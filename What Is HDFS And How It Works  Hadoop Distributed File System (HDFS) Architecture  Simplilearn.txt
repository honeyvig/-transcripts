Welcome to our video on hdfs the HUD up
distributed file system if you have ever
worked with big data or in the field of
data engineering you have probably heard
of Hardo it's revolutionized the way we
handle and analyze large data sets but
what is hdfs and why should you learn it
hdfs is a distributed file system
designed to handle the high throughput
computing needs of large scale data
processing systems it was designed to
run on clusters of community Hardware
making it costeffective way to process
large amount of data one of the main
benefits of hdfs is its scalability it
can handle petabytes of data across
thousands of nodes making it well suited
for Big Data applications another key
feature of hdfs is its fall tolerance it
can handle node failures without losing
data ensuring uninterrupted data
processing but why should you learn hdfs
well if you're planning a career in data
engineering it's an essential skill hdfs
serves as a foundational infrastructure
for the Hardo ecosystem enabling other
tools like map reduce and Spark to
process and analyze large volume of data
efficiently so whether you are an
aspiring data engineer or just curious
about hero learning hdfs is a great
place to start in this video we will
explore the basics of hdfs from its
architecture and data modeling to best
practices for managing data let's dive
in on that note consider the data

platform and Azo Services check out the
course Link in the description for more
details having previously covered the
introduction of hdfs let's now explore a
deeper understanding of the definition
of Hadoop distributed file system Hadoop
distributed file system or hdfs is a
specifically designed distributed file
system that stores and process large
volume of data across multiple commodity
Hardware nodes it is a fundamental
element within the Apache HUD of
ecosystems providing fall tolerance High
through port and scalability for a
better understanding let's illustrate
hdfs using a simple Layman example so
now imagine you have a large library
with thousands of books managing such a
massive collection efficiently can be
challenging so to to address this you
organize the books into a distributed
system with multiple bookshelves in this
example the library represents the hdfs
the books in the library represents the
data such as files and the bookshelves
in the library represents the data notes
in hdfs and the librarian who keeps
track of the books and their location
represents the name note in the hdfs you
achieve better scalability for tolerance
and efficient data access by organizing
your library into a distributed system
system similarly hdfs enables large
scale data storage fall tolerance and
parallel processing for Big Data
applications now let's look at the
architecture of hdfs from the given
diagram below name node is the master
node in hdfs it stores the metadata
about the file system including
directory tree file permissions and file
to block mapping it keep tracks of data
blocks location and coordinate data
access operations and then we have data
notes data notes are the slave nodes in
hdfs they store the data blocks and
perform read and WR operation as the
name node directs data nodes are
responsible for data block creation
deletion and replication we have blocks
so hdfs stores data in large blocks
typically 64 or 128 megabytes here each
file is divided into blocks and
replicated across multiple data notes
for fall tolerance rack so a rack is a
collection of data notes grouped based
on a physical proximity it helps in
improving data locality and reduces
Network traffic in hdfs a client refers
to the entity or applications that
interact with the Hardo distributed file
system it is typically a software
program or component that utilizes the
hdfs API to perform various operations
on file stored in hdfs the client
communicates with the hdfs Clusters to
request file operations like Reading
Writing or modifying now let's have a
look at the file operations like file
read and file right so here the client
can read the contents of the files
stored in hdfs it communicates with the
name node to obtain the locations of the
data blocks connects the appropriate
data nodes to retrieve the data the
client can read the entire file or
specific portion of it next file write
here the client can write data to files
in hdfs it communicates with the name
node to obtain Block locations and then
interact with data notes to write the
data blocks the client can perform
single wres or uptain data to existing
files
and next we have data modeling in hdfs
hdfs follows a right On's read manyu
model which means that once a file is
written it is not modified however new
data can be appended to the existing
file so here are some key aspects of
data modeling in hdfs first we have file
organization files in hdfs are organized
in a hierarchal directory structure
similar to the traditional file system
directories can be created to manage and
collect the data effectively next we
have replication hdfs replicates data
blocks across multiple data nodes for
fall tolerance the default replication
factor is typically three meaning each
block is stored on three data nodes the
replication Factor can be configured
based on the desired level of fall
tolerance and the third we have data
locality hdfs optimize data access by
keeping the computation close to the
data it tries to schedule task on the
same data nodes where the data blocks
are stored to the minim it tries to
schedule task on the same data notes
where the data blocks are stored to
minimize network transfer and next we
are moving on to the best practices for
managing data in hdfs effectively manage
data in hdfs consider the following best
practices first we have data
organization design a logical directory
structure that suits your data access
patterns and faciliates easy data
management organize data into meaningful
directories and subdirectories
next we have file size hdfs performs
best with large files rather than a
large number of small files aim to have
multiple file size of the block size to
maximize data locality next we have
replication Factor configure the
replications factor based on the
importance of the data and the available
storage capacity higher replication
factors provide better fall tolerance
but require more storage next monitoring
and maintenance regularly mon monitor
your hdfs cluster's health and promptly
address any issues monitor dis space
utilization block distributions and
cluster performance next backup and
Disaster Recovery Implement a backup and
Disaster Recovery strategy to ensure
data durability regularly backup
critical data and replicate it across
different cluster or locations following
this guidelines lets you maximum hdfs
architecture and feature to effectively
store and process large scale data with
