hello everyone welcome to another
interesting video by simply learn what
is one of the most important and core
concept of Statistics that enable us to
do productive modeling and yet it is
often confused by aspiring data
scientists yes I'm talking about the
central limit theorem so in this video
we'll discuss all there is to know about
the central limit theorem so let's start
by discussing the agenda for today we'll
start with the definition of central
limit theorem and then discuss the mean
and standard deviation associated with
it then we'll take a real life example
to understand where you can use a
central limit theorem then we'll discuss
some assumptions that are taken for
Effective use of central limit theorem
we'll end this tutorial with the
demonstration of the central limit
theorem in Python so without further Ado
let's get started so what is the central
limit theorem the central limit theorem
is a statistical concept that states
that the sample means of the
distribution of a random variable will
approach to a normal distribution if the
sample sizes are large respective of the
shape of the orizal population
distribution we take the population and
we take the sample out of them let's
discuss the mean and standard deviation
associated with it suppose we are
sampling from a population with mean mu
and a standard deviation Sigma let X be
the random variable representing the
sample mean of and independently drawn
observations then we can say that the
mean of the sampling distribution of the
sample means is equal to the population
mean which is mux bar is equal to Mu
where mux bar represents the mean of the
sample means and mu represents the
population mean on other hand the
standard devation of the sampling
distribution will be equal to the
population of the total standard
deviation upon the under root of sample
size let's understand this more clearly
by taking a real world example suppose
you are a digital manager of
pharmaceutical company in charge of 200
stores across the region and you are in
charge of weekly medicine restocking at
all of them you need to know how many
cases to order weekly for each store in
order to reduce the amount of inventory
that expires the plot on the right hand
side shows the distribution of all the
200 stores and average medicine cases
required by each of the stores in the
week the red line represents the average
cases required which is equal to 34 you
know there has to be a better way to
arrive at a reasonable answer that
doesn't entail visiting every single
store in your area and obtaining their
weekly sales figure you can apply the
central limit theorem to this problem
not that you understand the concept you
already knew the central limit theorem
when applied to reable problems AIDS in
balancing the time and cost of gathering
the data required to draw the
conclusions about the data so here you
can see the plot on the right hand side
shows the distribution of sample means
of the sufficiently large Subs taken
from the population sample size greater
than 30 will be sufficient enough to get
the normal Bill curve the mean of all
the samples taken from that population
mean is equal to 34 which is equal to
the sample mean of the subsets if you
plot the sample means you'll get a
normal distribution which is in form of
bell curve if these samples meet the
central limit theorem criteria you can
assume the distribution of the sample
means can be approximated to normal
distribution now you know how to apply
the central limit theorem in a real
world problem let's discuss some
assumptions behind the central limit
theorem the first one is the
randomization condition the data must be
sampled at randomly and it must add to
the randomization rule the second one is
the independence assumption the sample
value must be independent of each other
this means that the occurrence of one
event has no influence on the next event
usually if we know that people or items
were selected randomly we can assume
that the independence assumption is met
the third and the last one is the 10%
condition this states that when the
sample is drawn without replacement the
sample size which is n should be no more
than the 10% of the population let's now
discuss some application of the central
limit theorem political and election
polling is a great example to show how
you can use a central limit theorem
these po results are used to estimate
the number of people who support a
specific candidate to calculate the
confidence interval which is shown on
the news channel the central limit
theorem is very useful in this
one more place where you can use a
central limit theorem is a sensus data
you use the central limit theorem to
calculate the various population details
such as family income electricity
consumption individual salaries and so
on now that we have a good understanding
of the central limit theorem is theories
and application let's see a demo in
Python to understand it more clearly
here we are on an online compiler we'll
discuss the CLT by taking a dice example
a dice is a different number on each
side ranging from 1 to six each number
has a one in six chances of appearing on
on a role given all the equal likelihood
the dispersion of the numbers that come
up from the dice role is uniform let's
start by importing some necessary
libraries we'll import the numpy first
from numpy do random we'll import the
randid function which will be used to
generate the random
integers we'll also import the mean
function from the numai we'll set the
seed to one now we'll write the function
to generate the random
numbers the randid function will
generate a number ranging from 1 to six
we have taken the 100 because the
example will generate the print the
samples of 100 dice rows along with the
mean print the rows and then we'll print
the mean of the rules so when you run
this code you'll get the following
result you see we have the 100 numbers
and the mean of this number is 3.38 now
we'll repeat the process thousand times
this will give you the result of
thousand sample means according to the
CLT the result of the sample means will
be goian so we'll change this code from
here means will be equal Al to mean of
this random integers we'll take from 1A
7A 100 and this will be four in range of
1,000 now we'll plot this distribution
we'll use the P plot function we'll get
the graph as a histogram graph so we'll
plot it in that means and P plot do
show let's recheck our code we have the
random inter function we have the feed
okay we have imported them mean we have
not imported the Matt plot Library so
from Matt plot Library we'll import By
plot now I think everything is in place
and let's try to run this
code yep you can see this graph is a
histogram graph in the shape of a bell
curve and if you see closely the mean is
closely to
3.4 so that's it for this tutorial thank
you for being here and watch out for
more videos from us if you have any
doubts and queries regarding the central
limit theorem you can post your that in
