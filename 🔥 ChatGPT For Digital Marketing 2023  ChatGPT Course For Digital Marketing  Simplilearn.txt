the perfect route hi I'm rimajraf from
Dubai and I have completed the pgp in
digital marketing from Simply learn with
Purdue University when I shifted to
Dubai from Sri Lanka in 2015 I joined a

overwhelming even though the journey
wasn't easy the pgp in digital marketing
with Purdue University acted as not only
a catalyst but a game changer for my
career change with no profiling
certification in marketing domain it was

tremendously High waiting to be rated as
one of the best Education portal online
worldwide is surely promising not only
were the ratings I but also the courses
were economically charged the modules
were very informative and amazing I
still refer to those while in the final
stage of my course I told my Superior
about the certification program I was
doing and then it offered me a digital
marketing role in the marketing
department as a digital marketing
executive this that's how smooth it was
after working for a few years in the
same company as a digital marketing
executive I switched to a new role as a
digital marketing manager with this my
skill upgraded my salary increase and my
self-confident Boost alongside numerous
other positive outcomes I had a chance
to take a challenge and change my career
domain all together

many uses of chat jpt in digital
marketing its main USB is smart human
sounding content writing we can command
it to write content related to marketing
first on our agenda is an ad copy there
are various ways to go about it but we
must understand that no matter how much
content sounds like humans it is still a
piece of content written by an AI so you
have to give detailed and precise
queries to get the best results let's
start by giving it a basic command like
write an ad copy
foreign
content let's give this query more
content like write an ad copy for simply

precise ad copy we can also ask to make
it longer or shorter let's give it a

[Music]
thank you
and hola it gave us a long version of
that same content now let's try to
convert it into email newsletters V
digital marketers often send emails to
promote our products and services so
let's give it a query as can you convert
it to email newsletters
as you can see it has generated an email
with a subject line and body that is
enticing and engaging to read we can
also utilize chat GPT to correct grammar
or change the tone of the content for
example let's enter new query what is
Facebook

Facebook now let's ask it to rephrase it
more engagingly and in a digital
marketing context we can give queries
like can you make it more engaging and
relatable with digital marketing
together
[Music]

replaced it and it is more interesting
to read it as well GPT can also help
with keyword research so let's try it we
will give a query as suggest more Search

for some keywords for the blog suggest
keywords to write a blog on digital
marketing

reduce these topics based on search
volume to get maximum results let's ask

a topic content writing and ask it to

for simplion and I wrote a customer
collaboration email that looks
professional plus easy to read and
understand during our childhood we have
heard the fictional stories of robots
taking over various household courses
making the lives of humans easy peasy
but if you are not aware then these
fictional stories are turning into
reality though not in the form of
physical robots but yes in the form of
computer programs and apps with the help
of artificial intelligence and machine
learning Technologies
confused let me introduce to you to chat
GPT a pre-trained model that interacts
with user in a conversational way Chad
GPT is founded by open Ai and the model
is based on supervised and reinforcement
learning so are you excited to know more
about chargpt chat GPT has various
application in various domains in this
video we are going to see the
application of chat gbd in the SEO
domain also we are going to discuss how
chargpt will play an important role in
search engine optimization so here is a
question for you chat GPT is based on
which of the following GPT models
created by open AI Option 1 chat jpt1
option 2 chat gbd2 option 3 chat GPT 3
and option for none of the above let us
know your answer in the comment section
below and if your answer is correct you
will get a are from Simply learned we
know that SEO rankings depends on
various factors like on-page
optimization of page optimization and
more while using chat gbt we will
understand how chat GPT helps in various
SEO ranking parameters and reduces the
manual work so without any further delay
let's begin so to begin with let's open
chat GPT
we need to go to new chat which is
already open here
let's start by we will try to
demonstrate an SEO optimized blog in
this demonstration so let's get some
keyword ideas for the blog
so before that let's choose what kind of
blog we want to create I really love
traveling so let's try to create a
travel blog so for the travel blog we'll
find some good keywords
foreign
so here you can see we are getting some
suggestions for the travel destinations
we can choose any of them
okay so here we got around seven of the
results
so let's try to get something for Japan
so just make good keywords to create a
blog
going with Japan
okay so what I understand from this is
we are just getting few of the random
keywords
Okay so
it is
it is showing that these keywords cover
a range of topics related to Japanese
culture history food and more
uh out of these I guess
we can start
with the places here are a few places
like Mount Fiji
Tokyo and everything so let's try to
create a blog
on top 10 places to visit in Japan
okay so we are getting places to visit
in Japan
foreign
keywords related to top 10 places in
Japan
okay so we are getting some of the
keyword recommendations
and it is also suggesting that by using
these keywords our content will be more
discoverable and it will be easy for
rank for for search for for search
rankings
write me a Blog on
top 10
places
to visit
in Japan
so the idea is we will try to write a
blog and after which we will try to uh
optimize the block with respect to the
keyword top 10 places to visit in Japan
and we will also see whether all the SEO
practices can be easily applicable or
not using chat GPT
so here you can see we are getting a
Blog with the introduction with top 10
places and probably what I expect is to
get a good conclusion out of it
also like uh uh chat jpg provides you
the facility so that you can reduce the
length of your content the textual
content the blog or article or anything
you want to say every number of words
like if this Blog has two thousand or
five thousand words you can just ask
chat GPT to reduce it to 2000 or 1000
words also
so here you can see that
before when we search there were only
one liners about these destinations
these places in Japan and now we are
getting a detail about all the 10 places
definitely we have targeted this blog
for the uh keyword top 10 places to
visit in Japan however we can ask for
some more key words
to increase its reach
suggest
you
more development
keywords for my blog
okay so we are getting some more
keywords here
for any blog it is really important to
have a very good title so we will try to
implement a catchy title for this blog
foreign
title helps the user to click on your
content and it increases the possibility
to get more and more traffic
so here you can see the title is
completely keyword optimize our keyword
is top 10 places to visit in Japan and
here I can see most of the suggestions
most of the suggested titles have the
keyword top 10 places or top 10
destinations which are somewhat similar
to what we are expecting
add the best
suitable
title in my blog
okay so we are getting something
different here The Ultimate Guide to
Japan's hidden gems 10 places you can't
miss
okay so here we got title for a Blog but
here we can see there is a slight
limitation that it is suggesting the
title but it is not adding it to our
blog and representing it again to us
optimize my blog
for the keyword
top 10
visit in Japan top 10 places to visit in
Japan
but then
optimized
title
foreign
okay so we have to do it manually it's
not able to
add the title on the Block
optimize
blog
for the
keyword
top 10 places to visit and which
okay so it is showing the relevant
suggestions
so maybe there is a slight
ambiguity in the query that's why it's
not representing us the correct results
we are going to optimize our blog using
all these factors
visit in Japan
again these are the suggestions
let's try to implement these one by one
foreign
s H1 H2
in the above block
so yes we are getting the updated
versions having H1 and H2
and yes you can see easily that the
title of the blog is in H1 and the rest
are maybe in H2
H1 and S2 tags are some of the practices
in the on-page optimization which helps
the search engine boards to understand
that this is something important really
important for the page and they pick up
these hints for getting your page rank
so yes it is implemented
okay so our blog is completed with H1
and H2 implementations
let's try to get some interlinks for
this blog interlinks have their own
importance as interlinking your blog
with other pages of your website or your
blogging Pages this will help you to
gain the traffic from other pages to
your blog and putting the traffic from
your blog to other pages of your website
also it helps the search engine boards
to understand the crawl structure
understand the website structure also
so
suggest me few
intern links
for the above block
so yes definitely these are the relevant
and expected links we are getting so if
you have any of these blog pages in your
website or if you have created any of
these blogs earlier do Interlink it
which of the above
can I use in my blog so definitely there
are number of suggestions but if you
want to choose one how can you pick the
one let's see if we get the relevant
thing for this
okay
so it is not only suggesting that we can
use all of the above
but it is also showing the significance
of interlinking
okay moving ahead
so till now we have optimized our blog
for a keyword top 10 places we have
tried to get some of the keywords
relevant to the top 10 places to visit
in Japan we have added headings and we
have tried to get some of the good
Interlink suggestions to add interlinks
in our blogs which are some of the good
practices of the on page optimizations
so next moving ahead in another on-page
optimization technique is let's try to
get a cover image for this blog
so by by getting a cover image
suggestions we will try to implement the
image optimization technique for our
blog page
okay so it is showing uh some of the
suggestions related to
the diversity of the country the normic
view of Tokyo Skyline the beautiful
image of kuyoto's traditional Temple
Mount Fuji hiroshima's peace Memorial
Park
so we will try to pick one and see if we
are getting any image idea
let's take for Mount Fuji
suggest me the image idea for Mount
so let's see we have seen in generic for
all now let's see for this uh image
suggestion specific to Mount Fuji
okay definitely it is showing a number
of suggestions for the specific Mount
Fuji image
so if you are looking to create another
block for Mount Fuji then these ideas
are easy to take up
optimize
mount
Fuji image for my blog
here are some tips to optimize the image
for Mount Fuji for my blog which are
they're showing that the image should be
high resolution
then a clear subject
definitely if you have a large image a
large file size it really gets difficult
to load and the page load speed will
increase so if you have a large file
size the image should be compressed
without reducing its quality image
quality
we should have descriptive file names
and all tags
okay
so let's try to get a very good file
name and all tag also we'll try to
implement a good caption because adding
a caption is very good in the when
considered as a user
so
get me
good
title and
Alt
tag
for
mount
Z image
so there is importance for ltac as
search engines are the Bots they won't
able to identify the image directly so
all tags helps the search engines to
understand what the image is about
so yes it is showing not one but number
of suggestions for all the Mount Fuji
recommendations which we got earlier
so we will try to choose one and get a
caption for it
right a good
caption
for
for the image
scenic
Fuji
5
Lakes Region
so yes definitely we're getting
suggestions here
I guess this caption is quite long so
let's try to reduce it to
40 words
reduce the above
caption
to
not even 40 let's do it in 20 20 words
okay this one is better
now let's try to get the image if there
is any
shows
the mound
LG image for my blog
choose image
it should not I repeat
choose the perfect
illustration for
amount fusing
image for my
block
so you can see that it is not choosing
any image but it is again providing us a
suggestion what we can choose
again this is the limitation that it is
not showing us any of the image we will
try to put it in another way to get an
image
if it really works we can get it
okay so it is not possible to download
or get an image representation using
chat GPT
we can only get the recommendations to
choose the image and yes it is showing
some suggestions of an unsplash pixels
or Shadow stock to download the image so
we can really navigate to these websites
and download some of the required image
for our blog
so we we have uh completed here with the
image optimizations let's try to get
some video ideas because again having a
video is a catchy factor for the users
visiting your website
for your blog page
suggest me
suggest
video ideas
for
above
block
okay so we are getting few of the video
ideas
which of the
other idea is best match for my blog the
try to extract anyone from the above
okay so it is completely dependent on
the user's Choice what a user wants so
here I'll choose
for
again we will continue with Mount Fuji
only
provide video optimization optimization
ideas
video optimizations
for
amount
using video
for above block
okay so it is showing us some of the
suggestions what we uh which we can
Implement for a video as we do not have
any video here we can just take these
recommendations and optimize whatever
the video of our choice
so let's take the thumbnail suggestions
in our next query if it can suggest us a
Mount Fuji uh thumbnail uh image
suggestion and the video tag suggestion
right
suggest me
good
thumbnail idea
for
Mount Fuji
video
thumbnails have the Major Impact for any
videos it is the only thing
um
I repeat
thumbnails
thumbnails are one of the important
factors which encourages the user to
click on your video and watch the
complete video
so definitely having a good thumbnail
will help your content to rank
so yes we have got around 10 of the
thumbnail ideas from which we can
Implement any one uh as of the video we
are having for our blog
so we are done with the thumbnail ideas
after which we will get
we will try to get video tags so for
getting video tags let's get for all of
them
find me
video
tags
all of above
thumbnail
suggestions
times are important to help the user to
get your videos in the search list
like if someone uh uh types Mount Fuji
in the search box and if the Mount Fuji
keyword is or a tag is added to your
video tag it is more likely to get
searched and appear in the search
results and possibly use a May click on
it
so here we have tried to get uh try to
implement some of the good uh some of
the important
on-page optimization practices now let's
try to get backlinks which is one of the
most famous of page optimization
technique
above block
okay so it is showing
some of the link suggestions
so basically backlinks are the links
which points from other another website
or another web page to your web page or
your website
so getting backlink is one of the trust
factors in the search engine size that
your content is really unique and more
of more users wants to read it and share
it with another users
so the search engines by by these search
engines understand that your content is
really good and it is worth of ranking
so definitely getting a good backlink
from a very good authority websites is
fruitful for your content
so let's try to get
pages
on web are
suitable
to get
backlinks for my blog
so here we are getting some of the ideas
or suggestions that which Pages we can
choose to get a backlink
so here is industry specific websites so
if you are writing a travel blog there
should be a travel trip advice a Trip
Advisor like websites
which are showing more of the trip
oriented or bookings related oriented
for travel or destinations
there are few of the directories
okay government websites which are the
tourism websites in our case right now
blogging websites and social media
platforms
which can be relevant to the current
scenario which we are using here
so
let's check
how can we get
backlinks
from the
above
recommendations
for my blog
okay guest posting
broken link building
okay these are some of the backlink
building methods which we are getting
so that we can find one
and get one of the black
a repeat
so these are some of the battling
building strategies which we are getting
in the recommendation so we can
Implement any of these to get a batting
for our blog
let's choose the specific platform
and try to get the recommendations
or the ideas to get backlinks for the
from the blogging site
so we can Implement these ideas and it
it may be possible to get backlinks
now that we have got some of the ideas
to get backlinks for our blog let's try
to add the catchy metadata for our blog
metadata like having meta title or meta
description these are the only data
which is uh which is appearing in the
search results as you you have seen that
in the search result the link the Blue
Link we get is the meta title of our
blog page or a website page or any page
on the web whereas a few lines written
below that link is the meta description
that we are providing to let the user
know that what the blog is exactly about
so it is considered to be a good
practice to have the targeted keyword in
the title as well as in the description
so let's try to get one
is with the
create SEO
optimize
meta title and meta
description for my blog
so we are getting some suggestions here
top 10 places to visit in Japan discover
the best place to visit in Japan top 10
destinations definitely we have here top
10 destinations
see also we are getting some of the
notes that
it is good to have meta title less than
60 characters
so if if it is more than 60 character
you may get the dot dot part and the
title will not be clearly visible in the
search result page
so let's try to again optimize The Meta
title and meta description for top 10
places to visit in Japan
description
for the key word
top 10
places to
visit in Japan
okay
so we can use any of the one the one we
have got the recommendation the
previously and this one also both are
completely relevant to our content
so one of the technical SEO factor which
we are going to see here is getting the
URL recommendation uh URLs are the
important factor uh it helps the search
engine boards to understand about the
page as the URL is the first thing
search engines may be visiting to come
to your page
so uh it is a good practice to have the
keyword in your url rather than having
some of the abrupt characters like x a r
at the rate this kind of stuffs in the
link
so let's create
the URL suggestions
suggest me
SEO optimized
URL for the
above block
see so here
we are getting top 10 places to visit in
Japan which is definitely our blog and
as a keyword we are using it to optimize
our content and it is placed in the URL
so this URL is completely correct
also these kind of suggestions are very
good for the newbies in the search
engine domain as they will definitely
understand why and what we are doing to
optimize our pages
so next
moving ahead with some of the
non-technical aspects which may impact
which may definitely impact to bring the
traffic so let's try to get some of the
sharing suggestions like
bits
platforms
should I
repeat
which sharing options
should I add
in my
blog
so out of the mentioned sharing buttons
we can add any of them
adding at least three to four shading
buttons is considered to be really good
out of which there are many common like
Facebook is really common then Reddit is
really very common WhatsApp Shares are
really common Twitter Shares are really
common
so you can choose any of these to add it
in your blogs
thus commenting on
my blog
impact
on
traffic source so here we are taking the
suggestion that will this help or not
again this is again linked to the
backlinks that if we are adding the
comment section someone else may ask for
a backing for their web and this is
again going in symbiotic way like if
they are asking for a battling for from
your blog you can even ask from them

though we have not posted any blog link
or any uh internal links that leads to
that blog which we are expecting this is
not the clear idea we are providing but
yes uh to find four not four pages
uh it is not possible for the chat GPT
to get one but we can use some of the
tools suggested like a screaming frog or
Google search console where we get the
detailed report of the broken links or
404 pages that is the dead pages of our
website
so let's wrap up from the view of the
technical SEO perspective

pick any of them if needed you can check
these keywords in any keyword research
tool to check their search volumes if
you require so let's choose this keyword
let's write a blog using chat GPT in 500
words on this keyword
the next we have is content optimization

include keywords naturally within your
content recommends heading structure and
advice on appropriate keyword density so
to the above created blog let's find the
optimization
so here we saw the number of
optimizations suggested by chat GPT for
our content the next we have is meta
tags and descriptions chat GPT can help
you to generate compelling meta tags and
descriptions that accurately represent
your content these elements are
important for search engines to
understand the topic of your content and
display relevant information in search
results so let's ask chat GPD to write a
creative meta descriptions meta title

important to remember that SEO is a
complex field and requires a holistic
approach it's advisable to combine chat
GPT suggestions with best practices
industry knowledge and ongoing SEO
strategies to achieve optimal results
did you know Microsoft is planning to
invest 10 million dollars in charge gbt
developer even silicon Valley's biggest
conglomerates have begun to take note of
charge gbt versatility and practicality
people have started earning money
through chargeability and some even
predict the Revolutionary AI chatbot
will replace Google search but what
makes charge ability so resourceful what
charged is and how it works and at the
end we will discuss some of the ways
that chair GPT is being used the real
world the potential implications of this
technology from chat boards to language
translation chat Jeopardy has many
applications that make it easier for
businesses and individuals to interact
with technology so hello everyone I am
mank and welcome to Simply learn make
sure you are subscribed to our Channel
and hit that Bell icon to stay updated
with the latest technological Trends
before we move on to the demo part let's
discuss what chargibility is and proceed
further for the same so what is
chargibility charitability position
language model created by open AI it is
a form of generative pre-trained
transformed gbt model which was trained
on a data set of conversational problems
such as dialogue Snippets and chat logs
the model is capable of generating
human-like responses to text input so
now let's understand how charge gbt
actually works this model is pre-trained
on a large tax data set and then fine
tune on a smaller data set specific to
the everyday task when the model
receives input from a user it uses the
pattern it learned during fine tuning to
generate a response let's take another
example the model can generate an
appropriate response even if the input
is not a complete question or a sentence
after seeing what is charge gbt and how
it works now moving forward let's see
how we can use shared GPT in our
day-to-day life
so this is a Google search here we will
write
chat dot open AI
.com
it will take time
so this is the chat window UI
objectivity
so our first use case is chargpt can
explain complex subjects okay so first
we will ask like what
is neuroscience
it will take time
it's taking time to load because many of
the users are using
it started Neuroscience is the
scientific study of the nervous system
which includes the brain it will write
all about the Neuroscience you can ask
anything any subject okay like Heart to
Heart easy any or even you can stop
generating two if you want to
okay so this is how you can ask like any
question to the any complex question to
charge everything okay uh we'll ask one
more like what is
quantum
it's loading
I don't know why it's taking time
because of net issue or I don't know why
take time and it will come
that uses properties of quantum
mechanics to perform operations on data
like this okay
two states zero or one and all the
quantum Computing knowledge
okay
so this is how you can ask anything like
any com about any complex subject to the
charge ability okay
so with chat our Second Use case is we
can write code using chat GPT okay we
can write so here I will give give me
a machine
learning
program
called
application
okay press enter
okay so here it's starting here is a
simple Python program that uses scient
Library there's this and this
yes this is how you can take write a
code any code if you ask anything like
sorting like add two numbers
palindrome
anything you can anything you can ask
from chargibility it will give you a
code proper code
edit right please note that this is a
simple example of sort prediction is a
complex task and this example is not
enough to make a good prediction it
would need a lot more data feature
engineering and model tuning to make
accurate prediction Okay so
let me give another Java
implementations implementation
of the what bubble
algorithm okay
let me ask this
yeah it started like here is a Java
implementation of the bubble sort
algorithm
so
if you proper runnable algorithm
okay like bubble sort
of give you full
you can ask any type of code any type of
like apis anything
it will explain to this implementation
using nested Loop to compare adjacent
elements in the area and swipe them if
they are in the wrong order
okay
and then after the outer loop completes
the array will be sorted in ascending
order our third use case is we can debug
the code okay so for that
but I will I will take this one code
okay
I will take this code
and
here I will write debug the code and I
will paste it here
and what I will do I will instead of
temp
here
I will like I will write
okay I will add 2p okay so now
what it will do charge but it will do it
will develop see the error in the code
is in the this line
it should be temp
you can see here
it is stamp
so from charity you can debug the error
okay you can have the conversation with
to pull the charge body like if you have
any question you can directly write
what's wrong in the other question and
like this okay like you have an extra p
in this variable name which is causing a
compile error this is because temp is
the variable that you declared earlier
to store the value of current element
where a stamp is not a variable that has
been declared so here you can see
the stamp is declared here so that is
that the error is causing the code not
to run once you fix the issue okay like
sort the arrange or sending audio
okay so using chat GPT you can easily
debug your errors the code and it is
very helpful on your project building
okay so fourth use case is you can
create custom marketing plans or
strategy okay I'm repeating again you
can create custom marketing plans or
strategy like how so here I will write
how
could
remote
videos
on
social
media
president
it will give you proper plan how you can
promote your YouTube videos on your
social media
okay
I will chat with this okay I will ask
some question
views engagement everyone knows there
are few strategies you can use C per
second and more like more to come like
share your video on personal social
media accounts us include your Facebook
Twitter Instagram and other accounts
thing like that join the 11 communities
and groups through use social media ads
platform like Facebook and stuff
Instagram and Twitter
collaborate with influencer it is also
true create a hashtag for your videos
use YouTube video built-in sharing
features
it will give you all the marketing plans
it can create marketing plans any type
of plans
see remember your video should be
engaging information and should we
provide value to our audience
it is something like that now I will ask
one question to charge gbt
Okay so
I will ask what
if
make
only
travel videos
okay
what if I will make only okay
travel videos
so how
should
I
capture the
audience
you can ask any type of question okay
relevant to
this question or this answer you got
okay now let's see
it will give you everything if you are
making travel videos there are like few
strategies you can use to capture and
engage your audience
like this okay so the unique interesting
aspect of the destination you visit
people are often thrown to new and
unique experience like say share your
personal experience and insights it will
give you a proper plan
like how you can increase your audience
engage your audience okay
collaborate other travel bloggers that's
true engage with Audience by responding
to comments messages through
remember your video should be visually
appealing and provide valuable
information to your audience it is also
important to be authentic and true to
yourself like that okay so this is how
you can like using chat gbd how you can
create your marketing plans or your
something like that okay so our fifth
use case is we can generate articles and
blogs using shared GPT okay so let me
ask right and
article
Sheen
learning
because also machine learning kind of
machine learning on machine learning
in
500 Words
presented
it will write only exactly like 500
Words it will give you only 500 words
like machine learning is rapidly growing
field that is transforming the way we
live and work it is the branch of
artificial intelligence blah blah
basic idea of machine learning is that
computers can learn from data without
being explicitly programmed
like supervised learning is the most
common type of the machine learning just
through
yeah you can see here there are three
main types of machine learning
supervised learning and supervise and
reinforcement
it's true it will tell about it will
write a proper
article in only 500 word not more than
that
okay
machine learning has a potential
application Healthcare machine learning
patient data and more accurate diagnosis
like that
500 Words
it will give you exactly 500 Words
and conversion machine learning is
rapidly growing period that has the
portion into professionalize many
Industries it allows computers to learn
from the data without being explicitly
programmed
this is 500 Words of article
okay you can ask write article videos
descriptions blogs any kind of content
writing you can see
okay so let's do one more question and
the same so I will like give me
money
on
to write
okay skip for my YouTube
Channel
YouTube channel YouTube shorts
videos
video on Cyber
security
okay
so here is a short skip for funny
YouTube video on cyber security
like narrator
where every clip could be your last
exactly
so something like that
always use strong password like password
One Two Three or fourteen
tip number two never click on suspicious
link unless it's linked to be to repeat
the
see this is how you can create your
funny
how you can generate your content from
chargpt using chargity okay
thanks for watching stay safe out there
please note that that's description just
for fun exactly we know and not mean to
be taken seriously it's important to
take cyber security seriously and follow
best practices to protect your person
and professional data
okay
so this is how you can write
your make your content so easily like by
writing the title of the content so our
six use cases you can even Summarize the
book or article using child GPT like how
I will write here summarize
the book
delivers travel
s
no word written by Jonathan Swift and
this the book does the story of limel
deliver a ship surgeon who becomes
Shipwrecked it will light only and will
summarize all about delivered travel
yeah in part one this happened
Oliver washes up on the island of
lilliputia exactly
do this happen and part three this
happens
this is how you can summarize any book
any related to like educational no world
fiction any type of book or article and
blogs
okay whatever you want to summarize
it will run the book is being commented
on the Society of ship to one time
okay so this is how you can Summarize
the book fully master
our seventh use cases we can ask
interview question two using chargeable
so here I can ask how to answer
interviewer
what
is
your
weakness
okay
so when answering the question it is the
best to be honest but also to frame your
answer in a positive way yeah exactly
for example you could say something like
I have a tendency to be perfectionate
and sometimes struggle with delegating
task however I have been working on this
learning like this you can ask any
question any interview type question
okay related to HR or technical anything
you can ask
so let's see
how
to
answer
the
web viewer
like where do you see yourself
in next
five years
okay
so when answering this question it's
good idea to be aligned your answer with
the company's course and values yeah
exactly for example you could say
something like in five years I can see
myself going within the company and
taking more responsibility exactly
so this is how
you can ask any type of HR questions
you are facing off okay
so our next
use cases
our AIDS use cases we can develop apps
using charitivity
okay yes we can develop apps using
chargability like
I want
to write
an Android
app that
shows
me
please talk
prices
as a
list
um
let's see Yahoo
API
okay
how
can
I do
like this so it will write a proper
Android app code
for you
with a new Android project or it will
give you a proper idea how you can make
a you know app
all these steps
from starting to the last
choose a view holder to hold the
reference of the views for each item in
the list
okay
use asynchronous stars to fetch all the
step from starting to the end
this is a brief overview of the steps
and you will need to take a build
Android app
okay
okay so this is how you can like ask
anything to create
a
okay using any language plot Java python
any language
okay I repeat our ninth use case is we
can create our exercise plan diet plan
using chargpt okay
so I will write my width is 25 okay

is you want to lose
avocado toast with post deck
so it's important to know that this is
just a plan Simple Plan
so our tense use cases last use case you
can ask any General Knowledge Questions
to chat
like
okay
who invented
first
provided by German goldsmen yeah
you can cross question to charge with
the answer
okay
this is the all the use case of Charity
like

custom marketing plan or strategy diet
plan exercise plan you can generate your
content like article blogs you can
Summarize the book and the Articles or
interview question preparation or
developing apps coding
you can easily do with the charge GPD
okay I hope you understand how to use
chat GPT and what is charging okay and
the use cases of charge GPT and where
you can use in day-to-day life
artificial intelligence large language
models and AI chatbots have come a long
way and today we have many AI language
models which are helping us throughout
various domains few examples are
Microsoft's Bank Google's bar open AIS
chart GPT Megatron T5 and many more
today we will be discussing about the
caliber of chat GPD and AI which can
leverage you and help you to build a
perfect business so few of the reasons
that you need to consider are the
decision making capabilities of chat GPT
and AI customer services that you can
offer through chat GPT and AI chat GPT
potential to create a content and its
potential to leverage data analysis and
charge up it is an AI capabilities to
provide sales and marketing for you and
run automation for you we will discuss
each one of these in detail so the first
one is decision making capabilities of
chat GPT in terms of raw processing
speed chat GPT can analyze and generate
text at a rapid base capable of
processing and generating responses much
faster than a human can type or think it
can quickly access and retrieve
information from its pre-trained
knowledge providing intermediate answers
to suggestions therefore chat GPT excels
in processing and generating text at
higher speeds however it cannot be
directly compared to humans in terms of
decision making abilities however it is
proof that it is 90 accurate in addition
making whereas humans tend to be
accurate at a rate of 80 to 85 percent
charge GPT is anyways stronger in terms
of decision making at this case followed
by that moving ahead to the next reason
that is the customer service that charge
gbd and AI can help you with if you
compare a human the customer support
representative reads the customer care
compared to human the customer support
representative has to read the
customer's query analyze the problem and
formulate a response this process may
take a few minutes or more depending on
the complexity of the issue and
representatives typing speed right but
when you compare it with chart GPD the
AI powered chatbot like chat gbt quickly
scans and comprehends the customers
query it generates a response within
milliseconds providing intermediate
assistance as well so chat gbt's
proficient at providing customer
services at a much faster rate and it
can also eliminate you the cost of
hiring training and maintaining an
entire Army of customer services moving
ahead we have content creation if you
are a startup company or a company which
needs concentration for your product
then obviously you might end up hiring
Freelancers or a team of content
creators right but compared to humans
shared GPT is proficient at generating
content and can produce coherent and
contextually relevant text so you can
even save money by using the most
powerful and fully operational AI model
to create more versatile and highly
qualified content for you to avoid
hiring Freelancers and employees
the next reason is using AI models for
business data analysis AI can assist you
in data analysis by leveraging its
computational power and advanced
algorithms to possess and extract
valuable insights from large and complex
data sets AI algorithms can automate
data cleaning pattern recognition and
anomaly detection tasks enabling faster
and more accurate results AI models can
also perform Predictive Analytics
