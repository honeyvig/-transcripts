1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,809
so love Aaron welcome to another

2
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:13,059
tutorial my name is Hannah Bakshi and

3
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,680
this time we're gonna be going over a

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,980
new sprite kick game so today I'm going

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,140
to be showing you exactly how I have

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,380
created a game in sprite kit called

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,869
apple picking and so essentially the

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:27,520
point of apple picking is quite

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,340
self-explanatory really it's just lots

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,689
of apples or falling from the sky and

11
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:32,980
you have to move around a little player

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,170
in the shape of a star to actually go

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,059
and collect those apples and then your

14
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,160
score can increase however there's a

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,110
little bit of a twist there are also bad

16
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,059
apples and good apples and normal apples

17
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,219
normal apples just add one tear score

18
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,010
good apples add three tear score and bad

19
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,469
apples move three from your score and

20
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,960
just before I continue if you don't know

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,149
what sprite kit is which is the

22
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,149
essentially game SDK or graphics SDK

23
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:00,100
that we're going to be using to develop

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,559
this project that's essentially a 2d

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,670
sort of SDK or API actually that would

26
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,070
be a framework in Swift and objective-c

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,740
that Apple enables us to use in order to

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,200
do stuff like simple animation if you

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,420
want sort of 3d or more complex

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,369
animation I'd either go with scene kit

31
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,590
or middle however sprite kit does the

32
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,619
job for apple picking so I'm going to be

33
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,810
going over to the Mac part now in which

34
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,060
I'll explain it but just before I go I'm

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,009
just going to explain the basic concept

36
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,979
of the game on the whiteboard then we'll

37
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,840
go over to the back part in which I'll

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,200
explain the actual apps code okay so to

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,479
begin this is essentially a little

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,470
graphic demonstration of how apple

41
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,909
picking works let's say your device is

42
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,040
in landscape which is exactly how this

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,890
game is intended to be played all right

44
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,899
and so basically in the center we're

45
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,500
going to draw a little line okay then

46
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,939
from there we're going to calculate

47
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,630
another line a few pixels off over here

48
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,860
and also over here and over here and

49
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,239
over here so in total we want five lines

50
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,840
all of equal height of course okay

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,459
coming down from the top to the bottom

52
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,410
towards the bottom ending over right

53
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,000
about here though okay

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
and so these will take up all while

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,390
sailing cut to the entire screen I mean

56
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,980
there'll be a home button over here and

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,010
stuff however then there's a little

58
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,140
player in the shape of a star but since

59
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,570
I can't literally draw a star we're just

60
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,950
gonna go with a triangle for now okay

61
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,340
and so basically the user will let's say

62
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,130
the user clicks over here we will not

63
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,709
move the triangle over to this point all

64
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,060
we're gonna do is we're going to move

65
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,120
the triangles X value to the touches X

66
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,440
value and if the user starts moving

67
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,680
their finger around the screen like this

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,070
whatever the current position of their

69
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,200
finger is which is each one of these

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,320
little pixels ignore the Y value and

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,150
we're gonna take the x value and set

72
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,200
that to the end then we're going to

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,650
sentence this objects x value to the x

74
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,630
value of your finger and so essentially

75
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,060
this triangle follow your route and also

76
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,700
there will be a timer spawning an apple

77
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,520
at random intervals and they're

78
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,140
completely random whether it's a normal

79
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,820
Apple a good Apple or a bad apple

80
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,400
and so basically apples will spawn on

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,440
either one of these columns randomly

82
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,650
completely and then once one sort of

83
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,390
spawns let's just say an apple spawn

84
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,110
over here

85
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,880
it's just going to slowly start moving

86
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,790
are actually quite semi fast start

87
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,459
moving down and then your objective is

88
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,769
to let this triangle touch the Apple

89
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,930
meaning you've picked it or star

90
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,480
actually and so I mean if you touch a

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,489
bad apple of course your score will be

92
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,000
Mun back made less by three if you go

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,459
get a good Apple plus three and the

94
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,769
normal Apple plus one your score also

95
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,269
displayed over here so let's just say

96
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,160
our score is thirty three right now it's

97
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,390
going to display thirty three in the

98
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,600
middle and that's exactly how this app

99
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,959
will work okay so that was a simple

100
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,959
explanation of how this app actually

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,989
works hope you enjoyed that however now

102
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,250
first of all I'm going to be showing you

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,400
a demo of the app itself then I'll be

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,229
showing you the actual Mac part

105
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:29,110
including the code and yeah just a code

106
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,810
and an explanation of it so let's get to

107
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,190
the demo and Mac

108
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,220
part now so welcome back to the Mac part

109
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,080
and now I'm going to be showing you

110
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,760
actually technically it's the demo part

111
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,020
so now I'm gonna be showing you these

112
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,910
demo of the app that we'll switch over

113
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,020
to the actual apps code itself let's

114
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,820
begin and as you can see I'm gonna click

115
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,500
on the apple-picking app that's on my

116
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,910
screen right now it doesn't exactly have

117
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,820
a logo but again none of my apps do that

118
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,860
I share on this YouTube channel when I'm

119
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,300
gonna click on it and as you can see we

120
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,360
have a little star a score indicator and

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,550
lots of apples falling around right as

122
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,320
an Apple touches the star which is the

123
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,720
player it disappears so now I'm going to

124
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,440
move my finger around and as you can see

125
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,230
I am actually moving the star and I am

126
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,410
touching all the apples that I get

127
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,320
inside my site and as you can see we

128
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,840
also have these sort of bars over here

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,390
that indicate these little columns of

130
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,340
where the apples are actually spawning

131
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,480
and so yeah that's going to be the demo

132
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,620
part as you can see these are good

133
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,140
apples these are golden and so that's

134
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,930
going to be it for the demo part I hope

135
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,490
you enjoyed now we're going to be moving

136
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,169
over to the Mac part which I will

137
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,690
explain the code and that's going to be

138
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,790
it for the demo part let's move over to

139
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,280
the Mac part now so welcome back to the

140
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,200
Mac cards and now I'm gonna be showing

141
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,919
you the code in depth so let's begin but

142
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,140
not first with the code first I'm going

143
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,820
to be showing using assets that we are

144
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,340
using in this app so to begin as you can

145
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,230
see oh by the way all these graphics

146
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,970
will be available for download in the

147
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,490
description below ok so as you can see

148
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,070
this is the Apple graphic it's just a

149
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,640
normal red apple next we have the bad

150
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,710
apple graphic would you say black gray

151
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,440
is actually Apple actually have a good

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,660
Apple which is just the normal Apple

153
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,540
with instead of red golden that's nice

154
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,450
and then we also have the player which

155
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,310
is just a star and also a v-line

156
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,140
which appears like nothing but if you

157
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,840
really zoom in I don't know how I would

158
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,130
do that I don't think it allows you to

159
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,470
know but it's a really thin like one

160
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,650
pixel line that we do use to create the

161
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,320
columns ok can

162
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,480
enuine now now let's get into the code

163
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,670
and since spray-can apps don't really

164
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,250
have a UI that you can develop with a

165
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,560
storyboard file I'm just going to be

166
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,760
explaining the cone to you

167
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,100
luckily there's no user interface to do

168
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,530
you just dive right into okay

169
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,240
let's start with the code this is weird

170
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,120
because I haven't done actually encode

171
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,740
just code like a playground in quite

172
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,050
some time because usually the apps have

173
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,570
a UI again I'm gonna stress this every

174
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,370
single object that you put onto the

175
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,230
screen with sprite kit you have to do

176
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,110
programmatically continuing though okay

177
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,210
so as you can see this our main class

178
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,790
called class game scene which inherits

179
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,910
from SK scene which I do believe is yes

180
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,160
if this is a class I remember what it's

181
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,430
it's not a protocol to class okay and so

182
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,950
basically this is sort of where all of

183
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,480
your game logic and all of your graphics

184
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,000
are just going to be shoved into and so

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,950
this is essentially the hub of where all

186
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,750
your other classes will connect if you

187
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,190
have a Apple class or if you have a

188
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,590
another class basically where all of the

189
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,910
other classes that you've combined will

190
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,610
merge into and then will be able to

191
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,860
create one functioning app okay

192
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,260
continuing now as you can see well I

193
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,450
just have some variable declarations

194
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,040
over here and now I'm going to explain

195
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,740
these to you so first of all player is

196
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,280
the actual SK sprite node for the star

197
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,170
okay and so that's the star next we have

198
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,830
the node which is an SK sprite node for

199
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,650
the actual you know middle column if I

200
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,320
run this on a simulator really quick on

201
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,160
iPhone 6s plus I assume window I'm just

202
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,550
gonna move this right to make this

203
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,490
landscape alright and as you can see

204
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,120
this is note this middle column here and

205
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,050
so I explain more about that later okay

206
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,970
as you can see we also have known right

207
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,510
and so this is one node to the right of

208
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,070
node itself which is this over here then

209
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,910
we have node right B which is

210
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,420
one right to note rights over here again

211
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,340
we're just actually creating the middle

212
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,330
middle little column sorry middle column

213
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,820
and then the the the other ones are just

214
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,540
being calculated from there then we have

215
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,200
node left which is the left column and

216
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,480
then node left B which is the column to

217
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,570
the left of the left column okay so now

218
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,220
I'm going to close this down because

219
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,870
we're done with those explanations cells

220
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,850
are all the nodes that are actually

221
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,920
those little columns on screen the

222
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,660
reason I have this here was mainly for a

223
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,790
debugging purpose to see exactly where

224
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,300
the what you call them apples are going

225
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,220
to be spawning but you know I just kept

226
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,950
them in because why not and so

227
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,140
continuing now then we actually have an

228
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,000
apples array which is all the apples

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,580
currently on screen which is an array of

230
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,040
class Apple which if you were wondering

231
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,340
is literally just as case right note in

232
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,170
the hit inherits from the S case right

233
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,780
now the class over here however it has

234
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,790
one variable called type which is equal

235
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,740
to zero the reason I have to create an

236
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,430
entire new class for this is because

237
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,740
congrats Apple there are no you cannot

238
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,360
add variables to extensions just great

239
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,460
and so continuing though you can't add

240
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,270
variables to extensions and so I just

241
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,580
added a variable to a class called Apple

242
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,560
which inherits from s case right now

243
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,770
great that's a perfect work around I

244
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,620
guess but continuing then we have a

245
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,600
variable called spawn timer which is

246
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,910
just a normal NS timer and sort of this

247
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,770
will take care of when we need to spawn

248
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,610
another Apple then we have our player

249
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,290
score which is just the score of the

250
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,370
player which can be

251
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,830
I think the bounds of a normal int in

252
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,710
Swift are negative eight million

253
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,030
something and positive eight million

254
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,660
something so anywhere in between that

255
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,250
but I doubt you're even gonna get to a

256
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,330
to a thousand but continuing then we

257
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,610
also have a score label which is just a

258
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,310
constant and this is equal to a new SK

259
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,940
label node with a fun named Ariel okay

260
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,680
so then what we're doing is it'll be

261
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,450
getting up setting the scenes background

262
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,529
color to white color from UI color and

263
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,089
then what I'm doing is I'm taking the

264
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:23,890
score label and I'm setting its font

265
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,460
size to 100 over here okay so this will

266
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,529
make the score label really big then I'm

267
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:31,480
setting its font color to black and I'm

268
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,640
setting its position to self not freeing

269
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,029
up mid X and mid Y so essentially that

270
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,310
really centers it to the middle and then

271
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,620
I'm just uh calling self dot add child

272
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,589
on score label and so essentially this

273
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,680
will allow us to actually put score

274
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,399
label on the scene next what I'm doing

275
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,230
is I'm saying spawn timer is equal to a

276
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,200
new NS timer which is a schedule timer

277
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,140
for interval with time interval actually

278
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,630
I think they change that with 0.7 so

279
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,250
it's going to actually spawn an apple

280
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,020
and reserve my flat is seven seconds

281
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,160
it's going to call self the function

282
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,690
it's going to call is spawn Apple which

283
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,370
I'll explain to you in just a moment and

284
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,620
then it's going to give no parameters to

285
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,690
the function meaning no user info and

286
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,640
I'm going to make sure it repeats now

287
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,500
it's telling me that there it's

288
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,910
deprecated the quote sort of Objective C

289
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,050
selector so let's just try out the hash

290
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,110
tag or I mean crash selector method okay

291
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,000
so let's see if this works on Apple does

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,300
this work okay I'm assuming we could

293
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,279
just call this then okay great let's

294
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,339
just run that really quick and see what

295
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:57,760
we have great so it's working so that

296
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,890
was that okay so I've just updated code

297
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,550
a bit and so I have fixed the warning

298
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,560
that it was giving anyway continuing

299
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,970
then we'll just setting our apples a

300
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,180
rake to a blank array instead of a nil

301
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,850
array so we can actually append objects

302
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,940
to it and then this is where we do sort

303
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,950
of like the meat or juice of the actual

304
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,839
calculation so basically first of all

305
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,390
I'm taking the node and saying it's

306
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,010
sending it to a new S case

307
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,990
right now with imagening v-line meaning

308
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,120
vertical line which you just saw on the

309
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,330
assets then I'm setting its size to five

310
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,180
width meaning five pixels width and 300

311
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,760
pixels height and I'm setting its

312
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,160
position to self dot framed up mid X so

313
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,420
it gets centered in the x-axis and then

314
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,070
what I'm doing is I am 17 Y parameter to

315
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,740
self dot frame dot max Y meaning the

316
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,960
extreme top

317
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,380
- no dot friend height / - and so

318
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,390
essentially this will bring the entire

319
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,830
frame on I mean the entire node down and

320
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,530
so the beginning of the node just

321
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,560
touches the top of the scene then I'm

322
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,820
just adding node as a child to the scene

323
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,920
then I am setting node right - pretty

324
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,360
much the same as case right now it's

325
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,340
something the same size and this time

326
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm sitting I'm sitting it's the same

327
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,750
white parameter instead what I'm just

328
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,430
doing is I'm saying self dot framed up

329
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,610
mid X plus 200 and so that's where we're

330
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,820
saying mid X plus 200 and then for node

331
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,410
left I'm saying - 200 and then basically

332
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,220
for node right B plus 400 and then they

333
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,250
left B minus 400 for the X parameter

334
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,220
that's that and then of course we add

335
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,580
those as child's to the actual scene

336
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,470
then I declare player as a new ask a

337
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,300
sprite node with the image named player

338
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,790
that I created then I'm setting player

339
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,720
size to 50/50 and default I guess and

340
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,760
then we're setting its position to self

341
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,730
offering the mid X so the middle x axis

342
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,750
and then 1:25 meaning 125 in the

343
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,530
y-direction I guess that works

344
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,800
that's that continuing then we're

345
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,930
actually adding that as a child to the

346
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,390
scene next as you can see I have this

347
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,190
little function over here called random

348
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,960
number from now this is not mine it's

349
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,970
actually from this just over here made

350
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,330
by Indra ghek I I'm sorry if I'm not

351
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,320
pronouncing that correctly but this

352
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,440
person this person actually his github

353
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,450
page has a read of numbers

354
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,079
swift yes and it's really helpful and so

355
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,899
I'm using the random numbers random

356
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:47,860
number sorry

357
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,370
not random number from function from the

358
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,200
just in order to be able to generate

359
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,430
random numbers continuing though next

360
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,680
what I'm doing is I have a spawn Apple

361
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,910
function which we've already talked

362
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,639
about this is what the timer

363
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,620
continuously calls now in the spawn

364
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,089
Apple function essentially what I'm

365
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:08,589
doing is first form declaring something

366
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:10,810
called random position which is equal to

367
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,779
a new CG point then I'm going to say let

368
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,570
pipe which is a which of those little

369
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,480
columns I guess and I'm gonna say random

370
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,459
number from one to five there are five

371
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,010
columns 1 2 3 4 5 it'll choose any

372
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:28,180
random number between them and so what's

373
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,070
gonna happen is if pipe is equal to 1

374
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,470
then we want to choose the pipe in the

375
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,269
exact center because that's the default

376
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,120
node and so I'm going to set the random

377
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,430
position to note that position if it's

378
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,620
to the node rights position if it's 3

379
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,139
then no less position if it's for the

380
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,449
node right B's position and if it's 5

381
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:50,620
then no left B's position okay so now

382
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,720
we've decided where exactly our Apple

383
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,230
will spawn then we're going to set to

384
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,420
the type of Y Apple to a random number

385
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,850
from 1 to 6 now I know there are only 3

386
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,410
types of apples but I need to make it

387
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,120
really rare for it good or bad Apple to

388
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,459
come I want mainly normal apples to come

389
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,669
and so if it's one if is if the random

390
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:12,400
number generated is 1 then we'll do

391
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,059
something however if it's 2 3 4 5 or

392
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,819
even 6 then we're going to execute

393
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,650
something so there's a 1 on a 6 chance

394
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,689
that something will happen but there's a

395
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,209
5 out of 6 chance that this will happen

396
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,679
and I'm gonna tell you what these are in

397
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,110
just a second but the 5 out of 6 chance

398
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,780
1 is essentially we're going to create

399
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,280
something called an apple node which is

400
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,280
a new Apple image named apple ok so

401
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,840
basically we're using the Apple class

402
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
that I mentioned over here on the bottom

403
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,910
over here well and so since this

404
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,230
inherits from s case bright node

405
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,320
inherits those initializers as well and

406
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,820
so I can just use the image name

407
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,280
initializer from s case bright node and

408
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,070
we're using the normal Apple graphic

409
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,130
the assets been what I'm doing is I'm

410
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,720
selling the Apple loads position to in

411
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
random position that we have already

412
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,650
chosen in the beginning of the function

413
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,510
then I'm setting its size to a new CG

414
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,060
size make 50/50 I am then setting the

415
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,920
type to zero because it's a normal Apple

416
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,500
I'm then adding the apple node as a

417
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
child to the scene and I'm then I am a

418
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,030
pending it to the apples array now let's

419
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,190
say that the random number generated was

420
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,530
one okay then we're going to generate

421
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,450
another random number in the type apple

422
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,910
two variable and so essentially this

423
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,760
will be a random number from 1 to 3 if

424
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,990
it ends on 1 if it lands on 1 not 2 or 3

425
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,780
just 1 then I'm going to do the exact

426
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,790
same thing as we did for the normal

427
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,320
Apple except this time the type will be

428
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,600
1 and the image range will be good Apple

429
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,690
however if it's 2 or 3 then we're going

430
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,040
to do the exact same thing except for

431
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,950
the type will be negative 1 meaning bad

432
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,200
and then the image will be bad apple

433
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,010
that's that then we have two functions

434
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,140
over here that do the exact same thing

435
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,730
and so essentially the touches begin and

436
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,550
touches moved functions essentially we

437
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,620
just say let touch is equal to touches

438
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,330
dot first because that's a set for some

439
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,700
reason I mean probably because if you

440
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,740
want too many fingers to touch at once

441
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,420
you would see the x and y coordinates of

442
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,210
each finger but still i i would prefer

443
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,830
one touch and then a separate function

444
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,500
whatever but continuing i went on a

445
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,470
different topic there so basically we

446
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,210
declared touch as equal to have to stop

447
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,160
first so basically the first finger that

448
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,590
you have on the screen will be put into

449
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,780
this variable then we're setting player

450
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,170
positions x value to the touches

451
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,710
location and node self dot x so we're

452
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,890
only setting the x value not the y value

453
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,630
then the exact same thing for touches

454
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,370
moved because that literally just gives

455
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,710
you coordinates of the person's finger

456
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,840
moving just i guess a bit more life and

457
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,220
then continuing in the update function

458
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,900
which in case you didn't know what this

459
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,120
is this function is called whenever a

460
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,120
frame is rendered for example if your

461
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,170
frame rate is 60 frames per second

462
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,110
FPS then this is being cold this update

463
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,030
function is being called 60 times every

464
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,670
second because 60 frames are rendered

465
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,220
each second and so in this function

466
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,190
since it's running rapidly we want

467
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,890
apples to disappear again extremely

468
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,590
rapidly right as they touch the star and

469
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,630
so basically what I'm doing here is I'm

470
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,580
doing all these sort of Apple logic if

471
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,370
you will and so here I'm updating the

472
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,770
user score label I'm checking where the

473
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,180
star is and where are all the other

474
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,180
apples have they gone off-screen should

475
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,920
I remove them from the array should I

476
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,110
say yes it's collided with the star and

477
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,000
now we should remove it stuff like that

478
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,430
and so basically in the beginning here

479
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm just saying bar knew apples is equal

480
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,060
to a new array of apples and I'm

481
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,710
actually initializing it as well and

482
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,380
then I'm saying for I in Apple's not new

483
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,960
apples just normal apples but I'm saying

484
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,530
I dot position dot y I is the specific

485
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,430
Apple that we're on minus equals to plus

486
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,910
and then we're checking if the type is a

487
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,640
bad apple then plus two so make it go

488
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,760
for down meaning that the Apple will bad

489
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,190
apples will fall down faster but if it's

490
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,780
not a bad apple it'll go zero meaning

491
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,780
normal speed then we're going to create

492
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,490
a variable called should continue which

493
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,710
will be equal to true which is just

494
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,420
essentially a little check to make sure

495
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,150
that it's right the rights a polite

496
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,970
Apple stay at the correct times then

497
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,560
what I'm doing is I'm checking if the

498
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,140
apples position specifically the

499
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,020
y-coordinate is less than or equal to

500
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,550
the min Y of this frame the minimum

501
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,410
y-coordinate meaning if it's gone off

502
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,090
screen than should continue should be

503
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,290
false and also if the if basically this

504
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,560
apples frame intersects the player's

505
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,060
frame meaning they've collided or

506
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,010
they've touched then we should set

507
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,500
should continue to false however we

508
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,950
should also set eyes type to negative

509
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,660
one and we should also mine I mean sorry

510
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,550
we shouldn't set eyes type we should

511
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,640
check if eyes type is negative one and

512
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,520
if it is then we - equals three from the

513
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,520
player score and then what we do is we

514
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,250
check if the eyes type is zero instead

515
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,880
if it wasn't negative one then we'd plus

516
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,830
equals one to the player score because

517
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,230
that's a normal Apple however if it's

518
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,540
one this means it's a very good Apple

519
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,540
and so we plus equals three to the

520
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,230
player score that's that finally we

521
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,240
check if we should continue if we should

522
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,420
continue to keep this Apple in the array

523
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,760
then we say new apples on a pen this

524
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,550
this eye or else we just say I don't

525
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,020
remove from parent we don't want to keep

526
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,630
this as a node and we definitely don't

527
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,580
want it in the array cluttering it up

528
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,280
and filling up memory and then basically

529
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,260
we set apples to new apples and so

530
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,760
apples has gone from memory completely

531
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,010
and only the new apples are remaining so

532
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,710
we don't keep hundreds upon hundreds of

533
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,230
apples on in memory that doesn't make

534
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,450
sense why would you do that and then

535
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,850
finally we're setting score label sex to

536
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,340
the players score and that's it I hope

537
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,340
