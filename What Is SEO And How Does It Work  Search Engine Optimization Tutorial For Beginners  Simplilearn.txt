we will discuss all the components in
detail in the upcoming videos in this
video let's focus on search engine
optimization
mid 1990 was the initial phase when
content providers started optimizing
their websites for search engines
by 1997
content providers started manipulating
search engines to get higher rankings so
algorithm for search engines were
regularly updated to lower the risk of
manipulation
in 2001 there were rumors that seo would
no longer be in action and would be
replaced by search engine marketing well
this never happened
in these 20 years various growing seo
techniques have improved the web
presence of websites and will continue
for many more years so let's understand
what is search engine optimization
the practice of getting traffic
organically through the search results
with the help of search engine is called
search engine optimization
although being one of the most important
components of digital marketing
seo has had some myths floating around
it
let's have a look at them
only famous brands can rank high in
search results
yes it is a myth
with good seo techniques anyone can rank
high in search results
competitors are way too strong so it
isn't easy to rank high in this case
this can be a bit difficult but it can
be easily overcome with good competitor
analysis skills and one can attain high
ranks and search results
a website with more pages can rank high
well it depends on the quality of
content page has
if the content is high quality even the
website with fewer pages can rank high
to rank there is a need to spend a lot
of money
one can rank high with some strategies
and techniques without spending a penny
now that we have debunked the myths
around seo let's understand why seo is
important
seo increases the popularity of your
brand product or services among the
audience thereby increasing the chances
of conversion of lead to customer
traffic obtained organically is more
consistent
once you are aware of seo strategies and
start gaining visibility in search
results
your site will gain constant traffic
that will keep increasing with time
with seo one can reach a large audience
to promote products and services
businesses can acquire audiences from
both the national and international
levels
seo builds trust among the audience for
instance if your web page is available
on google search results the audience
finds it worthy of trust because of its
online presence
your competitors are doing it then you
should also do it this could be a
serious note
if your competitors are doing this to
rank high and gain visibility you must
also do it or remain back in the race
there are three types of seo that you
can implement for the growth of your
business
before moving towards it it is necessary
to understand how search engines work
let's understand it with the help of an
analogy
susan started a business of handmade
toys she failed to gain enough customers
using traditional marketing methods like
newspaper advertisements and banners
so she thought of putting the business
online thereby creating a website
the website was completely optimized for
search engines and was soon visible on
the search result pages
the website started acquiring the
traffic which ultimately became her
customers
the sales were boosted to an unexpected
level and the revenue has increased
exponentially
a good decision brought huge success to
susan's business
susan was thrilled with joy
when a thought struck across her mind
how are search engines able to find her
website
so
search engines can be google bing
etc which work on three basic steps
that are
crawling
indexing
and ranking
first we will understand crawling
search engines are hungry for content
and so they send the web spiders also
known as crawlers or robots or search
engine bots to discover new content or
any updated content
content can be an image web page video
or anything else present on the web
this process is known as crawling
soon after the discovery of content
web spiders start storing the url of the
content into the search index and this
process is known as indexing
once the content is indexed it appears
in the search results for the relevant
searches
when a user enters a search query the
most relevant search results are taken
from the index and displayed from most
relevant to least relevant on the search
result pages
this process is known as ranking
now as you're familiar with the working
of search engines let's dive deep into
types of seo
that is
on page seo
off page seo
and technical seo
we will start with on page seo
optimizing a web page to gain visibility
and rank high in search results
and get relevant traffic is known as
on-page seo
some on-page seo techniques include
optimizing content
adding attractive titles and meta
descriptions
adding internal and external links on
the web page
adding ssl certifications for the
website
optimizing images for search results etc
next is off page seo
actions taken outside the web page or a
website to rank high in search results
is known as off-page seo
some off-page seo techniques include
building backlinks
blogging and submitting articles on
other websites
promoting content on social media etc
and the last one is technical seo
optimizing technical elements of a
website such that search engines can
easily crawl and index the web pages is
known as technical seo
some technical optimizations include
reducing the page loading speed of a web
page to a minimum
submitting site maps to search engines
have organized website structure as it
informs search engines about the
essential pages of the website
adding redirections for the deleted urls
or temporarily moving urls
identify duplicate content and replace
it with unique content
don't worry too much about it we will
cover these in detail in the upcoming
videos
now to optimize the website there are
lot of tools available
few from google and few third-party
tools as well
let's have a look at these tools
keyword research tools includes google
keyword planner

website tracking sales report etc

how the search engine sees the website

impressions of your page in search
results

helpful while working with seo

performance and suggest improvements for
a web page
now you must be thinking
can seo actually bring success to your
business
well we have a small case study for you
to let you know how to go from zero to

cookies and pastries by express bakers

they needed to promote their products on

urls in the article express bakers were

accepted by search engines if and only
if humans have reviewed the content
before uploading

as per the data provided by google

search engines are notified of the
update and updated content is again
indexed
adding more value to your page
if the page is not updated frequently
you may lose the search ranking within a
time span thereby losing traffic
backlinks will remain an important
ranking factor
as it shows other people's trust in your
content thereby adding a plus to your
rankings
