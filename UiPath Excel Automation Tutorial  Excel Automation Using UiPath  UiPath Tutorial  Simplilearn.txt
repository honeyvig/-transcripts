what is excel automation
excel automation is a task automation

excel file using various specialized
activities

new project that includes excel an excel
file must be specified within it so that
all of the subsequent actions can access
the data contained within that file

various ways such as excel application
scope activities and workbook activities

let's look how to install an excel
package
let's jump into the uipath studio to
install an excel package go to the
manage packages
you can see the packages that are
installed go to all packages and search
for uipath excel activities
by default an updated version will be
installed if the excel package is not
installed you can install it from here
so in my device this activity is already
installed
so this is the place from where you can
install any activities or any packages
let's see some of the commonly used
excel activities
these are some of the commonly used
excel activities redrain select range
save workbook autofill range copy paste
range insert and delete columns so
insert inserting a column at the
specified location in a sheet or a table
or a range
and to delete a column you can delete it
from a specified range or the table
there are filters
filter table so what filters does is you
can use the filter action to create a
filter in a range table or a sheet based
on the values in a single column we also
have vlookup vlookup which stands for
vertical lookup is an excel feature that
when enabled searches and retrieves data
from a specified column we will explore
all of these activities in the demo
section in detail
let's look at the demo in this demo we
have an excel sheet that has a record of
kovitt cases in five states of india in
2021
so we will create an excel automation to
represent the number of cases in charge
it's easy to understand looking at the
charts rather than looking at the huge
numbers
then we will upload the file on the
drive
so let's jump into the ui path studio
and get started
this is the excel file which i have
created
it has all the number of cases in this
five states in the year 2021 the month
of jan feb march and april
all this record i have taken it from a
website called prs india dot org
so i have two sheets sheet one and sheet
two
so let's jump into the uipath studio
to start off with the demo we need to
have the three packages installed
one is the ui path excel activities
package
the other one is uipath g suite dot
activities this activity this package is
used for
drive top load on the drive then
the other package is
balareva excel activities
this package is used for bar graph and
pie chart
so
after installing these three packages
we'll get started
so let's create a new sequence
name it as sequence
2
so first we'll drag and drop an excel
application scope
so excel application scope what it does
is it opens an excel workbook and sets
the scope for excel activities
when this activity is completed the
specified workbook and excel application
are closed when the workbook application
variable is specified in the output
workbook activities field the
spreadsheet is not closed
after this drag and drop a create table
activity
so by default we have sheet1 and
enter the range
so the range is in this excel sheet
ranges from a1 to f5
so enter the range
for this
we need to enter the file path so we'll
select the file
so we have selected the file
we have entered the
entire table name
say
number of cases
[Music]
so once this much is done
next we'll drag and drop a bar chart
drop it outside the excel application
scope
and select the file path
so select the file
so select the file
select this cell range
that is the same range
what we had entered earlier
a1
to f5
so once that is done if the chart title
say basis
and you can select the chart type
bar stack 3d clustered 3d stand whatever
is required
for now we will select bar cluster
we have many other options to explore
data label type
will keep it in
show value so that it shows the value
and
select
show value
if you want show percentage you can
select percentage
and select show legend
and size
you can vary the size accordingly how
much ever you want
so i'll keep the size as
350
to 350.
you can change the width
so the bar chart is done
and you can enter the sheet which sheet
are you using so it's sheet1
so we will drag and drop pie chart
select the file
similarly enter the options here
enter the cell range
the same range
a1 is to
f5
show percent will show value
show legend
select show value
and select the sheet which you want we
will select the sheet 2
so done
so we have completed till here
next we need to upload this on the
google drive so
we'll select this option upload file
select the file
so we have selected define
so select the destination folder
for that
go to your google drive account
so we will go there
so in my drive i have created a folder
called excel automation
so i'll copy this
url
till here not the entire
copy of this
and go to your ui patch studio and paste
it in the destination folder
you'll get double quotes
then create a variable
and
create a variable as 5
oops there is an error
we have forgotten to use a g suite
application
this can be only used inside a g suite
application
so drag and drop a g suite application
and inside g-suite application
will write this so
that it's gone
so we'll run the file now
we'll save it
and
run
you can see the file is getting
run
so the execution is ended
we will navigate
to the drive
so here you can see
the file is successfully uploaded will
open the file
it's working on the graph
here you go here you can see the bar
graph
for the sheet one
with the values
number of values and each state wise
and for sheet two
we created a pie chart so here we go
here you can see the purchase
