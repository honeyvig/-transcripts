>> Hello folks. Welcome to my video.
My name is Dmitri Lyland and I'm
a Program Manager in the
Visual Studio and .NET team.
Today I'm going to show
you the Hot Reload
user experience in
Visual Studio 2022.
This is a brand new experience
we've added to Visual Studio,
our goal is to save
you time restarting
your app in order to apply code
changes. It's quite simple.
We think, in fact, we know
many times when you're
running your application,
you're going to run into some
change you want to make.
The app is already running,
and traditionally having
to shut that app down,
apply the code change, and
spend all that time rebuilding
restarting can be very expensive
for many applications.
With highly reload experience,
we're making this better,
at least we hope so, for
.NET and C++ developers.
Today, I'm going
focus on .NET desktop
applications and show
you how our hardware is
going to make working with
those applications just a
little bit easier when it's
set to make that code change.
Let's go ahead and
jump into the demo.
Here we have our first
demo application.
These demo applications are
available in the public.
These are public samples
of a desktop application,
part of WPF sample applications.
You can go ahead and find
that over at GitHub.
In this application that
I'm already running,
it's a little particle displayer.
It's an app that's
very visual and it
makes it really easy for me
to show you how to reload,
so let's jump right into it.
How do we load work exactly?
Here we have an app that was
started without the debugger.
If you look at the top,
you can see there's
no debugger attached,
and that's okay because
this is a .NET 6 app.
If you combine Visual
Studio 2022 with .NET 6,
you can use Hot Reload
without the debugger.
For everybody else, working
with .NET Framework or
older versions of .NET,
you can use the debugger and Hot
Reload will also be available.
In this demo, my app is running and
the Hot Reload button
up here is available.
This Hot Reload, it does all
the magic when you press it.
After you have a code change,
the code change gets applied
to your running app.
Not only that, but we've made it
available on File Save as well.
If you prefer not to click
the button, you can opt in.
It's not on by default,
but you can opt into this new
setting called Hot Reload and Save.
Let's go ahead and use
the feature by changing
some code and pressing "Save"
and hopefully seeing the magic.
Here I'm going to go ahead and I'm
going to just do something fun.
I'm going to add another
variable here called P5,
I'm going to add P5
into our collection.
The moment I did that,
the app went crazy.
Now, traditionally,
just to make even that
simple code changes to
experiment with my application,
I would have to have shut
it down and we get started.
As you can see here, I made
a code change and right
away it's taking effect,
doing some crazy things.
The Hot Reload is really easy
to undo the mess you started.
Great. We're back to a
much nicer particle.
I'm going to continue editing
this app live without stopping.
I'm going to go in here
and make some changes.
First of all, we've
got this value here.
I'm going go ahead
and add one to it.
By adding one, as you can see,
my app is changing quite
drastically three,
four, able to change it again
without ever having to stop.
Now, you don't even see me pressing
the Hot Reload button
up here because I'm
using this unsave features.
All I'm doing is on
the keyboard hitting
the "Save" button and the app
is changing quite dramatically.
It's pretty cool demo. Now,
this is fun and all,
me just tweaking values in
this application to make
the particles change.
But let's do something
a lot more dramatic.
Let's switch to a
different application.
This one is called
the calculator demo.
I'm going go ahead and
set that start-up.
This time, just for a difference,
we're going to start
with the debugger.
Again, all of this is available with
other debuggers since these
are all targeting .NET 6,
but we're going to use the
debugger in this case,
and we're going to start
this second application.
This is a little calculator.
Because we're using the debugger,
we're not only just
getting the calculator,
we're getting this really
cool related feature
called XAML live preview
because this is a XAML app.
That's not my demo today,
but if you want to
learn more about it,
we have other videos, they'll
tell you all the details.
I'll close this down just
to get out of our way,
and let's take a look at our
application source code.
Here, it's a very simple demo,
I would not recommend making a
calculator using same logic,
but we have this really
large method here,
let's go find it, called
process operation.
For better or worse,
this calculator demo is
using a very large method
to process your edit.
If let's say press 5 plus
5 and you press equals to,
it does the math over here, as
you can see, gives me the output.
Now, all of that is handled through
this giant processing method.
What I'm going to go
and do, it just proves
the how powerful Hot Reload is,
I'm going go and I'm going
to remove this whole method.
I'm going to take out
all the logic out of it.
I'm going to press the button
just to show you I'm
really doing it.
I'm Hot Reloading, changes were
applied successfully down here.
We know the changes made
it to the running app,
and I'm going to start pressing
all buttons in this application.
You're not going do anything
to actually execute.
The logic numbers might
be going up here,
but none of these
buttons are functional
because we're hitting process
operations and exempting.
Now let's believe I
retyped all that code.
I did cheat in pressing "Control+Z"
to put the code back,
but that's okay.
I could have retyped that,
there really is no difference.
Now that all this code is back,
I'm going to once again press
the "Hot Reload" button,
go back to my calculator,
and now I'm going to clear it.
Now I'm going press 5 plus 10
and it's going to tell me 15.
At all levels possible
with Hot Reload.
Hot Reload can truly make
a lot of changes while
you're app is running.
It's not that there's
no limitations,
there should be limitations
and you will get
an error message if you try to make
an edit that we don't support.
But we're hopeful that with some of
these edits being supported
and more over time,
that adds a lot of value to you.
Hope you enjoyed those demos,
this is just a fraction of what
Hot Reload can do for you and
I really hope you try it
in Visual Studio 2022.
Definitely give it a
try, give us feedback.
We're hoping this feature
is really useful to you.
Again, I want to emphasize
it's really broadly available.
Even if you're working in a
really old .NET application,
a really new .NET application
or an unoptimized C++ app,
Hot Reload user experience is in
Visual Studio and hopefully
save you a lot of time.
Thanks for watching and let us know
what you think of our feature.
