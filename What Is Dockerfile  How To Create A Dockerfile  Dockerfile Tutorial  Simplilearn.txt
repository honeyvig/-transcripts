hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on Docker file tutorial at simply
learn do you know friends that in 2010
solman hikes founded do Cloud a platform
as a service company do Cloud faced
significant challenges with scalability
consistency and managing dependency
across diverse customer environments to
address these issues hikes and his team
developed a tool to isolate applications
in containers ensuring they ran same
regardless of the underlying
infrastructure this Innovation led to
the creation of what we know as Docker
today which was open- sourced in 2013
revolutionizing software development
within its efficiency and aase of use so
guys in this video we will learn the
concept behind creating a Docker file
and moreover we will understand why and
in which situations we need to create
Docker file now before we move on just a

guys let's start with what is a Docker
file guys docer file is a text document
that specifies a docka image so by using
a Docker file you can create a
personalized Docker image which
effectively sets up a custom environment
taed for use within Docker container now
before we delve more into Docker file
there are some primary concepts of
Docker let's try to revise it so guys if
I talk about Docker so docker's primary
goal is to provide consistent runtime
environments that can be replicated on
any machine running in Docker so what's
the use of it basically it eliminates
the common problem of it by WorkOne
machine okay so what's that mean by a
phrase it ensures that Docker containers
can deliver the same environment across
all machines now in order to follow this
tutorial there are two basic concepts
that one should know the first one is
containers so what what exactly are
containers so guys containers serve as a
runtime environment where typically one
main process runs per Docker container
think of each Docker container as
providing a single service within your
project for instance say you launch one
container for a mySQL database and
another for a WordPress server so
connecting them to set up a WordPress
project now here you will require
containers so in the Aros containers can
be used to run a wide range of
Technologies including databases web
servers web Frameworks test servers Big
Data scripts and shell scripts now this
was the first part of one concept that
everyone should be awared of now what is
a Docker image so guys Docker containers
are initiated by running a Docker image
a Docker image is essentially a
preconfigured environment for a
specified technology or service it is
not a runtime itself but rather a bundle
of files libraries and configuration
files that builds up the environment the
primary source for Docker images online
is a Docker store simply search for a
desired technology component and you can
pull the image using Docker pull command
that you are already and then you're
ready to launch your containers now
containers are created from images using
the docker run command an image present
in the container is a layered
representation of your environment
containing the necessary files and
configuration so say when you start a
container with dock Run Okay
so say you want to
start your
container so you'll be following the
docker run
command okay now Docker adds an extra
read write layer on the top of the read
only image layers now the most important
questions now comes up why and when you
need to create a dog file think about it
and based on the above instances I've
told you if you get an idea then try to
relate after pausing the video now when
existing images don't meet your project
requirements so you will need to create
your own Docker file suppose say your
Project's requirement has a node js14
version okay but your system is not
supporting that okay so in that scenario
you can use a containerized platform
like Docker and you can create your
image from the docker file of that
respective version so this is a common
scenario which makes it crucial to
understand that Docker file creation is
an essential aspect of working with
Docker the docker file includes a series
of instructions that Docker follows when
you run the docker build command so your
workflow will typically look like this
so first of all what you'll
do so first step would be create a
Docker file and specify the steps to
construct your image so this is step one
okay now basically in this step you
creating a Docker file and you
specifying what are the steps that
should construct your image after that
what you have to do you have to run the
docker build command to generate Docker
image from your Docker file so in this
step two what we are going to do we are
going to run
[Music]
[Music]
now in the third step you're going to
use this image okay and to start the
container with the docker run command so
now typically you begin your search for
Docker images on the docker store so
I'll show you where you're going to get
the docker
store okay guys so you can see I have a
Docker desktop okay and here I can
search for various images containers
what I have created so I was talking
about nodejs okay so see I can create a
nodejs image okay so you see here we we
are getting the node and we can pull
this uh image from here and we can
include in our project similarly mango
Express or let me show you one more like
suppose I want jdk okay seven okay let's
see does it have Java okay they have
Java okay and
says these are tags okay this is
jdk7 okay what if I write jdk 8 okay let
me see okay so this has a jdk8 instance
but I don't think so it's correct so
it's basically the real official one is
Java of this one and it says it has a
tag of six so either you can pull this
or you can run this okay so this is
basically a Docker store where you are
going to get all your instances for your
images which you want to apply in your
project so additionally like GitHub also
host numerous repositories containing
Docker files so also you can share your
Docker images within your team or
organization just by setting up your own
Docker registry so if you can't find the
precise Docker image required for a
project like I couldn't find right now
jdk 6 so you have to create your own
Docker images in that instances and this
is a common because many are generic and
might not fit your specific needs so
simply create a text file named Docker
file with no extension and Define your
image within it it's a standard practice
to create custom images for most of the
projects including sandboxes and
playgrounds now let us try to understand
some of the docker files
Basics so guys as I have told you
earlier that Docker file serves as a
blue blueprint for building Docker
images so here are some of the key
points that you should remember the
first one that is text file with
instructions so basically Docker file is
a text file primarily containing
instructions AK to command line actions
for creating image then there are
step-by-step instructions you know so
Docker file also provides a sequence of
instruction detailing the steps needed
to construct the image then there are
standard instructions so Docker files
offers a set of standard instructions
for Docker file including from copy run
EnV expose CMD and among many others
which define various aspects of the
image then the fourth one is automatic
image building Docker automatically
constructs a Docker image by paring and
executing instructions from the docker
file the fifth one is describing the
build steps from a developer or a user
standpoint Docker file describes the
build process for the envirment M
building the image from Docker file also
allows to start the containers then in
terms of Technology context you have to
understand Docker file instructions
alone isn't sufficient you need to
comprehend the technology context you
are building for for instance crafting
Docker file for PHP project necessitates
the PHP specific knowledge like
configuration methods extensions and
environment settings the next one is
leveraging the existing images utilize
the pre-build images because it's going
to save time especially when you're are
experimenting with the new technologies
you can start by deploying images
prepared by others without delving into
the integrate details immediately over
the time as you tackle more complex task
you can enhance your understanding by
studying and learning from other Docker
files so this is iterative process which
allows for gradual accumulation of
knowledge and expertise in Docker and
the specific Technologies so guys let's
let us create our first Docker
application now you can see I have
written certain code in the docker file
so no need to worry about that I'm going
to explain you line by line each one of
them but let me show you how you have to
proceed for creating your first image
okay now the first thing that step that
I want you to do is that create a
directory say I want to create a Docker
application so say I'll choose this
directory mkd and say it would be my
Docker app okay
so let us see and we can see that this
directory has been created so if you do
LS okay to check whether it exists or
not you could see that my Docker app
exists and it is created at this point
of time okay pretty good now what I want
to do is that you have to create a
Docker file so I'm using visual studio
code as my text editor you can also use
the same and you can also see that in
Docker file there is no extensions
involved okay now after this just type
my Alpine latest and run the application
and just complete this thing so guys
after that what you have to do you have
to build your Docker image in the
terminal so for that the following
command is there so I'm going to type
Docker
okay
Docker build okay
and it would be the T flag okay and let
us skip the name as my Hello World
okay and give a DOT and let us build
this image basically and you could see
now my Docker application is built up
okay and in this there is a text file
now guys let us try to run our Docker
application now what you have to do next
type this command Docker run and say my
hello world because this is the name of
the basically file which we have given
so
my now if we try to run this command we
could see a hello world printing out
here and this has completed our
execution now let's try to understand
these code one by one so we can see it
has written all over here from Alpine
latest so what does it means so
basically it uses the latest version of
Alpine Linux as the base image okay now
in the next command you can see it's
written run mkd SL app so basically what
it does is that it creates a directory
SL app inside the container the third
thing is run Echo hello world so
basically and there is a SL app /hello
text uh directory that has been
mentioned so it writes hello world into
a file name. hello.txt inside the slab
directory then you could see it has
written workd slash app so basically it
is setting the working directory to the
slash app and finally we are seeing that
it is written CMD and double comma cat
and then hello.txt basically it
specifies the command to run when the
container starts which outputs the
content of the hell next when you build
and run this Docker image it will
display hello world and in the terminal
because CMD instructions run cat
hello.txt command which reads and
outputs the content of
hello.txt so that's why you are seeing
hello world right over here so this was
a very basic program that we have done
right now and in this way we will do one
more to make our Concepts more clearer
so guys in the next example we are going
to create a Lo a file for a python flask
web application now we all know that
flask is a popular micro framework for
building web applications in Python and
this example is going to demonstrate how
you can build a Docker image for a flask
application and run it as a container
now you need to follow step by step now
first what we need to do is let us
create a working directory so all over
here uh let us go to our terminal and we
can say mkd and we are going to
create my flask okay so we can see that
this directory has been created now let
us dive into this
directory okay now step two is you need
to create an app.py file but how you
you're going to do this now for the same
purpose what we are going to do so let
me just open that folder first so we can
see my FL ask is this and I'm going to
select it so you can see under this
directory it's showing yes that I've
created my directory and let us create a
file named
app.py okay pretty simple next file
would be your requirements.txt
so in this basically file what I'm going
to tell that what version of flask I'm
going to be using so that's why I have
named it and third would be our Docker
file
pretty fine now it seems bit Justified
right now now let us fill the content of
our python flask file now if you are
aware of the flask application then it's
great and if not you can just ignore the
process but uh I'm creating certain of a
flask application so it would be very
synonymous if you have a bit of idea
regarding Python and it's a wonderful
framework for working in the back end
and I would suggest you to learn it now
let us see it now as you can see in our
apppi file uh it's written from flask
import flask basically this is importing
the flask library and here I'm defining
app variable with underscore name name
to read this application then I'm giving
a route and I'm defining a function for
the same that whenever I'm going to this
route it displays a hello world a simple
backend application that would also do
the same task like if you're creating a
nodejs application and the way we are
routing up or a spring boot application
where we are giving the route and just
trying to run the application so same
process all over here and it says run on
the port 5,000 okay and if the host is
0.0.0 so that's our address name
basically now you can this a very basic
code for flask it's uh not a rocket
science so you can understand it if you
have a little bit of a coding idea and
even also you can ignore this because if
you are given a task just to run this
container then you don't need to require
to learn about all this backend stuff
now we have populated our app.py file
now in our Docker file let us populate
this now you have to understand the the
structure folder structure so everything
is there inside the my flas directory so
please make sure that so app.py Docker
file and requirements.txt should be
there so now as you can see this code
guys so this is our Docker file and it
has set of instructions written all way
here to give command to our computer
that what it needs to do to set up a
configuration for our environment so you
can see we are using python runtime like
uh as python as our parent image so
python 3.9 slim is being used all over
here now next thing what we are doing
basically uh so you can see that the
first code that is written all over here
that is python 3.9 Slim So basically
what does it tell this line specifies
the base image for our Docker image so
we are using python 3.9 slim image which
is a lightweight version of the Python
runtime then we are setting up work dr/
app so basically what it does it is
setting the working directory inside the
container to slash app okay last time
also we did it the same then what we are
telling it to copy the requirements.txt
file so basically this line is copying
the requirements.txt file from The Host
machine to the working directory in the
docker image okay I'll repeat once again
so it is basically copying the contents
of the requirements.txt okay from the
host machine to the working directory in
the docker image now I'm running the Run
pip install no cache
d/r requirements.txt so basically what
it is telling it is pretty evident that
we are installing python packages is
specified in the requirements.txt file
so we are using the PIP and the no cach
a DI option ensures that pip does not
cache the packages okay keeping the
images smaller and finally we have the
copy so this line copies the rest of our
application code from the host machine
to the working directory in the docker
image and finally we are exposing the
port 5,000 so this line basically tells
that the container listens on the port
5000 and it does not actually publish
the port but informs the docker and the
user that the application expects to use
this port then we have EnV flas cap
equals to app.py so basically this line
is very very important and it is telling
or basically setting up an environment
variable flask app to app.py now flask
uses this environment variable to find
the application okay and finally we are
putting CMD flask run host
0.0.0 and Port 5000 so basically this
line specifies the default command to
run when the container starts a tell
flask to start the application making it
accessible on all the network interfaces
so that's why I have written
00 and on Port 5000 okay so this is what
our Docker file is looking like all over
here okay so you can go through this
file and uh you would understand that
this is how an application like when we
are doing a backend stuff so this is how
we write our Docker file now we have
completed our app.py file we have
completed our Docker file and
requirements.txt is still missing now
you can see that I have written flask
equal to 2.0.1 so that's our
requirements. text file so have
specified the version of flask which I
want to use now let us go to our
terminal okay now let us try to run the
command so let us first uh build the
image okay
okay so as you can see let us build our
application for the same purpose I'm
using Docker build /t my flash command
so let us run this and it is building
our Docker application and is copying
the requirements text and finally it is
on the ninth step now we have built our
application now the next would be
running our application so in order to
run this container I'm going to type
talker run then /d/ p on the port 5,000
and 5,000 my flask so you can see we
have used certain flasks like/
d/p and uh we are publishing it on the
port 5000 and this is our working
directory my flask so let us run this
and you can easily see that our
application is our container is finally
running and we are getting some
encrypted code all over here so just
leave it so in this way we are basically
setting our environment for our any
application like we are building a front
end or a backend application so we can
include a Docker file and which is going
to set up our environment for our given
application so that was all for today's
