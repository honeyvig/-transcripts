hello everyone and welcome to today's
tutorial on devops for beginners at
simply you know back in the day when
Netflix was just starting to hit it
stride they faced serious challenges
managing their growing infrastructure
keeping millions of people happy
streaming movies and shows without
interruption it was not an easy task
initially Netflix struggled with scaling
issues monolithic architecture problems
and and deployments bottlenecks their
infrastructure couldn't keep up with
their increasing user demand leading to
frequent downtimes the monolithic
architectures made it difficult to
update or scale parts of the system
without affecting the whole deploying
new features were slow and risky and
often causing service
disruptions and that's when they
discovered microservices which allowed
them to break the application into
smaller and more manageable pieces this
meant that they could tweak and Tinker
with different parts of the service
independently and greatly improving
flexibility and reliability
complimenting microservices with devops
practices like continuous integration
and deployment Netflix transformed their
operation ensuring seamless streamings
for users worldwide so next time when
you Bene watch remember this Epic
Journey they took to get there now

experience through the real world
projects and through the premium sandbox
lab so hurry up now and join the course
link the course link is mentioned in the
description box so guys let's start with
what is
devops guys devops is an Innovative
approach to software development and it
operations that emphasizes collaboration
Automation and continuous Improvement
the goal is to bridge the gap between
developers who write the code and
operations who deploy and manage it
leading to faster more efficient
production cycles and deployments so
this was a basic definition of devops
now I hope so you have got a brief idea
regarding this now let's move on and
understand why devops so guys
understanding its impact on traditional
software development and shift to
microservices devops has become an
essential methodology in modern software
development primarily addressing many of
the inefficiencies found in traditional
development and operation model these
traditional models often feature sloid
structure where development and
operation teams have distinct separate
roles and
responsibilities this oparation can lead
to various challenges like the slow
production Cycles with development and
operations working separately the
transition from code completion to
deployment can be slow and combersome
there is a lack of integration between
these teams and often result in longer
release Cycles next issue with the
traditional setup was the deployment
issues when developers and operations
work independently there is a higher
chance of encountering problems during
deployment such as configuration errors
environment discrepancies and unexpected
behavior in production and also they had
limited feedback loops like in the
traditional setups feedback from the
operation teams regarding application
performance user issues or system
failures might not rest developers
quickly and thus delaying the necessary
fix and Improvement now there was an
introduction of microservices where we
got enhanced scalability increased
development velocity and flexibility
when compared to traditional setups now
let's look at a case study of a
financial firm and how devolves help
them so guys consider a financial firm
who is struggling with the deployment
cycles and poor feedback mechanism in
their traditional development setup
leading to delayed product updates and
frequent outages so what's the solution
as we have discussed earlier
microservices in devop culture so as a
solution they implemented a devop
culture fostering closer collaboration
between developers and operation and
also establishing a continuous
integration and continuous deployment
pipeline by the adoption of
microservices they split their large
cumbersome Financial processing system
into smaller and manageable
microservices and what's the outcome
guys the continuous Improvement the cicd
pipelines allowed for regular updates
and minimal downtime each microservice
could be updated independently and
facilitating faster and safer
deployments there was enhanced feedback
loops so monitoring tools specific to
each microservice provided rapid
feedback directly to the respective
development teams which allowed for
quicker responses to the issues and more
informed decision making so this was the
overall benefits of of applying a devop
sculture in a financial form and they
had two success outcomes the first one
was they adopted a devop sculture which
help them a faster delivery and there
was adoption of
microservices which help their
applications succeed and also improved
the user experience now let's move on
and try to understand that what are the
principles of devops so guys the core
principle of devops are laid as follows
initially is founded on several key
principles that streamline and enhance
the processes involved in software
development and operations the first one
is automation second one is cicd and the
third one is rapid feedback now let's
understand each one of them one by one
now if I talk about automation guys so
Automation in devops covers everything
from code deployment to environment
setup and network configuration for
example using a tool like anible you can
automate the deployment of application
across hundreds of servers eliminating
manual setup and ensuring consistency
across your
infrastructure next one we have is
continuous integration and continuous
delivery let us first discuss about
continuous integration so here
developers merge their changes back to
the main branch of the project as often
as possible these changes are validated
by creating a build and running
automated test against them for example
example using genkins a CI server which
automatically tests the build whenever
new commits are pushed to the main
repository ensuring that new code
integrates well with the existing code
base now if I talk about the continuous
delivery guys it extends a continuous
integration by automatically preparing
and tracking a release to the production
this ensures that you can release new
changes to your customers quickly in a
sustainable way for example travisci can
be configured to deploy applications
automatically to the production
environments whever the build stage in
the CI process is successful it is
provided by all the test that it has
passed now let us discuss about the
third one that is rapid feedback so guys
what does it involves it involves
implementing feedback mechanisms quickly
and identifying and addressing issues in
the development of production
environments for example we have New
Relic which can be used to monitor
applications in real time providing
immediate feedback to developers if
performance degrades or an error occurs
so these were some of the basic
principles of devops I hope so you got
an idea regarding this now let's move on
and discuss one of the most important
points that is phases of devops so guys
if we discuss the phases of devop
understanding the life cycle in devorce
is crucial to grasp how it benefits the
software development and operation
process and you should understand one
thing that devops is not a tool devops
is a practice that we apply in our
software development so the first one is
plan the planning phase involves
defining the project scope identifying
resources and scheduling timelines for
example jira for task management and
Sprint planning which helps in tracking
the progress and prioritizing the work
items next we have all over here is code
developers write code in small
manageable chunks to ensure that
integration is simpler and more frequent
for example we are using GitHub a
Version Control System where developers
can collaborate to track changes and
rever to previous States if necessary
the third one is build the build phase
involves transforming code written by
developers into a runnable instance of
the application for example Gradle or
Marvin which can compile code and manage
the dependencies the fourth one is
testing phase automated tests are run to
ensure the application behaves as
expected for example selenium for
automated web testing and ensuring that
user experience is consistent across
different devices and browsers next one
we have is release so guys the release
phase involves activities related to
deploying the software to production
ensuring that the software is released
in a controlled manner for example
Docker which can package the application
and its environment into a container
that can be deployed consistently in any
environment the next phase is deploying
the actual deployment of the application
to a production environment where it can
be accessed by the users for example we
use tools like kubernetes which
automates the deployment scaling and
management of the containerized
applications seventh one is operate
ongoing maintenance and regular updates
of the application are happening at this
stage for example we have anible for
configuration management ensuring that
all systems are consistent and
maintained in the desired stage and
finally it's monitoring continuous
monitoring of the application to ensure
it performs optimally and to detect and
resolve issues as they arise for example
we have Prometheus for monitoring
application performance and grafana for
visualizing the data collected so these
were some of the phases of devops so
guys in the interviews someone can ask
it so just keep a Thor note of this now
let us move on ahead and understand
DeVos tools and their capabilities for
example we have the Version Control
System Version Control Systems like git
allow the teams to track changes and
rever to previous version of their work
and manage code with a minimal conflict
between the concurrent efforts for
example we have the tool like get which
allows to do Version Control System next
we have cicd tools so guys we have cicd
tools like genkins Circle ey GitHub
actions which automate the stages of CCD
facilitating the frequent and reliable
code changes by automatically compiling
testing and deploying the code then we
have the configuration management where
we have tools like puppet chef and
anible which automate the provisioning
and management of your Computing
infrastructure and application they
ensure environments are set up
consistently and are repeatable moving
ahead we have monitoring and logging so
guys tools like elastic search lock
stash and kibana and also Splunk collect
analyze and visualize machine generated
data to provide insights into
application performance and health so
Guys these were some of the DeVos tools
and I hope so you have got a brief idea
like how they are Incorporated in devops
now let's move ahead and do a small
handson and let us see how can we
incorporate these tools into DeVos
practices so guys let us create a
Hands-On beginner DeVos tutorial where
we are going to set up a basic
continuous integration and continuous
deployment pipeline using GitHub actions
and in this Tut tutorial we are going to
show you how you can automate the
testing and the deployment of a simple
hello world python application now there
are certain prerequisites for this you
need to have a GitHub account and have a
little bit basic familiarity with Git
and python you can access any text
editor like vs code or Sublime Text Now
let us go on to the step number one let
us first create a new repository on
GitHub okay so I have logged into my
account okay and here I'm I'm going to
click on the new so here is our new
repository and our repository name is
going to be let's say hello world cicd
so hello world cicd is our get
repository now make sure that you make
it public okay that's very very
important because now initialize a
repository with a readme file so here
you can add a readme file all over here
and also you can set up a description
that this is a demo cic CD project
project okay now since we have done all
this thing just click on create
repository so our new repository is
going to be created okay so it says the
world is not familiar okay we are going
to change the name say hello world okay
now let us create the repository pretty
fine so you can see our repository is
created now let us do one thing now we
are going to set up our local
environment for that you need to have a
get bash in your system now let us clone
the repository okay so what we are going
to do so let us copy this okay and let
us go to our bash and here uh let us
first create a directory
so so let us create mkd and let us give
a name of cicd or we can say it demo
okay then let's move to that
directory okay pretty good now in this I
want to clone it up so for cloning you
need to do just add get clone
okay and add the given link pretty fine
now just click on into it and you can
see it has started cloning the given
directory now let us move to this
directory which is Hello World okay so
I'm just going to copy this and say
CD let's paste this
okay now you you can see we are in our
main branch now all over here so as you
can see we have navigated to this
directory this is our main and CD hello
world is our main parent Branch now
after that what you have to do let us
create a basic python application okay
so I have already created that for you
so you can see there are two files uh
first one is a app.py and second one is
test
app.py so this is a hello world cicd
okay but uh we need some different
directories so let us open the folder
first okay let us
see okay we can see demo
here okay so you can see we have opened
our directory hello world all over here
and here we are going to create a file
name app.py inside this repository so no
worries just click on this folder and
click
app.py okay and this is our app.py and
inside this let us write a python code
so basically let's create a function say
def hello old okay a function that just
prints hello
world and inside this I want to say
let's
return hello
world pretty fine now let's move ahead
and let us write our function so this is
very
basic so if
name let's say
it's it's equal
to
say
main
okay and we can print the hello world so
let us call our function hello world now
we have created a basic app.py file now
the next thing what we are going to we
are going to commit okay so let us add
this file so let us open our G bash and
say get okay and say get
add
app.py so this file has been added and
let us commit a message okay so get
commit
and
M and let us say add add hello world
okay so this is our
message now finally moving ahead what
I'm going to do so you can see uh
committer my name is given and your name
and email address configured
automatically B on your username and
host name so it says and after doing
this uh this has been commented now let
us push this so get push
so you can see it's easily being pushed
up now the fourth part is testing so we
are going to create a test file all over
here so basically in this we are going
to do a unit test and which is going to
test the hello world function so if you
are aware of unit testing it's fine and
if not you can check uh on our channel
uh there are a lot of videos regarding
unit testing it might help you out so
guys here let us create
this there
app.py
okay and here I'm just going to paste
this so it is unit test you can see I'm
importing our application app and here
is hello world is imported from this
file and here the class test app is
there and here basically we are doing a
unit test so in this I'm asserting that
hello world is whenever we are calling
this function it prints up the hello
world and finally we are defining our
main function we easy and U after this
let us add commit to this file okay
basically to our repository so what we
are going to do we are going to add this
file in our repo so let us control
pretty fine now let us get add and we
can
test
app.py okay it's says our app file is
not named like this let me check so test
app.py okay is it inside this
directory okay something is wrong so no
worries I have
okay now in here I'm going
to okay guys so my file was out of the
repository so I included in this okay
now let us go to our terminal okay and
let us retry to add
okay now you you can see this would be
easily
committed now and after this let us
commit it so get
comment M and let's say
ADD
test
for hello world
application okay and let's just click on
it and you can say this is committed and
find we'll push it
up so you can see it has been easily
pushed up onto our repository now the
step five would be creating a GitHub
action for cicd so let us navigate to
our repository first and uh if you
refresh
this we could see we have added a read
me file app.py test app.py okay now in
this repository we have to navigate to
the actions tab and click and create a
new workflow okay so here you can see
this actions button just click on this
so in this let us set up our new
workflow okay so basically we are going
to create like the file would be main.
yml and yml file that you have to put
all over here so let me share you with
this so guys as you can see this is our
main. yml file okay
and the content inside this looks
something like this okay so you can see
all over here now let us try to
understand this file so basically you
can see the name of this application is
python application cicd so we have
created a workflow file for this so it
says on so basically on defines the
event that is going to trigger the
workflow then you can see there is push
basically this workflow will trigger on
the push events to the main branch then
you can see there is a pull request and
the workflow will also trigger on the
pull request to the main branch so
basically these triggers are going to
ensure that every push and pull request
to the main branch initiates the
workflow which is common practice to
ensure that the main branch remains
stable and Deployable now you can see
all over here there are jobs okay so
like build yml copy code jobs and uh
these things are there so basically jobs
defines a set of jobs that the workflow
will execute jobs run in parallel by the
default unless it is specified now you
can see build this is a single job and
it is identified by the key build it
includes several steps that this job
will execute then you can see runs on
okay so this specifies the type of
virtual machine to run the job on so
here we can see uh that here is the
machine is UB to latest it basically
indicates the latest2 runner which is
provided by the GitHub action then there
are steps so inside the steps you can
see uh we have uh the users written
actions SL checkout at V2 Nam set up
Python and there are users action set up
python we do with python version 3.8 now
here you are going to install your
dependencies then you are going to run
and finally we are installing python M
pip install upgrade pip so basically
steps what does it means it's a sequence
of task that will be executed as a part
of the job okay in the uses action
checkout at V2 basically this step uses
the checkout action to check out the
repository code so that the workflow can
access it okay then we are setting up
python 3.8 and it uses the action setup
at theate python version V2 basically it
is initializing the setup python action
to set up a python environment with
specified parameters to pass the action
such as the version is
3.8 so this overall sets up the python
version 3.8 then we are installing the
dependencies so there is a run command
so basically it executes a command using
the Shell in the runner
environment and this script updates the
PIP and install the unit test module
although which is typically unit test is
a part of python standard library and it
does not require installation via pip
okay that's one additional thing I want
you to know and finally we are testing
our application with the unit test okay
so this step runs the Python's unit test
module in a discovery mode to find and
run the test then there are V flag which
is for the verbos output and which is
going to display all the test being run
on their results so this configuration
ensures that every change that we are
pushing to the main branch or made in a
pull request is automatically tested and
it is maintaining the codes integrity
and functionality the cicd pipeline
helps automate the testing and the
deployment it is very essential practice
for efficient and reliable software
development and which is generally
followed in the industry so I hope so
you have got a brief idea regarding this
now we have completed our setup so
what's the next thing we have to do so
we have to go all over here and just
click on Commit changes so it says
create V main. yml and we can see that
we have created this so guys as you can
see in this main. yml you can see we
have created our workflow all over here
and we have created our cicd pipeline
using the GitHub actions for the simple
python application this pipeline
automatically runs your test every time
the changes are pushed to your
repository demonstrating a foundational
devops practice this fundamental step
towards more complex devops processes
involves larger applications and more
integrated testing and deployment
environments so guys this was a basic
cicd setup I hope so you have got a
brief idea regarding this if not you can
