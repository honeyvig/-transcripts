hello everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video by simply learn today we
are going to discover the real mob
business process management
what it is and what are the steps
included in its life cycle and what
benefits does it have to offer for
corporations
if you are interested in the field of
business or operations management and
want to learn more about it then we urge
you to stay tuned until the end of this
video first of all let's understand what
business process management is
business process management or bpm is an
organizational discipline in which a
firm examines all of the operation
processes collectively and individually
through this assessment companies aim to
identify areas of improvement to create
a more efficient and effective business
environment in simple terms business
process management is all about
optimizing and improving companies
business processes that serve customers
and eventually bring the pile of revenue
bpm is vast discipline that by
definition
is dynamic given the continually
changing organization roles regulations
method corporate goals and other factors
it contains
bpm has evolved with time to accept a
wide range of optimization approaches
from six sigma and lean management to
agile we'll discover these approaches in
depth on some other day first let's dive
deep into the details of bpm
if we break down nuts and bolts of
business process management you'll find
out three key factors the first one is
of course business processes
the second one will be the set of inputs
and the third one will be the output
retrieved after processing presented
inputs
for example consider the bank loan
application process
here the customer will supply an
electronic application form via the
bank's website to receive the desired
loan plan let's say a home loan in this
case
initially the input provided by the
customer will go into the loan
application process now the loan process
is not one small process there are
multiple operations and regulations
involved in it such as credit checkups
quality control loan management
underwriting etc all these tasks are
cumulatively considered as business
processes as mentioned earlier all these
processes will start once the customer
provides some sort of input in this case
it is an electronic application which
will be forwarded to the salesperson by
bank's itt by evaluating the submitted
electronic application a sales person
will formulate the list of loan products
in order to present them to the customer
but if a customer is interested in some
specific banking product for instance
home loan
in such a case the sales person will
provide customer details about home loan
a home loan has certain eligibility
criteria which customer will have to
fulfill
so salesperson will ask for set of
documents such as id proof income source
or salary sleep property documents etc
this initial phase of loan application
is also known as pre-qualification
process
in the next phase the administrative
team will evaluate all the documents
submitted by the customer and forward
them to the credit analysis team
at this point the credit department
receives the application and the first
step is to analyze it for accuracy
genuineness and completeness
if all the needed fields are not filled
out the application will be returned to
the borrower or credit analyst who will
contact the borrower to get the missing
information
the credit team uses the loan
origination system to determine a
borrower's credit worthiness a good loss
will help a lender bank set up workflows
to process a loan it may automatically
flag files that have missing needed
fills return them to the borrower and
tell the sales department that they need
to be reworked to manage this take a new
department of information and technology
will also come into play this particular
step of application evaluation is also
known as underwriting process
in the next phase the credit decisions
are made if customer fulfills all
required criteria the application will
be approved or if the customer lacks
somewhere the application will be
rejected
in the next phase quality assurance will
be achieved because lending is highly
regulated business banks rely heavily on
the quality check stage of loan
origination process the application is
routed to the quality assurance team
which compares crucial variables to
internal and external standards and
regulations this is the final step of
loan procedure before it is submitted
for funding now consider all these
processes all together each process
works on feedback of other process or
some new input hence managing every
input and process can increase the speed
of business operation by removing
internal miscommunications service
delays customer complaints etc and bpm
is the field of management that exactly
works towards achieving that in short to
define it in more simple terms i would
say bpm is all about managing multiple
input streams and inter-communication of
business processes to generate desired
business outcome within the least amount
of time possible
this bpm comprises of three main pillars
people processes and technology all
three aspects are required to work hand
in hand for a bpm project to be
successful
the business process needs to be fit for
purpose and actually satisfy the demand
for all the stakeholders having said
that let's discover the life cycle of
business process management
technology and management both are
crucial factors for bpm so the life
cycle commences the collaboration of
both with five standard steps the first
one is design then we have model
implement
monitor and finally optimize
a large team of i.t and management
experts is required to construct the bpm
project
the management team will study related
set of business processes in great
detail and then try to redesign it with
the objective of optimizing it so that
it becomes more purpose oriented
all of this happens during the design
phase of the project here all the
processes are carefully designed to be
as straightforward as possible by making
use of standardization and it automation
that is why this space can be completed
in a shorter period of time next we have
as a modeling phase
during this page the process gets
documented in the form of an activity
model it allows experts to simulate the
system's behavior and try out different
scenarios through a what-if approach
once the process is approved by higher
management by looking at the modeling
and simulation seat it is then executed
and deployed over the information system
this phase of business process
management is known as implementation
phase here if management finds out some
discrepancy the corrections can be made
by employing standard methods and
automation
the fourth page of bpm is monitoring
in this phase the performance of
business process is monitored to see if
anything goes wrong
if any problem occurs during the
monitoring phase it will be further
optimized in the next phase of business
process management this phase is known
as optimization often this phase remains
continuously under the run since the
good bpm always improves its business
processes on an ongoing basis moving
ahead let's talk about the benefits of
business process management
the first benefit
is increased visibility of business
processes a good bpm implementation will
increase the visibility of banks
activities making it easy to monitor and
control the critical business processes
of the bank
bpm also provides management increased
ability to identify bottlenecks in
simple words a process bottleneck is a
work stage that gets more work request
than it can process at its maximum
throughput capacity an example of a
short-term bottleneck would be a skilled
employee taking a few days off
if this occurs planned operations will
not be done on time leading to the drift
in business performance the other type
of bottleneck would be a long term
bottleneck it occurs all the time and
can significantly slow down production
an example of long term bottleneck is
when a machine is not efficient enough
and as a result has a long queue
bpm can help companies make improvements
and reassign resources to meet customer
demands by identifying these bottlenecks
the next benefit of bpm is reduce lead
time
by controlling all business processes
altogether and monitoring each process
in a silo bpm increases the accuracy and
speed of business operations for example
the loan application process that could
have taken months can now be finished
within weeks because of control process
handling by bpm
this increase efficiency allows banks to
convert leads into potential customers
with no time so definitely this is the
hottest benefit that bpm has to offer
the next benefit is a clear definition
of employee roles
a good bpm ensures planning optimum
roles and duties for the teams as well
as employees since people resources is
also the important factor bpm aims to
manage the bpm system prevents
unfortunate situations where a customer
who phone to inquire about a loan
application is transferred from one
individual to the next and next with all
of them saying sorry it's not my
decision to make but let me transfer you
to the person who deals with it
bpm enables a cross-functional approach
to avoid the scenario so the work is
automatically moved from one desk to the
another without any need for manual
intervention
the sixth benefit is unified systems and
operations since in bpm no process
remains in a silo by itself all
processes come closer to each other
making business a complete unified
system
the last benefit on our list is expanded
growth potential as discussed earlier a
successful bpm increases customer
happiness and lead conversion which
directly increases a company's revenue
and market value
that's all we have for today about
business process management
