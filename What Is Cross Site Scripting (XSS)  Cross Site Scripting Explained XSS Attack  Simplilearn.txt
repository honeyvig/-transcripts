hey everyone welcome back to the channel
today we are diving into the complex yet
fascinating world of crite scripting
commonly known as xss this isn't just
any Tech topic it's a critical security
issue that's affected 40% of the
websites at some point according to
recent cyber security reports but what
exactly is xss well imagine you are
shopping online and suddenly without
clicking anything a popup appears or you
find yourself d to another site that's
xss a hacker has injected malicious code
into what looked like a harmless web
page now let me tell you a quick story a
few years back a major retail website
was hit by an xss attack right during
their busy holiday season hackers
managed to slip malicious scripts into
the product review sections and the
script ran automatically when other
Shoppers viewed the reviews the result
thousands of customers had the personal
information stolen right under their
noses the beach not only caused millions
in Damages but also the trust of the
customers so whether you are a buring
web developer a cybercity Enthusiast or
just someone who shops online
understanding xss is crucial today we
are going to break down how these
attacks happen show you real examples of
xss in action and most importantly share

section below so let's get started so
guys let's start with what is crite
scripting so xss is a security flow in
web applications where attackers inject
malicious scripts into web pages that
other users View and interact with this
allows attackers to execute scripts in
the victim's browser potentially
stealing information impersonating them
or altering web page content so let's
have a look at brief history and
evolution of xss vulnerabilities these
vulnerabilities are discovered in the
1990s and the xss has evolved from a
minor annoyance to a major threat as the
internet became more integral to daily
and business activities despite
advancements in web security xss remains
a prevalent issue due to the complex
nature of modern web applications so
let's say an example for the xss suppose
a website has a search function that
directly displays user input in the
search results page without proper
sanitization an attacker crafts a URL
that includes a search term like as you
can see on the screen that is script
alert xss detected so when another user
Clicks in this link or enters this
script in the search box the m script
runs in the browser displaying an alert
box so this is how a xss attack happens
now we move to the types of attacks so
the number one on the list is reflected
accss that occurs when malicious scripts
are embedded in a URL which executes
when the URL is visited and the common
insights that reflect user input like
search engines next on the list is
stored xss that happens when malicious
scripts are permanently stored on target
servers such as in comment sections or
forums the script is then served to
users who view the infected content then
comes the do based accss this involves
client side code vulnerability where the
document object model that is dome
environment is manipulated to execute
unwanted actions without needing to
communicate with the server so these are
the types of accss attacks now moving to
how xss attacks work so xss attacks
manipulate web applications to execute m
ious scripts on the users browser
attackers craft inputs that are
incorrectly trusted and executed as code
by the web application so let's
understand this with the help of an
example let's imagine a simple example
of a stored xss attack and we will
imagine a scenario on a social media
website first we'll see how we can post
a comment let's suppose someone let's
call them Alex post a comment on an
article but Alex command isn't just text
it includes a hidden snippet of code
that looks like less text but actually
has a script embedded in it now we'll
see the website doesn't check it and the
comments are not checked that contain
anything dangerous like scripts so it
saves Alex command with the script in it
just like any other command now when
other users like Bob or Charlie or any
one person read the article they see
Alex comment so without knowing when Bob
and charie view the comment the hidden
script in the comment runs automatically
on the browsers the script Secret sends
Bobs and Charlie information like the
cookies which can keep track of who they
are on the website back to Alex Alex can
now potentially access BS and Charlie's
accounts without the passwords this
example shows why websites need to check
and clean up any data like commands
submitted by users to prevent such
attacks this checking process is called
sanitizing by sanitizing inputs websites
can make sure no harmful scripts are
stored and later executed so this is the
best example for the accs attack now
we'll move to the common methods of xss
injection so the number one on the list
is user input attackers May inject
scripts via form fields or URL
parameters for instance adding a script
tag in a command field that executes
when other users view the comment next
is malicious content posting scripts in
user generated content areas like
commands forums or user profiles an
example is a user posting a malicious
script in an online Forum that steals
cookies from every visitor who use the
post the next is third party components
using third party scripts or plugins
that contain vulnerabilities an attacker
might exploit a vulnerable plugin to
inject malicious scripts into a website
that uses it so these are the common
methods of accss injection now we see
the impacts of xss so xss attacks can
allow attackers to steal cookies session
tokens or other sensitive information
that can be used to impersonate the
victim attackers can manipulate or
defense the website content seen by
users which can damage the website's
reputation and Trust accss can be used
to deliver malware to users potentially
leading to further exploit such as
ransomware or spyware now we'll see the
real world consequences and examples of
major accesses attacks so the number one
consequence is financial damage
companies might face significant
financial losses due to stolen data or
FR along with cost related to securing
the breach and potential fines for data
protection failures the next is
reputation damage a successful accesses
attack can damage a company's reputation
leading to Lost customers and decreased
trust in the brand then comes the legal
consequences businesses May face legal
actions if customer data is compromised
especially under regulations like gdpr
now we see an example of a major access
attack so we'll not name the website but
a welln social media platform
experienced an accss attack where
malicious scripts were inserted into
profile pages
this script automatically executed
whenever the profile was viewed
spreading the tag across the user base
it led to widespread unauthorized access
to personal information and was a major
privacy breach so now moving to
detecting and mitigating accss
vulnerabilities starting with the
detecting so starting with detecting xss
vulnerabilities so the number one on the
list is tools for identification use
automated security tools like oap zap BB
suit and xss scanners that can help
detect potential X ACC vulnerabilities
in web applications by simulating
attacks the next on the list is manual
testing Security Experts often perform
manual testing alongside automated tools
to catch nuances that machines might
miss the next is common science frequent
unexplained redirects or unusual popups
on a site can be indicative of access's
vulnerabilities the next on the list is
code review regularly review and audit
source code for potential accss
vulnerabilities focusing on how user
inputs are handled then comes security
headers use HTTP security headers like X
content type options and X accss
protection to enhance protection against
xss so these were the detecting options
for xss vulnerabilities now we'll see
prevention and mitigating them so the
number one on the list is coding best
practices employees secure coding
standards that include escaping user
input using safe API functions and
applying least privilege principles the
next is security measures Implement
content security policy CSP which helps
implementing xss by restricting the
sources from which scripts can be loaded
the next is input sanitization validate
and sanitize all user inputs to ensure
that Mala scripts are not executed
Frameworks like react automatically
Escape outputs reducing the risk of
excesses the next is output encoding
always encode output not just input to
ensure that special characters are not
executed as code and the next is use of
security libraries Implement libraries
and Frameworks that are designed to
defend against accss by providing
functions that handle escaping and
sanitizing these methods form the core
of a robust strategy to detect prevent
and mitigate accss attacks ensuring that
web applications are secure against this
common and dangerous type of cyber
threat and with that guys we have come
