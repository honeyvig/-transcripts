1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,340
so blow there and welcome to another

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,980
tutorial my name is Tammy Bakshi and

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,480
this time we're going to be going over

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,180
how you can use Twitter kit and of

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,860
course the Watson natural language

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,199
understanding service in order to create

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,789
an application in mind that I like to

8
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,570
call T so Morton a social media analyzer

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,420
now the point of this application is for

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,670
use people attract the sentiment of

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,610
different posts of users on social media

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,039
over time regarding a certain search

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,719
query now this is applicable to

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,300
absolutely any social media platform in

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,010
fact if you were to apply a visual

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,020
sentiment developed by Facebook you can

17
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,340
actually go ahead and even do this on

18
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,410
Instagram and many other kind of social

19
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,260
media as well however for now I'm going

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,660
to be focusing on textual social media

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,850
and in this case Twitter but you can

22
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,250
very easily expand this to Facebook or

23
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,899
practically any other kind of social

24
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,750
media that uses text because it's a very

25
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,180
simple API integration and of course

26
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,760
with this search so let's begin now in

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,439
essence this is going to be created in

28
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,259
the iOS application or when using a

29
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:09,999
third-party library in order to display

30
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:12,639
a graph of sentiment over time and let

31
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,170
me show you a little bit more of what's

32
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,209
actually going on in the backend when

33
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,649
you're developing and actually using

34
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:20,409
this application let's begin alright so

35
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,450
now to begin of course when from an iOS

36
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,520
front-end this enables us to develop the

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,020
application really quickly because it's

38
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,060
simple doing the iOS development and of

39
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,740
course allows us to display a lot of

40
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,749
information because the very easy to use

41
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:34,149
touch interface so let's just say we've

42
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:37,509
got an iOS interface and of course this

43
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:40,649
is running Swift now of course I could

44
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:48,009
use Watson through the iOS SDK however

45
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,169
in this case I've decided to use a lamb

46
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:52,149
on fire for which I do have quite

47
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,549
through different tutorials in order to

48
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,229
create a version that uses the REST API

49
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,509
for Watson so these are actually going

50
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,789
through raw HTTP and are wrapped by a

51
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:03,039
lamb on fire instead of using the Watson

52
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,439
developer Cloud SDK it's a little bit

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,090
easier to set up and get installed

54
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,980
because it's come

55
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,170
both cocoapods and you don't need to go

56
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,780
through the entire Karthus setup and so

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,190
soon I'll be telling you also in a

58
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,900
separate video how exactly we can

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,760
install the Watson Melbourne SDK but

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
that's for another video all right so I

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
know actually about Watson and finally

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,990
we've got the last piece which is the

63
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,050
social media platform now in this case

64
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,510
the one that I found usually works the

65
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,330
best is Twitter and the reason why is

66
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,830
because I've seen numerous different

67
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,240
examples of it in action

68
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,100
like for example a little while ago

69
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,890
actually some time ago Google Drive the

70
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,090
service thing I'm sure you've all heard

71
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,130
of went down because as you can imagine

72
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,560
millions of people like yourself are

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,230
going on Twitter and publishing hashtag

74
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,060
goon we drive down with a lot of

75
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,010
negative sentiment in fact you can see

76
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,150
on the screen right now a bunch of the

77
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,830
different examples of different twits

78
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,560
that people have and the people of

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
Twitter we're having some really

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,960
interesting reactions to it basically

81
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,420
and so Twitter usually works the best

82
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,490
because of its trend system and the way

83
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,170
it uses hashtags compared to other

84
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,380
social media websites so in this case

85
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,510
Twitter is the one that I'm beginning

86
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,570
with however you can use any social

87
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,220
media platform that you desire as long

88
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,380
as it has an API that allows you to

89
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,780
search and also and of course once you

90
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,900
actually sign up for a version of the

91
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,180
Twitter API or a Twitter developer

92
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,070
account and if you actually incorporate

93
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,800
the OAuth login you will actually get a

94
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,989
higher quota and so it'll work out for

95
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,510
around two minutes

96
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,550
continuous streaming and so essentially

97
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,190
the way this works is we have a timer on

98
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,739
the iOS application now what the timer's

99
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,500
gonna do is every say two seconds so you

100
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,770
can adjust the interval by a second less

101
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,050
or more but say you'd by default every

102
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,170
two seconds the iOS application is going

103
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,540
to query Twitter and so it's actually

104
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,489
going to send over an HTTP request over

105
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,500
to Twitter and this is through its SDK

106
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,030
because again it can be installed

107
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,709
through cocoa pod so it's very very easy

108
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,350
to get set up and so through their SDK

109
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,020
we said that

110
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,960
gtp request over a Twitter kit or over

111
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,030
the Twitter through Twitter Kent and the

112
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,100
Twitter is going to get back to us with

113
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,920
a bunch of posts on this certain search

114
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,850
query so it'll get back to us with posts

115
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,430
now once the IMS application has posts

116
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,840
it does some very very simple

117
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,120
pre-processing just removes a few

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,010
Unicode characters just a few things

119
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,280
that Watson may not like and then once

120
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,660
it's got posts it's actually really

121
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,850
simple all you do is you use the iOS

122
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,360
application to send over those posts to

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,400
Watson again we're doing this through

124
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,700
HTTP and then Watson's going to analyze

125
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,840
them using the natural language

126
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,030
understanding service and this is where

127
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,250
the interesting part comes in you see in

128
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,170
this case I could have used the

129
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,900
sentiment analysis service however the

130
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,730
reason I didn't decide to do that is

131
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,490
because of one specific reason and that

132
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,390
is that with Watson NLU I see with Emily

133
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,540
you I get something called an emotion

134
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,220
score I don't get sentiment I can't

135
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,830
emotion now what's the difference you

136
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,340
may say well with emotion I get one

137
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,040
single move I get one thing about you

138
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,140
and it's flowing point and it's a range

139
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,550
of negative 1 to 1

140
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,910
and so basically negative 1 is very

141
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,020
negative positive 1 is positive and 0 is

142
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,790
kind of neutral in between doesn't

143
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,710
really matter kind of thing and so it

144
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,110
gives me one individual value when I'm

145
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,000
working with sentiment analysis service

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,650
spell that's gonna give me five

147
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,630
different values it's going to give me

148
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,800
anger fear disgust sadness I'm joy and

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,200
so these five values can be used for

150
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,940
more intricate analysis if you would

151
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,100
prefer that however it's easier for

152
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,690
people generally this is a positive

153
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,120
negative emotion then for humans to

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
visually have to see five different

155
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
emotions on a graph it really isn't that

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,510
easy to use for a human therefore I

157
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,700
prefer the one value and of course

158
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,590
because it's such a simple scale we can

159
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,110
easily graph it out and plus our

160
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,780
graphing library is great because what

161
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,280
it allows us to do is actually have

162
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,610
Graff have the middle b0 have the bottom

163
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,010
B negative one the positive the top

164
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,560
being positive one and then what I can

165
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,990
actually do is make it so that when the

166
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,889
line is the middle it's blue or so when

167
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,560
the lines in the middle it's blue and so

168
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,710
as it actually goes up it will continue

169
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,560
to be blue because of course it's

170
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,570
positive and of course whatever changes

171
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,600
there are but then as it starts to go

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
down let's just say at this moment

173
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,950
Google Drive one down it'll actually

174
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,500
start to go down why is it reaches zero

175
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,980
and then right after that it's going to

176
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,770
be red because it's in the negatives and

177
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,320
you will see and then and so it's just a

178
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,450
great graphical interface and so it

179
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,610
works out absolutely perfectly Watson

180
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,560
fits in perfectly with our graph I seek

181
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,930
a no extra processing required so it's

182
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,850
very very convenient so that's exactly

183
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,470
why we're using natural language

184
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,030
understanding instead of sentiment

185
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,990
analysis just in case you are wondering

186
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,270
and so back to the flow

187
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,620
Mariah's Watson gets back to us with the

188
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,710
emotion then in the right as we get the

189
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,750
emotion back we then just go ahead and

190
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,789
do a little bit of processing on the

191
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,500
information that it gives back to us in

192
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,930
JSON and right after that we're able to

193
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,539
show the graph and update the graph and

194
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:42,979
of course we can have the graph scroll

195
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,169
as we get more and more values and how

196
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,910
the user interact with it in touch and

197
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,370
so that was the beginning there's still

198
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,900
a bit Homer though there's a feature

199
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,560
called

200
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,260
outlying tweets now what is that like

201
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,750
tweets well imagine this let's just say

202
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,970
our sentiment is in this range over here

203
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,800
all right so that's where our range is

204
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,039
here now what you can do is you can

205
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,740
basically say draw a little circle we

206
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,729
create a little radius around a certain

207
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,550
sentiment value or the average sentiment

208
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,669
value if by chance let's just say

209
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:18,900
there's someone tweeting something

210
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,990
really negative Google Drive whereas the

211
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,749
average sentiment is really positive

212
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:26,430
you'll find out in the outline tweet

213
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,620
section or let's just say there's some

214
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,120
kind of movie that people just do not

215
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,269
like well in that case you can go ahead

216
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,430
and find people who do like the movie I

217
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,490
goes the outline tweet section if people

218
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,519
are sort of mixed I'm 50% of people do

219
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,829
not like it because I do like it then

220
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:45,839
it'll show you the toys of people on the

221
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,329
extremes it will show you people who are

222
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,910
extremely positive and people who are

223
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,250
extremely negative basically any

224
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,339
person's post whose sentiment does not

225
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,529
lie within the immediate vicinity of the

226
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,839
average sentiment of one of these kinds

227
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,389
of posts right so that is the outlying

228
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,820
tweets feature of course permutes can be

229
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,880
expanded to a bunch of other features

230
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,870
including using the IBM Watson

231
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,240
personality insight service and an

232
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,800
application of mine that you may have

233
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,319
heard of send a color and that's coming

234
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:19,410
up in part two in the video however what

235
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,420
I'd love to do now is show you this part

236
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,940
to Sona how exactly it works and then

237
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,290
part two we'll talk about the next

238
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,329
version that takes this another level

239
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,310
burger let's give up on that part now

240
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,139
we're always showing you how exactly you

241
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,540
can code him all of this using swift and

242
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,760
iOS of course isn't the Watson natural

243
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,170
language understanding and in this case

244
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,510
Twitter kitchen alright let's get over

245
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,779
to the coding part now all right so

246
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,730
welcome back to the code part and now

247
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,829
let's take a look at how exactly you can

248
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:49,199
build your own version of T Silva now

249
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:51,420
the storyboard for this application is a

250
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,949
little bit more complex than we may be

251
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:54,959
used to on this channel let's start off

252
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,000
at the very beginning now you see I want

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,940
T so on we won't have a push segue so

254
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,579
you can actually go back to the title

255
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,440
and then interact with the with a fuse

256
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,750
and so what that means that I need to

257
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,149
start off with a navigation controller

258
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,639
and so I start off initially over here

259
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,130
at the navigation controller which will

260
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,709
go ahead and push us over to the Welcome

261
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,740
page now you might wonder what exactly

262
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,209
the Welcome page does if there's no

263
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,920
button on it this is just a bunch of

264
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,740
labels well the button

265
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,500
does appear see right under let's start

266
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,330
there's a button you can't see it in the

267
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,130
storyboard though because it's a button

268
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,959
that Twitter is going to put in for us

269
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,760
in the code we'll be getting to that

270
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
shortly

271
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,899
now over to the second second a few

272
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,820
right has you've logged in with Twitter

273
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,430
and you'll put over here where it asks

274
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,860
you what your search query is once you

275
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,330
enter in your search query you don't

276
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,950
click on the let's start and it'll move

277
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,170
it over to this page this is kind of a

278
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,779
dashboard t-cell but your homepage say

279
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,790
now you can do a few different things

280
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,890
first of all you can just search it up

281
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,570
on Twitter or your search query on

282
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,610
Twitter and it'll show you the tweets if

283
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,010
you click it'll go through this segue

284
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,080
which will push us over to this view

285
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,020
which has a table view and using our own

286
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,330
custom code we'll go ahead and push a

287
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,370
bunch of tweets into the table view if

288
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,529
you were to go back if you were to click

289
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,029
the back button since we're using the

290
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,709
push segues in the navigation controller

291
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,410
you can click on sentiment when you're

292
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,300
going to sentiment you come here now I

293
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,160
know this looks really weird but don't

294
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,770
worry the chart which shows sentiment is

295
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,570
actually over here in these blue

296
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,610
boundaries there's just a small bug and

297
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,770
how xcode renders this chart because

298
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,779
it's a custom UI view but that's all

299
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,089
it'll actually appear correct on the

300
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:40,250
device itself as a matter of fact this

301
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,660
reminds me I'm going to be showing you a

302
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,300
demo of Teasle in action right after

303
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,180
we're done the coding part if you were

304
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,529
to go back you can take a look at the

305
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,209
most interesting feature the outline

306
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,730
tweets which are visible over here and

307
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,680
the way it starts off is this table view

308
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,300
is going to show you all the tweets and

309
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,399
then within around three to four seconds

310
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,620
it's going to refresh and only show

311
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,990
content which fits as an outline tweet

312
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,209
but wait what if there are no outline

313
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,600
tweets what everything everything what's

314
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,120
the average well then go back and head

315
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,160
over to your settings page here you can

316
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,140
actually just quite a few different

317
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,779
knobs that T's OMA has the first one is

318
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,000
with the sentiment refresh now what this

319
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,730
means is basically how often this chart

320
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,829
is going to refresh unfold it's around

321
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,180
two seconds that we'll take a look at

322
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,220
that in the code in terms of outliers

323
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,350
you can set the amount two tweets that

324
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,209
the outliers searches for and it's quite

325
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,579
tweet intensive and so make sure that if

326
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,920
the user isn't paying you don't allow

327
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,240
them to search for too many tweets

328
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,189
because of course they're going to get

329
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:43,449
over their quota quite soon however

330
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:45,769
there's also the more interesting knob

331
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:46,970
with sensitivity

332
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,040
sounds of Japanese basically how far

333
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,809
away from the average means to me in

334
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,670
terms of sentiment to make considered an

335
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,490
outlier by default it's over half I mean

336
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,619
it is quite large because we want to

337
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,300
make sure that massive amounts of tweets

338
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,879
you're able to find the trouble outliers

339
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,220
and not just slightly deviant from the

340
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,749
average because of Sanna machine

341
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,759
learning error however you can increase

342
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,920
us or decreases to your will if you

343
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,269
decrease this you'll probably get more

344
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:12,980
tweets because it'll be closer and

345
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,079
closer to the average if you increase

346
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,369
this we'll get less and less tweets

347
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,990
because of the fact that you're only

348
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,970
searching for more at the extremes

349
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,660
rather than closer to the average so

350
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,970
those were all the views and how they

351
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,949
interact with each other now let's take

352
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:28,490
a look

353
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,420
code for each of these views one by one

354
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,129
let's start off with the main view

355
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,629
controller which is this view right over

356
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:38,540
here as I mentioned we have to insert

357
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,879
the button for the actual login now if

358
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,949
the view controller just loads up I'm

359
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,809
able to see that the Twitter kit allows

360
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:47,059
us to create a button here we go now I

361
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,160
do to find a few global variables that

362
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,149
we're going to need to throw out the

363
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:51,980
view controllers I do this so we can

364
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,839
actually access data throughout

365
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,949
different view controllers without

366
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:58,040
having to do any fancy work so now as

367
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,240
you can see inside of the view

368
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,319
controller if I were to go to the

369
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,689
viewdidload function of course we run

370
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:04,220
the super view in low this as always

371
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,600
this is all the same from there we have

372
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,059
a new login button so we have the

373
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,160
Twitter login button imported from

374
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,410
Twitter kit and of course I have a

375
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,029
completion handler who once you have

376
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,860
actually logged in as we run this as an

377
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,449
asynchronous task and not a synchronous

378
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,850
task I'm going to make sure maximum

379
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,920
performance and we don't fill it up the

380
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,129
UI now what we're doing here is creating

381
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:30,649
the button and I'll talk about what's

382
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,269
inside of the completion handler in just

383
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:32,749
a moment

384
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,459
remember because this is an asynchronous

385
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,549
task what that means is that right as

386
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:40,129
you can run this code this won't

387
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,540
actually run what's inside of this

388
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,730
button won't actually run rather it'll

389
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,309
skip to over here where as you click the

390
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:47,880
button then the

391
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,800
code is going to run and so this is what

392
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,319
runs first now what we do is we set the

393
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,779
center position of the login button in

394
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,509
the center of our current view and then

395
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,579
from there we add a sub view to our

396
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:02,009
current view which is a login button

397
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:03,360
in fact if I were to make this a bit

398
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,110
easier for you to see here there you go

399
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,509
so then we just add the sub view and we

400
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,470
are good to go we've gotten the button

401
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,610
in the center of the screen

402
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,620
screen and we don't actually need this

403
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,509
function as it was a it's a leftover

404
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:20,610
from the older version I'm separated

405
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,050
this into a separate view controller

406
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,110
entirely there we go now let's talk

407
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,089
about what happens once you log in now

408
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:28,380
right as you click the button you're

409
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,670
taken over to the Twitter application

410
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,980
where you give consent for your account

411
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,649
to be used by my application if you

412
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:35,819
don't have the Twitter application

413
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:38,759
installed you know a separate window is

414
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,500
going to open up and you can just give

415
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,670
your consent there and if you're not

416
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,019
already logged in you can go ahead and

417
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,779
log in however let's just say you do

418
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,220
give your consent for us to use your

419
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,980
data then in that case this will go

420
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,509
through because I'll have a new Twitter

421
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:53,519
session I can then create a new Twitter

422
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,040
API client and pass it your user ID I

423
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,259
can then ask it to load your user in

424
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,630
give it your user ID and then run

425
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,120
another completion Handler now once the

426
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,329
user is loaded in then if there was an

427
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:08,130
error it's going to print out the error

428
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,540
or else it's going to print out mail

429
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,300
here off and regardless of whether or

430
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,310
not that happens we are going to run an

431
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,290
asynchronous task on the main thread

432
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,689
however meaning that we can actually do

433
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:20,610
you I up dates and I'm going to perform

434
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,120
a segue on the current a view controller

435
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,829
and of course this current segue is

436
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:28,560
query and the sender itself if we were

437
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,329
to go back just to tell you exactly what

438
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:32,880
that is the query segue will take us

439
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,980
from the main new controller over to the

440
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,680
next view of interest and that is this

441
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,620
view over here and there we go

442
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,660
this field over here which asks the user

443
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,029
for their search query if we were to go

444
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,560
over to the query view controller you

445
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,449
can see this is very very very simple

446
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:50,759
code inside of this view controller all

447
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,189
it really does is of course creates a

448
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:54,959
new iboutlet for the search query which

449
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,120
is UI text field and then why does they

450
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,010
click on the start button we set the

451
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,940
global variable named session

452
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,860
which was designed to find in the

453
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,110
viewcontroller dots which file over the

454
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,780
search queries text and we perform a

455
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,730
segway on the self view controller and

456
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,880
this one's identifier is start the

457
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,810
sender is self and so that is the query

458
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,820
u controller extremely simple doesn't

459
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,580
really do real work now at this point

460
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,930
you're in the dashboard the dashboard

461
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,730
doesn't have its own view controller

462
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,470
file due to the fact that there's no

463
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,210
real code you need to put there it's

464
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,010
just a place where you have a bunch of

465
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,870
segues in fact that's one of the main

466
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,580
reasons I chose to use the push segue

467
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,560
because it's easier to integrate and

468
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,840
then integrate navigation there instead

469
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
of having to have code for all the

470
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,760
navigation manually alright so now we

471
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,560
can talk about the first real view

472
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,710
controller the tweet view controller we

473
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,940
actually show you a bunch of different

474
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,010
tweets in a table view now you might be

475
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,500
wondering why the code is so short for

476
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,330
this view controller and well it's short

477
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,980
because Twitter does all the work for us

478
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,170
I don't need to do anything all I do is

479
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,910
I import the Twitter kit library and

480
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,340
then this view controller is actually

481
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,840
not a regular view controller it

482
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,090
actually conforms the Twitter timeline

483
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,190
view controller of course we still have

484
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,930
viewed and loads as this inherits from

485
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,030
the view controller class we do run the

486
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,800
superb unit load and as we just said

487
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,080
selfs datasource to a Twitter search

488
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,630
timeline datasource we passed the global

489
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,070
variable called session query that we

490
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,450
discussed in the query view controller

491
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,670
file and I passed the global variable

492
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,980
called Twitter client because that is

493
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,020
our API client and that's logged into

494
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,970
your account so we can actually run the

495
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,100
search now remember if you were to not

496
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,410
log in to the user and just use your own

497
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,920
API key and in that case you would have

498
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,500
a lower quota because you're using

499
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,900
well the developer account and so you

500
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,670
have a lower quota just keep that in

501
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,300
mind as you use the service in fact if

502
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,710
we were to go over to the app delegate

503
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,020
just to show you here in the app

504
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,850
delegate I do actually take a look at

505
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,040
Twitter create a new shared instance or

506
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,720
actually access the shared instance and

507
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,450
start the shared instance and I provide

508
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,010
my consumer key and consumer secret

509
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,470
which will be reset after the video just

510
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,320
by the way and so yes I do provide my

511
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,680
API credentials in the app delegate all

512
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,970
right so now that we're done this

513
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,180
you can go over to a sort of main view

514
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,430
this is what makes t so about what it is

515
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,730
Realty Zuma and so this is the sentiment

516
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,590
view controller you might be wondering

517
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,510
why it's called the SPME controller and

518
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,220
that's because it's also mentored with

519
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,140
personality and set a color which we'll

520
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,940
be seeing in the next version of this

521
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,390
application in the part 2 of this

522
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,940
tutorial now in this case I'm importing

523
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,430
three modules Twitter kit a Lambo fire

524
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,560
and Swift chart Swift chart is an

525
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,810
exceptional charts library I'll be

526
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,130
linking to its kid hub down in the

527
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,260
description below a Lambo fire is the

528
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,150
exceptional networking library I'll be

529
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,250
linking to them down below as well and

530
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,380
of course you know Twitter get there the

531
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,240
great social media platform that we all

532
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,190
know and love and of course they provide

533
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,640
a very very easy to use swift or not

534
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,030
swift iOS framework and of course just

535
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,070
so you know I am using cocoapods just in

536
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,180
case you don't know how to use cocoapods

537
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,830
there is a youtube video on my channel

538
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,960
coming soon that will teach you a little

539
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,280
bit more about what it is and how you

540
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,840
can use it link will be down below once

541
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,870
it's released alright so that is Twitter

542
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,990
kit and those are all the modules we're

543
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,880
using here now to begin with I've got a

544
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,860
very simple extension to the streams to

545
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,950
the string class and of course we are

546
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,620
parsing JSON quite a few times here both

547
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,140
with Twitter and with Watson and so I do

548
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,360
use the string extension to

549
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,090
automatically parse a JSON string into

550
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,870
string any for me after that we also

551
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,670
have the extension to the array class

552
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,950
with this extension to the array class I

553
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,280
can easily get the average of any array

554
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,530
into a double yeah almost entirely

555
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,610
automatically just like that now if we

556
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,040
were to continue here as you can see in

557
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,920
the SP view controller itself of course

558
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,210
this inherits from the UI view

559
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,690
controller

560
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,880
I've created myself a chart which is the

561
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,460
ID outlet variable chart and from there

562
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,290
and this is also just by the way the

563
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,610
chart that we control the sentiment with

564
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,770
and then these are the actual sort of

565
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,110
internal variables that help us out now

566
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,730
Watson sentiments and chart date oh

567
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,560
you'll find out exactly what those do in

568
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,660
just a moment but essentially chart data

569
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,600
is all the data in the chart and Watson

570
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
sentiments is all the sentiment values

571
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,220
that we get from the tweet so we talked

572
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,440
about that in just a moment and of

573
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,030
course there's also variable called run

574
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,100
timer and I'll be talking about why I

575
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,710
need that when it comes up as well now

576
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,480
right as the unit load function begins

577
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,419
we actually do add to chart now who take

578
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,370
a look at what add to chart does is it

579
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,990
checks if we're currently running the

580
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,799
timer if we are then in that case it's

581
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,140
going to set Watson sentiments back to

582
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,429
nothing because we're going to be

583
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,679
looking through and getting the center

584
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,720
and for each tweet all over again

585
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,600
after that we define an optional NS

586
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,039
error because we're most probably not

587
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,480
going to have one and of course at the

588
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,549
beginning it starts off as male and then

589
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,179
I create a new URL request so basically

590
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:10,280
what this is is I actually ask the

591
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,630
Twitter client to created the URL

592
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,299
request for me that I can send later on

593
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,490
so this is not an actual response that

594
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,080
we're getting from the URL we're just

595
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,659
creating an nsurl request or now renamed

596
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:23,360
in Swift three or four it's now called a

597
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,510
URL request so I'm interested in the get

598
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,460
method we'd have no reason to use the

599
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,870
post method or any of the other methods

600
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,480
so get is the one that we use and then

601
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,080
the search tweets JSON is a URL string

602
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,390
that I use of course the parameters

603
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,280
would be as in terms of the query the

604
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,049
actual session query the global variable

605
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,330
and in terms of the result type we want

606
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,669
to get the most recent results first as

607
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:49,190
that'll allow us to work with the most

608
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,200
recent tweets of course I just provide

609
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,750
provide a memory memory address or a

610
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,840
pointer to the optional NS error so just

611
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,580
in case there is an error that error is

612
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,500
no longer optional and now contains a

613
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,690
value that's that I create something

614
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,580
called a dispatch group now before I'll

615
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,200
continue just in case you're unfamiliar

616
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,780
with asynchronous tasks make sure you

617
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,789
watch my video on that there's a link to

618
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,679
that link to it down in the description

619
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,570
below but essentially what a dispatch

620
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,179
group is is well a group of asynchronous

621
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,090
hop operations or group of operations on

622
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,730
a dispatch thread and essentially the

623
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,740
reason we need a group of these is that

624
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,690
at the end we want to wait for all of

625
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,429
them to complete we don't just want to

626
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:30,679
have one thing happen and then we can do

627
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:32,390
the next thing inside of that

628
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,330
asynchronous task so we need to what a

629
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,760
bunch of asynchronous tasks in a loop

630
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,250
and after that once they're all done we

631
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,300
need to be able to wait for people to

632
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,920
wait for all that to be on so we can go

633
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,660
over to the next step that's why we have

634
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,100
a dispatch group you'll see exactly what

635
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,130
I'm talking about in just a moment there

636
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,050
we actually use the Twitter client that

637
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,760
we have like in the global variable to

638
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,500
actually set the Twitter URL request

639
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,600
that we had how I do ignore the error

640
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,250
because in this case there is going to

641
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,320
be no error however in order to create C

642
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,850
for code you can go ahead and look at

643
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,460
that error as well to pass up the URL

644
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,230
request and then we have a new

645
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,660
completion Handler in this case I look

646
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,090
for the URL response the data passed by

647
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,830
it and the error just in case there is

648
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,900
one and then we begin the completion

649
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,510
Handler so I have a do statement here

650
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,360
now if of course all the operations do

651
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,670
statement are successful then well good

652
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,190
if they are not however I will print out

653
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,230
the errors localized description which

654
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,000
is basically a a user-friendly version

655
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,420
of me ever getting back over here though

656
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,760
once you have sent that Twitter request

657
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,310
then you are free to start off with the

658
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,670
actual sort of processing again inside

659
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,500
of this do we print out just in case

660
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,390
there is an error the actual localized

661
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,120
description and then after that we start

662
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,910
we start looking at the actual data sent

663
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,070
back the first thing I do is I convert

664
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,220
the URL data over to JSON now this isn't

665
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,140
a string so I can't just use my string

666
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,690
extension I have to convert it from data

667
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,540
to JSON so I use the JSON serialization

668
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,850
class with a JSON object I pass it my

669
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,700
URL data and of course I allow fragments

670
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,710
which is basically just an eternal talk

671
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,170
allowing it to parse JSON you don't need

672
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,000
to worry about all this I don't want to

673
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,980
confuse you with the allow franc masala

674
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,440
JSON parsing just leave it as a black

675
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,920
box

676
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,680
however from there we want to forcefully

677
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,290
convert this to a string any because all

678
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,200
of the indexes or the indices for all

679
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,910
the objects here early new strings

680
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,880
however the values for these indices can

681
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,590
be arrays it could be strings ants

682
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,060
whatever they want to be that's why we

683
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,580
give them on any type there we create an

684
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,770
array of tweets in this case strings and

685
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,810
then I loop through the response but not

686
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,360
just any indices I look through these

687
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,650
statuses

688
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,659
and of course in this case I treat the

689
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:54,770
statuses as a string any array of

690
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,750
dictionaries in the dictionary being

691
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,179
string any from there because this is a

692
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:03,770
list of string any I can loop through

693
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,529
that list and I is always going to be a

694
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:09,860
string Eddie there I can look at the

695
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,669
indices of I text I will get any convert

696
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:15,740
at the string and then I've got the text

697
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,779
of the tweet and I append that the

698
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:20,419
tweets array just like that I wrote all

699
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:22,700
my tweets from JSON now in a very simple

700
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,529
array that I can access natively here in

701
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:27,860
Swift then I loop through all the tweets

702
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,130
now every single time the loops code is

703
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,220
called I enter my Watson group

704
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,279
dispatched and despatch group so again

705
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,890
this is telling the dispatch group and

706
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,020
there's a new job that has joined you

707
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,760
all right from there I create the

708
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,559
credential data these are my credentials

709
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,720
for the IBM Watson natural language

710
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,940
understanding service and then I create

711
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,370
a level fire request and so of course I

712
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,940
pass it the eight the REST API URL for

713
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,039
natural language understanding I tell it

714
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,510
that I want to use the get method and

715
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,399
the parameters are going to be the

716
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:04,070
version in this case twenty 1702 27 if

717
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,419
there's a new version you could always

718
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,690
put that in if you force the text in

719
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,220
this case is going to be a tweet which

720
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,200
is I and the features that we're looking

721
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,090
for in this case are only sent image

722
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,000
because we don't want anything else

723
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,200
however and of course I mean I use a

724
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,690
little bit of different terminology in

725
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,090
my whiteboard and emotion sentiment but

726
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,409
what we're gathering here is indeed

727
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,570
sentiment information in terms of the

728
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,460
HTTP headers though that we're sending

729
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,990
out only going to be sending the

730
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,640
credential data so Watson knows that

731
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,350
it's me not some random person that's

732
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,690
trying to get into the service I'm going

733
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,240
to validate this request and as long as

734
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,520
it's good I should get any response all

735
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,750
right as I get a response

736
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,909
I've got completion handler that handles

737
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:46,640
that Watson underscore response now I do

738
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,590
have an a-flat statement to make sure

739
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,289
that I do actually did a Watson response

740
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:54,169
so if let Watson rest is equal to what's

741
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:56,179
the response that results on value if

742
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:58,549
this is true then I just append that

743
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,149
wants a sentiment to an array

744
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,820
this looks really complex doesn't it but

745
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,710
really all it is is we're taking a look

746
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,899
at the result that Watson gave us we

747
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,969
took a look at the set time value we

748
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:11,469
look at the document value and we look

749
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:13,539
at the score value how this is a perfect

750
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,989
example of where languages like nodejs

751
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,789
or Python are superior

752
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:20,769
we'd so if you don't marry can get very

753
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,509
good JSON handling because of the way it

754
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,369
handles these variables and such a type

755
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,879
saving way however you can use libraries

756
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:30,249
like swifty JSON in order to combat this

757
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:32,739
for you and very soon thanks to for

758
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:35,080
example what Chris Landers doing with

759
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,549
the Python we we should be getting the

760
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,609
dynamic callable and dynamic members the

761
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:42,969
dynamic member lookup into classes which

762
00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:44,589
will allow us to have even better JSON

763
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,279
handling very soon hopefully however for

764
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:51,519
now we do look we do create sort of ugly

765
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,149
code with what Swift has and then just a

766
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:57,159
pen that's Watson sentiments after that

767
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,869
I just print that out print up the

768
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:00,759
entire array actually just for debugging

769
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,499
purposes again the user never sees any

770
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:04,029
of the print statements just for the bug

771
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:05,259
and purposes it's always good to have

772
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:07,509
that there and then once the allow the

773
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,789
file request is done I then leave the

774
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,889
Watson group what that enables me to do

775
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,409
is enter every time something starts and

776
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:16,839
then leave when something ends when the

777
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,940
dispatch group sees that everything has

778
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,099
left and now there's nothing left to

779
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:23,679
leave and it will tell me everything's

780
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,259
done you can continue your code and so

781
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:29,259
that is that now outside of this for I

782
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:32,169
am tweets loop comes this interesting

783
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,690
part where we update the UI now of

784
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,219
course we want to go back to the main

785
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:37,749
thread we can do this as an asynchronous

786
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:39,580
thing tasks because we don't want to

787
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,929
sort of force ourselves with a

788
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,359
synchronous tasks but it's on the main

789
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,119
thread so we can update the UI now what

790
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,320
I'm doing is I'm actually creating

791
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,299
another asynchronous task inside of here

792
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:51,909
not not sort of not an asynchronous task

793
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:54,190
but I'm actually telling the Watson

794
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,149
group to notify this block of code right

795
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:01,119
as the Watson group has seen all of its

796
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,769
members leaf and so now there's nothing

797
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,749
left in the Watson group and I'm telling

798
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:06,549
you to run this on the main queue as

799
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:08,469
well so we probably don't need this but

800
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:10,899
to say on the safe side I'm doing it and

801
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:12,639
so I'm running some main queue so we can

802
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:14,360
update the UI within this

803
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,500
outright at this block of code is

804
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,270
executed and we're gonna do a few things

805
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,280
the first thing is we're going to keep

806
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,550
attract our cells of the chart data what

807
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,050
I mean by this is that we're going to

808
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,940
get the average or ever the average I

809
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,410
was talking about the array extension of

810
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,630
the Watts and sentiments and then we're

811
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,370
going to append that average over to

812
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,800
chart data now if the chart data count

813
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,690
is greater than 60 then we remove the

814
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,390
very first from that chart data and then

815
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,760
we remove all of the values from the

816
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,520
actual chart that's on screen and so

817
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,790
basically we remove older values as we

818
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,560
get newer values if there are more than

819
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,900
60 of them how do I do is I create a new

820
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,450
chart series chart seems as part of the

821
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,880
Swift charts library and I pass it the

822
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,830
array that we just created which is the

823
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,740
chart data array I tell it that the area

824
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,510
is true the chart series this really

825
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,670
doesn't matter to you and then from

826
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,580
there I add this chart series over to my

827
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,270
chart

828
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,040
I set the minimum y-coordinate to

829
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,590
negative 1 and the maximum Y to sorry

830
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,050
minimum Y to negative one maximum Y to

831
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,060
positive one and you know why if you've

832
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,470
watched why we're part of the video

833
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,960
because of nou sentiment being from a

834
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,510
range of negative one to one and then

835
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,970
from there I create a new timer this is

836
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,740
a scheduled time with a specific timer

837
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,660
interval in this case this is the global

838
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,450
variables sentiment refresh now this is

839
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,430
by default set to let's see how many

840
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,790
seconds this is set to 2.5 seconds and

841
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,640
the reason it's 2.5 not say 1 is so that

842
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,770
we can keep the quota and still get

843
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,920
relatively real-time results not to

844
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,570
repeat because it's basically telling

845
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,000
Swift all right after 2.5 seconds I see

846
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,620
here this block of code but don't

847
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,800
execute it every 2.5 seconds and that

848
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,270
from there all I do is I take this this

849
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,020
a which is the timer and then I tell it

850
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,720
I have an in the timer I execute the add

851
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,730
chart function which is the function

852
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,130
that this is in and of course at the end

853
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,420
here I do print out the Watson

854
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,130
sentiments and you already saw what

855
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,330
happens in the catch

856
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,100
now the reason this happens is basically

857
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,110
every time the add to chart function is

858
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,790
called it'll add one extra value to the

859
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,980
chart and then once it's done adding

860
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,320
everything to the chart then after that

861
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,480
2.5 seconds later it's going to add to

862
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,110
try together

863
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,150
the reason I implemented this feature is

864
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,980
because let's just say your internet

865
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,530
connection is bad or Watson slow or the

866
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,870
TWiT library's responding correctly and

867
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,000
it takes three seconds to get your chart

868
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,790
values and in that case you don't want

869
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,470
that before you got your first value

870
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,750
you've already created a task to get

871
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,750
your second set of values and so right

872
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,760
after those three seconds are done then

873
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,100
wait 2.5 seconds then get the next set

874
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,900
of values and hopefully it's not very

875
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,090
noticeable because it takes relatively

876
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,120
the same amount of time for each for

877
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,620
each query to go through in the first

878
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,370
place and so that is how the personality

879
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,360
works and so actually because Watson

880
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,770
takes care of all the machine learning

881
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,900
for us and I can the best part is that

882
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,730
we're using well machine learning

883
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,950
technology I'm just doing all right if

884
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,140
they use a bad keyword it's negative is

885
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,480
a positive keyword it's positive but

886
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,400
rather we're actually taking a look at

887
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,320
the true meaning and context of the

888
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,580
sentence itself vary from perspective

889
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,010
where we can actually understand natural

890
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,260
language that's the power of machine

891
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:34,740
learning

892
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,720
that's why Watson is so good I literally

893
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,340
have a hundred and four lines of code

894
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,020
and I've created an entire application

895
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,450
that grabs tweets bouncing through

896
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,640
machine learning software and does this

897
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,250
almost instantly on the cloud it's it's

898
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,679
just great from there that is the

899
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,390
outlier view controller this is sort of

900
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,860
where the interesting part comes in and

901
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,200
also there is one function that I did

902
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,760
forget to mention for the SP view

903
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,620
controller and that is view will

904
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,600
disappear the point of view will

905
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,970
disappear is basically the set run timer

906
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,090
to false and set the global variable

907
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,639
average sentiment to the average of the

908
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,500
Watson sentiments now the reason we do

909
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,570
this is because of two things first of

910
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,220
all let's just say you started the timer

911
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,210
task to look at your or not you started

912
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,510
right after we got a value we started

913
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,480
the timer to actually call at chart two

914
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,490
point five seconds later now for those

915
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,169
two point five seconds let's just say

916
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,600
you leave the view and in that case even

917
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,190
though you've left a view you're going

918
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,950
to be calling out a chart and on

919
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,290
necessarily wasting quota I'm looking

920
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,210
through the tweets and so if run timer

921
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,429
is false it will not run and there's

922
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,200
what will not call itself over and over

923
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,720
and over again so we can stop the loop

924
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,750
right there and also we set the global

925
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,159
variable average sentiment to the

926
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,510
average of the lots of sentiments

927
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,609
because of the planet simple fact that

928
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:54,560
let's just say you go to the outlier

929
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,050
view and in that case the outlier of you

930
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,329
need to know the average sentiment is in

931
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:01,940
order to give you what the outliers are

932
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,119
I'm getting over to the outliers this is

933
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,099
again a Twitter Timeline view controller

934
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:09,230
however there are a few differences is a

935
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,349
bit more complex so first of all what I

936
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:14,359
do is I take a look at a bunch of tweet

937
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,579
IDs or I create an array of a bunch of

938
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,589
different tweet IDs and I want to show

939
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:22,040
in my view in my my table view and then

940
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,130
I'd also create a dictionary of tweet ID

941
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,310
to sentiment is a string double because

942
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,869
the tweet IDs are stored in strings and

943
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:32,270
the sentiments are stored in doubles and

944
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,180
I also set a variable which is max

945
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,560
tweets which is the number of tweets

946
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,410
that I want to look at and of course

947
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,319
a local variable and so if we were to

948
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:46,349
scroll down here we can see that we do

949
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,789
not indeed he was that local variable

950
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:49,530
all right perfect

951
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,349
so next up in the viewdidload function

952
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,059
the first thing that I do is I call to

953
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,240
get tweeks function now this this this

954
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,609
class also has its own get tweets

955
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:02,430
function which is right over here

956
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,549
now this get get tweets function it's

957
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:06,960
actually quite special and the reason it

958
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,930
special is because it's also slightly

959
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,480
recursive what that means is that see

960
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,339
when you search for tweets on Twitter

961
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,470
it'll give you a few results at a time

962
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,530
say 10 points at a time in one response

963
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,660
and then when it says is alright if you

964
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,299
want more responses then what you have

965
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:27,359
to do is you have to use this ID and

966
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,990
then call the API again with that ID and

967
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,720
we'll give you the next page results and

968
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,960
so basically the next results here is an

969
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,030
optional string if you're calling get

970
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,190
tweets for the first time then you don't

971
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,599
want to give next results because it's

972
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,920
the first set of results that you're

973
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,319
getting however it get tweets as calling

974
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:47,819
itself to get the next page of results

975
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:49,829
that's what it's actually going to fill

976
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:52,890
out that variable now of course this is

977
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,099
mostly the same content as last time but

978
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,660
I'll go through a little bit of it just

979
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,460
so you get a good idea of course I

980
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,549
declared error at a new URL request and

981
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:06,630
I check is next results nil if it is not

982
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,809
then I set its value in to next page

983
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:12,349
which is of course dumb if let's name it

984
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:15,779
if if indeed we do have a next results

985
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:18,150
page and what I do is I tell the Twitter

986
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,130
client to create a URL request for me of

987
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,410
course the get method however this time

988
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,950
not only do I provide the tweets a JSON

989
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,750
but I tell it I'm looking for the next

990
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,450
page and of course from there I tell it

991
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,980
I don't want any parameters because I

992
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,700
don't need me

993
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,650
and I provided a pointer to the error of

994
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,660
just in case there is one however if

995
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,789
there is no next results page then we do

996
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,410
the exact same thing as we did in the

997
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,089
sentiment view controller by providing

998
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:43,980
the parameters of the session query and

999
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,990
we want the most recent tweets but in

1000
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,220
this case we also tell it that the

1001
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,500
amount of tweets we want are the outlier

1002
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,069
tweets

1003
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:51,450
and so of course we don't need max

1004
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,310
tweets because we use the

1005
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,860
variable without liner tweets there we

1006
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,870
go of course we do give it the network

1007
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,110
pointer as well and so this is where the

1008
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,240
intro nothing interesting the same part

1009
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,570
comes in the Watson group in order to

1010
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,970
tell when everything is done and then we

1011
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,410
send our Twitter requests over to

1012
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,420
Twitter we look for the response in the

1013
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,220
error and the data we print out the

1014
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,690
error if there is any or the localized

1015
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,850
description of it we go ahead and parse

1016
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,400
out the data from Twitter and then what

1017
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,410
I do is first of all is I create a new

1018
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,320
variable for the next results page if

1019
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,110
there is a next results page then I said

1020
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,740
it or I put its value into the next

1021
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,710
results page variable after that what I

1022
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,840
do is I loop through all of the

1023
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,670
different tweets every time I loop

1024
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,860
through a tweet I enter the Watson group

1025
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,710
and I create a new variable or constant

1026
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,600
called tweet text or just equal to that

1027
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,030
specific tweets text and then we do the

1028
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,620
exact same thing as we did last time

1029
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,540
with Watson we create the credential

1030
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,370
data and we create no fire request to

1031
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,280
access Watson now once we can respond so

1032
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,290
we do something slightly different of

1033
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,360
course we still parse the sentiment but

1034
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,250
then what I do is I get the absolute

1035
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,460
value of the average sentiment minus the

1036
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,010
current tweet sentiment now if I

1037
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,220
actually get this value and of course I

1038
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,900
also do get the absolute value of this

1039
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,700
average sentiment and the absolute value

1040
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,950
of the sentiment itself before I get the

1041
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,310
absolute value of them negated and the

1042
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,500
reason I do this because I always want a

1043
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,210
positive number I don't want positives

1044
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,950
negatives combined because all I'm

1045
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,170
looking for is a difference right like

1046
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,660
for example how far off is this

1047
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,700
sentiment from the average sentiment now

1048
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,550
if this difference if this difference

1049
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,160
number is greater than the sensitivity

1050
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,690
which is a global variable that's

1051
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,990
adjustable then in that case a pen the

1052
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,870
ID of this tweet to self doctrine is and

1053
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:50,400
also set this tweet IDs sentiment in the

1054
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,490
tweet sense variable or dictionary to

1055
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,060
the sentiment now of course if there is

1056
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,910
no sort of sentiment or if the sentiment

1057
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,700
is very close or it's not part of the

1058
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,980
sensitivity then in that case we just

1059
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,390
append a blank tweet

1060
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,670
d and then we leave the Watson group

1061
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,360
that's how that works now of course we

1062
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,220
still do the same Watson group notify on

1063
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,730
main right thing right as or actually

1064
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,230
now that I think about it we do need

1065
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,600
backs tweets because max tweets what

1066
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,950
it's going to allow us to do is this you

1067
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,080
see with max tweets we can see exactly

1068
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,350
how many tweets we want to check in

1069
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,620
terms of tweet IDs and so if we would

1070
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,570
say if self that we are used our count

1071
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,000
is less than self that max tweets and

1072
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,060
the next results Peters nothing meaning

1073
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,730
in essence that we've collected you know

1074
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,510
we have not collected the maximum of our

1075
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,750
tweets and there's still a next page to

1076
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,240
go to because it's not blank then in

1077
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,760
that case call get tweets all over again

1078
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,400
and tell that the next results page is

1079
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,110
an extra salt page that we had already

1080
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,140
gathered however if there is no next

1081
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,720
results page or if we've reached the

1082
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,030
maximum number of tweets then go ahead

1083
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,130
and print out all the trade IDs and

1084
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:14,550
while this tweet IDs contains blank

1085
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,590
meaning that while there is a blank

1086
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,990
string inside of tweet IDs they can go

1087
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,960
ahead and remove each of those blank

1088
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,510
tweet id's and of course just for

1089
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,280
debugging purposes print out the while

1090
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,570
just to make sure we're not getting into

1091
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,000
an infinite while loop after that print

1092
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,800
out the tweet IDs once more create out

1093
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,720
the sentiments for each tweet ID and

1094
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,080
then call a create collection function a

1095
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,390
great collection is actually the sort of

1096
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,850
graphic part basically what we do here

1097
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,600
is create the Twitter requests to

1098
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,490
actually get the text for each and every

1099
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,340
tweet or the actual you know tweet

1100
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,060
itself another I do is I go ahead and

1101
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,370
run a bunch of logic that'll allow us to

1102
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,950
put all of the tweets that we gathered

1103
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:03,870
into the actual into the actual view

1104
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,030
controllers table view now the way I do

1105
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,850
this is by creating a tweet collection

1106
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,470
now what's a tweet collection you may

1107
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,290
ask basically what I do is I take a

1108
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,840
bunch of tweet IDs and I tell Twitter

1109
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,600
create a collection out of these IDs now

1110
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,270
the collection is label

1111
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,160
under the users account since they

1112
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,250
logged in now the collection also has a

1113
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,670
custom identification ID which is given

1114
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,480
to us as well right here now once that

1115
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,610
collection is created and we have the ID

1116
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,550
we're able to go ahead and tell Twitter

1117
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,280
to use that collection as a data source

1118
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,530
and cause very unfortunately the Twitter

1119
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,840
can sdk hasn't just allow me to pass a

1120
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,850
bunch of tween IDs to use as a data

1121
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,110
source that's definitely a

1122
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,030
recommendation that I have for them to

1123
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,700
add into their SDK so I have to go

1124
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,890
through all of this code to create a

1125
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,840
collection and then use that collection

1126
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,810
as a data source but anyway at least I'm

1127
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,170
able to so I take that collection give

1128
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,520
it over to the Twitter collection

1129
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,530
timeline data source and set the

1130
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:08,420
self-taught theya source over to it and

1131
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,760
that new self dot refresh and there we

1132
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,310
go we refresh the table view and we're

1133
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,850
good to go now of course there are a few

1134
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,410
things that you can experiment with like

1135
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,840
for example if you can use touches began

1136
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,290
to just move with force ID in order to

1137
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,970
create a more advanced version but

1138
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,550
that's for version two of course there

1139
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,230
is just a little utility function called

1140
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,030
random string which is used to create

1141
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,410
IDs over here as well have how finally

1142
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,510
very simple the settings view controller

1143
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,130
which allows us to have a refreshed

1144
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,590
slider a sensitivity slider and a tweet

1145
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,960
slider so we can actually set each and

1146
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,730
every one of those variables when we do

1147
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,380
the viewdidload we set those sliders

1148
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,570
values to the actual global variables

1149
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,400
values and what we do view will

1150
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,470
disappear we set those global variables

1151
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,590
values to the values of those sliders so

1152
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,390
every time you close the view you set

1153
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,220
the values of the global variables every

1154
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,230
time you low the view you you actually

1155
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,970
get the values of the global variables

1156
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,630
and put them into your sliders so that

1157
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,670
was all the code that went behind T soma

1158
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,830
now that you understand it of course all

1159
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,240
the code will be available in the

1160
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,890
description below so you can download it

1161
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,900
and use it yourself and expand it to

1162
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,260
really whatever you'd like it to me it's

1163
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,180
time for a little more it's time for a

1164
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,850
demo of T soma in action let's take a

1165
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,430
look alright so as you can see this is T

1166
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,220
soma open up on my iPhone so let's go

1167
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,600
ahead and begin by logging in with

1168
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,230
Twitter

1169
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,790
I'm going to click login to Twitter and

1170
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,350
as you can see it forwards me to my

1171
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,300
Twitter application I can click the

1172
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,280
connect button on the bottom right and I

1173
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,680
can go ahead and open T so I back up T

1174
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,390
cell I realized the session has been

1175
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,180
created and allows me to enter my search

1176
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,760
query now let's just say my search query

1177
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,330
is hashtag or actually at Apple or

1178
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,750
actually you know let's go hashtag wEDC

1179
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,740
WWDC there we go

1180
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,380
because WBC is coming up June 4th and is

1181
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,810
currently June 2nd or well though June

1182
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,910
3rd technically so I'm going to click on

1183
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,430
let's start there we go let's begin by

1184
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,650
seeing some tweets just so we can take a

1185
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,780
look at some of the tweets alright so as

1186
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,250
you can see some people are arriving at

1187
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,430
WWDC there are few different banners

1188
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,300
people are tweeting about what to expect

1189
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,760
their wish lists all this kind of stuff

1190
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,480
so let's just go back that let's head

1191
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,430
over to sentiment now this is exactly

1192
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,619
what we want to see what do people think

1193
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:33,920
about WWDC let's find out alright so as

1194
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,210
you can see generally people are

1195
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,400
positive in fact for the next minute I'm

1196
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,170
gonna keep this going see if we get any

1197
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,970
real-time activity and we're gonna

1198
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,040
actually fast-forward this so you don't

1199
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,170
need to sit through tea soma actually

1200
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,460
cutting through all the data

1201
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,300
all right as you can see not enough

1202
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,670
people are tweeting about WWDC for us to

1203
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,830
see anything in real time however if

1204
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,570
they were really able to see real-time

1205
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,150
updates of this graph as the tweets were

1206
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,430
happening if you were just to choose a

1207
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,770
topic that's currently trending it would

1208
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,560
oh there we go it moved so now of course

1209
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,690
let's just say Apple releases something

1210
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,270
at WEC someone doesn't like this we'll

1211
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,280
definitely go down but now we've

1212
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,170
realized that the average sentiment is

1213
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,120
positive and so of course some people

1214
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,970
are going to have negative reactions so

1215
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,920
let's go back and see some of the

1216
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,990
negative reactions as you can see this

1217
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,450
is all the tweets let's go ahead and

1218
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,790
wait for it to to filter alright there

1219
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:37,310
we go as you can see it is filtered and

1220
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,020
now it's showing things that are really

1221
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,580
positive like for example as you can see

1222
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,100
mr. Bies seeing the dark mode of Xcode

1223
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,090
10 and Mac OS it's name is unknown so

1224
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:51,200
far which actually does look great but

1225
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,530
that's extremely positive and so because

1226
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,180
it's so positive and because it is

1227
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,520
abnormally positive it's showing us that

1228
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,240
outlying tweet so is Diddy's and of

1229
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,150
course lots of other people as well now

1230
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,830
if we go back we might be able to get

1231
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,230
more relevant or rest less relevant

1232
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,180
tweets if we go to the settings and

1233
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,440
adjust the sensitivity

1234
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,840
maybe we search more tweets and let's

1235
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,330
just crank up the sensitivity a little

1236
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,870
bit to get even more farther away tweets

1237
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,960
so now let's wait maybe five seconds and

1238
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,300
we should get a result we shouldn't see

1239
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,470
there we go as you can see the

1240
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,240
sensitivity was just too high

1241
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,820
if I go back however and if I set the

1242
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,820
sensitivity a bit lower maybe we should

1243
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,850
be able to see maybe some less sort of

1244
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:41,390
outlying tweets maybe less abnormal wait

1245
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,520
for a few seconds now ah there we go

1246
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,460
so as you can see we are still getting

1247
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,410
some but some that are extremely

1248
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,960
positive in fact I can actually tell

1249
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,670
there are barely any negative tweets

1250
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,410
about tell you to me VC am not

1251
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,300
surprising but yeah there are barely any

1252
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,700
negative tweets which proves that t7

1253
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,010
works alright so that was a quick demo

1254
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,740
of T Silva in action I do hope you

1255
