hey everyone welcome back to the channel
in today's video we are diving deep into
the world of react and focusing on a
fundamental concept that plays a crucial
role in building Dynamic and interactive
user interfaces react props I know many
of you have been curious about how props
work and why they are so essential in
react development well you're in the
right place because in this video we are
going to unravel the mysteries of react
props and break down the concept in
detail it's not just going to be Theory

link in the description box should
navigate to the homepage where you can
find a complete overview of the program
being offered so let's start with the
first topic which is what are react
components in react components
communicate with each other using props
think of props as special messages or
data that one component sends to another
these props allow components to share
customized informations like values or
pieces of data the word props is short
for properties which are basically the
data or information of something in
react props represent the specific
details or attributes that one
components want to share with another
remember props or properties only make
sense within the context of components
in other words you need components in
order to use props effectively props
help components talk to each other and
exchange information making it easier to
build Dynamic and interactive user
interfaces in react so now let's first
make a parent and a child component then
we will link them so let's go to visual
studio all right so this is our visual
studio now here we will first of all
create a parent component so app.js we
have named it parent component all right
so first of all we'll
import react from
react all right so now we will create a
function
app now inside this function we will
return so this is a syntax so as you can
see now let's say we want to Let's
create a d first of
all now div is for
multiple objects or attributes I repeat
so now div is for multiple things so as
of now we will inside the div we will
write let's
say
image as of now we'll write image only
then after that we will add other things
so here I have zoomed in a bit so that
it is easily visible for you guys so as
of now let's export it export
default app all right now this is a
parent component as of now all right now
we will link it with child components
for for that we'll have to create a
child component so we have named a child
component as pitcher. jsx all right so
let's let's start creating this child
component so here also we'll do
input react from
react All Right Now
function let's say picture is the name
of the
function all right now here we will
return now inside it we will first of
all
write inside Dev
again all right now inside this like
inside div we will write a title and
then we'll write an image we'll attach
an image so H2 let's
say so we write a
beautiful
sunset all right now after this an image
will
attach all right now what we'll have to
do now
sources there's a source I've
written so you can pick the image of
your
own landscape let's name
it
then style this is this is basically
what we are doing is CSS so in CSS we'll
have to do double curly
bra all right inside double qu Braes
let's say
width is 300
pixels
all right so here is closed so uh this
is the title and this is the image now
we will this is the child component as
if we know so we'll export it export
default picture all right so now in
order to use it in the parent component
we'll have to import it over there so
basically what we'll do is we'll simply
import it by writing import picture from
picture
okay
put picture
from so now here we'll use do slash so
because we want to locate it do
slash
picture all right now here after H1 we
can just use the can write the
name of the component
so piure this is how you write a
component
and now we'll save it so basically what
we are doing is we are just using this
whole code over here by including this
name with a backs slash so this is a
component that we are using inside the
app. jss this is a picture component we
are using it inside app.js now let's
save it and let's see so let's just
click on it as we can see a beautiful
sunset again it is not a sunset but yeah
we can see this image that we have given
the H1 tag and as if we can see H1 and
this picture inside picture what we are
doing is there is
a heading that is a beautiful sunset we
can let's just change it let's write
uh beautiful Valley yeah let's write
valy all right now again as we can see
there is heading H2 in h2 tag this one
and then there is image so basically
with the help of components we are using
it inside the div after image tag now
after this we can also pass props to the
child component that we will have a look
afterwards so in react we use a cool
feature that lets us easily repeat a
design without using a bunch of cod so
let's say if I'm just just copying it
and paste
it four times and save it again so we
will see four images and captions are
there the headings are there so imagine
you have a product card on a website and
you want to show different products
without typing out the details each time
so as we can see in the picture these
are the same products or same pictures
but what if we want a different products
so with react we can set up the designs
once and then just update the product
name price description and image without
getting into the Integrity of the code
it's like having the template for
displaying products and we only need to
change the specific details for each
item without messing around with a lot
of complicated code this way updating or
adding new products becomes a breeze and
we keep things nice and organized
without hard coding everything as you
can see now we have hardcoded it but we
don't have to we can change each and
every
uh details of this image all right so
this is where props come into the
picture and for that we have to
understand how to use
props so how to use props so react
follows a oneway data flow approach this
simply implies that information is
transferred exclusively from parent
component to its child components
additionally it's crucial to note that
any data sent from parent component
Remains unalterable by the child
component
in Practical terms this means that a
data will move from
app.js acting as the parent component to
picture. JS which functions as the child
component as we did this unidirectional
flow of data ensures a structured and
predictable interaction between
different parts of react application so
now let's understand passing props to
components so in HTML when you want to
add special instruction to an input box
you can use attributes for instance if
you want your friend to bring you a red
balloon you might say red in the
instruction and the balloon is like the
input element similarly in react when
you want to give Specific Instructions
or information to a component you use
props it's like telling your friend
additional details but in react World
you attach these details to component
much like attaching attributes to an
HTML element inside the component tag
after specifying component's name we
assign a value to each property as you
can see component name prop equals value
we can also use multiple props that is
multiple values also as you can see prop
one value one prop two value two prop
three value three so it's up to us all
right now this was about passing props
to components now let's understand how
to read props inside the child
components this is how you can pass
props from parents now we will
understand how to read props in the
child
components to read the props in inside
the child component you have to simplify
and include the names of the props they
are listed inside the curly braces right
after the function name so when you see
something like function name and person
like this example function then function
name that is bike then name and mileage
name and mileage is inside the CRA so
when you see something like name mileage
or any other name inside the C braces it
means you can find and use the values
inside the component it's a simple way
to organize and pass information to the
function so this is how you receive or
read props inside the child components
now let's understand it with the help of
a fine
example all right so again we are on vs2
code now we will modify this code and
understand how we can pass props from
parent component to child component we
will understand the functionality so for
that let's just just remove these or we
can also keep these as it is all right
now we'll go to picture. jsx so this is
a child component we'll also have to
modify this so but let's start with the
parent component
itself all right so as we can see H1
image so we'll keep it as it is now
inside this components we'll first of
all pass the attributes so let's say the
first attribute is title so we want the
title so let's say first is uh
beautiful value all right so this is our
first attribute that is title so as we
have already understood that we can also
pass multiple attributes right so this
is a second attribute image
URL now inside this we'll use an image
URL so as of now we I have some image
URLs that I have kept so I can use
this just copy paste it again in a
similar way we'll do another one I'll
just copy paste it so we can save some
time all right so I've copy pasted it
and changed this URL that is the image
URL and the title that is a beautiful
sunset now again we can copy
this and go to another one now here what
we'll do is we'll write let's say Hills
in the
night all right so again we'll have to
copy
paste we just copy pasting it because we
need to save time nothing else all right
so now we'll write Green
Forest
all right so this is the image URL and
this is the title so we are done with
this now we can just save it so here
what we are doing is we're passing these
attributes to the child component this
is the component picture we are passing
these attributes to this child component
but here we have to read those
attributes which the parent component is
passing for that what we'll do is we
will receive props as you can see props
now we'll change this hardcode data that
is a static data to the dynamic one this
images this title also so how we will do
that we'll use the title prop to display
a custom title so what we'll do is we'll
write inside the curly places
GSX we write
props dot
title all right so the title is this one
title beautiful value so this now
becomes Dynamic it will
automatically update over here so this
is the dynamic data now all right
similarly we'll do for image tag as well
so as we can see SRC so this this is the
static this is not Dynamic right this is
the hardcode so we want it to be dynamic
so what we'll do is we'll write the same
way as we did upwards so curly
braces now inside curly braces what
we'll do is props do image
URL all right so this is the second
attribute image URL props do image URL
so now it becomes the dynamic this is no
longer hard code all right so we can
keep it as it is CSS and all and let's
try to save
it all right so let's see everything is
fine or not now let's see if it is
working or not let's save it so as you
can see uh a beautiful Valley a
beautiful Sunset Hills in the night uh
it is not visible we'll have to figure
it out a green forest so now it is a
dynamic data simply what we are doing is
we are using this code only and we are
passing these attributes from the parent
to the child component so the child
component is updating the title this
props image this also that is the image
also and we are simply using the
components we have used the same
component but we have changed the
details or the information or the data
so this is how you can pass the props
from parent component to a child
component all right now let's understand
destructuring props in JavaScript
there's a handy thing called d
structuring imagine you have a bunch of
data in an object or array and you want
to pull out specific pieces and store
them in a separate variables now in
react which uses JavaScript when we are
working with objects called props here's
what you do first group your properties
using curly braces you can then either
put them into variable name props inside
your function or just directly use them
as functions input so as you can see in
this example this props that this child
component is receiving then we are
destructuring it into the variables that
is being passed from the parent
component as you can see the variables
are color name mileage price so these
are the attributes that is being pass
from the parent to the child components
now the child components is
destructuring these attributes so that
we can use them as it is instead of
using props do color props do name we
can simply use their name that is color
name mileage
Etc now for the second step to use these
properties where you need them just
mention their names without using props
before each one so as we have done this
so we don't no longer have to use props
do color props do name
Etc so the second thing you can do is
like this example function product this
is the function name and after that
simply you have done is instead of using
props you simply pass the attributes
image name description price and then
you can use it further so in a nutshell
destructuring in react is like picking
out the bits you need from a bunch of
data and using them easily in your code
so this makes our code more readable and
concise so this was about destructuring
and about react props so in this video
we have delved into the fundamental
concepts of react DRS understanding
their role in a component communication
through Hands-On examples we have seen
how props enhance flexibility and
usability in our react applications now
equipped with this knowledge you're
ready to leverage props effectively in
your own projects all right guys with
