foreign
and in this video we will be creating a
YouTube clone but before we begin if you
haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and press the Bell icon so you
will never miss any update from Simply
learn so without further Ado let's begin
and see what's in it for you so here we
are going to create a YouTube clone with
react.js but before we jump to the
coding part let's see how the YouTube
page looks like
let's see
here
as you can see
there is a navbar upstairs where you
have your logo
after that there is a upload button the
Bell icon notification button
and that mic button in the search bar
and it's written here the YouTube
and in this you will find
home Explorer shots subscribe original
YouTube music and all other things
so let's jump to the coding part and
create the YouTube clone as it is
so open your Visual Studio code
to create this YouTube clone you must
have node.js installed in your system
so let's just open one folder or just
type control
plastic and inside that write a command
in PX
create
react
and then the folder name that you want
to create
I'll write U to
flow
press enter it'll take couple of minutes
to install all the packages
so let's wait for few minutes
it'll take a couple of minutes to
install all the modules
before until it's get complete let's see
the YouTube clone again
so we'll have this
videos
and here we'll write this
I'll write this
okay cool
let's go back to our Visual Studio code
and let's wait a couple of minutes more
so
a folder is
created
so let's go to this folder
to do that I have written a command CD
YouTube clone and then I'll hit enter
inside this I will write
npm start to see how project is working
or not
so our react app is working fine
let's go back to our code
and open this
after opening the YouTube project that
we have created
let me zoom in a little for you
let's make it safe
after going to this let's open the
app.js file
inside this let's delete this header and
let's see it's working fine
hello
from CPU
learn and let's remove the react logo
save this file inside this let's
delete all the CSS part let's save this
also
and now let's run this control Buffet
and that's right
start
let's see election hello
yes
here
we will write
can
let's add another one
and we write NTM I
installed react router
Dom
let's install this
meanwhile let's create a folder or let's
create a file here
the
thought she is
and
a header dot CSS
hit enter
inside this header.js let's burst
delete this
and this we will write
Center
and then save it
let's find compilation error so let's
work on this first
let's cut this
chart
inside this header bar
let's import first the react
import react from
here
this will install all the modules or
dependencies that we need
but before that let's add the header
here
inside this we'll write import
header
from
and then the
fit
now let's just save this file
let's go back to our
header.js file and in this file
just a second
yes
inside this file
let's go
let's create a function here first
inside the function hit the
now inside this header function
we will return
inside this will create it there
the class name
Shader
said this
so just check
will write something in
H1 tag
hello
from Simply learn
let's save it
and showing some error
because we have to export it
we have imported the header inside this
app.js
but we haven't
export this header so in the last
write export
default
in the
file name which is
header now let's save it and as you can
see it's showing
hello from simpler
so going back to our code
let's
open up
CSS page
inside this we'll write some basic CSS
properties that we are going to fetch in
this head.js file
so let's write some approaches
let's give it all a padding
we can do this after a while also but I
have loaded somewhere so let's just give
it a try of giving
all
sizing border box
after that we'll give it the outline of
no
after that let's save this and inside
this header.js let's delete this and
inside this
will write
header after that
we'll write the clicks
after that we will write a line
we are going to give the property to
these in the app.js file but before that
you have to declare it here so we are
going to write a line
items
sent
will give justify content
two images right just if I contend
and then the space between
after that in the next line
will give it another
class name
item
of that EP Flex
and then again the line
buttons Center
and the height of Max 30.
and x y
save it
okay
that's now in this part
we'll write it
right
let's
first we're going to create a menu bar
here
these three lines part we are going to
create first after that we will create
this YouTube logo and this premium ion
so let's go back to our code
inside this let's give this a good class
name
of menu bar only
bye
insert this will break
hpg
inside this
the fuse box should be
0 0 24 and 24
let's forget this let's copy this from
the YouTube only
let's delete it
you have to go to here hit inspect
inside this
will copy this part
we'll copy this
let's see
let's go over this
let's find it here only
SVG
that's
clear element
let's paste it here
and then see as
it's pasted here but for that
you need to form a document
to your code
is fine
so it's looking good
now
what we have to do is
we have to save it
let's see
we have to add some CSS more properties
let's
add some properties here that we have
declared in the header.js file
we have created
this let's go start with the
body part of this
go to 40 give it a width of 100
after that we'll go
and color
that would be white only
but let's skip it
after that click the fonts and view of
and
let's now go to
six file
now
first let's add the CSS properties in
app.css file
let's complete this first and then we'll
move on to the header bar
so it will be inside it only so let's
do it first
like
overflow
Maybe
after that
one says
the
let's make it as two different fields
after that
let's try the white
inside this little color so we will
write white it will fetch this
now let's do it for
black also
wherever we'll call this black
it will fetch this
zero zero zero as you know
so we'll go back to the container
everything stores so we'll make this
container as
so very tough 80 percent
and then the margin should be
of zero percent
and then we'll make it as photo so we
can switch the screen like in Facebook
YouTube
as we can
do this in this it'll reduce the size
according to the desktop
so we can do that here also
so let's go back to another
we have floated the D flick
it's you can confirm yeah
I wrote one only so we
style this
the flex
let's make it as click
after that it should be enough
let's go to
line
items
Center
let's head from this also
yes
inside this
will give it a line items
Center
after that
we'll justify
just if I contend
face enter
space between
now let's check it
okay now just
put the flex length in the justification
space between
cool so we'll do the Justified content
inside it space
between
after that
we have also
got Justified content
piece between and then the center one
inside this we'll write justify content
then Center
after that
we have wrote
nothing as of now but let's go to this
save it
and let's see
a file
display here right now let's go back to
this
and let's edit this
in this style part let's cut this
because we have made The Styling there
and let's not give it a width of 100
let's give it over 30 percent
30 pixel would be fine
this should come under crickets
so
okay
should we get it
okay
this should come on the brackets
no it's fine
no
thanks
okay afterwards
will also include the height of this
so it would be
it's all comes in the
under this let's scale with height of 30
pixels in this also
come under wickets
after that let's check it
let's say this file
and as you can see
it's showing
like this only
let's
switch and then
so
we are back to the we need to give it a
padding so it will come here
let's do that let's decrease the size of
this first
I think we should decrease it but let's
see
foreign this is fine but let's
give it a try
yeah it's fine
okay let's
move forward
now
let's make it as this cursor as a
pointer because whenever it goes to this
YouTube sign or this 3D lens it will go
to pointer
so let's make it as whenever it rolls
over this or any of these it should be
as pointer
let's go to our code
and let's write here in the class
0.2
icon
let's save it
first we need to add the CSS file here
for that we'll write import
and then the start and then Flash and
then the file name the file name is
header.css
let's close this
it's not fetching it let's see
why
okay we haven't given it in the brackets
okay fine
let's save it
let's give it a styling here first
inside this
save it
inside this
inside this
and give the bedding of
zero plus seven
and then the second should be 15 pixel
let's save it
and see
is it working
yeah
as you can see whenever we go here
it's going from Sir cursor to pointer
okay fine
now
let's move on to the next part
which is the logo
after that
we'll create a logo here
logo
inside this logo
will write
now we go again to YouTube
and then again search for their SVG if
this has
okay
I think it have the 3G
oh
let's find it
here only
inside this
3G
let's copy
and let's go back to our code
let's paste it here
it's have pasted as a junk part
so let's delete it and again go back
here
and copy it manually
[Music]
let's
copy the element
and add to our code let's paste it
here again
it's just
here for my document
and as you can see it's coming
right
so let's see the logo again
okay everything's
coming right
in the Styles part
let's delete this line and let's
copy this from here
and let's paste it
here
let's save it
as you can see
it's coming but it's coming a very
short so let's edit it here only
[Music]
let's increase the size of this YouTube
premium button
go to the style in this
60 would be a little bit let's do it the
more
75 be fine yes
it's coming right
let's start with fine
we'll give it a padding but after a
while because let's create a basic
structure of a header then we can just
style it
okay
let's first give it a anchor tag so when
we'll click on this
it can be clickable
okay
let's give it a pointer also
inside the class
inside it will write
enter again let's save it
as you can see
you have to make it
give The Styling in this part let's do
it after a while
but before that let's
attack
and save this logo
and create a
guitar
and make it as empty now
good
so while
after this let's close it
now let's save it so whenever we click
on this premium button and we'll go to
another page
let's move ahead
inside this let's
give it
styling
inside this let's
put a menu bar
inside this let's give it a bedding
foreign
[Music]
pixels
which should come in there
10 pixels let's save it
and see
okay
foreign
[Music]
we need to give padding from here also
let's first give it the bedding in the
header
items that we have saved here
okay
that's a box
let's see
this
that's what we can give it a little bit
of 100
it will declare it inside this
now
coming back to header.js file
create
here
first let's now we'll create we are
creating a search bar
okay let's
name of
header
Rod items
after that we will give it
The Flicks content space
align Center
yes
or we can just give it this
so we don't want to give it as left
so let's save it
in here because I haven't
close this one
now
inside this
device
off input box
foreign
type of that would be take
inside the text
will write
again let's
class name would be
search box
that's called
after that
to write
search inside this will you will have
the use of
placeholder
with the help of placeholder
we can write anything inside this so
let's write search
that let's close this
after that
let's save it
let's see it's coming
like this only but it's having uh we can
change it after a while
let's lit
it's coming okay
let's go back
to our code
and inside this let's give it
uh
let's create another Dev
inside this we will write class name
let's search
inbox
okay
and then you can just copy it from here
also
and then Center
and then
justify content Center
[Music]
okay fine
let's first just
close this and now let's save it
okay fine
now
we need to
have the SVD file here
so we'll copy it from the YouTube
let's see inspect coming back to our
code
let's remove this
save it
let's do some styling here
inside this
let's give it
height
oh this would be fine let's go again
further
let's get that and put
a box that we have created right now the
search box
let's give it a vertical
100 percent
after that let's be preparing of
0 pixels and 20 pixels
receive it
so after that
let's go to
input box we have done
let's see
let's now go to good
search box
here
we'll give it a width of
100
after that
and give it a height of 50 pixels
moving ahead
we'll give it a border of one pixels
solid
or we need light but let's
for now
okay let's give it a light color 607d
I have wrote it down
this color scheme
8B and 0. let's save it
as you can see it's much lighter now as
you can see here will decrease the size
of search here
after a while and we need to also need
to decrease the size of this
part we can do it after a while and
we'll create a structure
let's
give it a margin
0 pixels and it should be 10 pixels
let's see first it is more so we'll give
it
fine yeah it's fine for now
and let's give it a bad thing
foreign
and
then pixels would be fine yes
after that will come to the search box
inside this search box
will give it over top
for the pixels
after that will give it a high top 40
again
it should be inherit or let's make it as
one proceed
after that the top pending should be
of 30 pixels or 30 percent whichever is
fine
let's save it it's not
so let's do it should be zero percent
for now
you can change the stylings after a
while
by just creating a
structure
solid
let's just delete it and just copy it
from here
inside it here
after that
okay fine it's fine
now let's save it
it's not showing the importance it is
[Music]
let's see
what we have not
registration
uh-huh
background color is white only
let's see
okay let's even
Fox comes here
let's reduce the size of speed of box
think it's
activated the same let's make it guys
25
inside this
it's all fine
foreign
as we can see here
30 is fine you need to reduce the size
but we can do it afterwards let's see 30
is fine but let's make it as
28 for more per section okay
let's move on to the high end
I don't imagine is this
I think it's
important
[Music]
let's save it
okay no we don't need that
big thing question only
okay
and the box and it should be more than
it's fine but let's
pockets and
increase the size of the search
foreign
this
so let's move it here
let's not give it a little bit
20 would be fine okay now
not this
let's see here
the question would be fine
in the head we can reduce the width
and the extra padding that we have given
you can reduce that
so let's start with that only
this one is inside the box that's
and box
let's say 10 only
okay A little quick side
let's see
okay
let's not give it
a question
[Music]
not remote in this okay
let's now give it the height is fine
everything looks fine
but let's see
what is the mistake
let's move on
inside this
let's make it as a little short
because it's a very long part
to reduce the
this
no word
let's reduce it a little more let's
50
oh okay fine it's well now
let's make it as
or let's do that 36
foreign
now we'll move forward
with this
now coming back to our JS file
let's go
now let's open our header file
now inside this part
we will write a SVG
okay we can copy it from YouTube we need
to do it
like this we need to add this search box
for that we will inspect
and here
we can find the SVG
it's coming for for all
but we need
it's the icons so let's
copy this
copy this from here
and then let's paste it here then format
document
here let's delete the style of
U2 and let's add the style that we have
created earlier
copy this from here
in this place added
make it as 15.
and then let's save it and see
okay fine it's coming right but let's
give it 20 pixels
then you can do pixel again
this would be a little big let's
make it as 15 only
but it's coming a little this side so
let's reduce the bedding
then
it is fine
because let's first make it does
pointer
so whenever we go here it should be
yes like this
or like this
so let's
start to our code
and inside the code
will also need to do some styling
foreign
so we have created our search box here
so let's move ahead
let's now create a
volume button
for that let's create it a Dev class
last name would be
voice search
let's skip it always
inside
again I will go back
inside
let's create
okay let's copy it from here
let's inspect here first
inside this we need to
go to this
button
and save this
we can find
the SVG
let's copy this element
and let's face it here now we need to
format document
and it's
fine
let's save it
and let's see
let's now
change the style
and let's delete it and let's copy it
one of the previous and we are following
so let's paste this guy here
okay
let's again copy
again let's paste it here
and insert this let's make it a pointer
save it
as you can see it's coming right
okay fine let's do some editing here
and set this glass
let's
do the voice part
of heading all
let's do it
let's give it the flex
the flick
we have to go to earlier
line item
Center
let's save it
okay fine
now we need to change the positioning
here
all right
let's size
let's change this
okay fine it's fine
foreign
paste it inside this
box and later we'll just save it
okay
let's see the issue
inside it let's talk back okay
same thing
let's cut this from here this voice part
let's
let's record this from here and
paste it here
okay
let's now do here some edit things
because
it's not coming right
you know
okay
so we need not have to write this inside
this inbox related so let's cut it in
save it so it's looking fine now
now let's move to the next part of this
which is the header right
so after this
there let's see
we'll create another
class
let's now create a class right there
Class E
the class name will be
header
right
after that okay
line
items Center
off the blunt
we can
go to another create another class name
let's give it a class name create
options
inside this create options we will write
this SVG
foreign
let's cut it first
inspect
and this let's copy this
it's very easy right
let's save it and format
fine let's delete this style
and let's copy the style one we have
created
save it in C
it's not coming let's see UI
okay it's coming but in the end
the page I must be long here but we can
reduce it after a while but let's do
some changes first
besides is fine
let's now
inside this class
let's
give it pointer
and not in this class
okay select this
class let's get a pointer
and then the Mac
could be 15.
okay
now after that
we'll do here are some changes
but let's
find now we'll go to another part which
is
the YouTube app button
this one
notification bar
we can go to this
class see where it's ending
after giving one
let's create another class
of the
notifications

first we need to make another two parts
of this notification bar
first is this ring YouTube ring and then
the notification button
so let's not create this as
notification menu let's name it as
YouTube
uh apps
inside this let's now again
go to
the
bar of YouTube and this icons
we will
find the
okay let's first cut this
and then inspect
[Music]
inside the icons
we can write it
copy element
and then let's
write it here format the document
erase this style
increase the style and copy this style
from above
okay
and let's just paste it here and then
just save it and see the new
notification ring bell is here
now let's
do the notification bar
after this
let's create this
and first
whether we need to make it as pointer
okay let's make it as pointer here so we
can point it anywhere
and the
Mappy
50.
I have created the
CSS app.tss files here
so
let's now just save it it's giving it a
margin of 15
we can reduce it after a while but let's
we do this for as of now
let's move ahead with another Dev of
class

so let's create it
notification
menu
inside this let's
get the SVG of the notification
inside let's find out
where the notification one comes

dig inside this
okay
let me come down
it's fine let's make it at this only
but let's
create it
let's not create this notification menu
but let's create this
logo
so for that
let's first create open now I simply
download it
inside this
let's get this
let's get this
copy
let's go back to our code
creating another menu
there of class name
profile
foreign
but I am writing this so let's
format
document
formatter
let's just ID darker we don't need it
let's move ahead
with the class and we don't need the
class also we just need the picture
is here
so we can write the
things after that
so let's
just
go
you can create it
and before that let's
alter
d
and then class name
click B
d d Max
let's not save it it's showing an error
let's find out
okay

okay
now let's save it and see
the image is coming very big let's just
cut this part
let's add the image
from my my page only
thank you
copy element
coming back to our code
yeah
to just paste it
just need the
source code of the picture so let's copy
it only
and then the
and after deleting let's save it now and
see
is it coming or not
okay
we need to
format that mind
let's now save it
it's not coming still let's see what's
the issue here
so the issue here is coming is
I have to open the
image in new tab
then let's copy it from here
and then
I have to paste it inside this
now let's save this file
and then
it's not coming still so let's
form a document
let's see the issue
why it's not working
let's press first and CSS
image Dot
because it didn't fit
we made the class name was DP so let's
give it a border of
let's give it for the radius of
person after that we'll get a height of
30 pixels
and then we'll do with
30 pixels again
okay
design
will give it cursor
yeah
let's now save it and like you can see
the image is coming but it's not coming
right
so let's just copy some other image
it's opening the same language
copy this
paste it inside
let's see the issue
react rotor let's not see it here first
inside this
everything is fine
[Music]
foreign
middle items so we need to fix this also
but first we need to fix the image part
so let's see what's the issue here
copy element let's copy it again we
don't need
let's see the
issue here
let's open the image the image is
opening here
why it's not working here
okay fine let's add that
only
[Music]
it's
inspect
open and then tab
copy this

and the two working
let's just save it
okay Centrelink logo is coming but I
don't know why that picture is not
coming but let's
it's fine let's cut this
let's reduce the size of this picture
let's
give it
off
20
5 would be fine
I know it should also be 25 again and
it's coming fine
yeah
now we have created this basic structure
but first we need to delete this space
let's go back to our code inside this we
have
given our maximum height so let's delete
that
we have seen it was in the middle part
so inside this middle
let's see
now it's coming like this I have done
one few change in this CSS file and give
the width back it was 100 but now I gave
it a 65 percent
so our upper body is ready now we'll
work on this bar
now we'll work on this thing
home button explore shots in this we'll
add these all buttons after that we'll
go back to the
body part
now that we have created a header part
we will work on the sidebar which will
come here for that we have to create two
files inside this Source folder only
so we'll click on this and type
bar
dot Js
and another file called
side
bar
dot CSS
so let's cut this
and this
let's open this app.js file
here we'll write the
source of this file so we'll write side
let's save it
in show error for us for some time but
let it find
let's move ahead
and let's create a sidebar
for that first we need to import react
from
react
now
we have to import the
sidebar
open the folder we need to write this
I have two different view also
sidebar dot CSS
sidebar is also here
now let's create a function here
with that side part
inside this function we'll read
everything so let's first return okay
class
let's create div
of class
Side by
inside this let's close this

put fault and then
and let's save it now
it's still

let's see
different
let's see
what's the issue come in here
also
let's now save it and as you can see
it's showing
hello from Simply done
go back to us calling let's delete this
file
we have written here
so let's
let's create a another class
everything will be printed
so let's create the printer
let's create another class
anymore
so you
know
items
please
same thing
like items
Center
and then
we will list
close this
and then inside this
you learn the SVG
we can create it like this and we can
create it like this
let's create it like this only
or we can create it like this
one
let's go here
inside this
let's find it CVG
open let's paste it here
format
after that
we have to delete this
and so
instead of this
right under the style
that will come into this
let's give it away
so we're both
of 25 pixels and that should also come
on
pets
now
oh 25 again
pixels
imagine
excellence
now I'm going back to our
code
we have to make give it a name also that
here it's showing room so we have to
make it in the name for that we'll use a
tag called span
let's
let's use it
foreign
and it's right side but inside it let's
make this
right
foreign
[Music]

after that let's
give some stylings too
that I passed items
inside if there is just different
content should be clicks
start
after that
100 percent
pixels
to that
we have created this plan

it's coming back to our
code
let's cut this Pages because there will
be done
so let's create a file called swinger
good
cheers
and another one is
dot CSS
so let's open the first file
filter.gl VSS
not JS
but first we need to add here the file
source

heater
let's save it
let's see here but it's fine
import
filter from
filter
you can save it
it's nothing but let's
see you
scream
because we haven't wrote anything inside
this let's start by putting the art
from here
moving ahead let's first
import me part
which is the styling
clear the part of that file which is
filter.css
okay
it's not trying because
of this part
so we'll remove this part from here
inside this we will create a class
let's name this class as main display
I mean display and inside this
let me write that
filter
now let's save it
that's my strings there
let's see the issue what's the issue
here
we have given the head the other side
part and the physical Community let's
let's first
[Music]
basic structure then we can see
let's just go to filter component
and inside this filter
let's create a function
inside this function
vertical glass

inside this filter
looking great
H1 to C
hello from Simply
love

whether it is in the correct format or
not
save it it's showing an error let's find
out after this yes
we have
we have a Twitter can
export default
and then the file
let's now save it
let's see the issue what's coming on
it's inside the filter only
module not found okay I have wrote
with the wrong spelling
so look at that it's gone fetch the
filter
let's save it
now as you can see
it's coming straight
fine
let's just
focus on this now
but
filter
I have written here a property of filter
to give it a flex 0.8 and we are giving
it a 0.8 if you remember we have given
this header.css property
of 0.2
somewhere inside the side part GSS
we have given it the property of x 0.2
so Flex is what this screen is a flex
and it is divided into so many parts
so this part is it's taking 0.2
and the leftover path is taking 0.8 so
for videos and all of the stuff we need
this part
so we are giving it a 0.8 percent and
into this we are giving it 0.2 percent
so everything is clear now so let's
cut this file
inside this let's see
okay
return
[Music]
if I haven't done its value
let's now save it
and as you can see it will
show her
hello from Simply them but it's coming

I'm creating it's very easy to create
let's just get it's small as just
remember the filter
let's just close it too
it's like this one
[Music]
so we can write
the name
see first name would be
all
right let's filter
items
pulling through
active Roots always show that in this
page is one
we are on
the lastly let's close this
and inside this Android or
let's save it and see
it's showing you here
let's change its size
let's go to this part
property
over here
let's write 50 pixel
so it should come up
and let's give it to Martin also
of zero pixels from the left and 10
pixels right
let's save it as we can see okay up
like this
so
let's go back to
fan class with the writing
okay
so let's write span
filter item
items
and inside this
that's right
now let's give it a font size of 16.
so let's try
on size
16 pixels
after that
let's give it a wedding
10 pixels and from there it will be 15
pixel
let's give it a border radius of 23
pixels
after
that let's give the borders so
come like a box type of thing
from Pixel solid
now we'll repair the color the color
that
you will be need here is in e
and e and e 5 C
31.
let's save it
I'm receiving this let's see
as you can see it's coming
like this
let's decrease the size of this box
yeah it's like
a little big
so let's give it on say 12 would be
final
eleven

earlier only so we'll say none
and the color is that is
from the third law
