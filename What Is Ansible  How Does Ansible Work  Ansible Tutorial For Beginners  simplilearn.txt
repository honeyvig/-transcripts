do you know Once Upon a Time Tesla the
electric car company faced the challenge
with their production processes they
were building incredible electric cars
but managing their vast Fleet of servers
and machines was becoming a nightmare
every time they needed to update
software or configure new systems it was
tedious and errorr process then they
discovered anible a magical tool for
automating tasks with anible Tesla could
write simple scripts to Define how they
wanted their servers to be set up and
managed it was like having a digital
Army of robots doing all their work so
guys whenever Tesla needed to deploy new
software or make changes to their
infrastructure they simply ran their
anible scripts and everything was done
automatically what an amazing in demand
automation tool nowadays companies are
looking for candidates who have
knowledge of anible and they are also
paying them very good amount of money so
considering this we'll be covering

the course link is mentioned in the
description box understand the agenda
for our today's session so guys first we
are going to start with what is anible
moving ahead we will discuss about how
does anible works then we will discuss
about benefits of using anible and then
we are going to conclude our session by
installing anible on Docker so this is
agenda for our today's session so let's
move on so guys as you can see all over
here I am on the official anible
documentation but the question is why
have I opened this documentation so
right this is official documentation by
the team of anible and I would always
want you to refer this documentation
while learning anible guys anible is a
versatile automation tool tailored for
it professionals which enables tasks
such as application deployment
workstation serw updates Cloud
provisioning configuration management
and inra service orchestration notably
stands out for the agentless nature
requiring no additional security
infrastructure for deployment which
simplifies its use and management now
what are the benefits of using anible if
I talk about the benefits of using
anible anible offers several benefits
the first one is agentless architecture
anible doesn't require agents to be
installed on managed nodes thus reducing
complexity and potential security
vulnerabilities this agentless approach
simpli FES deployment and management
moving ahead we will also discuss about
what are manage nodes and control nodes
then there is a crossplatform support
anible can manage diverse environments
including Linux Unix and windows
subsystem as well as network devices and
Cloud platforms providing unified
solution for automation across different
infrastructures third one is scalability
whether managing handful of servers or
large scale infrastructure and scales
effectively it can handle thousands of
node with A's allowing organizations to
automate task across their entire
environment fourth one is integration
anible integrates seamlessly with
existing tools and Technologies
including Version Control Systems like G
Monitoring Solutions and continuous
integration delivery pipelines enhancing
the overall automation workflow now You'
be wondering how does anible works so
guys in anible there are two main types
of computers the first one is control
node and second one is manage nodes the
control node is where anible is
installed and operated it's essential to
have one control node though having a
backup control node is also possible on
the other hand manage nodes are the
devices or systems controlled and
managed by the control node anible
operates by establishing connection to
these nodes whether they are servers
clients or other entities you are
configuring it then sends small programs
known as anible modules to these nodes
these modules are executed over SSH
which stands for secured server shell
and are also removed after the
completion the key requirement for this
process is that anible control node has
a login access to the managed nodes
while SSH keys are commonly used for
Access and other authentication methods
now we are going to install anible on
the docker so guys to install anible
within a docker the first thing that you
need is a vs code so guys to install a
text editor you can go directly to the
vs
code so guys you can see this is
official website of the vs code and from
here you can download your favorite text
editor it runs very smooth and later on
what you have to do guys you have to go
to the docker's official website so you
can see this is the first link of the
official Docker and from here you can
download Docker desktop on your system
so guys if you don't know how to install
Docker you will see a video in the link
just click on that and you will be very
easily navigated to installing Docker on
your Windows system now after you have
installed vs code and Docker The Next
Step comes up installing anible within
Docker container so it's certain thing
like you are installing a package or a
virtual machine and our virtual machine
is acting as a container which is on a
Docker platform so guys as you can see
all over here so here's a file I have
created so this is the folder anible and
inside this I have created the docker
file so your first step would be to
create a Docker file now after this you
have to ensure that a Docker is
installed on your host machine okay then
after creating a Docker file you have to
specify the instructions for building
your anible container so here's a basic
example like here you can see from
Ubuntu latest so I have added install
dependencies app.get update app. get
install app. wi software properties
common add repository yes update PPA
anible and app get installed by so as
you can see guys I have written the
script all over here okay now let us try
to understand this script so you can see
all over here the first thing that is
from one to latest what does it mean
this sets the base image for the docker
file it indicates that the docker image
being built will be based on the latest
version of Ubuntu operating system
available on the docker Hub next thing
is run appt get update so guys this line
runs the app get update command inside
the docker container to update the
package list from the repositories and
the and and symbol which you are seeing
is a line continuation character in the
docker file which allows a command to
span up to multiple lines third command
as you can see all over here is written
apt get install by software so basically
what's it's doing this line install the
software properties common package using
App get this package provides an
abstraction of used app repositories it
often requires for adding PPS which
means that personal package archives to
the system in the next line you can see
I have written apt ad repository yes you
have to update the PPA anible and anible
and add so this basically what it does
it adds the anible PPA means anible
personal package archive to the system
ppas are kind of additional software
repositories for Ubuntu this particular
PPA provides the latest stable release
of anible and you can see there's a yes
flag which automatically answers yes to
the prompts and update and ensures that
the package lists are updated after
adding to the repository the app get
install why anible this line installs
anible using appg anible is a
configuration management and automation
tool so guys this line installs anible
using appkit now after all anible is a
configuration management and automation
tool so after building the docker image
using the docker file now we have to run
this container using the docker run
command and it follows with the it flag
okay so let me show you so guys as you
can see I have already been navigated to
my directory of anible so you can see
docker build t t is argument okay and a
container a container is a name so let
us say a name as uh demo container now
we are going to build our image first so
I'm typing this Command right click on
this and let me show you what is
happening so as you can see it started
building our anible container all over
here inside the docker now we have
install the anible all over here now the
next step is to run our Docker container
which has installed anible image so just
type this command Docker run and it
anible container bin bash let me explain
you this command so guys after building
the docker image using this Docker file
you can run a container from it using
the docker run command the it flag
allocates the pseudo TTY and keeps the
STD in open even if not attached
allowing you to interact with the
container shell /bin/bash this specifies
that you want to start a bash shell
session inside the container now when
you're inside the container you can
verify that anible is installed by
running anible version now we'll also do
that but before that let's run our
container so you can see now we are
inside a bash container or bash sh and I
want to check whether our anible is
installed or not so
I'm going to type anable version so you
can see that our latest version is
3.12 and you can see the python version
it's also saying
3.12.0 so guys congratulations we have
successfully installed our anible in the
docker so guys this was just a basic
overview of anible and what it has the
capabilities for you can do a lot of
things with anible and automate a lot of
processes like configuration management
you can create your playbooks and just
run it so in that way it automates your
process and it makes your workflow kind
of easier so guys thank you for watching
