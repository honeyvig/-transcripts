25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,600
further Ado should we begin yeah and you

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,199

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,719
figure out how to get solve my Hunger

28
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm really hungry right now and I have a

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,760
hankerin for pizza Ken Watson helped me

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,640
get a pizza definitely in fact that's

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,840
the point of this Facebook live event

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,080
today so and so today we're going to be

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,080
showing you how you can build a chatbot

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
that could actually order pizza for you

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,880
through a rest API on an iOS application

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
so basically we're going to have an iOS

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
application where you can converse with

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,000
IBM Watson through speech and IBM Watson

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,439
will actually be able to help you build

40
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,520
your pizza and then order your pizza

41
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,759
through a rest

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,240
API now just before we actually get into

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,880
a demo though and before we actually get

44
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,799
your

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,000
pizza let's talk a little bit about the

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,640
technical side okay please sure so to

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
begin the Watson apis we're going to be

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,840
using today uh first of all Watson

49
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,119
speech to text for input as you can see

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
behind me uh and so speech to text we're

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
going to be using in order for the user

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,840
to be able to speak to the application

53
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,680
and have that converted to text that

54
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,240
Watson conversation can then understand

55
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
and Watson conversation can then of

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,960
course act as our chatbot and then

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
Watson conversation can give output to

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,720
the user using IBM Watson's text to

59
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,440
speech U so that's how we're going to be

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
giving output to our user through our

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,760
iOS

62
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,080
application of course though as I said

63
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,160
this is an iOS application so the

64
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,440
language I've coded this application in

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
is Swift however I do have a surprise I

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,640
guess you could say at the end uh as to

67
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,879
how I was able to integrate node.js with

68
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,120
this as well so make sure you stay tuned

69
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,080
to the end of the alive event in order

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,519
to see what I was able to do with no JS

71
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,319
and this application as well all right

72
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,519
so now finally I think we're ready to

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,000
actually start ordering your pizza using

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,040
this chat box please let's let's make

75
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,200
this thing work all right sure so now

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,959
let's get to the demo so as you can see

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,519
what I'm going to do uh is behind me uh

78
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,800
you should be able to see my phone here

79
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,239
okay and so this is a the my my phone

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,959
screen being mirrored onto this

81
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,159
television behind me uh and so as you

82
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,920
can see this is a simple application

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,200
that I've set up and this is the UI for

84
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,040
our chatbot it's extremely simple all we

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,440
have is a text View and a button the

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,480
button will allow us to control the

87
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,400
recording status of speech to text uh to

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,120
see when speech to text is and isn't

89
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,599
listening to me and I'll show you how

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,319
that works in just a moment uh but of

91
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,959
course we've got an invisible text view

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,200
on here as well and this text view will

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,280
allow us to see the input that we're

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,239
giving one Watson and the output that

95
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:33,560
Watson is giving to us along with that

96
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,000
speech to text and text to speech input

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
and output let's actually try it out so

98
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,959
let's actually start the conversation

99
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,640
with Watson by saying something

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,519
like hello Watson I would like a

101
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,560
pizza so I have stopped and as you can

102
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,439
see hi what size pizza would you like

103
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,200
all right so I I'm really hungry can we

104
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,959
do a large sure definitely uh so as you

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,640
can see Watson asked us what size we

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,560
want so now uh Jam wants a large so

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,040
let's

108
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,159
do we would like a large

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,799
pizza large pizza got it any toppings

110
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,079
today all right so as you can see uh it

111
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,519
all it's uh tells us that it's

112
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,600
understood that we want a large pizza

113
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,199
and it asks us for the toppings that we

114
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,479
would like uh and so you know let's just

115
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,759
say that we've never been here before

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,360
and we don't know which toppings are

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
provided so we can actually ask Watson

118
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,440
conversation since we're in this context

119
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,639
Now what are my

120
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,000
options and as you can see now I'm done

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,280
talking to Watson and have cheese olives

122
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,919
pineapples and chicken as toppings you

123
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,520
can have three toppings tops all right

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
so as you can see Watson has responded

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,880
to us and it gives us those four

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,360
different types of toppings that we can

127
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,440
have in our pizza of course in an actual

128
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,039
chatot you would probably have many more

129
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:53,960
options but in this case since we're

130
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,320
going for uh sort of like an example we

131
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
have cheese olives pineapples and

132
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
chicken as our toppings and you can have

133
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,520
maximum three toppings uh so let's

134
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
actually try out maybe I guess first

135
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,240
topping is cheese please sure got to

136
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,720
have cheese I like my first chopping as

137
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,639
cheese topping sorry

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,680
but all right

139
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,800
first any preference on crust size okay

140
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,560
so Watson still understood what we said

141
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,080
even though uh our speech to text didn't

142
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,880
exactly go that nice so got the int

143
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,520
exactly it stands that intent that's

144
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
where that machine learning aspect comes

145
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,520
in uh with Watson conversation uh and

146
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,759
then it asks me if I have any preference

147
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,120
on cr- eyes but just before we go to

148
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
that let's actually specify our second

149
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,880
topic sure well I want some protein so

150
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,360
can we get a chicken on that definitely

151
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,440
so I'd like chicken as my second

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,160
topping as you can see now speech texal

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
understood what I said and watch all

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,639
right chicken as your second topping any

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
preference for crust eyes all right so

156
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,160
now I think we can get to cross SI um I

157
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,120
think maybe we should go for normal I

158
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,520
mean I'm trying to watch my carbs can we

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,280
go thin crust sure let's try that

160
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,120
out I'd like a thin crust

161
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,599
please all right thin crust it is any

162
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,000
sauce requirements all right so speex

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
luckily understood what we said uh and

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,479
so Watson conversation has replied to us

165
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,800
and now it's asking us what we like to

166
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,520
do in terms of sauce so let's ask it

167
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
what our options are here and let's uh

168
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,000
decide according to that what are my

169
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,440
options okay and then you can have no

170
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,759
sauce we can go easy on the sauce you

171
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
can keep the normal amount of sauce or

172
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,440
we can add extra sauce all right so

173
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,520
Watson has replied to us now it gives us

174
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,240
those four options in terms of sauce

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
that we can have so James what you do

176
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,479
what would you prefer here let's go easy

177
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,199
on the sauce all right so please go easy

178
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,520
on the

179
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,039
sauce and so Watson says all right we'll

180
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,199
go easy on the sauce would there be

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,000
anything

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,319
else well I mean I think that's it for

183
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,120
today I'm good I'm hungry I'm really

184
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,479
hungry so am I so this works perfectly

185
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,039
so that's all for

186
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
today all right great you will be able

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,199
to pick up your pizza soon all right so

188
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,080
as you can see Watson has sent in the

189
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,199
order and it actually shows us those

190
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,639
final specifications of our pizza the

191
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,520
size is large the crust is thin the

192
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
sauce is easy topping one is cheese

193
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,520
topping two is chicken and Topping three

194
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,440
is nothing and that's the application

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,919
I'm going to be showing you how you can

196
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,000
coat in today in a live coating session

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,879
uh but just before we actually get into

198
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,720
that I guess uh it's Pizza time

199
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,879
then yeah so we actually do have a pizza

200
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,199
here so that's good

201
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,240
great

202
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,080
so this is nice so we can uh start

203
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
eating now since we're hungry but now

204
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
finally we can get into the technical

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,639
part of this demonstration so if I

206
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,599
actually switch back to my computer here

207
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,479
as you can see behind me we're going to

208
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,800
start building a diagram of how this

209
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,879
application actually works uh so now the

210
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,560
first thing is that we've got a few

211
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,400
components of this entire system uh and

212
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,680
so the first most important ingredient

213
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,080
to this application I guess you could

214
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
say is our hungry user in this case

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,279
James yes who is actually trying to

216
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,719
order the

217
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,680
pizza of course I just took my pizza

218
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,320
away well though of course we've got the

219
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080
application which is going to help us

220
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,680
order the pizza of course we've got our

221
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Watson Suite of apis which will actually

222
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,399
help us have the application order the

223
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,880
pizza itself and understand what the

224
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,320
user is saying but of course the rest

225
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,240
API will actually order the pizza itself

226
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,440
and receive the specifications from our

227
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
application now basically the way this

228
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,120
works is obviously the user gives us

229
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,720
some input uh to the application now

230
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,200
again the application will be doing all

231
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,279
of the orchestration here and so the

232
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,399
application takes this input uh and once

233
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,240
the application has input from the user

234
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,480
voice input we can't just directly give

235
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,320
that to conversation unfortunately so we

236
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,600
have to convert it to a string so what

237
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,279
we need to do is we need to take that

238
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,480
voice and we need to convert it to text

239
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,680
by running it through text to speech uh

240
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,160
sorry speech to text speech to text will

241
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,519
then take that wave file of the user's

242
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,480
voice and it'll convert that into a

243
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,040
string that string can then be sent back

244
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,200
to the application and the application

245
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,320
now has some input data that

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,640
conversation can actually work with this

247
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,440
is the thin crust that those exactly

248
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,920
exactly like for example when I would

249
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
say please go easy on the sauce that's

250
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,839
my voice that speech detects then

251
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,079
converting to a string please go easy on

252
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,120
the sauce

253
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,560
which can then be sent to and is sent to

254
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
Watson conversation Watson and of course

255
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
we are sending a little bit of metadata

256
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,399
about the actual conversation context on

257
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,959
how our conversation's going what was

258
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,200
said last uh and so uh once we have that

259
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,839
context in order then conversation is

260
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,680
going to return to us a response now

261
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,760
this response not only contains what it

262
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,800
wants to reply to the user but it also

263
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,839
contains some new metadata about the

264
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,040
conversation which is then sent back in

265
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
the next request so you'll actually see

266
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
a bit more of that about how that logic

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,440
works in the actual live coding session

268
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,920
but that's basically how that works but

269
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,560
then in order to make sure that the user

270
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,920
doesn't even need to read the screen we

271
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,720
send what Watson conversation told us to

272
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,120
Text to Speech Text Speech will then

273
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,360
synthesize what the US what conversation

274
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
is trying to say to the user and that's

275
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,519
sent as a wave audio file back to the

276
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,839
application the application then plays

277
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,480
that out through the iOS devices

278
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,360
speakers and then finally the user can

279
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,760
have their output the user will then

280
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
continue this cycle over and over and

281
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,519
over again just as we did in the demo

282
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,600
until they're done specifying what their

283
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,279
Pizza will contain and once that's done

284
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,959
of course we call our rest API which is

285
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,760
going to actually order the pizza as it

286
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,240
did today all right so that's exactly

287
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,600
all how the technical part of this

288
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,040
application will

289
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,079
work now though let's actually get into

290
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,200
a live coding session where I'm going to

291
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,040
show you how you can actually implement

292
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,720
this code but before we get into that

293
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,880
what you should do is you should

294
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,560
actually head over to my GitHub page uh

295
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
and so yeah so you should head over to

296
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,920
my GitHub page tan may1 123 is the

297
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,160
username there uh and there's a starter

298
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,079
code for the first Watson made simple

299
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,279
event uh what you're going to do is you

300
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,760
you probably want to download that

301
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
starter code because as you can see

302
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
behind me uh it's actually completely

303
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
blank there's no code or any interface

304
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,800
for this but what it does do do is I've

305
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
already included these IBM Watson

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,600
Frameworks in this application namely

307
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,440
rest kit conversation speech to text and

308
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,800
text to speech and so that you don't

309
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,519
need to install them from Carthage from

310
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
scratch at this time so you can follow

311
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,639
along with us I'd recommend doing this

312
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,800
because it's much faster but of course

313
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,360
if you'd like to manually install via

314
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,120
Carthage your choice you can do that if

315
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,079
you'd like as well all right so now

316
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,279
though we are actually ready to begin

317
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,519
coding but before we actually code let's

318
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,720
start with develop in the UI of the

319
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,880
application itself now the UI is as you

320
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,600
saw extremely simple we just have a text

321
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,720
View and a button on screen and so what

322
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,959
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to

323
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,880
drag on first of all a button from my uh

324
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,320
objects controller here uh and I'm going

325
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,880
to label this button as start as you can

326
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,120
see right there and what I'm going to do

327
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,360
is I'm actually going to have another

328
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,040
text view as well uh in this text View

329
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,399
and just going to drag this on screen uh

330
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,639
and this is going to be almost as big as

331
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,279
the screen but just before hitting the

332
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,160
button uh and basically this text view

333
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,079
as you saw will allow us to see what

334
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,720
yeah exactly you'll see that Watson

335
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,160
conversation uh going on uh what you're

336
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,320
what you're saying to the chat button

337
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,760
what it's saying back to you uh but

338
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,959
another thing you're probably going to

339
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,480
want to make sure is that the user can't

340
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,240
change anything that's in that text view

341
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
because we don't want them changing

342
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,160
anything this is just to show them

343
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,800
what's happening and so what you want to

344
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,720
do is click on your text View and in the

345
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,000
attributes inspector uh deselect

346
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,680
editable and deselect

347
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
selectable so once you've done that the

348
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
user will not be able to edit or select

349
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,600
any text in the text view so it becomes

350
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,920
really convenient because then we don't

351
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,560
need to implement keyboard hiding logic

352
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,399
when they hit return that type of stuff

353
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,760
so it becomes much much easier all right

354
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,519
so that's really all we had to do for

355
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,079
the UI extremely simple now though we

356
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,759
can actually get into the code of the

357
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,120
application all right so let's begin

358
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,480
with viewcontroller.swift and this is

359
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,560
where we're going to be doing all of the

360
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,639
coding for this application uh and so

361
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,040
well the first thing we need to start

362
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,480
off with though is our Imports now in

363
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,519
terms of imports uh again we are we are

364
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,480
uh in this application recording and

365
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,079
playing audio and we're doing this via

366
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,519
the AV Audio record and the AV Audio

367
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,720
player and by the way for this

368
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
application I'm assuming you have some

369
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,560
at least little experience with iOS

370
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,959
development uh through Swift uh so it's

371
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,399
much easier for you to follow along all

372
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,920
right so now the AV AIO player and AV

373
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,399
audio recorder classes are accessed via

374
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,600
the AV Foundation framework so what

375
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,079
we'll need to do is import that first so

376
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,639
right after import UI kit you're going

377
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,440
to want to type in import AV foundation

378
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,079
on your screen and then you're going to

379
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,519
want to import your Watson apis so you

380
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,800
can actually use them in this

381
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,199
application so I'm going to be importing

382
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,560
uh importing sorry conversation we're

383
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,440
going to be importing speech to text and

384
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,920
of course we're going to be importing

385
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,399
text to speech now once you've got all

386
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,279
those all those Imports down you should

387
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,560
be ready to actually start coding in

388
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,040
your application let's begin with a few

389
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,399
variables that are going to be used

390
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,759
throughout this class so if I go into my

391
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,120
view controller class here I'm going to

392
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,079
declare some class level variables and

393
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,920
constants and let's actually begin with

394
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,639
our IB Outlets which will actually let

395
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,279
us uh communicate with our interface

396
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,040
Builder or our UI throughout this code

397
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,600
uh so I'm going to create a new IB

398
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,720
Outlet a variable uh and so this is

399
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,920
going to be called let's just say start

400
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,040
stop button because uh as you can tell

401
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,920
uh by the self-explanatory name here uh

402
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,319
this is the button which will allow us

403
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,319
to start and stop our voice recording of

404
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:39,680
course though we have to declare uh our

405
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,079
text View and so we're going to be

406
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,600
calling this the conversation list and

407
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,959
this is a type UI text view once you've

408
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,279
got those IB Outlets down that's all you

409
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,120
need to do in terms of IB Outlets but

410
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,920
we've got a few more variables that

411
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,519
you're going to need to create today in

412
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,959
order to create this application so two

413
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,680
of the most important ones though would

414
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,000
be our av audio recorder and our av

415
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,040
audio player so let's create those so

416
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,639
first first thing we're going to do is

417
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,600
create a new recorder so variable

418
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,360
recorder and set this to a new AV audio

419
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,440
recorder uh of course this is going to

420
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,160
be a forced optional so it's equal to

421
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
nil by default uh and of course we're

422
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,560
also going to be creating a player or AV

423
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,519
Audio

424
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,800
player once you've got that down you're

425
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,120
done with your AV classes in terms of or

426
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,720
audio video Foundation classes uh in

427
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,319
terms of class level variables now

428
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:33,639
though let's start working with some

429
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,079
conversation logic now the first thing

430
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,759
in terms of conversation logic that

431
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,480
you're going to need to take care of is

432
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,240
your last context variable as I said

433
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,880
when I was explaining in the diagram of

434
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,519
this application what we're going to be

435
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,639
doing is sending Watson in the first

436
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,600
message no metadata about the

437
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,279
conversation and also the users whatever

438
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,120
whatever the user said but then what

439
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,680
happens is when Watson returns stuff

440
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,920
back to us it returns a little uh it

441
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
returns a variable called context

442
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,880
variable uh and it also returns a

443
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,800
response so the response we can of

444
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,319
course show that to the user and give it

445
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,039
to text of speech but then what we need

446
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,880
to do is in the next request that we

447
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,679
sent to IBM Watson the next uh message

448
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,280
the user sends we need to take that last

449
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,640
context variable that Watson gave us and

450
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
send it back to it and do that every

451
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,160
single time to make sure that Ian Watson

452
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,520
knows what of course is going on in the

453
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
conversation and is able to reply

454
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,600
accordingly uh and so the way we can do

455
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,160
this as is by creating something called

456
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,320
the last context variable and this is

457
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,080
going to be a of type context and this

458
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,039
is going to be a normal optional so by

459
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,120
default it's nil uh and of course we're

460
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
going to be passing this to IBM Watson

461
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,640
conversation the first time as a nil

462
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,600
object so it'll know that there's no

463
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
context and this is the first time that

464
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,520
we are of course sending a message to

465
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,000
Watson from this

466
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,919
application once that's done though

467
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,120
there's a little bit more conversation

468
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,159
logic left and what we're going to do

469
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,600
now though is we're going to create the

470
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,400
very variables that will help you keep

471
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
track of how your pizza is actually

472
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,799
being ordered and the structure of the

473
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,799
pizza order so let's actually take a

474
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,960
look at how that will work so what are

475
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,320
the things that the user can change

476
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,200
about the pizza well they can change the

477
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,559
size the crust size the sauce the

478
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,159
topping one two and three right so all

479
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,960
we need to do is create variables for

480
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
each one of those so I'm going to create

481
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,520
a variable called size empty string uh

482
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
of course crust size uh again empty

483
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,600
string uh we're going to create

484
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
something like um sauce empty string

485
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,960
again uh we're going to create the

486
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
topping one and Topping two and of

487
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
course topping

488
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,559
three once we've got all our toppings

489
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,400
down we're done over all of our

490
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,720
conversation logic and there's just one

491
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,400
last con uh sorry uh constant that we

492
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
need to create in the class level scope

493
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,400
uh and what this would be is our output

494
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,360
file URL now this URL will actually be

495
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,039
the URL to the file that our AP audio

496
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,880
recorder will record files to and Watson

497
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,000
speech to text will grab audio from the

498
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,080
way we're going to do this is we're

499
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,520
going to create a new output file URL

500
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,280
constant here and this is going to be

501
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,600
equal to a new URL okay uh and that

502
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,880
we're going to be using the file URL

503
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,520
with path initializer here now this

504
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,440
takes a string and in order to get the

505
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,080
string we're going to run the NS search

506
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,159
path and then wait for it to fill out

507
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,320
and then NS search path for directories

508
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,720
in domains function and this will return

509
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,559
an array of strings and so we're going

510
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,600
to ask it to find the document directory

511
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,159
through the default user domain mask and

512
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,320
of course we're going to ask it to

513
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,320
expand the till day now this returns an

514
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,480
array of strings so we're going to get

515
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,400
the last element by forcefully

516
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
unwrapping the last element in this

517
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,159
array and then to this we will append

518
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,880
slw Watson audio. wav or wave or wave

519
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,120
technically and so now this is the URL

520
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,000
that the that the recorder will actually

521
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,360
record your audio too whenever you click

522
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,120
on start record your audio and then

523
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,720
click on stop of course though this is

524
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,840
also the URL that speech DET text will

525
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,080
grab your voice from when it's trying to

526
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,159
understand what you said and that's what

527
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,200
these two what that's that's what this

528
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,919
constant sorry will be doing and that's

529
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,720
what we had to do to initialize

530
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,320
basically this entire class uh and have

531
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,640
our base variables down in order to get

532
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,039
started with the actual code but to

533
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,960
begin with our actual code though we

534
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,520
need to start off by sorry initializing

535
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
our av audio recorder and the way we can

536
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,760
do this is by going into our viewed load

537
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,520
function and over here we're going to be

538
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,280
of course initializing our av audio

539
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,159
recorder so it's ready to record some

540
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,480
audio so the way we can do this uh is by

541
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,960
first of all we need to create a new

542
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,039
session okay uh and I'm going to create

543
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,919
a new AV Audio session in a new constant

544
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,120
and I'm going to be getting a shared

545
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,159
instance meaning the default in instance

546
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,200
of an AV Audio session once that's done

547
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm going to create a new variable

548
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,679
called settings and this is going to be

549
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,200
a new dictionary of type string any

550
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,240
object uh and of course this is going to

551
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,200
be a blank dictionary by default but

552
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
then what we're going to do is we're

553
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,559
going to go to the settings dictionary

554
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,279
and we're going to be setting the AV

555
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:26,480
sample rate key to a new NS number and

556
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,720
this NS number will be using the float

557
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,919
literal initializer and we'll be using

558
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,000
44100 as our number here again you don't

559
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,960
exactly need to know what this means uh

560
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,679
we don't really care about that all this

561
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,120
is doing is It's recording it's

562
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,159
initializing our recorder so it works

563
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,960
with Watson speech detex that's all we

564
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,840
care about right now this is not related

565
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,320
to wats in any in any way though uh but

566
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,240
then we're going to go back to our

567
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
settings variable and we're going to be

568
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,559
setting the AV number of channels key to

569
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,360
a new NS number uh this time we'll be

570
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,360
using the integer literal uh initializer

571
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,640
and this will be equal to one that's it

572
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,919
just one channel in our av audio

573
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,720
recording once that's done though well

574
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm going to um be a little bad here and

575
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
I'm not going to implement error

576
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,320
handling uh because I want this to be as

577
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,240
simple for you as possible but in your

578
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
applications I would highly recommend

579
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,120
you implement error handling uh because

580
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,559
of course it's important and you don't

581
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,919
want your application to crashing uh and

582
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,720
so I'm not going to be implementing a do

583
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,559
catch statement here uh although you

584
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,559
could in your applic appliations uh

585
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,240
right now I'm going to forcefully try to

586
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,799
do all of this so what I'm going to do

587
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,360
is I'm going to forcefully try to set

588
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,559
the session category that we

589
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,760
created I'm going to be running the set

590
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,640
category function uh and what I'm going

591
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,840
to be doing is I'm going to be setting

592
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,240
this to AV Audio session category play

593
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,200
and

594
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,559
record once that's done I'm also going

595
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,919
to forcefully try to set the recorder to

596
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,200
a new AV audio recorder I'm going to be

597
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,799
initializing this new AV audio recorder

598
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,400
uh and of course going to be using the

599
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,799
URL settings initializer right over

600
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,480
there the URL will be the output file

601
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
URL because this is where we want our av

602
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
audio recorder to save the recordings

603
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,240
and settings will be the new will be the

604
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,919
settings variable that we had just

605
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,960
created once that's done though we're

606
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,559
going to tell the recorder to set

607
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,679
metering enable to true and then finally

608
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,480
what we're going to do is we're going to

609
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
what we're going to do is we're going to

610
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,080
set the recorder to prepare to record

611
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,640
and once we're done preparing that

612
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,400
recording we are done initializing our

613
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,919
recorder and we can finally get to

614
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,880
working with Watson nice yay okay let's

615
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,240
get to that now so now you can get out

616
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,600
of your viewed load function and you can

617
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
create a new IB action and we're going

618
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,960
to create a new IB action function and

619
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,559
we're going to call this start stop

620
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,480
recording now this is actually the

621
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,720
function that's called whenever you

622
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,760
click that start stop button and so

623
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,080
inside of here we're going to create a

624
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,640
new if statement and we're going to

625
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,960
check if the recorder is recording but

626
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,919
if it's not recording which is what that

627
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,760
little exclamation mark at the end over

628
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,120
there does if it's not recording then

629
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,039
what'll happen is it'll run some block

630
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,080
of code and this block of code what

631
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,880
it'll do uh is it'll first of all uh

632
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,440
make sure that first of all we create a

633
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,400
new session which is our AV Audio

634
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,679
session uh this is our shared instance

635
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,880
by the way uh and then what we do is we

636
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,159
forcefully try to set the session active

637
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,240
by doing session. setactive

638
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,200
true once that's done uh and again I'm

639
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,760
not implementing error handling that's

640
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,279
not good you should do that in your

641
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,919
applications uh but then once I'm done

642
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,559
that I tell the recorder to record by

643
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,679
running recorder. record that specific

644
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,440
record function uh and once that's done

645
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,880
we're ready to set the start stop button

646
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,320
title to stop because now we are

647
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,360
recording the user uh and when they

648
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,240
click on stop now it'll stop recording

649
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,799
them uh and of course we're going to be

650
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,679
using a normal UI control State and so

651
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:57,720
that's what we're going to be doing in

652
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,760
this block but what if the recorder was

653
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,360
recording and the user just clicked on

654
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,399
stop well in that case we actually want

655
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,960
to start using IBM Watson and so now

656
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,760
let's Implement that so let's actually

657
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,240
put an else into our little if statement

658
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,159
here uh and let's actually start

659
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,440
implementing what happens if the user

660
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,240
was recording their audio uh and now of

661
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,559
course they get to send that audio to IB

662
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,440
Watson and continue those steps in the

663
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,520
pipeline now the first step we have to

664
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,039
work with is speech to text and in order

665
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,640
to do that we actually have to to have

666
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,679
that audio file in a real way file on

667
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,960
the in the documents directory and the

668
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,559
way we can do that is by telling the

669
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,919
recorder to stop recording uh by saying

670
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:42,320
recorder. stop over there once that's

671
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,960
done what I'm going to do is I'm going

672
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,520
to get a new AV Audio session again our

673
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,399
shared instance and I'm going to set

674
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,080
active to false once again I'm going to

675
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,240
forcefully try

676
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,320
this once that's done though finally we

677
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,320
can actually start working with Watson

678
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,120
and specifically speech to text so let's

679
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,320
actually create a new speech to text

680
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,399
constant here and since we've already

681
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,480
imported speech to text I can actually

682
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,919
create a new speech to text object and I

683
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,159
can initialize this with my credentials

684
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,559
and since I already have some

685
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,919
credentials and I don't need to create

686
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:16,760
them in Blu miix what I'm going to do is

687
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,120
I'm going to paste them into this

688
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,960
application and these are my speech to

689
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,880
text credentials here and this is what

690
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,320
we're going to be using in order to of

691
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,960
course understand what the user is

692
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,320
saying once that's done we're going to

693
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,480
actually create a new settings uh

694
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,880
variable though and well basically the

695
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,039
speech detect service needs to know what

696
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,679
it's going to be given is it going to be

697
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,000
given a w file and uh some other sort of

698
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
file like some other sort of audio file

699
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,720
in fact you can actually check this

700
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
numeration are you giving it a basic

701
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,960
file an F Lac file an muula file an opus

702
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,919
file or wave file so there many

703
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,200
different for file formats that speech

704
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,240
to text works with uh but in this case

705
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,760
we're using Wave so we're going to

706
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
create a new recognition settings object

707
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,640
over here put that in the settings

708
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,520
constant and the initializer we'll be

709
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,760
using for recognition settings is the

710
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,399
content type initializer and we're going

711
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:13,760
to be using wve as the content type once

712
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,840
that's done though we are ready to go to

713
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,360
the speech to text uh constant that we

714
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,760
created and call the recognize function

715
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,039
on it and we're going to be using this

716
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,840
initializer right here uh the one that's

717
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,559
uh really short the shortest initializer

718
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,440
uh but of course this takes the audio as

719
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,679
URL and not data once that's done the

720
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,279
audio will be giving it will be the

721
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,120
output file URL and it'll automatically

722
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,559
grab the data from that URL the settings

723
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,039
will be the new recognition settings

724
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,480
that we just created and once that's

725
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,279
done we'll be creating a success

726
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,880
completion Handler and of course the one

727
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,279
parameter we'll be taking this

728
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,120
completion Handler would be the speech

729
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,039
recognition results and we're going to

730
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,600
be calling this the results variable

731
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,480
now inside of this completion Handler

732
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,559
we're going to be putting in some code

733
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,159
and the first thing we want to do once

734
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,480
we receive some text from speech to text

735
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,440
is show the user uh that they have said

736
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,320
something and as you saw in the demo it

737
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,080
says like for example I said please go

738
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,200
easy on the sauce and it said you colon

739
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,799
please go easy on the sauce it showed me

740
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,840
what I said uh and so the way we can do

741
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,480
that is by appending that to the text

742
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,960
view but when this code is called we

743
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,159
will be in a background thread and that

744
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,799
that means we're not in the UI thread so

745
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,120
that we've basically got this main

746
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,919
thread we've got a few more threads here

747
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,399
and we've deviated from the main thread

748
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,360
which is our UI thread to another thread

749
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,600
and this is a background thread and that

750
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,440
means that this code is going in

751
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,480
parallel with our UI code so we're not

752
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,200
freezing the UI while we're waiting for

753
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,279
speech to text but the only thing is for

754
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:48,039
our background thread we can't change

755
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:50,519
the UI since we're not in a UI thread so

756
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,760
what we have to do is we have to just

757
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,600
Fork back into the UI thread and we

758
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,519
actually have to change that text View

759
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,399
and get right back to our back backround

760
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,960
thread so the way we're going to do this

761
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,880
is we're going to go into ios's

762
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,120
operation queue and we're going to go to

763
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,760
the main operation queue which is our UI

764
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,600
a thread and so what we're going to do

765
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
here is we're going to add an operation

766
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,240
and the code for this operation is

767
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,799
actually quite simple we go to the self

768
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,600
conversation list which is the text view

769
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,760
that we just created and then we set its

770
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,159
text to this and I'll tell you what this

771
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,120
does in just a moment so we set it to

772
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,519
the text that was already there and then

773
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,440
we add uace and then we add what you

774
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,240
just

775
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,120
said and then we add a new line so

776
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,399
basically this code over here this line

777
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,480
of code that I just added will append

778
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,120
what I just said to the microphone or to

779
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,880
to speech to text onto the screen so I

780
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,559
can see if speech to text actually

781
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,760
understood me correctly that's what this

782
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,960
code over here is going to do but then

783
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,039
you're going to go after the ending

784
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,399
bracket or brace for your operation Q uh

785
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,480
added operation and once you're after uh

786
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,440
that little line a code we're ready to

787
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,960
start working with conversation this is

788
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
actually quite a simple service to use

789
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,640
speech to text uh now though we get to

790
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,200
work with conversation now the way we

791
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,720
can do this is by creating a new

792
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,760
conversation context and this is going

793
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,440
to be equal to a new conversation class

794
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
and of course as I said we can

795
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,799
initialize this with my own parameters

796
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,880
or with your parameter or sorry your own

797
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
credentials uh and so what you're going

798
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,000
to do is you're going to fill them out

799
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,840
in this initializer here that you've got

800
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,720
for the conversation class

801
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,840
however since I've already got my

802
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,600
credentials uh ready I'm going to just

803
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,880
paste them in from the other screen and

804
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,559
as you can see those are my credentials

805
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,279
there of course though we are also

806
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,240
specifying the version of the

807
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,960
conversation uh model to use and so this

808
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,840
is as far as I know the latest model uh

809
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,720
in existence here uh and so that's the

810
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,519
one that we're going to be using finally

811
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,480
though once that's done all we need to

812
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,880
do is create a message request and this

813
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
message request is actually going to

814
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,399
help us send a request to the

815
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,480
conversation service so let's create a

816
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,039
new MSG request here and let's set this

817
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,440
to a new message request object and

818
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,720
we're going to be using the longer text

819
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,880
string initializer over here and once I

820
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,840
uh put in that initializer I'm going to

821
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,519
be setting the text to results. bestest

822
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,320
transcript and this is the best

823
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,200
transcript that speech to text believes

824
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,320
that it could provide of the user's

825
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,600
Voice once that's done I'm going to be

826
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,919
giving it no alternate intents but then

827
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,519
and you see that there's this little

828
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,279
context parameter that it wants uh and

829
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,320
so this is actually going to be to uh be

830
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,279
equal to self. last context but you must

831
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,440
be wondering though last context is by

832
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,639
default nil why would we want to pass it

833
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:46,519
here well you're right in some in a way

834
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,639
but the message request actually takes

835
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,639
an optional context specifically uh and

836
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:55,279
so what happens is it's if uh last

837
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,559
context is nil anyway it's just as good

838
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:00,559
as saying nil to it directly uh however

839
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,720
if last context is full of some metadata

840
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,080
about our current conversation then of

841
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,679
course that will be sent over to the

842
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,679
message request and that can be sent to

843
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,600
conversation so the logic behind that

844
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,120
you'll understand in just a moment when

845
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,919
I add in the next few lines of code

846
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,279
that'll actually update that metadata

847
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,519
but you'll see that in just a moment of

848
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,679
course I'm going to be giving it no

849
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:23,840
entities no intents uh and of course no

850
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,159
output as of right

851
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,320
now once that's done though finally what

852
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,159
we need to do is call the message uh

853
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,279
sorry we have to call the message

854
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,399
function on conversation uh and so we're

855
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:39,320
going to be using the longer initializer

856
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,639
down there uh I'll paste in my workspace

857
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,360
ID in just a moment uh message request

858
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,480
we're going to be using the message

859
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,320
request that we just created I'm going

860
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,720
to again not Implement any failure

861
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,360
initializer you should be doing this in

862
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,240
your applications but I'm not right now

863
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,480
but then in terms of success initializer

864
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,639
I am and of course the one parameter

865
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,039
that will take in this completion

866
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,440
Handler will be called response and

867
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,159
there will be some code inside of this

868
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,679
message uh completion Handler here uh

869
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:08,600
and so I'll tell you what exactly that

870
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,240
code will do now so the first thing we

871
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,600
need to do though is update the

872
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,200
conversation

873
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,000
metadata and the way we can do this is

874
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,799
by setting self. context to the

875
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,080
response. context so basically the

876
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,440
context that Watson returned to us we're

877
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,720
putting that into the self last context

878
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,600
variable and the next time we send a

879
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,639
message to conversation this message

880
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,600
request over here will actually pass

881
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,639
that into the context and then this will

882
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,039
repeat and repeat and repeat until the

883
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,720
user's done ordering their pizza and

884
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,639
until then conversation will actually

885
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:45,120
keep track of the pizza

886
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,240
specifications so that's that logic

887
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,600
might seem a little bit confusing but

888
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,080
again if you've worked with conversation

889
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,360
before I'm almost sure that you'll uh uh

890
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,399
that you'll understand exactly what this

891
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,399
means uh and so then once you're done

892
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,559
that you can actually start working with

893
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,399
some entity and intent logic so let's

894
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,559
actually begin with our entity logic so

895
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,320
let's create a new response entity

896
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,159
constant over here and we're going to be

897
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,480
sending this to the response entities

898
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,760
and I'm going to be getting the first uh

899
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,560
from this array of entities now of

900
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,280
course there's always a possibility that

901
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,119
there's nothing in the entities array

902
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,159
and so first is nil and that's why it's

903
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,240
optional uh and so that's why we're

904
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
storing this in a temporary constant

905
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,119
right now uh and I'll be talking about

906
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,280
how we'll of course find the actual

907
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,040
output of entity in just a second here

908
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,919
so after that though we're also going to

909
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,520
do the same for the intent so response

910
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,079
intent is equal to the response intents

911
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,599
and again this is an array and we're

912
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,520
getting the first from this array again

913
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,599
could be nil and this is why we're going

914
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,399
to be putting some IFL statements here

915
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,760
so now let's put an IFL statement and

916
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,159
let's see IFL entity is equal to

917
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,000
response

918
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,880
entity this means that response entity

919
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,839
actually has something inside of it and

920
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,880
is not nil and so whatever if it's not

921
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
nil that value will be put into the

922
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
entity constant and the code inside of

923
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,720
this block will be called and so then

924
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,000
inside of this block we can use that

925
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,880
entity and the first thing let's do is

926
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,079
let's extract the entity's label by

927
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,760
doing entity.

928
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,839
entity and then let's extract the

929
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:24,240
entity's value by doing entity.

930
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,800
value then let's check if the entity

931
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,560
label

932
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,440
over

933
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,680
here was equal to

934
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,119
topping if the entity labels equal to

935
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,440
topping well I have to pause right here

936
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,640
there's a line of coder missing and I

937
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,760
purposely missed that out and the reason

938
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,400
being I have to explain some uh sort of

939
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
logic to you so if you take a look at

940
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,800
the screen now and just really

941
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,720
concentrate on that screen I'm going to

942
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,839
put in a few comments here and so as you

943
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:55,040
can see basically what what the logic is

944
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,760
behind this application is that int

945
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,480
topping numbers are handled by intents

946
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,319
and specific toppings are handled by

947
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:04,800
entities what I mean by this is let's

948
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,240
just say you say I'd like my first

949
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,240
topping as cheese or you know you could

950
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,800
phrase this however you'd want but this

951
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,119
is basically what you'd say this is what

952
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,920
you'd intend to say the intent here

953
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,000
would be topping one but the entity

954
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,400
would be topping cheese and so if we

955
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,839
were to combine these we would know

956
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:25,640
first topping cheese uh and so that's

957
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,079
what what what we're trying to implement

958
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,359
in terms of logic but there's one more

959
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,240
thing that you should see here though uh

960
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,640
which is that let's just say you were to

961
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,319
say I'd like cheese you wen't say you

962
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,920
wouldn't say I like my first topping

963
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
this cheese then who knows what the

964
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,720
intent will be we don't know because

965
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,440
Watson conversation hasn't been trained

966
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,680
to understand that uh but could be a

967
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,440
cheese crust right if that was one of

968
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,440
the opportunities exactly so you know

969
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,880
you you wouldn't know what this would

970
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,359
mean but our intent would know that this

971
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,640
is topping cheese because it sees the

972
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,000
word cheese inside of here and so what's

973
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,119
happening here is we get confused the

974
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,560
code gets confused and it doesn't set

975
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,520
your first topping to cheese because it

976
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,560
doesn't know which topping it should be

977
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,000
uh should be your first second or third

978
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
topping doesn't know uh but then let's

979
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,319
just say you say I'd like my first

980
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,359
topping which I'm not sure why you would

981
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,359
say something like that but if you were

982
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,400
to then your then your intent would be

983
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,400
topping one but there would be no entity

984
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,000
because there is no topping mentioned in

985
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,880
the sentence there's the word topping

986
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,839
but you're not specifying chicken cheese

987
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:30,040
olives or pineapple you're not

988
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,160
specifying any of that stuff so entities

989
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,440
don't come into account here and so

990
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,880
that's why that becomes a little bit

991
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,280
more confusing and so what we need to do

992
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,800
is before our if let statement we need

993
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,640
to create a variable called topping type

994
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,680
uh and this topping type variable will

995
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,680
be an optional uh string and so the

996
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
reason this is going to be an optional

997
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,800
string is because by default we want

998
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,480
this to be n okay however if our entity

999
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,400
contains a topic then what we're going

1000
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
to do is we're going to set this to that

1001
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,920
topping so inside of our new if

1002
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,720
statement where we say if entity label

1003
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
is equal to topping then what we do is

1004
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,280
we set as you probably guessed tobing

1005
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,960
type to The Entity value not the label

1006
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,280
and so in this case our label would be

1007
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,119
topping but our value would be something

1008
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,440
like cheese and then when we're handling

1009
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,520
the intense later then we can see okay

1010
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,920
which number of topping were they

1011
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,800
talking about were they talking about

1012
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,040
their first topping second or third uh

1013
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,920
and depending on that we can of course

1014
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,880
continue and Implement our logic so

1015
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,920
that's how that works and since we're on

1016
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,680
the topic of intents anyway let's

1017
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,520
Implement our intent handling uh so

1018
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,960
after your IFL statement for the entity

1019
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,680
let's implement the IFL statement for

1020
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,119
the intent uh and so we're going to say

1021
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,280
if let intent is equal to response

1022
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,680
intent and if this is true again if

1023
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,760
response intent is not nil uh then the

1024
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,359
value of response intent will be put

1025
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,520
into intent and then this this block

1026
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,640
code will be executed so let's actually

1027
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,400
say um maybe something like uh intent oh

1028
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,680
sorry no we have to actually check

1029
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,760
something first uh so what we need to do

1030
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,400
is we need to create a new constant

1031
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,880
called contextual intent and set this to

1032
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
the actual string value of the intent

1033
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,560
the actual name of the intent uh and so

1034
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,599
then what we do uh is once we've got

1035
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,160
that down we have to put in a few if

1036
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,400
statements unfortunately a lot of if

1037
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,000
statements uh so the first one we're

1038
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,960
going to do though is say if contextual

1039
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,359
intent

1040
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,599
is equal to size small now the size

1041
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,760
small intent means as you probably

1042
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,160
guessed the user wants a small pizza and

1043
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,200
so we can say small pizza and we can set

1044
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,560
self. size to

1045
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,240
small now of course we can continue this

1046
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,560
exact pattern uh for all the rest of the

1047
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,839
I'd say around 10 and T here uh but of

1048
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:54,400
course as you can probably guess that

1049
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,359
would take a lot of time uh and I don't

1050
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:58,119
want to of course spend your time on the

1051
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,240
live stream right now uh and so instead

1052
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,839
of spending your time what I've gone

1053
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,319
ahead and done is I'm just going to

1054
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,800
paste in these if statements from

1055
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,319
another screen

1056
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,079
here so I'm just going to copy and paste

1057
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,640
and for those wondering we've provided

1058
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,200
this also via your GitHub exactly so you

1059
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,280
know you don't have to worry about

1060
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
missing out on that it'll be available

1061
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,440
to you to follow along exactly so right

1062
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,400
after this event the actual final source

1063
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,240
code will be open sourced uh however

1064
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,960
though uh the uh starter code you can

1065
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,280
actually find on GitHub right now and if

1066
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,599
you'd like you can actually follow along

1067
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,520
with us right now have any questions or

1068
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,839
issues you can leave them in the live

1069
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,680
chat uh James will be giving me some

1070
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,960
more questions later of course we're

1071
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,280
going to be doing a great Q&A uh but

1072
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,040
let's continue as you can see we're

1073
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,640
getting an error and I made this error

1074
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,319
on purpose uh but why well there's a

1075
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:46,839
simple reason I need to explain some

1076
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:50,160
more logic to you so so it's happening

1077
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,240
here we're getting an error because log

1078
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,040
Pizza is a variable that hasn't been

1079
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,640
defined yet but what's log Pizza well

1080
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,680
when the user's intent is done and that

1081
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,160
means they're done ordering their Pizza

1082
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,280
they finalized their specifications then

1083
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,640
we want to take the actual Pizza

1084
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,920
specifications and print them out onto

1085
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,880
the screen for the user to see just as

1086
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,040
you saw in the demo how at the end it

1087
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,880
said size large sauce easy you know

1088
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,960
crust thin topping one cheese topping

1089
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,000
two chicken topping three nothing uh

1090
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,520
when it said that it was because of the

1091
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,640
log Pizza variable and the log Pizza

1092
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,400
variable is saying okay the next time we

1093
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,720
go into the main operation queue we're

1094
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,240
actually going to paste out all of those

1095
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,760
pizza specification onto the screen and

1096
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,000
so the way we're going to do this is by

1097
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,680
before our if let for the intent we're

1098
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,720
going to create a new constant uh or

1099
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,400
variable sorry called log pizza and this

1100
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,280
is going to be equal to false and Swift

1101
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,880
will type inference this as a Boolean uh

1102
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,760
and so after your IFL let though you can

1103
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,920
actually go back into the main operation

1104
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,400
queue in order to change the UI we're

1105
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
going to add an operation here and here

1106
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,800
we're actually going to do a few UI

1107
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,160
changes the first one is again as you

1108
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,200
saw in the demo when Watson replies to

1109
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,119
us it doesn't just say out what it said

1110
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,640
it also says watson colon then says what

1111
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,880
Watson said and so basically what we're

1112
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,359
going to do now is we're going to say

1113
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:12,800
okay uh we get to the conversation list

1114
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,400
self. conversation list and we append to

1115
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,560
its text again another row that has what

1116
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,040
Watson conversation uh replied to it so

1117
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,880
response uh.

1118
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,839
output. text tt. first and of course

1119
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,680
we're forcefully unwrapping you should

1120
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,319
be implementing error handling in your

1121
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,640
actual application though and so this

1122
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,760
will actually add out what Watson

1123
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,599
replied to the user in this onto the

1124
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,119
text View and of course I forgot to put

1125
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,960
do text here so that's a must here all

1126
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,119
right so once you've got that done then

1127
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,480
we put in an if statement to see if log

1128
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,559
Pizza uh and if log pizza then we want

1129
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:55,680
to put all those pizza specifications as

1130
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,680
you saw onto the screen

1131
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,720
and so quite simply all you need to do

1132
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,000
here uh is do something like maybe copy

1133
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,800
this line of code here paste it in and

1134
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,280
change this to size and change this to

1135
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,480
self. size and again since we have quite

1136
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,559
a few Pizza specifications uh and this

1137
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,800
is still a small application uh I'm just

1138
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,440
going to paste in those other Pizza

1139
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,000
specifications from another screen of

1140
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,319
code as you can see these are all our

1141
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,960
pizza specifications so it'll print out

1142
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,119
the size crust sauce topping one two and

1143
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:28,880
three once that's done though after log

1144
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Pizza you're finally ready to work with

1145
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,599
the last final step in the pipeline and

1146
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,640
this is your text to speech service and

1147
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,920
finally after this you can actually go

1148
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,440
ahead and order some pizzas using this

1149
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,240
poot uh so all you need to do in order

1150
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,200
to work with text to speech you create a

1151
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,559
new text to speech constant set this to

1152
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,440
a new text to speech object and again I

1153
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,000
have my own credentials for this service

1154
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,880
so I'm going to be pasting those in

1155
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,559
right now

1156
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,079
as you can see here I've got my

1157
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,240
credentials here uh and then what I'm

1158
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,640
going to do is quite simply no message

1159
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,359
request or settings or anything to be

1160
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,400
done just do text to

1161
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,200
speech. synthesize use the smaller

1162
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,359
initializer give it the text as what

1163
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:17,000
Watson returned by going to the response

1164
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,880
getting the output getting the text and

1165
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,000
then of course getting the first in that

1166
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,319
array and then your success completion

1167
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,119
Handler will contain an object of data

1168
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,839
and just call this audio for example uh

1169
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,520
and then you have some code now I'm

1170
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,240
going to be pasting something in here

1171
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
let me let me show you this so basically

1172
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,000
what I'm going to do here and this is

1173
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,839
actually pretty important uh is I'm

1174
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,480
going to get a new shared instance of an

1175
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,160
AV Audio session uh and I'm going to be

1176
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,680
overriding the audio ports to make sure

1177
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,960
it plays audio through the speaker but

1178
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,760
what does this mean well it's quite

1179
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,640
simple so with an iPhone specifically an

1180
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,319
iPhone not iPads don't do this iPod

1181
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,720
Touches don't do this only iPhones when

1182
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,319
by default when you tell them to play

1183
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:00,720
audio they'll actually play it through

1184
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,400
the earpiece so the audio will be very

1185
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,720
dim and so you won't be able to hear

1186
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,480
anything but we want really loud audio

1187
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,480
so you can actually hear something uh

1188
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,640
and so what's going to happen is we need

1189
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,839
to actually override the earpiece and go

1190
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,760
directly to the speaker but there's a

1191
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,720
little problem now let me actually tell

1192
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,359
you a quick story here so while I was at

1193
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,880
ium developer connect 2016 I actually

1194
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,880
had my ass tme application which had

1195
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,200
speech to text as well and it would use

1196
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,599
code or text to speech sorry and and it

1197
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,800
used code similar to this and so one

1198
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,640
thing you must note here is that this

1199
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,359
won't just override the earpiece it'll

1200
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,359
override the headphone the HDMI

1201
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,920
lightning everything and so uh you will

1202
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,640
be able to hear the speaker but the

1203
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,880
audience won't be able to hear the

1204
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,760
speakers at all so you might want to

1205
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,079
stay careful of that so if you'd

1206
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,720
actually like like to play this to

1207
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,640
speakers or headphones or something of

1208
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,480
that sort you'd want to implement your

1209
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,839
own Logic for overriding specifically

1210
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,800
the earpiece going to the speakers if

1211
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,400
there are no headphones phones or

1212
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,000
anything else plugged in so you're

1213
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,440
probably going to want to implement that

1214
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,760
if you want that

1215
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,040
functionality all right so once that's

1216
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,000
done though we can actually play our

1217
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
audio and the way we can do this is by

1218
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,559
going to the self. player as you know we

1219
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:13,880
created in the beginning of this uh live

1220
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,280
event and we're going to be forcefully

1221
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,280
trying to set this to a new AV Audio

1222
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,079
player we'll be using the data

1223
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,839
initializer and we'll be using the data

1224
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,640
that Watson text to speech returned to

1225
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,720
us in the audio variable once that's

1226
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,079
done done we're going to be telling the

1227
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,400
a self. player to prepare to play and

1228
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,079
then self. player to actually play and

1229
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,920
from there you are done coding in this

1230
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,640
application but one last line of code

1231
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,440
all you need to do I'm hungry I know but

1232
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,119
just one last line of code I promise and

1233
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,559
then sell uh sorry so all you need to do

1234
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,359
is set the start stop buttons title to

1235
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:55,839
start sorry not star start and then set

1236
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,040
it to a normal by control State and you

1237
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,599
are done coding all you need to do now

1238
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,640
is go back to your main. storyboard

1239
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,720
connect the IB Outlet to the text View

1240
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,280
and of course the button so I've

1241
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,880
connected my IB Outlets to the text View

1242
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,760
and the button and then I connect my IB

1243
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,000
action from the button to the uh View

1244
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,640
and then we are completely done our

1245
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,079
button now knows how exact oh sorry I

1246
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,160
didn't connect the ibaction properly

1247
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,440
anyway so now our button knows exactly

1248
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,240
what to do when it's clicked our text

1249
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,040
view knows what output to give when it's

1250
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,119
done uh and of course this application

1251
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,559
is ready to be tested would you like to

1252
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,599
test this out now all right so what I'm

1253
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:36,960
going to do is I'm going to first of all

1254
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,480
uh connect my phone to my Mac because we

1255
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,000
can't do that um we can't test this

1256
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,880
application out without connecting uh so

1257
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,640
it's going to be a little bit of uh lag

1258
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,440
between putting this phone on screen so

1259
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,319
what I'm going to do here is I am going

1260
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,000
to run this onto my

1261
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,359
device and then

1262
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,599
we

1263
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,079
will okay so right okay so it's going to

1264
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,400
run on my device you'll be able to see

1265
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,960
it on screen in just a moment uh

1266
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,839
unfortunately these lightning to hdmis

1267
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,680
don't allow you to transfer data through

1268
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,079
the lightning Port that they give you

1269
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:13,119
only Power so that doesn't work come on

1270
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,319
Mac Apple okay so then we can continue

1271
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,119
I'm going to plug this back in as you

1272
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,960
can see on the TV right now we've got my

1273
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,520
phone and there we go as you can see now

1274
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,280
this is the application that we just

1275
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,240
coded in live Let's test it

1276
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,640
out

1277
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,880
hello as you can

1278
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,599
see it

1279
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:42,599
says or at least should say in just a

1280
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:44,680
moment here oh one thing I forgot to do

1281
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,599
in the code is we have to paste in the

1282
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:49,000
workspace ID for conversation of course

1283
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
or else how will it know where to go so

1284
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,079
you have to do is go back to the code uh

1285
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:54,720
so you already know where this is I've

1286
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,200
already shown you this I'm just going to

1287
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,799
paste in the conversation ID uh and then

1288
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:02,319
we will switch back to the phone uh so

1289
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,720
workspace ID right there all right so

1290
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,640
then we

1291
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,400
just put run this back right back onto

1292
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,240
our phone and then we should be able to

1293
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,520
test out our

1294
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,079
application all

1295
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:23,240
right run the

1296
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,520
app and in just a moment it should run

1297
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,240
onto my phone and then you'll be able to

1298
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,440
see it on the screen once I plug it

1299
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,599
in all right we've got this running and

1300
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,000
switch

1301
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,960
over so you can see here shows my phone

1302
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,040
and now we can actually test it

1303
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,240
out

1304
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,240
hello so in theory the recording works

1305
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,960
fine what size pizza would you like all

1306
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,200
right so Watson is able to reply to us

1307
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,960
using text and speech it's able to so so

1308
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,160
we've seen that the recording works

1309
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,119
works perfectly speech for text works

1310
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,599
perfectly conversation Works nicely uh

1311
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,520
what the text view Works nicely and of

1312
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,200
course text to speech works perfectly as

1313
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,559
well and this is our live coded in

1314
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:13,160
application I'm not using the older

1315
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,680
application right now and that is how

1316
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,000
you can Implement your own little pizza

1317
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,119
ordering chatbot that will actually call

1318
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:22,799
a rest API when it's done ordering the

1319
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:25,720
pizza in order to actually get your

1320
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,079
pizza all right so I guess it's Pizza

1321
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,440
time again uh but now just before we end

1322
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,240
off with this application as I said I

1323
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,040
have another little surprise I guess uh

1324
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,559
with node.js and this application so

1325
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,799
let's take a quick look over here back

1326
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:45,760
at our uh presentation here uh and so

1327
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,680
this is our system before or no we have

1328
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,319
to switch back to the Mac uh this was

1329
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:54,760
our system before all right uh right

1330
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,960
over here uh and so this this allow the

1331
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,079
user to order a pizza using the

1332
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,119
application but there are a few problems

1333
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,520
with this first of all you have to keep

1334
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,799
you know updating the software uh

1335
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:07,400
according to the newer Swifts that come

1336
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,000
out uh of course we have to have you

1337
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,240
know the user has to have have an iOS

1338
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,400
application specifically they can't have

1339
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,599
another type of device uh like they

1340
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:17,960
can't order it from a flip phone for

1341
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,160
example uh so there are just a few

1342
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,240
problems with how this is implemented

1343
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,839
which can't really be solved by creating

1344
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,319
more and more and more applications for

1345
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:28,359
different types of devices and so the

1346
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:31,280
way that I've decided we can combat this

1347
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,319
is by instead of using my own custom

1348
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:37,720
application we use twio and so twilio

1349
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,440
will allow us to actually order these

1350
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,319
pizzas through SMS that's right we can

1351
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,599
actually use twio in this case and

1352
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:46,200
through that means we could really order

1353
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,799
a pizza from a flip phone we could order

1354
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:49,880
it from an iPhone really anywhere where

1355
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,240
you can send an SMS from anywhere around

1356
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,960
the world uh and so now as you know with

1357
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,880
SMS speech to text and text to speech

1358
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,760
don't really come in because of course

1359
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,000
we have direct SMS uh so those have to

1360
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,240
go so those services are no longer in

1361
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,119
use uh now of course though we can't

1362
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:09,839
have twilio directly communicate with

1363
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,040
the rest API and conversation so we need

1364
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,119
to implement a node.js server in between

1365
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:18,079
and twilio will contact the node.js

1366
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,240
server whenever it receives a request

1367
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,119
from the user and that then then the

1368
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,520
node.js server will send that to

1369
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,520
conversation conversation will reply to

1370
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,200
the node.js server and it'll send that

1371
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,480
back to twilio for the user and of

1372
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,319
course once the user is done ordering

1373
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:33,359
their Pizza the nodejs server will

1374
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,880
actually send that request to the rest

1375
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,079
API in order to have the rest API order

1376
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:42,079
their Pizza in fact now let's take a

1377
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,520
look at a demo of how that can itself

1378
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,119
can be uh can be implemented uh and so

1379
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,720
now if I just open up my messages here

1380
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,480
I'm going to compose a new message then

1381
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,880
I'm going to switch over to my phone uh

1382
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,119
and then while it switches over I'm

1383
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,280
going to go into my Linux

1384
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,599
um box over here and I'm going to start

1385
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:05,640
a nodejs script if it'll load that is um

1386
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,720
sometimes the internet doesn't want to

1387
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,720
cooperate with you so just give it a

1388
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,599
moment so as you can see this is behind

1389
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:13,400
me uh but it might just take me a moment

1390
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,280
here to set up

1391
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,359
the

1392
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,720
actual Linux so basically what I'm going

1393
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,359
to be doing now is I'm going to be

1394
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:25,520
opening up or you know opening uh that

1395
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,160
to no Js that comes in between uh the

1396
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,920
twio conversation and the rest API all

1397
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,880
right so it should work technically uh

1398
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,720
so as you can see behind me we've got my

1399
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,319
phone once again uh my text message and

1400
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,720
so I'm actually going to be composing a

1401
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,359
new message to my Twi out number that

1402
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:44,280
I've got set up and as you can see what

1403
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,200
I'm going to do is again just like we

1404
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,000
said to my application I'm going to say

1405
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,480
hi to twio and it returns to with hello

1406
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,200
what size pizza would you like and of

1407
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,760
course from here we can continue our

1408
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,280
conversation of course just like we did

1409
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,599
last time we'd like a large pizza uh

1410
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:05,119
sure what uh what toppings do we have

1411
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,960
just to prove though that this is

1412
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,440
actually keeping in track of the context

1413
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,200
uh and the flow of our conversation I

1414
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,119
can ask it for the options which

1415
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,640
otherwise it wouldn't be able to tell me

1416
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,640
about the toppings unless I was keeping

1417
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,480
track of the conversation and the

1418
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,040
context which it has and it says we have

1419
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,079
cheese olives pineapples and chicken is

1420
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:25,240
toppings you can have three toppings

1421
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,440
tops and from here of course I can

1422
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,599
continue my conversation with lson and I

1423
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,520
can continue to order my pizza for my

1424
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,400
SMS and the best part is though that

1425
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,559
this will actually keep track of each

1426
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,680
phone's context variable independently

1427
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,920
so you could have 500 people messaging

1428
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,040
it at once and each one would remain

1429
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,359
separate and it wouldn't get those

1430
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,280
orders mixed up ever and so generally

1431
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,880
the the implementation of this is very

1432
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,720
very interesting and in fact you can see

1433
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,599
this source code on my GitHub page as

1434
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,640
well nice all right so that's what we

1435
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,000
had for this Facebook live event today

1436
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,119
but just before we go though uh I mean

1437
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,160
we would like to do a quick Q&A uh but

1438
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,079
one more thing is though uh that I'd

1439
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,880
like to say first of all a few

1440
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,760
conferences of ibms uh first of all oh

1441
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,240
sorry we've got connect 2017 here uh so

1442
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,359
connect 2017 is going to be a conference

1443
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,760
all about IBM Watson uh so this is going

1444
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,880
to be held in San Francisco from

1445
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,839
February 20th to 23rd it's going to be a

1446
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:27,920
really interesting conference so I'd

1447
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,880
recommend you check that out uh but of

1448
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,319
course apart from that we've also got

1449
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:33,640
interconnect 2017 which you'll be at

1450
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,280
right exactly I'm going to be presenting

1451
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,520
at interconnect 2017 it's going to be

1452
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,880
held from March 19th to 23rd in Las

1453
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,400
Vegas so I'd recommend you check that

1454
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,880
out as well might even be interesting to

1455
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,799
meet some of you uh at interconnect

1456
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,240
he'll be doing a book signing hopefully

1457
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,240
yes so maybe let's see U so apart from

1458
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,319
that uh of course we've also got amplify

1459
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:54,599
which is going to be held almost at the

1460
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,720
same time as interconnect again Las

1461
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,000
Vegas March 20th to 22nd uh so of course

1462
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,760
again all about IBM Watson and IBM Blu

1463
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,079
miix and uh basically how you can

1464
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,359
combine things like cloud and cognitive

1465
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,760
uh to your application Advantage now

1466
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,480
before we get to questions can you pull

1467
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,480
up um like your contacts or where they

1468
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,960
can follow you on the social media sure

1469
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,280
so as you can see here this is my

1470
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,319
contact information uh so this is my

1471
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,799
GitHub as well if you'd like to see my

1472
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:21,520
open source projects and the code for

1473
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,000
this application uh of course my YouTube

1474
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,559
email Twitter and Linkedin but of course

1475
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,240
though you can actually uh also this is

1476
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,680
my book hello Swift that I've written uh

1477
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,799
hello Swift iOS at programming for kids

1478
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,839
and other beginners uh and of course you

1479
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:36,520
can actually pre-order this online on

1480
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,240
the Publishers website and many other

1481
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,359
bookstores as well if you'd like to uh

1482
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:42,520
and of course you can actually just

1483
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,559
search up hell Swift and pre-order that

1484
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,880
if you'd like all right so now I guess

1485
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,640
we can actually uh start the Q&A of

1486
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,799
course our pizza was ordered uh so

1487
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:55,480
that's nice uh thank you so let's begin

1488
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,039
quick Q

1489
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,160
all right let's see what we

1490
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,359
got all

1491
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,920
right so Tammy while I'm looking for

1492
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,680
questions why don't you um get them

1493
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,960
interested in like how you got started

1494
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,880
with Watson sure definitely uh well the

1495
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,440
way I actually got started with Watson

1496
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,280
is actually quite interesting and quite

1497
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,240
coincidental uh so what happened is

1498
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,240
around one and a half years ago I was

1499
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,880
really interested in you know General

1500
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,400
programming really uh and so what

1501
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,640
happened is actually this was in uh nove

1502
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,160
just uh just before November of 2015 I

1503
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,280
was really interested in things like uh

1504
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,280
programming in general and so I was you

1505
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,960
know on YouTube I was creating YouTube

1506
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,599
videos and so in my recommended pain I

1507
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,319
actually saw a documentary about the

1508
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,760
smartest computer in the world and I was

1509
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,079
like okay what's this it was a 42-minute

1510
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,839
documentary and it highlighted exactly

1511
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:46,720
how Watson was able to play Jeopardy how

1512
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,359
it learns what machine learning is what

1513
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:52,000
AI is and I was just so so interested by

1514
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,280
all of this and so I was immediately

1515
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,680
hooked to I Watson uh and so I couldn't

1516
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,039
resist myself but to see what IBM Watson

1517
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,520
is nowadays and I was absolutely

1518
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,359
thrilled to see that Watson actually

1519
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:05,079
provided things like developer apis uh

1520
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:06,799
and so what happened is I actually

1521
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,280
started working with those those

1522
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,520
developer apis my first API was

1523
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,640
retrieving rank that I used uh so it was

1524
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,359
generally very interesting how I got

1525
00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:17,760
into IBM Watson uh and of course though

1526
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,480
uh apart from that I actually released

1527
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,559
my first IBM Watson video in November of

1528
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,799
2015 uh and so of course I actually

1529
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,200
presented my very first Watson

1530
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,000
application at interconnect 2016 2016 uh

1531
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,079
which I had developed called as tme

1532
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,599
which is an nlqa

1533
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,920
system so that's how we got uh started

1534
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,559
off with

1535
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:40,880
Watson great no um tamy are there any of

1536
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,960
the services that you enjoy most from

1537
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,559
the Watson well I actually got asked

1538
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,440
this I don't exactly remember when but

1539
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,240
um I got asked this a lot uh and so what

1540
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,599
I have to say there though is that I

1541
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:54,920
don't necessarily have a favorite Watson

1542
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,760
API but the reason being here though is

1543
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,200
that they're all completely different

1544
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,880
they're all good in their own use cases

1545
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,760
uh but if you were to say the one that I

1546
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,640
find would be best for most use cases

1547
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,200
really interesting and really fun to

1548
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,440
work with I'd say visual recognition and

1549
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,079
the natural language classifier would

1550
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,119
have to be uh and so the only thing is

1551
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,240
though you know things like retrieving

1552
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,920
rank natural language classifier they

1553
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,440
have such different use cases that I

1554
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,319
can't really compare them uh with each

1555
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,880
other and see which one's better

1556
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,039
necessarily uh but in terms of

1557
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:25,559
interestingness I think visual

1558
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:27,240
recognition and the natural language

1559
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,480
classifier take the cake there nice do

1560
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,640
what um projects do you have working on

1561
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,319
right now that you maybe are interested

1562
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,319
in sharing with the team uh well I am

1563
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,520
actually working on quite a few projects

1564
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,520
most of them uh are quite secret for now

1565
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,559
though of course I am of also working on

1566
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,520
a lot of projects to make the like kids

1567
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,880
and their parents lives easier uh of

1568
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,720
course I'm working towards uh helping

1569
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,480
people with disabilities as well which

1570
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,559
you'll see more about this type of stuff

1571
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,760
at interconnect 20177

1572
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,119
so again that's what I'm saying uh you

1573
00:59:58,119 --> 00:59:59,799
might just want to check that out as

1574
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:03,240
well um one of the questions I see is

1575
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,760
regarding the apis from Watson's if

1576
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,720
someone was to get started yes what

1577
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,480
would you recommend for someone to get

1578
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,760
started with no JS if that's their

1579
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,240
programming language of prefence sure

1580
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,559
yeah in order to get started like the

1581
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:17,480
Watson API to get started with Watson

1582
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,480
I'd say the natural language classifier

1583
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,319
the reason is because it's extremely

1584
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:23,760
simple to train requires very very

1585
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,400
little training data so if you don't if

1586
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,680
you're not like a data scientist and you

1587
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,760
don't have a lot of data available you

1588
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,200
don't have like an abundance of data

1589
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,240
natural language classifier is great to

1590
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,799
start off uh and so it just generally it

1591
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,720
trains very quickly trains nicely and

1592
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,280
it's accurate so I believe that the

1593
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,720
natural language classifier is a great

1594
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,760
starting point at least uh and from

1595
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,200
there though and it also has a lot of

1596
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,440
use cases so you won't have trouble uh

1597
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,079
like deciding for example uh what you

1598
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,440
what example you might want to create uh

1599
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,920
but apart from that if you've already

1600
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,319
experimented with a natural language

1601
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:54,440
classifier and you're looking for a

1602
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,400
little bit more challenge next I'd

1603
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,280
recommend the conversation service

1604
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,839
because again it's practically the

1605
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,680
natural language classifier and dialogue

1606
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,799
combined dialogue already wasn't really

1607
01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:06,039
hard to use natural language classifier

1608
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:08,119
extremely simple to use combined they're

1609
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,799
really powerful and simple to use uh and

1610
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,319
of course provide a lot of use cases so

1611
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:14,720
natural language classifier and

1612
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,039
conversation would have to be

1613
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:19,799
it um so some of the other things that

1614
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:22,079
we had so some people

1615
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,640
um someone said what if the web services

1616
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,640
stop supporting the API do you jump onto

1617
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,760
another

1618
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,079
language well okay so uh sorry could you

1619
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:32,280
repeat the question yeah I don't know if

1620
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,039
it came out right um it says what at the

1621
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:35,680
web services well actually you know I

1622
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,799
had one because as they saw you were

1623
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:39,680
having to manually enter things yes

1624
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,000
right okay how would you want to work

1625
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,880
around that so that way you know is

1626
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,720
there way to deliv the web sockets

1627
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,200
exactly so speech DET text the Watson

1628
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,200
speech DET text service uh in fact the

1629
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,520
Watson speech detect Swift SDK which I'm

1630
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,559
using in my application actually

1631
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,799
provides support for web sockets in

1632
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,799
their applications uh and so what

1633
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,720
happens is like for example here since I

1634
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,119
didn't want to of course complicate all

1635
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,880
of this and show you how to do things

1636
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,920
like websockets with this what I did is

1637
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,279
I created this very very barebone and

1638
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:11,520
simple application where we've got this

1639
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,279
recorder that records a wave file and

1640
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:15,520
that wave file sent a speech to text but

1641
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,039
what you could do is you could have this

1642
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,480
websocket uh that would of course listen

1643
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,000
to you and stream transcripts back to

1644
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,279
you uh as you say them so like as you

1645
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,880
were to say sentence uh each word would

1646
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,480
be sent individually back to the

1647
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,799
application and added to the text View

1648
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:33,880
and it would automatically stop right as

1649
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,400
you're done speaking and it detects that

1650
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,440
you're done speaking and so of course

1651
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,880
Watson speech detex does actually

1652
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,559
provide that support it's just that I

1653
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:41,880
haven't implemented it in this

1654
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,319
application due to Simplicity I wanted

1655
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,960
it to be as simple as possible for you

1656
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,559
to be able to understand the concept

1657
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,640
behind it someone asked so you've done

1658
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,520
about a year now with us right when we

1659
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,359
first met each other I found you online

1660
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:56,960
Yes actually we interacted that way and

1661
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,440
we've been brothers ever since actually

1662
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,440
a lot of trips and Journeys um so but

1663
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,640
someone want to say that why did you go

1664
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,640
with like Watson from IBM standpoint

1665
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,119
versus I don't know you've got aure and

1666
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,839
you've gots or Google well there are

1667
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,440
actually quite a few reasons and I

1668
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,359
actually get asked this quite quite

1669
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,640
often uh the reason I'd say number one

1670
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,000
that I prefer IBM Watson over something

1671
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,119
like Google's cognitive cloud or maybe

1672
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,079
aour as you said would be that Watson

1673
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,480
first of all focuses a lot on natural

1674
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,000
language that's what that from the

1675
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,079
beginning as you know Watson's main goal

1676
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,400
was to understand and reason with

1677
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,200
natural language and that's one of the

1678
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,720
reasons and plus Watson really allows

1679
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,839
you to work with your own data where you

1680
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,520
know like Watson's visual recognition

1681
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,039
service allows you to use its own

1682
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:47,880
default classifier in order to do things

1683
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,400
like take a picture of a bird and it'll

1684
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,079
tell you there's a bird in the picture

1685
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:52,760
but you can also create your own

1686
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,799
classifiers for example where with

1687
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,680
Google's cognitive Cloud you can do that

1688
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,880
very easily at least you can but it's

1689
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,440
not intuitive is it's just not it's not

1690
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,799
as simple to do with Watson and it's not

1691
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:07,400
as powerful in in that context uh and so

1692
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,799
and Watson also provides a wide a much

1693
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:13,119
wider range of services than any other

1694
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,839
cognitive Cloud uh that I I've seen at

1695
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,960
least until now so that's really why I

1696
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,640
prefer Watson uh over most of these

1697
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,119
other services that are provided by

1698
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,039
other

1699
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:26,520
companies let's see some other ones is

1700
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,319
so Tammy you're um you're you just

1701
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,920
turned 13 or yes 13 October 16th I

1702
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,920
turned 13 um I know you've had

1703
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,160
interactions with some of the other

1704
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,000
companies especially regarding Walmart

1705
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,880
right and I think Walmart asked you

1706
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,119
something specifically like how did you

1707
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,039
learn so much about analytics data

1708
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:47,920
science machine learning yes so I think

1709
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,440
it's a good question for a lot of people

1710
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,960
out there that are really hungry to grow

1711
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,799
their knowledge there how how can they

1712
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:56,319
follow in your recommendations yeah you

1713
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,240
know there's actually this one thing

1714
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,480
that I'd like to tell you it's pretty

1715
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,520
much all about doing stuff so like for

1716
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,200
example when I found out about Watson

1717
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,760
Not only was I hooked to how these

1718
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,039
Watson apis work I was hooked to

1719
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,359
something else that came much before

1720
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,079
Watson apis which was the original

1721
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:15,640
Watson that played Jeopardy I was very

1722
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,400
interested in how that worked and I

1723
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,520
wanted to create my own nlqa system for

1724
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,400
example and so I created as tme after

1725
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,599
many many months of research and reading

1726
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:27,319
about I'd say 15 entire papers about

1727
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:30,440
nlqa systems I finally got to one called

1728
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,640
ask MSR which is what ask tan is based

1729
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,720
off of or ask Microsoft research which

1730
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,880
they developed in 2002 uh but you know

1731
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,400
basically what I like to say is like for

1732
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,520
example the nlqa system I developed uh

1733
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,319
that led me to finding out more things

1734
01:05:45,319 --> 01:05:47,039
about machine learning and finding out

1735
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,599
more things about machine learning led

1736
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:50,119
me to learn about things like neural

1737
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:52,599
networks and once I had things like oh

1738
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:53,880
what's a neural network once I knew what

1739
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,640
a neural network is and once I know what

1740
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,559
what all these different machine

1741
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,480
learning algorithms are I start to get

1742
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,960
interested in like hey what's a neural

1743
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,720
network and then I do a few weeks of

1744
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,200
research on neural networks and I start

1745
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,920
to find out how they work and then in

1746
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,440
the process of learning how to use

1747
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,000
neural networks I learn about some other

1748
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,240
concept entirely and I get so interested

1749
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,200
and I just one thing leads to another

1750
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,520
and I just you know continually uh learn

1751
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,960
through uh basically learning one thing

1752
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,359
and then having that teach you another

1753
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,319
thing and then continuing like that

1754
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:23,000
that's usually how I like to of course

1755
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,400
learn uh with machine learn with thing

1756
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,279
topics like machine learning uh

1757
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:29,799
especially due to the fact that there is

1758
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:31,960
actually quite a bit of I guess you

1759
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,640
could there are quite a few resources

1760
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,920
online to help you do that uh so I think

1761
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,000
it's really interesting uh how it's How

1762
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,680
uh basically um if you think about it

1763
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,119
compar it to other topics machine

1764
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:45,720
learning doesn't have the most material

1765
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,760
online but whatever material is out

1766
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,480
there is extremely useful so it just

1767
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,480
turns out to I found out about feed

1768
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,799
forward neural networks it takes me to

1769
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:56,039
convolutional then recurrent Etc ET

1770
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:58,160
so just continuing in a cycle like that

1771
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,400
really does help me learn as much as

1772
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,279
possible great answer unfortunately

1773
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:05,039
we've got a lot of comments here but

1774
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,400
we've got to wrap it up so for anyone

1775
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,920
that has asked questions like I saw the
