hello everyone welcome to another video
by simply learnt in this video we will
discuss about raspberry pi
the raspberry pi foundation developed a
series of small single board computers
in the united kingdom so let's look at
today's agenda
we'll first discuss what is raspberry pi
then we will see some of the raspberry
pi use cases
followed by which we will see the
different types of raspberry pi boards
available
proceeding further we will see the
applications of raspberry pi and lastly
we will see the advantages and
disadvantages of raspberry pi but before
we begin make sure you have subscribed
to our youtube channel and clicked on
the bell icon so you never miss an
update from simply learn so without
wasting any further time let's get
started with what is raspberry pi
the raspberry pi is a small low cost
computer the size of a credit card that
connects to a computer monitor or
television and utilizes a conventional
keyboard and mouse
raspberry pi can do everything a desktop
computer does including accessing the
internet
using raspberry pi we can watch high
definition videos access spreadsheets
word processing and play games
the raspberry pi can communicate with
the outside world and has been used in
variety of digital maker projects
raspberry pi is also used in music
machines and parent detectors as well as
weather stations and tweeting bird
houses with infrared cameras
raspberry pi use cases
raspberry pi is using computer desktop
a simple desktop can be built using a
raspberry pi a micro sd card and a power
source an hdmi cable and a suitable
display such as an old monitor are also
required you will also need a usb
keyboard and a mouse
robotics controller there are numerous
raspberry pi robot controller projects a
specific robotics package for pi is
available which is powered by the device
battery and can be used to interface
with and control robots
printing using a raspberry pi with the
raspberry pi we can print anything all
we need is raspberry pi that's connected
to your home network as well as some
print server software this is
accomplished by first installing the
samba file sharing program then cups
cup stands for common unix printing
system includes printer drivers as well
as management console
game server
the basic operating system for raspberry
pi has a special version of mini craft
game pre-installed the raspberry pi
applications can be used as a game
server it's fantastic mini craft game
server a wonderful gaming experience can
be created by using many raspberry pi
game machine
as a retro gaming machine the raspberry
pi is perfect it is one of the machine's
lightest components the raspberry pi
zero in particular is a variant that can
fit into small locations and be used for
gaming projects the raspberry pi may
also be used to restore many popular
16-bit game systems
now let us look at the types of
raspberry pi
the different types of raspberry pi are
raspberry pi model b raspberry pi model
a
raspberry pi model b plus raspberry pi
model a plus raspberry pi zero raspberry
pi 2 raspberry pi 3 model b
and raspberry pi 0w
the different applications of raspberry
pi are it is used as media streamer
tablet computer
internet radio
home automation
robotics command
arcade devices
cosmic computer and different raspberry
pi projects
now let us look at the advantages of
raspberry pi
raspberry pi is about the size of a
credit card
the raspberry pi is inexpensive
using raspberry pi to function as a
server is more efficient than using a
regular server
the raspberry pi is ideal for adaptive
technology because it can display
visuals as well as play movies
the micro computer can be used by small
businesses on a tight budget to use
their product or build new technology
that integrates the product
now let us look at the disadvantages of
raspberry pi
raspberry pi is not a computer
replacement and the processor is not as
fast downloading and installing software
takes time
so you won't be able to do any intricate
multitasking
other operating systems such as windows
are incompatible
this product will not be beneficial for
large-scale businesses that already have
large servers which can perform all the
tasks that raspberry pi can
as a result it would not be worth it and
putting everything together it would
take time
so with that we have reached the end of
this video thank you so much for being
