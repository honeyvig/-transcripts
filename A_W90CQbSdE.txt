00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,920
[Music]

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,639
so hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,640
tutorial my name is Tam Baki and this

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,840
time we're going to be going over IBM

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,400
Watson a few Services it provides and of

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,920
course today I'm with my mentor Rob High

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,880
here at again IBM interconnect 2017 as

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
you saw in the last video was with John

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,719
con uh talking about the TJ bot and iot

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,200
uh with the TJ bot that actually Rob I

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,520
here actually gifted to me on stage

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,520
during our ey talk uh and so uh we're

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,879
going to be of course creating many more

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,520
videos with that but for now we're

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,480
talking about Watson and doing a quick

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,399
Q&A session about some of your

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,440
frequently asked questions about Watson

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,239
but before we begin Rob would you like

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,160
to introduce yourself okay I'm Rob High

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,800
I'm the CTO for IBM Watson I've had the

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,399
privilege for the last several years to

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,640
be able to guide the technical strategy

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,680
for IBM's uh work in cognitive Computing

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,200
that is great all right so let's begin

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,040
with one of the most asked questions

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,320
that my subscribers have for you which

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,520
is really what's the difference between

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,159
Ai and cognitive uh versus cognitive

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,240
Computing or sorry traditional Computing

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,360
tradition yes what's really the

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,759
difference here what what makes

32
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:25,799
cognitive Computing so special so one of

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,600
the key things that cognitive Computing

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,600
does is it really begins to look at the

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,840
world the same way that we do you know

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,840
if you really kind of look at our world

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,520
around us it's full of signals you know

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,600
the light is a set of of uh of uh of

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,280
either particles or waves depending on

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,439
how you want to look at them that have a

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,520
certain frequency to them that give them

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,000
color give them brightness um um that's

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,520
just one thing you know our voices are

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,000
carried as as audio signals um the

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,719
things that we feel the things that we

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,680
um are able to touch the things that we

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,560
smell all these things are signals and

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,039
what's really amazing about human beings

49
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,640
is essentially what our brain is capable

50
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,120
of doing very very well is figuring at

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,040
the patterns of meaning in all those

52
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,000
signals and that's true whether these

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
are physical signals the signals that we

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,519
associate with physics and chemistry uh

55
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:28,720
and biology or even more softer signals

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,200
the signals of emotion the signals of

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,640
intent the signals of imagination all

58
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
those are signals as well and one of the

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,200
things that we've tried to do in the

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
cognitive Computing system is really

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,239
kind of Follow That same approach to

62
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,319
understanding the world that we live in

63
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,680
by just picking up all these signals and

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,319
then looking at the patterns of meaning

65
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,560
that we can find in the cognitive system

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,200
similar to the way that humans do as

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,120
well and that's just completely

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,200
different than what we've done in the

69
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,519
past where you know to build a program

70
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,400
you had to write the logic of every

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,040
mathematical turn that was going to

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,480
occur within um that particular

73
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,000
algorithm Perfect all right so now that

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
we've gone over really the difference

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,239
between cognitive and traditional

76
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,239
Computing and what makes cognitive so

77
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,280
special uh would you like to touch upon

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
a little bit about how cognitive is

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
assisting humans so one of the things

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,080
that we really focus on is not just

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,480
simply recreating the human mind uh in

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,040
part because frankly the human mind is

83
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,840
really amazing it's it's you know

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
mysterious um but yet it also is very

85
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,640
good at doing certain things instead we

86
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,120
look at is how do we augment human Minds

87
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,319
how do we take what human beings are

88
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,920
really good at and and extend it um give

89
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,799
it more strength give us more power by

90
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,680
be able to take our mental capabilities

91
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,280
and using a cog system to do things that

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,840
we could not naturally do on our own

93
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,519
perfect uh so that's what uh What uh is

94
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,879
IBM you know I mean we've all heard that

95
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
IBM is working with cogni Computing and

96
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
Watson is a System created by IBM uh

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,720
that can understand it can reason it can

98
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
learn it can make decisions for itself

99
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,439
based off of learning from these signals

100
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,160
and these inputs that it's being given

101
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,759
in order to give output that the user

102
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,759
would want uh and so now though uh

103
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,400
another question how can developers

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
around the world actually use Watson's

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,759
capabilities in their apps so one of the

106
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,400
things that we were able to do over the

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,000
years of experience with Watson is begin

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,039
to identify what were sort of the key

109
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,440
building blocks that were necessary to

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
construct a really useful cognitive

111
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,479
application so we took each of these

112
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,000
building blocks and we put them in the

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,039
cloud given them an API and made those

114
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,759
apis available through the cloud for

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,360
anybody to use so really building an

116
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,080
application is as simple as identifying

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,479
the service that you want to make use of

118
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,039
writing the code all these code all

119
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,639
these a apis are available as restful

120
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,639
services so if you know how to build a

121
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,960
Json structure as you have done in many

122
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,600
of your videos um you can make use of

123
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,960
the services there's a wide variety of

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,440
them available so all you have to do is

125
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,560
go to ibm.com BL miix navigate into the

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Watson Zone and you're going to find

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
those services and be able to pick them

128
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,120
up and make use of them exactly so

129
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,520
Watson has things like speech Vision

130
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,440
natural language processing and you know

131
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,280
General reasoning and logic right that's

132
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,720
right and the key ones are things like

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,840
conversations right because that's a

134
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,120
very common use case for people today is

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
they want to build what some people

136
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,160
refer to as jaat chat Bots but I like to

137
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,400
think of one it's not just a chat but

138
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,199
really a conversation right trying to

139
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,080
build an application that walks people

140
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
through their conversational Bots

141
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
exactly got okay yeah there we go so in

142
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
fact if you'd like to find out more

143
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
about how you can build these

144
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,199
conversational Bots and use Watson's

145
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,880
apis there will be a link to the TM

146
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,360
teachers Watson playlist down below and

147
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,680
then you you can you know go ahead and

148
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,199
check out how you can use those Waton

149
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,840
services in your applications but now

150
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,080
another question is well what's the

151
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,440
underlying technology behind Watson what

152
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,319
types of algorithms do you do you use

153
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,039
like what what's going on behind it so

154
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,599
we've actually gone through a transition

155
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:16,800
over the years and when we first began

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,479
we were heavily focused on using classic

157
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,199
machine learning algorithms um you know

158
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,800
things like uh logistical regression uh

159
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,840
sbms um even linear regression in basan

160
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,360
we've more recently evolved over to

161
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,000
making better use of deep learning

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,240
algorithms um convolutional neuron Nets

163
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,599
Uh current neuron Nets or even more

164
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,280
exotic variations of uh of long

165
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,479
short-term uh memory um algorithms um

166
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,520
what we call

167
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
lstms um and usually in combination it's

168
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,479
not usually just a single algorithm it's

169
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,199
usually different algorithms that we're

170
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,639
leveraging to pick up on different kind

171
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,879
the signals and find those patterns

172
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,160
exactly uh so that's what goes behind

173
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,759
Watson but now another question is well

174
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,360
uh and this will be on my YouTube

175
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,240
channel soon but I've actually sometimes

176
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,280
you know gone ahead and created um I

177
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,039
guess you could say mixes of services to

178
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,280
create one extremely powerful service

179
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,199
like conversation enhanced by Tone

180
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,560
analyzer by say for example uh actually

181
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
combining the conversation and tone

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,840
analyzer by whenever you send a uh a uh

183
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,879
message to conversation it'll actually

184
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,800
put the tone of that message into a

185
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,960
context variable so that you can of

186
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,120
course access uh access the tone and

187
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,520
give personalized responses do you think

188
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,840
or do you believe Watson uh will I guess

189
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,639
you could say start to support like

190
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,000
mixes of these apis built in soon

191
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,800
mashing them up together in in both uh

192
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,199
structured and unstructured ways um the

193
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,360
answer is very likely you know there's

194
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,599
still choices that we have to make as we

195
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,319
move forward making sure that people can

196
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,240
Mash these things up in the style that

197
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,479
you describe yet at the same time keep

198
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,440
keep each individual Service as simple

199
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,879
as possible and of course that's a

200
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,039
balance we're always trying to measure

201
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,000
how complicated we're making things so

202
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,400
that we don't and we can keep things to

203
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
the point where people can do everything

204
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,720
they really want to do without being

205
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,639
bogged down so yeah you're going to see

206
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,599
more and more at least patterns of

207
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,280
integration where you can take something

208
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
like a conversation integrate it with

209
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,120
tone analyzer integrate with personality

210
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,800
insights integrate it with other

211
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,039
services like the weather to be able to

212
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,080
understand you know what the weather is

213
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,120
like outside where you are or where

214
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,839
you're going um what the environment is

215
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,519
like the place that you're at you know

216
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,680
if that's in your home or in your car or

217
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,839
in your office what else is happening in

218
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,560
that room that would also inform how the

219
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,240
conversational system should interpret

220
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,920
what you need to be able to anticipate

221
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,279
that need and be able to offer you

222
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,040
choices in that context that are

223
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,399
meaningful to you or relevant to you in

224
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,000
that environment so yes absolutely

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
you're going to see lots of combinations

226
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,880
of this kind that is perfect I can

227
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,519
imagine that being being very powerful

228
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,240
for a lot of developers applications now

229
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,079
one more thing how can developers give

230
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,079
feedback to the Watson team if they want

231
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,240
to say incorporate a new feature give

232
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,399
feedback for an existing service so we

233
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,760
have a variety of uh social channels

234
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,519
that we invite people to come and join

235
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,079
us of course we have GitHub slack um

236
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,880
Twitter LinkedIn channels where you can

237
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,120
provide us input we love to hear from

238
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,560
you um we want to hear what is working

239
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,240
for you the great case of of of success

240
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,399
that you've had doing fun and

241
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,040
interesting things uh and where things

242
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,600
are not working so well for you CU

243
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,760
obviously we always want to make these

244
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,200
these things

245
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
better all right so that's going to be

246
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,720
