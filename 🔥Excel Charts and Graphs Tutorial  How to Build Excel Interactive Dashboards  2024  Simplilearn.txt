Practical mode where we will have some
data sets over which we will be trying
to apply the charts now there are
various types of charts in table and
those are the pie chart the column chart
the bar chart column versus line pavier
chart and Spark line charts so we will
discuss one after the other first let us
discuss about the pie chart so as you
can see we have a small data set on my
screen which I have personally created
and uh this deals with the companies and
this deals with the shares of the
automobile industry so now for this
let's create a pie
chart select all the data and then get
into the toolbar and inside the toolbar
you can see various options and inside
that you're going to use the insert
option and when you select the insert
option you will have a ribon here and
inside the ribbon you can see groups
tables illustrations addin and here
there you go these are the charts so now
we needed a pie chart so select on that
icon and you have various types of pie
charts you have two dimensional pie
charts three dimensional pie charts
donut type of charts Etc right so I
would like to go with the three
dimensional pie chart as it looks a
little more appealing and easy to
understand and now there you go this is
the title of the chart and these are the
legends of the chart and this is the
chart area and these are the values now
we can uh you know kind of add the data
labels as well so you can just have to
press the plus icon over here and you'll
have the options you can add the data
labels which will give you a lot more
interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this will be a a great
way of presenting your data to your
clients
right yeah and there is another option
where you can uh directly explode this
like you can pick it out you can see
this right Point explosion where you can
split it out and you can show that
especially like you can highlight it and
show it so that's the you know a great
way of presenting your data so that's
how you can work with pie charts in
Excel now let's quickly move to the next
one that is the column chart and in the
column chart we have the data related to
some company and uh the profits of that
company based on a year so you can see
that the year has started from 2008 and
it has gone until
2021 and these are the profits of that
company year after year so since we are
dealing with column chart I'll tell you
the simplest way to create a column
chart there is a shortcut key for that
which is alt F1 and there you go you
have the chart right on your
screen now you can uh expand the chart
just by dragging it like that and you
can see that there is some problem with
this chart that is we have numbers here
instead of es right you can see that the
First Column is the years which is 2008
to 2021 but here you can see we have 1 2
3 4 which is not proper right so to
change the axis that is you can see the
axis which is 1 2 3 4 from 1 2 3 4 to
the years 2008 2009 2010 11 Etc you just
have to make one change here and also
you can see I have pressed the plus icon
over here which will open the option
where you can include the access titles
if you have and data labels everything
right so for now I think I'll keep it as
it is so you can include the data table
as well as it is here and you can
include that in the chart there are
various options that Excel provides you
so now let's uh focus on changing the
axis from 1 2 3 4 to the ears for that
you need to select the chart design and
inside the chart design you have an
option called select data press that and
here you have various set of options you
can see profits you can see ears now
we'll select ears and we will remove
that and now you can see the edit option
here right select that and now it will
ask you which column to be selected for
the access range for that let's select
this and now let's select the ears
here and press okay and there you go
again press okay so there you go you
have the ears over here instead of the
numbers which you had in the first place
so that's how you create the column
chart and we have the next type of chart
which is really simple now you know you
kind of change this chart directly into
bar chart there is no big deal in
that so uh for that you just just need
to select the change chart type option
over here you're just changing the chart
type and you can get the bar graph over
here column and bar graphs are
completely same to each other only that
you can see these uh bars in the
horizontal way rather than in the
vertical way let's do that let's not
create a new thing for that so uh yeah
there you go when you select the change
chart type option you have various set
of chart type options on the menu bar
over here so what we needed was the bar
chart now let's select that and there
you go let's select okay and you have
the bar
chart right and you if you want you can
include the data labels which look a
little bit more interesting you can also
include the data table as
well okay for now I think we have to
expand the chart to get the Clear
View yeah that's how you do
it right now let's move into the next
typ type of one yeah we dealt with the
bar chart so we'll directly enter into
the column versus line chart so we have
similar kind of data we just had year
and profits in the previous part now we
also have included the expenses right we
needed another column to showcase the
line chart compared to the columns right
so for that I've included a new column
that is expenses Al as well now just
let's select the
data and let's select the option alt F1
to create our
chart right now automatically uh Excel
has provided us the column chart we have
The Columns of expanses we have the
column of profits and we also have ear
now let's change the data as we did
before select uh year and remove it and
then
edit select edit and select the year
that is from here to
2021 select okay and we have the ears
over here now what we needed to do is
change the chart type right select the
change chart type option and since we
wanted to create a column versus line
chart it is a combination whenever you
want one or two types of charts included
in one single chart window then it is a
combo option so here we need to select
the combo option and inside that we have
various types of combination charts we
have clustered column we have clustered
line on secondary axis we have clustered
stat areas clustered column and the
other one is custom combination so let's
go with the first one that is clustered
line let's select that and there you go
we have the line graph with the column
so that's how we create the column
versus line and if you want you can
include the data labels and and you can
include the data table as well yeah okay
I think uh we need to expand the canvas
a little more to get a clear
view
yeah so you have Legends over here you
have the data labels and access
everything and chart title you can
always change the chart title so for now
let's uh rename it as profits versus
expenses
yeah that's that's how it
goes done okay I think I made a spelling
mistake
here yeah it's clear
now now the next type of chart we're
going to deal with is the P
chart so uh we have dealt with P chart
column chart bar chart and column versus
line now P chart is a little bit
different it's like you're going to
create some active chart which responds
to the variations you're making to your
data so to understand that better let's
create a practical chart over here I
select all the
data
okay yeah I have selected the data now
to create a pivot chart so let's
select the insert option from the
toolbar and inside the ribbon we have
charts group and inside that we have P
chart now let's select the P chart
option and there you go now it's asking
for range and we have selected the range
over there and uh we are not going to
create a new worksheet for the entire
chart we're going to create the uh chart
inside the existing worksheet itself so
for that let's select the the uh area
where we want to select the uh chart to
be present now for that let's select
this
and yeah select
okay okay there is some
error let's cancel this and try
again let's select the
data and prev chart
again we have selected the
range
yeah that's how you select the range and
now select the position where you want
to create it existing worksheet we have
selected that and press okay yeah that's
that's the way we've got our PV chart
over here and you can see our P chart is
completely blank right now it will
respond to the changes you made make to
your P chat for now we have uh serial
numbers and U these are the names of the
guys who
have okay so these are the names of the
guys you who have some dealerships for
various car makes such as Ford Ferrari
Honda Kia Alpha Romeo BMW etc etc so uh
we're going to change or we're going to
see um you know we're going to make some
charts of the persons who own the cars
or the car brands or dealerships in
various regions so we're going to work
on that now let's drag in the
name and uh let's drag
region and
cards and
units yep so we have our uh chart over
here column chart which has the
different different names and the
dealerships and some of cars over there
right so you can see that we can also
change some values over here what if we
wanted to know only uh the details
regarding Jennifer you can do that you
can unselect everything and you can just
select Jennifer and press okay now
you'll have the details of only Jennifer
of having the car brands so we have the
regions as well so Jennifer owns
dealerships in two different regions
that is South and West and uh the sum of
units and count of cars as well so
that's how the PV charts are used in
real
time and now let's select sales and drag
the sales as
well yeah it's been dragged and you have
the sales of U
Jennifer the details of her sales and
let's move the chart a little bit and
you have the plus icon where you can
include the labels for a better
information yeah so that's how you use
the P charts so we are on the last type
of charts which is the spark line chart
Now to create a spark line chart we need
to get into the insert option and inside
we have the ribbon and inside the ribbon
we have the group that is spark lines
now to generate a spark line chart we
need to select this particular column
and then select the type of spark line
you want to create for now let's create
the column type of spark line chart yep
we have to Club these cells together
first we forgot that because we're going
to insert the spark line chart right
above here now for that let's Marge the
cells
[Music]
yeah so uh we wanted to create
the
spark line chart of column type and now
it's asking for the location where we
want to create the spark line chart so
this is the location now let's select
okay and there you go we have the spark
line chart right over here now you can
see that we have a negative Point here
so if you want you can change that from
negative to positive and it will
automatically update that and if you
want to add the access to this
particular chart you can select the
options spark line and there you go you
have certain options like High Point low
point and if you wanted to add some
margins and you can also do
that add data type access and there go
you have the
access show access yeah you have the
access now and you can have the high
point and low point for that as well
which is the you know the biggest change
and the smallest change in this
particular segment that is few Furniture
yeah Furniture had the highest sales in
January and uh Home Appliance had the
lowest sale and you can also change the
color and uh let's type of change the
color again yeah we have a different
color over here which resembles a little
bit more better or you can also go with
this one and if you wanted to add the
same to all these tables you can do that
just by dragging it and you have it for
all the 6
months now if you wanted to add some new
data in this row or you wanted to add a
new complete row then you can do that as
well and change that and bring that
change implemented in these charts as
well now let us try to add a new row
here which includes the miscellaneous we
have that data right over here let's
select that copy and uh let's paste it
over here so there you go we have the
extra row here so yeah now we have added
the miscellaneous row and right now we
have the spark line chart for only four
columns or four rows that is Furniture
technology home appliances and office
needs and miscellaneous is missing now
to add that as well let's select spark
line and inside spark line just select
edit Group location and data and now
let's select the entire
data and and now select
okay there's something wrong
again spot line edit
data select
range this should be helping yeah there
you go we have all the five rows now
including Furniture technology home
appliances office needs and
miscellaneous now for this particular
example we going to use the employees
data now let's quickly get back to the
Practical mode and enter into
Excel now you can see that we are on
Excel sheet right now so let me expand
my screen a little
bit so that the data is a little more
visible yeah
so here on my screen you can see that we
have employees data so the First Column
is the name of the employees and the
second column is the start dates of the
employees that when have they started
working with the organization and when
they have ended or resigned to their
position in that particular organization
and the duration gives us the number of
days they have worked in that particular
organization so to create a g chart is
really simple you just have to select
the data and then go to the insert
option and in there you can see the
charts icon and select all charts and in
that select the bar chart and here you
can see the Stacked bar chart select
that and press okay and there you go you
have the Stacked bar chart right on your
screen let's expand this a little more
so that we have the clear visualization
of the dates as well now you can if you
want you can change the title as org
data or employe
data
and now we are partially done with our
chart now the next thing we have to do
is select the bar chart right click on
it select data and here select the add
icon now you need to select the series
name so the series name is duration for
our Gant chart and series values are
let's select this and select let's move
a
little
yeah so these are the data series let's
select okay and you can see the Gan chat
on my screen right here select okay and
it's done and still now it's not
complete yet so to finish it you need to
select the blue colored bars here and
right click on them and select format
data
series go to the fill icon and select no
fill
and it's done for now and you can see
that there is a difference in this
particular arrangement we had Joe at the
first place and Susan at the last place
but here you can see Joe is in the last
place and Susan is in the first place so
we need to make some arrangements here
for that right click select format
access and then here you can see
categorize in reverse
order and there you go you have your
Gant chart right on your screen
right on my screen you can see a
circular progress tracker so it is
tracking the percentage of the first
student that is Stacy now let's try to
change the marks of Stacy from
engineering subject from 55 to
75 and uh engineering subject 4 from 68
to 84 then you can see the percentage is
getting changed and also the same is
getting implemented on the progress
tracker interesting right would you like
to create a similar circular progress
tracker yes that can be done that's
exactly what we're discussing today so
let's get started with our onepoint
agenda that is circular progress tracker
in Excel now let's get back to the
Practical mode so let us enter into a
duplicate sheet which has all the marks
of the students so now we are on the
duplicate sheet where we have all the
students names and the marks list and
also the percentage now let us create a
new column which states the the actual
percentage minus the overall percentage
so the overall percentage is 100 and the
actual percentage is uh 75 76 and so on
let's try to calculate this or let's try
to convert it into the percentage
format
now let's try to change some
values yeah
cool now let's try to change this yeah
we were supposed to add the percentage
symbol which we forgot now it's
implemented there now let's drag it
again so there you go we have the
remaining percentage as well so we have
the actual percentage and the remaining
percentage so we need both of them to
apply the donut chart so we have
selected both the percentages and now
we'll enter into insert menu then you
can see um pie chart icon over here
click that and you have a donut chart
over here select that and you have the
donut chart so now let's remove the
symbols which we don't need so we have
removed the uh details of one and two
there and uh let's change this to
Circular
progress
tracker so we have removed the Legends
and we have renamed the chart name as
circular progress tracker and now let's
try to insert the percentage icon or the
text chart so you have the text chart or
text text box option over here select
that drag and drop it
here yeah we have the text box here
select that go to the formula bar select
equals to and now select the address
cell there you go you have it now we
have the percentage in the text box now
you can make your edits I'll bring it to
Center alignment to Center text color to
Blue as we have it on the Outer Circle
and you can change the font you can make
it bold increase the font
size there you go so we have the
progress
tracker okay let's try to group the text
box with the chart so that we can move
them all
together so now you can make some
changes and see if that's working or not
so let's make the change to the
engineering subject one from 32 to 68
and press enter there you go the changes
have been applied the percentage got
changed to 78 from 72 and the same has
been implemented here and even the
progress chart is also working on the
same way so that's how you create the
circular progress charts in Excel so how
to create a paper chart you ask it is
really simple all you need to do is just
follow few steps and you have your PIV
chart ready which is completely
interactive now all you have to do is
select any cell in the data set you have
and rush into the insert toolbar then in
the group of charts you have an option
called pivot chart select on it now
you'll be asked to select the data range
and you can see Excel has automatically
select all the range that you want to
include in your pivot chart then you
have another option which is asking you
to either create the PIV chart in the
current worksheet or a new worksheet for
now let's select a new worksheet and
there you go voila the pivot chart is
completely ready you might ask me this
is completely empty yes the default
pivot chart what you get from Excel will
be completely empty but you can add the
Legends and all the data that you want
to add onto your pivot chart just by
dragging and dropping the data from the
right hand side of your Excel sheet that
is from the PIV chart Fields so you can
see we have various options region
category state subcategory sales
quantity Etc now I'll add
region I'll add region to
access and comparatively we will see the
sales that are happening in those
particular regions by dragging sales
into values now you have all the data in
the form of pivot chart which is
completely interactive which which
represents the sales happening in those
regions now you can also select a
particular region right by default all
the regions are selected but if you want
to select only Central then you can do
that by deselecting everything and
select only Central and select okay and
there you go you have all the data
related to the sales happening in the
central region now if you want to you
know kind of see all the uh categories
of sales happening in all the regions
you can drag the category into values
again and uh in the region part okay I
think we have to add category into
Legends yes now select uh regions that
that is old regions and select okay and
you can see the category wise sales in
all regions at one single go and I hope
you did not observe it clearly uh the XL
also gives you the completely prepared
pivot table as well right which is also
interactive you can also get to choose
the data from here as well and select
okay and you'll see that being reflected
on the pivot chart so here you can see
both pivot table and pivot charts are
completely interactive on my screen you
can see a small data set the data set is
about students and their marks in the
sixth semesters right now we should be
creating a new heat map to describe
their rankings Now to create a heat map
the procedure is really simple just
contr a select the entire data go to the
Home tab and there you can see the
Styles group and in the Styles group
click on the conditional formatting now
out of all the options go to the color
scales and when you open the color
scales you can see some types of maps
select the green yellow red Scale map
which should show Green for highest
yellow for mediate and red for low right
this is how you create a heat map just
select the first option and there you go
the heat map M has been successfully
generated the green colored cells
indicate the highest marks orange and
yellow color indicate the intermediate
marks or the average marks and the red
color indicates the lowest marks that's
how you create heat maps in Excel hey
everyone my name is ishan and I welcome
you all to this session in this session
we will talk about project plan in Excel
we will learn about a project plan and
how we can make an effective plan in
Microsoft Excel before we begin let's
have a look at all the topics we will be
covering today first we will see the
basics of a project plan then we will
check the process of project management
in Microsoft Excel and why should one
refer to Microsoft Excel apart from this
we will learn about how to make a gan
chart in Excel towards the end we will
check some Microsoft Excel templates so
without any further Ado let's get
started let's see what is a project plan
project plan is a basic thing that is
needed to execute a project according to
project management book of knowledge a
project can be defined as an approved
elaborative document that guides the
team during project execution and
project control when when we making a
project plan a project plan must answer
several questions for us these questions
are like what are we expecting our
project to deliver how are we expecting
to get our deliverables within the
desired time who all will be a part of
our project and what tasks they will
have in the project when will the
project start and when it is expected to
end that is the deadlines of the project
now let us learn about project
management in Excel Microsoft Excel is
one of the most common application these
days it is used in both offices and at
homes Microsoft Excel is an easy project
management tool that allows the team
members to easily see the tasks in a
project develop a plan and track its
progress before we learn more about
project management in Excel let's first
have a look why do we use Excel
Microsoft Excel is an easy tool to plan
a project so it can be used by people
who are beginners in terms of project
management in Excel one can find several
analytical tools like concatenate Len
and counter so this makes data analysis
easy and effective as the entry of data
is easy same tracking and controlling of
project status then there are several
project management templates in Excel
that help us to have an effective
distribution of project data we will be
checking several project management
templates towards the end of this video
now let's have a look at the process of
making a Gant chart in Excel before we
begin this it's important we know what
is a gan chart a gan chart is like an
horizontal bar chart that is used for
project management with the help of a
gan chart we can check the status of the
task the date they start the date they
end and their dependencies on each other
Gan chart helps in coordinating and
monitoring different tasks in a project
now let's have a look at the steps that
will help us in making a gan chart first
step we have is make a project table we
have several rows and columns like here
we have three columns in the First
Column we have the tasks in the second
we have a start date and in the third
column we have the duration or tenure of
the task the second step is to make a
bar chart in Excel for this we will
select the entire second column then we
will go on the insert Tab and click on
the bar graph chart there we can select
staged bar graph in 2D bar charts as a
result we will have the entitled bar
graph on the screen in the third step we
will add the duration to the bar graph
we will right click on the chart and in
the menu that appears we will select
select data option a window that appears
on the screen in that window we will
select add option as shown we can also
see the start date is already in the
entry section then in the dialog box
that appears type tenure in the series
name and click on the Range selection
icon that's shown in the figure now
select the relevant data from the tenure
column and click on okay now we can see
a bar graph that has two colors on the
screen this bar graph now has the
duration of the tasks the fourth step we
have is adding description to the Gant
chart now we will open the box again and
in that box we will select the edit
option as shown in the figure then we
will select the tasks as we had selected
the duration of the tasks before and
click on okay we can now see the tasks
have appeared towards the left side of
the Gan chart the fifth and the
remarkable step will help us convert
this bar graph into a a g chart we will
now click on the bars and select the
format data series option from the menu
that appears then in the format data
series dialogue box we will select no
fill option we can find our Gan chart on
the screen now in accordance with the
data that we had entered now we can see
the tasks on the left side are in the
reverse order so what we will do next is
we will click on the task panel then go
to the format xess dialog box and select
the categories in reverse order option
now we can find our tasks in the right
order one more thing we can notice is
Gan chart is starting with some other
date and not with the dates that we had
entered so for this we will copy the
first date in some other cell then
clicking on the copied cell we will go
to the home menu to select the dialog
box as shown in the figure then in that
drop- down menu you will select the
number option we can now find a value
displayed in the copied cell we will
copy that value click on the dates on
the chart and as the format access
dialog box opens we will paste that
value in the box that says minimum shown
in the figure as a result we will have
our final Gan chart on the screen in the
the last step we can give several
designs to a Gand chart change colors
and make it more presentable for us now
when we know the basic steps of making a
Gant chart I will show that practically
to you in Microsoft Excel our first step
is to open Microsoft Excel and in
Microsoft Excel we will make a project
table in a project table we will have
three columns the First Column will be
task the second column will have the
start date the third column will have
tenure or the duration of the task so
beginning with tasks we have task one in
task one we have 1.1 1.2 1.3 then comes
task 2 in task 2 we have 2.1 2.2 2.3 and
2.4 then we have task three in task 3 we
will have two subsections 3.1 and 3.2
then we will start with the starting
dates in starting dates we'll put 1st
January the Task 1 1 .1 will be 1st of
January then this will be 4th January
let's say this is 5th January then we
will put this as 11th of January and
this will be again 11th January only
this will be 15th January let's put this
as 17th January let this be 19th January
task 3 begins on 23rd January and it the
3.2 section begins at 26th of January
now let's put the tenure or the duration
of the time task we will begin with task
one it takes 12 days then 1.1 takes 7
days we say this takes 4 days and this
takes 8 days then for task two it again
takes 12 days it takes 5 days 5 days and
let's say this takes 6 days and this
takes 4 days then we come to task three
this takes 8 days and let's say this
takes 6 days and the 3.2 section takes 5
days so this is how our project table is
is ready in the second step we will
select the entire second column after we
have selected this column we will go to
the insert tab in the insert tab we'll
go to the bar columns and in this we
will select 2D stacked bar charts now we
have the entitled bar chart in
accordance to our data on the screen
then comes the third step we will add
the duration of the tasks to the bar
graph we will click on the chart and
after we click on the chart we will
select select data option in the select
data source dialog box we find the start
date is already there now we will click
on ADD and after we click on add in the
series name section we will put tenure
then in the series value we will click
on this icon and select the entire
tenure series and click on okay so this
is the bar graph that we have now this
is now in two colors the orange color
and the blue color this bar graph now
has the duration of all the tasks in our
project table now in the fourth step now
it's time for for us to add description
to our Gan chart instead of this 1 2 3 4
5 we will put task one task two and the
subtasks so what we will do is we will
again go to that box we will left click
on the Gan chart select the select data
option and then we'll go to the start
date here we'll select the edit option
in the edit option we will select all
the tasks and click on okay now we can
see all the tasks are aligned towards
the left of the bar chart as we can see
this is a bar chart or a bar graph and
not a gan chart the next step we have is
converting this bar graph into a gan
chart so we will click on the bars and
select the format data series option
from the menu that appears here we have
this format data series option now we
can see the dialog box on the screen
here we'll go into the color section
fill section and then we will select no
fill now we can see the blue lines have
disappeared so this looks like a g Gand
chart so now when we have a Gand chart
on the screen we can notice that the
task here are in the reverse order so
what we will do is we will click on
these tasks and select the format X as
option here we will select categories in
reverse order we can see our Gan chart
is now in order like we have our task
one on the top and task three at the
bottom the dates are starting from 11th
of December but the dates we have
provided are from 1st of January now we
will copy this cell then go on the dates
box here we'll go to format access in
the format access we can see minimum in
this minimum we will paste this value
and press enter as we press enter we can
see our Gand chart starting from the
date that we wanted to start and that to
in the correct order starting from task
one to task three now as a result we
have our final Gant chart on the screen
in the last step what we can do is make
our Gand chart more representable we can
change the color of These Bars we can
give them shapes and we can do many
other things to make it more presentable
we will first select the bars like what
we will do is we will select task one
and let's say we give it the color blue
then task two we will give it color
green and in task three we'll give it
give it the color black so here the
subsections will give different colors
to the subsections as well then we come
to task 2.1 this is how we can change
the color of these cells or or apart
from changing colors we can select a bar
graph and do the gradient fill so this
is how we can make a gan chart more
presentable after changing the colors or
changing the shapes we have our final
Gand chart on the screen finally let's
have a look at some Microsoft Excel
templates for project management
Microsoft Excel templates help in
collecting data putting them into order
and check their dependencies with each
other with the help of these templates
we can monitor the status of the tasks
and we can also check the progress our
project has made moving forth we will
check some important Microsoft Excel
templates the first template we have is
Excel project review template this
template helps us have an overview of
the project we can have a clear
understanding of all the tasks that are
planned and that are completed this
helps project managers to measure the
progress of the project and take further
steps accordingly second template we
will check is Excel budget template in
this template we can monitor all the
expenditures of our project it helps us
in managing the budget of our project
and also helps in comparing the budget
of a project at different phases let's
have a look at the budget template in
Excel on we can download this template
from Office timeline.com the Gant chart
towards the right is in accordance with
the dates towards the left if we
fluctuate the date we can see the
template working the start date for task
one could be changed to 10th June if we
change this date to 10th June we can see
the fluctuation in the Gant chart so
this is how we can use this template
directly let's have a look at the third
template now third template we will see
is Excel Sprint Project tracker template
this template is used majorly in agile
projects where the project is made in
several Sprints or sessions this
template includes the start date the end
date and the duration of each task we
can also see the percentage completed of
each task let's have a look at this
Sprint Project tracker template as well
we can see the Gan chart towards the
right and the data towards the left so
if we change any data we can see the Gan
chart changing for example we can change
the data in Sprint 2 feature 3 let's
change the start dat to July 2nd we can
see the Gant chart changing this is how
we can use this template directly to
track our sessions let's have a look at
the fourth Excel template this template
is Excel project tracker in this
template we have the data of all the
tasks with the status and owners we can
track the percentage of task completed
and also compare the plann duration of
the task to the actual duration of the
task after the critical part tracker
let's check the Excel project schedule
template this template helps in
effective management of the project as
it helps in monitoring the time that
each task of the project takes it
provides a clear view of all the work
associated with the project let's have a
look at this template in Excel ones we
can see the Gan chart in accordance to
the data if we change the estimated
hours at two places let's say at the
design review we make it 15 hours
instead of 5 hours and at the create
Staffing plan we make it 2 hours instead
of 20 hours we can see the Gan chart
fluctuating this is how we can use this
template to manage the schedule in a
project moving forward the next template
we will see is Excel project status
report template this template helps us
having a list of project deliverables
and the risks associated with that
project this template helps the project
managers about different crucial
activities involved in a project after
this we have Excel Milestone tracker the
Milestone tracker helps us in tracking
or monitoring different tasks in a
project project managers use this
template to monitor the project
performance with respect to the
timelines the last template we will see
is Excel project planner Excel project
planner includes a list of task with the
respected owners along with the start
date and the end date of that task this
helps in monitoring each task and
comparing the estimated task date with
the actual ones let's have a look at
this template in Excel we can see the
Gan chart with respect to the data
entered let's make changes at several
places in the data we can make this 22
to 24 we will make this 23 go to 2 and
we can make this 5th September go to
15th September
and when we make the changes we can
realize the Gan chart is fluctuating so
this is how we can use this template to
plan a project effectively and
efficiently hello everyone welcome to
this video tutorial and dashboards in
Excel in this video we'll be creating
two dashboards using a sample sales data
set so if you want to get the data and
the dashboard file that we'll be
creating in this demo then please put
your email IDs in the comment section of
the video our team will share the files
via email now let's begin by
understanding what is a dashboard in
Excel a dashboard is a visual interface
that provides an overview of key
measures relevant to a particular
objective with the help of charts and
graphs dashboard reports allow managers
to get a high level overview of the
business and help them make quick
decisions there are different types of
dashboards such as strategic dashboards
analytical dashboards and operational
dashboards an advantage of dashboards is
the quick detection of outliers and
correlations with Comprehensive data
visualization it is time-saving as
compared to running multiple
reports with this understanding let's
jump into our demo for creating our
dashboards we'll be using a sample sales
data set let me show you the data set
first so here is the sales data set that
we'll be using for our demo so this data
set was actually generated using a
simulator and is completely random it
was not validated though we have applied
certain transformations to the data
using power query
features so this data as you can see has
thousand TRS so using the simulator we
had generated thousand rows of
data similarly if I go on top you can
see this data set has 17 columns now let
me give you a brief about each of the
columns so first we have the region
column so we have Middle East and North
Africa this North America Asia
subsaharan Africa and others similarly
we have the country names from which the
item was ordered the third column is the
item type so we have different items
Cosmetics vegetables there's baby food
cereal fruits Etc then we have the
representatives name or you can see this
as the customer name who ordered the
product then we have a sales Channel
column so there are basically two
channels whether the item was sold
offline or online next we have the order
priority column now here C stands for
critical then we have H which is for
high priority orders then we have M for
medium priority orders and finally we
have L which is for low priority orders
you can see the order date column then
we have the order ID the ship date next
we have units
sold which is basically the total number
of units sold for each item then we have
the unit price column this is the price
at which each product was sold then we
have the unit cost column which is
basically the production cost for each
of the items next we have the total
revenue the total revenue is actually
the product of unit sold and unit price
then we have the total cost column now
the total cost column is actually the
product of unit sold and the unit cost
similarly we have the total profit
column so total profit is the difference
between total revenue and the total cost
and finally we have created two more
columns that is order year and then we
have order month now these two columns
were actually generated using the power
query features so we use the order date
column which is this column and
extracted order year and Order
month so first we are going to create a
revenue dashboard where we'll focus on
generating reports for Revenue by order
year Revenue by year and region Revenue
by order priority and much more we'll
create separate P tables and po charts
and format them to make them look more
interesting and presentable We'll add
slices and timeline to our dashboards in
order to filter it based on specific
Fields now let's create our first report
to see the total revenue generated each
year so we need to create a pivote table
for this I'll click on a sell in my data
set and then then I'll go to the insert
tab here we have the option to select
the pivote table I click on this you can
see my table range is
selected next I want to place my pivote
table in a new worksheet and let's just
click on okay there you go so we have a
new sheet where I can place my PO
table so first I need to find the total
revenue generated by each year so what
I'll do is I'll drag my order ear column
under rows and then I'll select the
total revenue column under
values you can see I have my P chart
ready now if you want you can sort this
so from the data you can see we have
order Year from 2010 to
2017 now based on this data let's create
our pivote chart so so I'll click on any
cell go to insert and here you have the
option to select recommended charts I
click on this now actually I want a line
chart so I'll click on line here and
select
okay there you go so we have
successfully created our first pivote
chart now let me show you how you can
format this chart to make it more
readable so first let me delete these so
I right click and select hide all field
buttons on the chart so this will delete
the buttons present on the chart now let
me go ahead and edit the chart title so
the title I want is total revenue I'll
type it
down by
Year all right next let's do a few more
Transformations so if I click on this
plus sign which is actually for chart
elements we have some options like to
add access access titles chart title
data labels this grid lines Legend and
others okay so let's remove the legend
now you can see the total Legend is gone
now let me add access titles so we'll
label our x- axis and y axis so here
under xaxis
I can write it
as
ear similarly on the y axis I'll put
Revenue okay now you can move a bit all
right
now let me select this chart Style
option and go to Colors
first here I'll select yellow color okay
and then let me go back to style let's
select a new style from this
list I
want this style okay now you can also
add data labels so I'll just click on
data labels you can see we have the
revenue for each of the years now this
is not readable at all so we'll format
this a
bit if I click on this Arrow here I have
more
options if I scroll down you can see we
have something called this number here
I'll expand this and under category I'll
select
custom now here we'll give a format
code which is a bit
different so this is actually a kind of
a formula so I'll write if my Revenue
value is greater than let's say 9 lak
999,000 let me make sure there are six
nines here so 1 2 3 4 5 and six okay we
are good to go I'll close the
bracket I'll give a
hash give two
commas so if the revenue is greater than
9 LH
99,000 I'll put it in the format of
millions So within double quotes I'll
write
M I'll give a
semicolon followed by another
hash and if the value is less than the
desired
number it should be 0 million let me
click on
add all right you can see how nicely we
have formatted our data and and you see
here we
have added the new format which is in
millions all right now if you want you
can go ahead and adjust
the boxes let me move this a bit up I'll
delete this now if you notice this line
chart you can make a few conclusions for
example if you see here in
2010 the total revenue generated was
nearly 175 million now this came down to
150 million in
2011 then the revenue constantly grew
from 2011 till
2014 it reached 195 million and after
2014 it again came down to 180 million
and the revenue dropped significantly
between 2016 and
2017 in 2017 the revenue was just 96
million now before moving ahead to my
next chart let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write it as
Revenue by Year all
right
now let's analyze the revenue generated
each year in different regions so for
this we'll create another peot table let
me close this I'll click on any cell go
to insert and select pivote table I'll
just click okay so that my P table is
placed on a new sheet all right now this
time we want the revenue by each year
and region so first of all let's drag
region to
columns
then let's drag the order ear column
under rows and then I'll select total
revenue onto values so here you can see
we have the pivote table ready so for
2010 you can see in Asia this was the
revenue generated similarly if you see
for
2013 this was the total revenue
generated in Europe and we have for
other years as well now let's create a
line chart based on this pivote table so
I'll select any sell in the pivote table
I'll go to insert and I'll click on
recommended charts from this list I'll
select my line chart and click on okay
there you go so we have our next weote
chart
ready so on the right you see the
different regions that are present in
different colors let me just expand it
so that you can see all the regions we
have so in total we
have seven
regions and each of the regions have
been represented in different
colors so if you notice this
scph for the subsaharan African region
in
2012 subsaharan Africa meet the highest
amount of
sales now from the sample data you can
also tell that the revenue for North
America has been significantly low
compared to other regions similarly if
you
see for
Europe This was the revenue new trend
between 2010 and
2017 so if you see here in 2011 the
sales where at this level then it
significantly dropped in
2012 then in
2013 there was a huge Spike and then in
again came down in 2015 and so on so you
can make your own conclusions by looking
at these line charts now let's format
this chart so first of all let's delete
the field buttons present on the chart
and we'll
also delete the Legend all right now let
me just reduce the size of the
chart next we'll add a chart title
so
we'll give the title as
Revenue by year and region
okay you can also format the Y AIS in
terms of
millions so I'll right click on this
axis and I'll select format
AIS I'll scroll down and here we have
the number drop down let me scroll again
under category I'll select custom and we
use this format that we created for us
our previous chart there you go you can
see our access labels have been changed
in terms of millions now so let's close
this and let me save it now you can
reduce the font size or increase the
font size let me just show you suppose
you want to increase the font size of
the chart title so you just select it
and from here you can either reduce or
you can increase you can see now it's 12
if you want you can make it 16 similarly
you can also edit the access labels also
by selecting the chart title you can
also move it to left or right or you can
place it in the center as well for the
time being let me just keep it to the
left all right now we'll see the revenue
and total cost by each region and we'll
create a combo chart for this so let me
show you how to do it I'll go to my data
sheet I have my cell selected we go to
insert and click on pivote table let me
just click on okay all right so for this
I'll select my region onto
rows and
then I'll
have two columns under values the first
one is going to be total revenue and the
next column will be the total cost
column all right so here we have the
pivote table ready now based on this
pivote table let's create our pivote
chart so I'll go to recommended charts
and if you see below at the bottom we
have combo chart so this is the preview
of the combo
chart all right now let me just click on
okay there you go so we have a nice
combo chart ready here now the way to
look at it is the bars represent the
total revenue which is this column
now the line
represents the total cost so let me go
ahead and edit this chart a bit so first
of all let's delete the field buttons
all right and let's also remove the
legend from
here next we'll add data labels so I'll
click on data labels here okay so these
are the data labels
for the bars or the revenue column now
let's format the data labels in terms of
millions so I'll click on this Arrow go
to more options if I scroll down I have
number from here I'll select custom
and I'll choose my type that is in
millions all right so you can see we
have formatted our data next thing we'll
add a chart title so here I'll write as
Revenue
by
region it's actually revenue and total
cost by
region before moving ahead let me rename
the sheets as well I'll write revenue
and total
cost
similarly sheet three also I'm going to
rename it as
Revenue
by year and
region so this makes your sheet more
readable all right now moving
ahead next we are interested to get the
revenue generated by order priority
prity and for this we are going to
create a pie
chart so let's go to the data sheet and
create our pivot table first I click on
okay now I'll select order priority
under rows and under values I'll select
total
revenue so this is a very simple pivote
table so you have your order priority so
C is for critical H is for high L is for
low and M is for medium now based on
this let's create a pie chart so I'll go
to recommended charts and here you have
pie chart I want to select this 3D type
of pie chart and I'll click on okay all
right so we have our pie chart ready let
me just resize it and from here I'll
remove the field buttons and I also
don't need the legend so I'll delete
this as well all right now let's give a
chart title so this is going to be
Revenue
by order
priority now let's add our data labels
I'll check this
option okay now let's again format this
in terms of
millions so
here I'll click on the last option I'll
go to numbers under category I'll select
custom and my type is going to be in
terms of millions there you go let me
close
this I will just move this to the
center all
right now if you want you can change the
color of the text as well so let's have
it in white color and see how it looks
okay so this looks pretty decent
cool
now moving to our next report so this
time we are going to find the total
revenue by countries so we have multiple
countries present in our data set we
want to visualize the revenue generated
in each country so for this we are going
to create a horizontal bar chart so let
me show you how to do it but before
moving ahead let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write Revenue
by I'll just put op which stands for
order priority all right now let's
create our horizontal bar chart I'll go
to insert click on pivote table and
select
okay so I want my Revenue based on
different countries so I'll select
country and put it under rows and then
I'll choose total revenue and place it
under values so here you have the
different country names we have
Afghanistan this Albania let me scroll
down you have
Bangladesh there
are a number of countries you have Czech
Republic there's Estonia France Gabon
similarly if you scroll down we have
India there Jamaica Italy and all the
way to the bottom if you go we have New
Zealand there Netherlands Philippines
Portugal we also
have Singapore
lots and lots of
countries we have the UAE United States
of America Zimbabwe and
others all right let me go up so based
on this pivote table let's create our
pivote chart so I'll go to insert and
select recommended charts from here I'm
going to select the column chart you can
see the preview here and let me click on
okay all right so here you can see
the different country names at the
bottom and the revenue for each of the
countries let's go ahead and edit this
chart so first of all I'll
delete the field buttons okay and let me
also remove the
legend here I'll write
Revenue
by
countries this is going to be my
chart
title
okay let's format this chart a little
more so I'll click on this option and
we'll select a new style let's
say I'll
select style six okay and let me now go
under colors and we'll select the color
of the bars so let's choose this color
okay so you have a horizontal column
chart ready and at the bottom you can
see the different country names and we
have
the
revenue
cool now let me go ahead and rename this
sheet so I'll write Revenue
by
countries
and hit enter
okay and finally we'll create another
report which is going to be part of our
Revenue dashboard and this is revenue by
items so we'll visualize our revenue for
different items present in the table so
if you see this we have Cosmetics
vegetables cereal fruits the cloths
snacks households and other products as
well so let's check the revenue for each
of these
items so we'll continue the same drill
I'll create my pivote table on a new
worksheet and this time I'm going to
drag item type under rows and we have
the total revenue under values so here
on the left of the table you can see we
have the different item names and then
we have the total revenue so let me just
s this
total
revenue from largest to smallest so you
can see here office supplies meet the
highest amount of Revenue followed by
household then cosmetics and fruits meet
the lowest amount of
Revenue I'll click on this go to insert
and select recommended charts this time
I'm going to create a bar chart so this
is how my bar chart is going to look
like I'll select okay all right now
let's format this chart a
bit I'll delete the field buttons and
I'll delete the legend as
well
and let's edit the chart title so this
is going to
be
Revenue by items
cool we also want to change the
color of the bars so I've selected all
the bars I'll go to my home Tab and here
let's say I want to select green color
all
right I've edited my chart a bit
now
let's make
it
14 and I'll remove the
Bold okay here if you want you you can
change the font Also let's keep it in
blue color all
right finally let's rename this sheet so
I'll write Revenue by
items
cool finally now it's time for us to
merge all the charts that we have
created to our
dashboard so let me show you how you can
create the dashboard I'll create a a new
sheet and first thing I'm going to do is
I'll click on The View Tab and uncheck
grid lines so this will remove the grid
lines present in the worksheet next I'm
going to insert an image so we'll have a
background image on our dashboard so the
way to do is I'll go to the insert Tab
and under illustrations I have the
option to select pictures or insert
pictures so I'm going to insert
picture present on the device that is my
computer I'll go to desktop and here I
have a folder called Excel dashboard
files and I'll select this dashboard
background and hit
insert so this is going to insert an
image now let me just drag this image so
it covers a fair
portion so I'll hit shift and I'll drag
it all
right so you can see I have successfully
added a background image if you want you
can
still expand this background image a bit
to the right
cool now the next
thing is going to be the title of the
dashboard so I'll click on insert and
here I have the option to select a text
box so I'll click on a text box
and I'm going to place a text box in the
middle and I'm going to name this text
box as
Excel Revenue
dashboard
on
Sals
I'll centrer line
it let's do some more formatting so I'll
select this text box on the top you can
see shape
format here I'm going to expand this
shape fill and I'll select no fill so my
text box is transparent now and I'll
also remove the outline all right now
let me just double click on the title of
my dashboard and I'm going to
select a font you can select whichever
font you
want let me stick to britanica bold and
I'll increase the size to let's say
30 all right I'll just drag the text box
I'll make the text as white instead of
black all right so we have
our title of the dashboard ready now if
you want you can also insert some icons
to this dashboard so I'll go to insert
and I'll click on illustrations again
and select
pictures I'm going to
add these two pictures which is of a
store and a cart
to make it
look visually appealing so I'll place
the
icons here and similarly let me just
copy
it and I'll place
the cart and the
store to the right as
well all
right
next the idea is
to
bring in all the charts that we have
created and place it on the
dashboard so let me
copy each of the charts and place it on
the dashboard so I'll hit control V to
paste
it and we'll resize this as
well all
right
similarly let me bring in all the other
charts as
well all right so now you can see I have
added all my charts and graphs to this
dashboard so you can see here we have
our line charts our column charts the
combo charts the Spy chart and others
now let me go ahead and format these
charts a little more so you can see this
looks a bit cluttered so let's adjust
the labels let me bring this down
similarly I'll bring 190 million a
little
below all right this looks fine
now one more thing we are going to do
is we'll remove the white background
from each of the charts and make it
transparent so let me show you how to do
it so I'll select this chart
then I'll right click and go to format
chart
area here on the right you see we have
an option called No fill so if I select
no fill you can see the white background
is gone now similarly let me also remove
the grid lines so I'll select the grid
lines and hit delete so you have also
removed the grid lines from here now
let's also remove the white outline that
we have so I'll select this chart go to
format and here I'll go to shape outline
and I'll select no outline you see this
so we have our total revenue by year
which is a line chart and this is
completely transparent now now what I'm
going to do is I'll place this chart
over a box so I'll go to insert and in
insert we have the option to create a
shape so I'll click on illustrations and
here I'll choose a shape and let me
select a rectangle so I'll just create a
rectangle
here all right and now what I'll do is
I'll select this and bring this to front
I'll right click and choose bring to
front and I'll place this
shape below it all right now the next
thing is to edit the shape so first I'll
change the color of this box so let me
select this blue color and and let me
increase the transparency so I'll right
click and go to format shape here I'll
increase the transparency let's keep it
to
25% or let's say 20% all right next
thing we'll just convert all the font to
to white
color including the access labels the
chart
title will
also convert all
the access labels to white color so it
looks better now we'll just adjust
our chart over here next thing let's
just remove the outline so I'll go to
shape outline and I'll select outline
you see we have now formatted our chart
let's just pull this a little
up all right now we'll add this blue
background to all the other charts so
we'll first add the background make it
transparent and then we'll convert the
font text to white color to make it more
readable and visible so for the time
being I'll just pause the video and come
back
again all right so now you can see on
your screens we have nicely formatted
our dashboard so I have added a few
logos for each of the charts you can see
the logos here so for Revenue by
countries we have a globe then if you
see here this is kind of a map or a
location similarly we have all formatted
the color of the bars then we have also
formatted the L labs in terms of
millions if you look on the Y AIS even
the revenue for year in region are all
formatted in terms of
millions if you want this you can also
format the total year by Revenue in
terms of millions so the way to do is
you can select this graph right click
and go to format
access here if I scroll down you have
numbers and under category I'll select
custom then I'll select my type as this
format which is in
millions and you see here we have
successfully formatted our Y axis
labels all right so the next thing is to
add slicers and timelines to our
dashboard now slicers are used to format
your data based on a particular column
suppose if you want to see Revenue by
certain items you can add item as a
slicer and you can view the
entire dashboard similarly for timelines
you can add date columns so if you want
to see what was the amount of sales or
revenue generated on a particular year
or a particular month you can do that
using a timeline so I'll select one of
the charts and then either you can go to
the insert Tab and here you can see
under filters we have slices and
timeline
or if you go to the pivote Chart analyze
tab here also you have insert slicer and
timeline option so I select insert
slicer here first now it's giving me the
list of fields present in the data set
so I'll select country region and let's
say we want
to know by item type and sales Channel
so these are going to be my four slicers
I'll click on
okay you can see it here we have our
four slicers here and these are the list
of values under region we have Asia this
Europe North America and others
similarly we have the different country
names for Country slices and then for
item type also we have all the items
that were present in our data set
now moving ahead we need to connect all
the slicers to a dashboard so what I'll
do is I'll right
click on this option and I'll go to
report
connections okay so under report
connections you have all the pivote
tables that we
created you currently see only one of
the pivote table is selected so we need
to select all the peot tables so let me
check all the p tables present in this
workbook and click on okay all right now
that we have connected one of our slices
we'll now connect the other remaining
slicers so I'll right click on this go
to report connections and I'll check all
the pivote tables present in this
worksheet click on okay similarly let's
do it for the country slicer I'll go to
report connections and let me
select all the pivote tables
and finally we have the item type so
I'll right click go to report
connections and then I'll select all my
Pivot
tables and let's hit okay all right now
let me just organize this a bit so I'll
place my Pivot
tables to the
right I'll just reduce the
size
let me scroll
down I'll
add my region slicer
here
similarly I'll add my final slicer that
is sales Channel now in our next
dashboard which is going to be the
profit dashboard I'll show you how to
add a
timeline all right now now I have
arranged all my
slicers so let's say you want to find
the revenue that was generated for an
item type let's say beverages so you can
just select beverages here and all your
charts show the respective revenues so
you have the total revenue by year for
beverages only similarly here you can
see the revenue by year and region only
for beverages item type if I scroll
down now this chart represents the
revenue that was generated in each of
the countries only for item type
beverages let me just uncheck
it all
right let's say you want to
see the revenue generated for a country
like India so I have selected India here
and now you can
see my graph has changed only for
country
India you can see here it is showing
only for India
now now similarly you can also filter
your revenues based on the different
regions let's say you want to know the
revenue generated based on sales channel
so we have two sales channel that is
offline and online suppose you want to
know the revenue generated offline so
I'll just select offline you can see the
values have changed so these were the
revenues generated for each of the items
only for
offline if you see here now these were
all the offline sales for the different
regions
so this is our entire Excel Revenue
dashboard on sales we create created
multiple charts and graphs then we
applied different formatting we added
different icons then we formatted the
labels also next we added slicers and
finally we saw how we could filter our
data based on these
slicers likewise now we are going to
create a profit dashboard based on the
same data so before moving ahead let me
rename this sheet as
Revenue dashboard I'll write
R dashboard
okay now we'll move to our data sheet
and start creating our P tables and po
charts for the profit
dashboard all right so let me go ahead
and create my first pivote table
so I'll create a new
worksheet this time I'm going to create
a line chart to visualize the profit for
each year so I'll drag my total profit
column to values and my order year to
rows so here you can see we have
our pivote table ready now you can sort
this data to get an idea as to
which year had the highest profit and
which year had the lowest profit so from
this pivote table you can see since I've
sorted this data in descending order so
2014 had the maximum amount of profit
and 2017 had the least amount of profit
I'll just do control Z to undo it all
right now based on this pivot table let
me go ahead and create my P chart so
I'll go to recommended charts and click
on a line chart so this is the preview
of the chart I'll click on okay let me
close this
similarly we are going
to edit this chart now so first I'll
hide all the field buttons present on
the chart and I'll rename the chart
title as
total
profit by
year next I'm going to remove the legend
so I'll delete
this let's do some more
formatting so I'll go to
style
and this time
I'm going to
select my style type okay and if you
want you can choose the colors as well
for the time being let's have this
yellow color next let me add the data
labels so again if you see here this is
not formatted properly so let's go ahead
and format
the data labels so I'll click on number
and I'll select custom
here and the type I'm going to select is
in millions and I'll click on close so
here you can see we have
our line chart ready which shows total
profit by year let's rename this sheet
as
profit
by Year all right now let's move back to
our data sheet again next we are going
to show the total profit by countries
for this I'm going to create a map so
let me first create my pivote table so
I'll go to insert and I'll click on
pivote
table let me click on
okay since I want the country names so
I'll select country under row and then I
have my total profit under
values the next thing I'm going to do is
is I'll just rename the row labels as
countries and
then I'm going to delete the grand total
which you can see at the bottom so here
we have the grand total let me just
delete the grand total so I'm going to
select this P table go to the design tab
here we have sub totals and Grand totals
I'll switch off the grand total let me
just verify it again I'll scroll down
you see the grand total has gone now all
right now we want to create a map out of
this the way to do is I'm going to
select my
data copy it I'll go on top and I'll
paste it here using this data I can
create my field map now so I'll go to
insert here we have the option to create
a field map there you go you can see we
have our map ready
I can expand this now as you can see our
map has a color scale which comes from
light gray color to dark blue color so
the countries that are in Gray or you
can say light blue have the lowest
amount of profit while the regions or
the countries that have been shaded
in dark color or dark blue color have
highest amount of profit I will go ahead
and delete this scale
okay next we need to connect this map to
the original data source so what I'm do
is I'll right click on this map and I'll
go to select data here instead of the
previous range I'll give my new Range
now so my new Range will be my original
poo table that I had created I'll go on
top and click on okay so we have our map
ready now now if you want you can change
the color of the shade so I'll just go
to colors and let's say we'll keep green
color so the countries that are shaded
in dark green have the highest amount of
profit while those which are highlighted
in light green color are are the
countries that made least amount of
profit okay now moving
on next we want to create a pivote table
that will show us the profit by year and
sales channel so for this we are going
to create another line chart so I'll go
to insert and click on pivote table so
I'll select new worksheet here since I
want to know the profit by year first of
all I'll drag my order year column to
rows and then I'll choose my total
profit column under values next I'm
going to select my sales Channel under
columns there you go so we have our P
table here based on this P table let me
create my poot chart so I'll go to
recommended charts and I'm going to
create a line
chart I close
this you see here based on this chart
you can tell the profit generated with
online sales were actually lower than
that of offline so here the blue l
represents offline profit and the Orange
Line represents Online Profit if you
Mark Clearly in year 2012 the Online
Profit was actually higher than the
offline profit so let me go ahead and
edit this chart a bit so we'll delete
the field buttons I'll also delete the
legend for now let me go ahead and add a
chart title so I'll
write profit
by year
and sales
Channel
okay so this is my second report before
moving ahead let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write
profit
by
countries similarly let me rename this
sheet as
profit by year and let's say SC for
sales
Channel
okay moving
ahead now I want to create a pie chart
based on a pivote table that will show
The Profit by sales Channel only so this
is going to be a simple pie chart so
I'll first go to insert click on P table
and click on okay so I'll drag my my
sales Channel under rows and then we'll
have the total profit column under
values so this is my simple pivote table
now let's create our pivote chart which
is going to be a pie chart let me
explore the other types of pie charts we
have okay so I'm going to select a donut
chart here I click on okay let's edit
this chart I'll remove the field buttons
let me now remove the Legend as well
I'll just resize it and this is going to
be
profit
by sales
Channel
okay let's also
add data
labels and here again I'm going
to format this label
I'll select the category as custom and
my type will be in millions okay let me
just move
this to the
left and this to the right
okay let's also delete the lines
cool now let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write profit
by let's SC C which stands for sales
Channel cool finally I'm going to create
a report that will show the revenue and
profit by items so I'll go ahead and
create my pivote table first this time
I'll choose my total profit under
values and we'll also have the revenue
column so I'll put my Revenue at the top
then I'm going to
select item type under rows so here is
my pivote table based on this pivote
table let me now create a combo chart so
you can see the preview of the chart the
blue bars represent the total revenue
and the Orange Line represents the total
profit I'll click on okay let me close
this first let's remove the field
buttons let's also remove
the legend
here then we'll add a chart title I'll
name it
as
revenue
and
profit by
items okay if you want you can also go
ahead and change the color of the
bars so let me just select
one of these colors
okay all right so we have our five
reports ready that we are going to use
for our profit
dashboard next let's create a new sheet
and we'll get started with building a
dashboard so I'll click on a new sheet
let me just rename this as profit
dashboard all right we'll continue with
the previous TR
so first of all let's go to the view Tab
and remove the grid lines now we'll
insert a background image like we did
for our Revenue dashboard so I'll go to
insert under illustrations I'll click on
pictures and select this device I'm
going to have the same background I'll
click on
insert all right so you can see we have
a picture of a company or you can say an
organization let's just drag
this a bit to the
right we'll adjust the size
also all
right now let's copy the title of my
profit dashboard so here you can see I
have brought my Revenue
dashboard and I'll copy the title and
the logos that we used for the revenue
dashboard I'll paste it on my new
dashboard let's just align
it in the
center all right the next step let me
now go ahead and edit the title so this
is actually going to be
Excel profit dashboard instead of
Revenue now we'll copy each of the
charts that we just created for example
the revenue and profit by items then we
had profit by sales
Channel all this we are going to copy
one by one and put it on the profit
dashboard so let me just copy a few
now I'll paste it
here and later on we can make the
adjustment copy this as
well similarly I'll bring the other
three charts onto my sales
dashboard okay so here on my profit
dashboard I have added all the
charts and I have aligned and reshaped
it so that it looks good I've also made
some formatting for example I've reduced
the size of the chart
title now let me go ahead and show you a
few more formatting that we also did for
the revenue dashboard first let's remove
the white background from all the charts
so I'll select the first chart I'll
right click and I'll click on format
chart area here under fill I'll select
no fill next I'm going to remove the
grid lines so I'll just delete it let me
close this now we also have a outline so
I'll go to
design format and I'll remove the
outline next I'm going to
add a blue box at the back like how we
did for the revenue dashboard so let me
select a blue box from here and I'm
going to paste it here okay and let me
just select the chart and I'll bring
this to front and I'll move
this to the
back next I'm going to change the font
color all to White so that it's clearly
visible and it's more
readable I'll do it for the x-axis as
well okay so here I have my first chart
ready the same I'm going to do for the
rest of the
charts okay so now you can see here I
have formatted all my charts I've also
added a blue background you see here
here I have also formatted the V labels
in terms of millions which is actually
the profit similarly here I have added
the data labels this is for
Revenue some of the charts also have the
data Legends so here you can see the
blue color represents
offline and the red represents online
similarly here you have the Legends I've
also formatted the map as well okay now
now the next thing is to make this
dashboard more interactive so we'll add
our slicers as well as timeline first
let me show you how to add a timeline so
I'll select one of the charts and I'll
go to insert under insert I have the
option to create a timeline so I'll
just click on
timelines so timeline is actually based
on date columns so since in our data set
we only have two date columns one is
order date and one is ship date so Excel
has only shown us two columns so I'm
going to create my timeline based on
order date so I'll select my order date
column and I'll click on okay you can
see here this is called a timeline I can
expand this now this timeline is based
on months now now if I scroll this
timeline you can see here I have my
order year 2010 and I have all the 12
months similarly we have for for 2011
then we have for 2012 all the way till
2017 now you can filter this in terms of
years quarters months or days let me
just select year now so I have years
from 2010 till 2017 let me just squiz
this and I'll place it somewhere here on
the
right now let me go ahead and create a
few slicers for my profit dashboard so I
have selected one of the charts under
insert I'll click on
slicer you can see it gives me the list
of columns from which I want to create
slicers so I'll create region let me
also select
country let's say I
want the representatives name or the
customer's name and I'll click on okay
so here I have created three
slicers let me me first resize it and
I'll place
it on the
right similarly I'll place the country
column
also then we have the region
slicer I'll resize this and I'll bring
it here okay the next thing we need to
do is I have to connect all the slicers
and the timeline
to the P tables for the profit dashboard
so I'm going to click
on the multiple select option and go to
report connections here I'm going to
select all the pivot tables that are
related to
profit so here I have selected four and
I need one more which is p table number
10 I click on okay similarly let's
create or connect my region fi filter to
all the pivote tables so I right click
go to report connections here I'll
choose all my pivote tables which are
based on
profit I'll click on okay let's do it
for the country slicer as
well click on okay and similarly I'll
connect my timeline as well I'll go to
report
connections and I'll say
select all the pivot tables related to
profit then I'll click on okay let me
now go ahead and create another slicer
based on sales channel so I'm selecting
one of the poot charts I'll go to insert
click on slicer and I'll select sales
Channel and hit
okay so I have my sales Channel slicer
now let me connect it to all the
respective P tables
that are based on
profit click on
okay now let me just bring it here all
right the next thing I want to show is
how are we going to use the timeline
first so you see we have all
the years here from 2010 till
2017 now suppose you want to know the
profit that was generated in the the
year 2012 so I'll just click on this
range and now you can see our charts
only show information for 2012 so this
dot represents that was 51 million
profit in the year 2012 similarly you
can see
here the profit by sales channel for
2012 from the map you can see the
different countries and the profit each
of these countries made in 201 12 if I
scroll down you can see the revenue and
profit by items now if I
select another year let's say
2013 I can just drag this to the right
and now you can
see our profit by year and sales channel
for offline and online you can see the
map or the line chart for total profit
by year so in 2012 it was 51 million and
then it went up to 54 million in
2013 similarly our map has also changed
now this is a sort of an information
that we have you can click on this
and check the information that Excel has
prompted all right so this is how you
can use a timeline now as I said we
checked by years you can also see it for
months and quarters as well let me just
uncheck
it I'll send it back to the place where
it was and I'll reduce the
size okay now suppose you want to check
the profit made by different
Representatives you can select them one
by one let's say Adam Churchill this is
the profit generated by Adam
churel similarly you can select multiple
persons as well now suppose you want to
see the profit by different countries so
you can use the country slicer let me
just bring this to the middle and let's
expand our chart a
bit okay so here you have
the profit by different countries chart
I'll just bring this to the front so
that you can see it clearly okay now
here suppose you want to see the profit
generated in let's say United Kingdom
you can select United Kingdom so this is
the map of United Kingdom and it tells
you the total profit that was generated
in United Kingdom and Below you can see
the revenue and profit for all the items
that was sold in United Kingdom so you
had beverages cloths household office
supplies you can see clearly office
supplies item meet the highest amount of
profit in United Kingdom now you can
also select multiple countries let's say
I want to know for France as well so
my map will change accordingly so now I
have United Kingdom and France selected
and the other charts present in my
dashboard change accordingly now I have
my country select elected as India you
can see the map of India
here and these were the respective
profit values now one thing to note here
is this is actually not Millions this
should be in K that is Thousands so
please mark this as thousand and not in
millions even for this this is actually
K and not
million all right so we have
successfully created our second
dashboard that is on profit let me just
resize this a bit and we'll place it
where it was
earlier
cool so we saw how to create different
poot tables and poot charts and then we
formatted our poot charts based on our
requirement we saw how to edit the
colors now let me show you one more
thing you can also change the look and
feel of of the dashboard by going to the
page layout tab under page layout you
have themes so here you can select
different themes currently we are with
the office theme now let me just select
another theme let's say faet you see the
colors have changed and it
looks really
beautiful similarly let me try out
another theme let's say organic you see
our chart has changed let me just delete
this okay so now once you change the
theme the text also change a bit you can
see the slicers are in a different
font let me explore One More theme let's
say this time I'm going to choose
depth and this is more of a green type
of
color you can play around and select
whatever theme suits the best all
right now let me just move back to my
Revenue dashboard and see how it looks
there you go so since we changed our
theme even our Revenue dashboard is also
impacted
so this is how it looks
now you can always go ahead and play
with different themes colors fonts and
effects all right
so in this demo we saw how to create a
revenue dashboard so we created line
charts this combo chart pie chart
horizontal and vertical bar charts and
then we learned how to add slicers and
connected to different P tables and we
filtered our data to see Revenue as well
as profit by items by countries by
different regions sales Channel we
learned how to create a map and lots
more and with that we have reached to
