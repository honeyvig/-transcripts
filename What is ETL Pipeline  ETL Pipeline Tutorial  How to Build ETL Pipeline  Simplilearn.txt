welcome to the world of data
transformation and integration in
today's fast-paced digital landscape
businesses face a daunting challenge
extracting valuable insights from
massive amounts of data enter the edl
pipeline the backbone of data processing
and analytics in this tutorial we will
embark on an accelerating Journey
unveiling the secrets of building a
powerful ETL pipeline whether you are a
seasoned data engineer or just starting
your data driven Adventure this video is
your gateway to unlocking the full
potential of your data together we will
demystify the edl process step by step
we'll dive into the extract phase where
we retrieve data from multiple sources
ranging from databases to apis and then
we'll seamlessly transition into the
transformation phase where we clean
validate and reshape the data into a
consistent format but wait there's more
we will explore Cutting Edge techniques
for handling large data sets leveraging
cloud-based Technologies and ensuring
quality we aim to equip you with tools
and knowledge to create robust and
scalable ETL pipelines to handle any
data challenge so buckle up and get
ready to revolutionize your data
workflow join us in this accelerating
journey to master the art of ETL
pipelines having said that if an
aspiring data analyst looking for online
training and certifications from
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading experts then
search no more simply learns
postgraduate program in data analytics
from Purdue University in collaboration
with IBM should be a right choice for
more details use the link in the
description box below with that in mind
over to our training experts hey
everyone so without further Ado let's
get started the PTL pipeline so ETL
basically stands for extract transform
and row so ETL pipelines fall under the
umbrella of data pipelines a data
pipeline is simply a medium of data
extraction filtration transformation
exploiting and loading activities
through which the data is delivered from
producer to Consumer to make it a little
simpler the data is produced in two type
let's say you run a vehicle showroom and
you are being a data producer so the
data that you produce is very less and
that could be basically fit into an
Excel sheet this type of data might need
update once in 24 hours or based on your
audit cycle here we call it match data
and this data is processed using the
oltp model and batch processing tools
but now let's say you're running an
entire vehicle manufacturing plant now
the data you're dealing with is
voluminous and includes various types of
data it can be structured data
understood semi-structured data ranging
from space inventory to all the way up
to robotic assembly sensors data based
on requirements this type of data needs
updates maybe every hour every minute or
even every second such type of data is
called real-time data and needs
real-time data streaming Frameworks and
the data is processed using o l a p
models now ETL is involved in both these
approaches now let's dive in and
understand what exactly is an ETL
pipeline ETL stands basically for
extract transform and load and
representing these three core steps in
data integration and transformation
process let's dive into each phase and
explore their significance firstly
extract the first step in ETL pipeline
is extracting data from various sources
these sources can range from relational
databases they data warehouses apis or
even streaming platforms the goal is to
gather raw data and bring it into
centralized location for further
processing tools like Apache Kafka
Apache nifi or even custom scripts can
be used to perform the extraction
efficiently next is transform once the
data is extracted it often requires a
significant cleaning validation and
restructuring this is transformation
phase the transformation phase ensures
that the data is consistent standardized
and ready for analysis Transformations
can include tasks such as data cleansing
filtering aggregating joining or
applying a complex and business rules
tools like Apache spark Talent OR python
libraries like pandas are commonly used
with these Transformations lastly we
have the load phase the final step is
loading the transform data into Target
systems such as data warehouse data lake
or database optimized for analysis this
allows business users and analysts to
access and query the data easily loading
can inboard batch processing or
real-time streaming depending upon the
requirements of the Business
Technologies like Apache Hadoop Amazon
redshift or Google bigquery are often
employed for efficient data loading now
that he understood the core phases let's
explore some key Concepts and best
practices for building robust ETL
pipelines firstly data quality ensuring
data quality is crucial for Reliable
analysis implementing data validation
checks handling missing values and
resolving data and consistencies are
vital to maintaining data Integrity
throughout the pipeline next is
scalability as data volumes grow
exponentially scalability becomes
essential distributed computing
Frameworks like Apache spark enable
processing lowest data setting value
allowing the pipelines to handle
increasing data loads efficiently
thirdly we have error handling and money
train robust error handling mechanisms
such as retry logging and alerting
should be implemented to handle failures
gracefully additionally monitoring tools
can provide real-time insights into
pipeline performance allowing quick
identification and resolution of issues
next we have incremental loading for
continuously evolving data sets
incremental loading strategies can
significantly improve pipeline
efficiency rather than processing the
entire data set each time only the new
or modified data is extracted and
transformed reducing processing time and
resource consumption and lastly we have
a data garments and security
incorporating data gun statuses and
adhering to security protocols is
crucial for protecting sensitive data
and ensuring compliance with regulations
like gdpr or hip AAA now that we have
covered what exactly is ETL and ATF
stages and also the best practices for
18 pipelines less proceeding with
understanding the popular ETL tools so
the first one amongst the popular ETL
tools is the Apache airflow Apache
airflow is an open source platform that
allows you to schedule Monitor and
manage complex workflows Apache airflow
provides a red set of operators and
connectors enabling seamless integration
with various data sources and
destinations next is Talent a
comprehensive ETL tool that offers a
visual interface for Designing data
integration workflows Talent provides a
vast array of pre-built connectors
Transformations and data quality
features making an ideal choice for
Enterprises and lastly we have
Informatica Informatica is a widely used
Enterprise grade ETL tool that supports
complex data integration scenarios Power
Center offers a robust set of features
like metadata management data profiling
and the data lineage and powering
organizations and with that we have
