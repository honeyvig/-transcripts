our YouTube channel and hit the Bell
icon so that you are the first to know
when we host with that mind let's get
started so this is our data set for the
X lookup on Excel you can down load this
data set from the description box below
so here let's start with X lookup so
here I would like equals to X
lookup
thank you so first we have to write this
this is the formula for the X lookup X
logo value X lookup lookup array return
array and these three are the optionals
okay if not found match model and the
search mode these three are the option
so the lookup value for me is the this
stock number okay because only the stock
number are the common on the both you
know sheets you can say
so B2 comma so now we have to see the
lookup array so lookup array will be
over this
I will press the shift down arrow
okay then enter
okay
so
here the next thing is written array so
what we want to return in this
particular column okay that will be the
price I want to print the price
yes
so before that what I will do I will add
you can add the dollar sign using F4 I'm
here adding manually
okay
the Anthology dollar 12 why we are
adding the dollar sign for the range
yeah so when I will drag from here to
here all the price value will become
okay yna because this stock number is
not present in the particular this seat
okay so this is how you can get the
price but
if you want
if you want particular like the size
brand and price all three what you can
do you can simply drag here
okay and you can add the dollar here
or using you can add the dollar using F4
um adding the manually press
ok
so as you can see we have this size we
have the brand name and we have the
price what I will do I will drag down
okay so this is how you can you know
fast the particular value using X lookup
from the different different sheets
this is how you can select the
particular range
what if you don't want
all the three columns but you want the
size and the price and you don't want
the brand
for that what you will do
you will hear right
choose
then bracket
here you will start with the curly
brackets
here you will write the how many columns
do you need one two three four five six
okay so here I will write the
I need the two columns
okay then
what will be your first column
uh
I want my first column
should be the price
so
here I will select zip
I will select the price
as my first column
okay
okay my bad
I want
my first column
here I will add the dollar sign
you can use the F4
and I want my second column should be
the size
okay
here I will add the dollar sign
why we are adding dollar sign for the
particular range for the full range of
the size
okay so here I will enter
so I will drag down
okay
so as you can see here in the First
Column we have the price and the second
column we have the particular size
okay so this is how you can select the
particular cell for the X lookup
okay not dragging and dropping but you
found to this and this size okay how
this is you can select so now as you can
see we are getting this n a value here
okay for that what you can do
double click here so
here
I will give a comma so here as you can
see if not found okay for that but I can
get the double
this is and hit the enter
and I will drag down
so as you can see the blank space
because we haven't wrote here something
okay so here I will write the no
match enter
okay I have already here
enter
then I will drag it down then as you can
see here we have the custom value now no
match
so
this is how you can
fill the blank space or the not matching
values from your custom values
so this is how you can use the X lookup
but here we are using in a particular
single sheet you can add the multiple
sheet
and you can same way you can use the X
lookup as we did in the this sheet
