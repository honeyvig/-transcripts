foreign
I'm sure you're all aware that every
application that we use today has
something called the front end which is
the user interface and the back end
which is the software that accesses data
for us and finally we have the database
to store the data
now these three together form something
called as the full stack so hi guys
welcome to this video on what is full
stack by simply learn but before we
begin if you haven't subscribed to our
Channel already make sure to hit the
Subscribe button and the bell icon to
never miss an update so here's what's in
store for you first we'll have a look at
what front-end development is
then we'll see some of the front-end
languages
then we'll move on to some front-end
libraries and Frameworks
then we'll see what back-end development
is understand some of the popularly used
back-end languages and Frameworks and
finally we'll have a look at the
database
so now what exactly is front end every
time you open a website it has several
UI components and once you click on a
particular icon say sign in in this case
you get navigated to the sign in or the
login page right so what happens is that
all of these items facilitate navigation
and utility
these are collectively called as the
front end
so the front end is the visible part of
the website or the web application which
is responsible for user experience the
user directly interacts with the
front-end portion of the website or the
web application
so now let's have a look at some of the
front-end languages so I'm sure you've
heard of HTML CSS in JavaScript so these
are collectively called the front-end
languages when it comes to HTML it
defines the structure of websites and
formats the web pages it also defines
text documentation so let's look at a
simple example if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit skillup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
so here I've made use of the H1 tag
which is the heading tag in HTML and
I've displayed the message hello welcome
so correspondingly my website displays
the same message
so HTML is responsible or defines what
is being shown on the website next up is
CSS now CSS is a style sheet that allows
you to alter and style different web
components beat size font spacing Etc it
makes the content on the website look
more decorative correct so now if you
have a look at the code here I've added
some styling I've changed the font style
to italic I've made the text bold and
I've changed the color to red and again
correspondingly all the changes I've
seen on the website
moving on we have JavaScript now
JavaScript is a very powerful
client-side scripting language and it is
mainly used for enhancing the
interaction of a user with the web page
so again if you have a look at the code
here I've created a form wherein the
user can enter their name and I've also
displayed the message please enter your
name as a result an input box is made
available whether user can type in their
name now this is facilitated by
JavaScript so as I mentioned earlier it
is used to make web pages interactive
and bring the web applications to life
so next let's have a look at some
front-end Frameworks and libraries now
most of these are JavaScript Frameworks
and libraries first we have react then
there's angular there's view there's
jQuery and then there's bootstrap now
all of these help develop the front end
of the application however when it comes
to react angular in view it's not
necessary that you must know everything
to create a website one of them will be
sufficient however the usage of react is
on the rise and most of the developers
prefer using react jQuery and bootstrap
are also powerful Frameworks that can be
used used to create interactive web
pages now that you know what front-end
development is you must be wondering how
the data is being fetched and how this
data is being presented in front of you
on your screen correct now this is all
facilitated by the back end of the
application so let's understand what
back-end development is
now back end basically refers to the
server-side development of the
application
it is responsible for managing all the
database with the help of queries and
apis so every time the user makes a
request it queries the database and
retrieves the data from the database and
presents it to the user
and lastly it ensures data consistency
so now let's have a look at some
back-end languages and Frameworks
firstly we have node node and express.js
are packages provided by JavaScript
then there's python which is a very
popularly used language python
Frameworks like Django and flask are
popularly used to create the backend of
applications
then there's Java and Java provides
spring and Java server faces which are
also used for backend development then
there's c-sharp which provides
Frameworks like asp.net core and asp.net
MVC and other popularly used back-end
languages are PHP this Pearl and Ruby
database is the collection of
interrelated data which helps an
efficient retrieval insertion and
deletion of data from database and
organizes the data in the form of tables
views schemas reports now some of the
commonly used database Management
systems are MySQL there's postgresql
there's Microsoft SQL Server this Oracle
database and then there's mongodb but
how can we assemblylearn help you if you
wish to make a career as a full stack
developer then a certification will come
in handy for that you could head to our
official website and look for full stack
development courses now we offer the
full step Java developer Masters program
we also provide the postgraduate program
in full stacked web development and we
also provide the full stack web
developer mean stack Masters program you
can go ahead and click on the program
and have a look at the overview if this
suits your requirements you can go ahead
and purchase the course so this is the
website we are going to create in
today's video here you can see we have
an HTML web page with a navigation bar
to take the user to different sections
of a website I hope you already know
that we have to create several web pages
for a single website to make it a fully
functional website we have to create
these Pages separately in different HTML
documents and then we have to provide
the links to this particular home page
for directing the user to various
locations of a website
if you see here in the navigation bar
we have several options starting with a
company's logo so Comfort learning is
the company's logo here we have an icon
of the book to let the user know that
this website is for learning
so we'll see further in this video how
we can use these logos and all then we
have links for several other web pages
of our website that are not working
because we haven't added these web pages
till now the reason for this is we don't
want to make this project a long one we
want to finish it quickly and we want to
give you guys a basic idea of how to use
JavaScript and other Technologies to
create a fully functional website
next up we have a card button over here
on clicking it opens the cart with items
present inside it and the user can
either clear the whole cart or proceed
further to buy all the things they need
right following this card button we have
a background image over here with a card
present over the image
the card says find your favorite course
here now you guys might have guessed
that this website is for buying courses
and the user can buy some courses here
which they want to study
this shop now button is completely
working and if we click on it it will
take us to the courses catalog where we
have several courses present to choose
from we have eight different courses
present here you can add as many courses
as you want or as many products as you
want
so we can add any of them to the cart on
taking the mouse cursor over any image
you can see it gives us an option to add
that particular product to the cart
right
if we click on this add to cart button
you can see it says in cart it means
that we can't add any specific course to
the cart more than once
we can later change the number of items
in the cart but we can add a course only
once from you let's add some courses to
the card and then we'll see if it's
working or not
so we'll add few courses we'll add this
one so it says this course is already
present in cart similarly this course is
also present and we can add this course
now we'll move to the cart we will click
on this card button and you can see we
have all the courses present over here
now if you notice here we have these
small arrows present right we can click
on these arrows to change the number of
items we can either increase the number
of items or we can decrease the number
of items as well then we have a remove
button over here and if we click on this
remove button you can see the course is
removed now we can remove any number of
courses we want and we can also increase
the number of products in our card
following it we have two options over
here either we can clear the whole cart
or we can proceed if we click on this
clear card button there will be no
course present in the card and the total
price will change to 0 in that case fine
so I hope you guys must have known the
task by now it's clear and seems
effortless right but these small things
take a lot of precise coding and
attention to work smoothly
so let me show you guys one more thing
before we move on to the coding part if
we reduce the size of a web page or we
can say if we remove the size of a
browser you can see the size of website
also changes if we make the browser
similar to a phone you can see we have
got a menu type of thing over here and
if we click on this we are getting the
options here we have home categories
pricing and about us right so these were
the options present in the navigation
bar we can get them inside a particular
menu using CSS we'll see how it actually
works
so a website is responsive right we'll
do it with the help of CSS so let's move
on to the programming part now
so here we are in the vs code we have
all the images already present inside
the images folder in our system so if
you want to see you can see here we have
all the images present over here and we
have four different files we have app.js
we have
index.html products.json to add products
and we have style.css to style all the
elements fine here we are in the HTML
file some of you guys may think that
HTML CSS and JavaScript were fine but
what's up with the Json thing we haven't
heard of it in the previous videos
so let me tell you guys Json stands for
JavaScript object notation just like we
create objects in JavaScript Json is
also used to create objects like name
value Pairs and later we can use these
objects to retrieve that data in a HTML
file in simple words to add an item to a
cart we need to store it somewhere to
get that data related to the object and
then we can add those items to our cart
so Json is used to transmit the data
between a server and a web application
we need to store our products somewhere
so that we can use them when added to
cart so you'll get to know more about it
while working on it basically so for now
if you know enough about JavaScript
objects then Json will be easy for you
guys because the syntax remains almost
similar in both the cases that is in
JavaScript and in Json
so let's start writing the code now here
we are in a HTML file and we have
already linked all the files over here
you can see here we have used font
awesome library for icons we'll use on
our website you have seen that book icon
we have used in a logo part and several
other icons like the cart icon Etc so
we'll include those predefined icons in
a HTML file using this particular
library to include this specific Library
you don't have to do much of a task go
to Google Search
cdnjs.com slash libraries
slash font awesome
go to Google and search for this and
then select version
4.7.0 under the version option copy the
third URL with min.css as extension and
paste it into your HTML file as simple
as that I'll let you know about the
classes we'll use while working on the
website now let's start with the
programming part
the first thing we have on our website
is the navigation bar right let me show
it to you again so here you can see we
have a navigation bar we'll first work
on this one only
so let's start writing the code so this
is the output of a current website so
what we'll do is
will minimize the browser and we'll
start writing the code here only
so what we'll do is we'll write here nav
class is equals to nav bar
then inside this we'll write div
class is equals 2.
Burger
and inside this we'll write three div
tags fine we'll write here div class is
equals to layer 1.
we'll close this div we'll copy it from
here and we'll paste it again three
times
fine
we'll write here layer 2 and layer 3 is
class then after this particular div tag
We'll add another div tag with
class is logo
then inside this we'll use the span tag
we'll write here span class
is equals to logo
logo text and then we'll
write here
I will use the itag to make it a little
bit italic so we'll use the class as
far
far book fine
we'll write here
tile
is equals to margin
margin right will write your margin
right as
0.1 M then we'll write here
similarly we can close this fine
now we have added the book icon to our
website
then what we'll do is we'll write here
again span will use the span tag within
this span tag we'll write here
tile is equals to
color and the color code is
hash
f095 D1
so these are the color codes for this
particular website
will use them we have written here F 0 9
d51
fine
then what we'll do is we'll write here
font size as
1.1 M and what we'll do next is we'll
write here
before the span tag closes we'll write
here
learning fine okay so what we did wrong
here is we forgot to mention Comfort
here
now we are done with the logo part next
up what we'll do is we'll write here div
class is equals to
menu bar we are working on the menu bar
for the hamburger menu so what we'll do
is we'll write here
UL so UL stands for unordered list we'll
write here class is
list
and inside this we'll use
litec so we'll write here
class is let's say list items
will
right here
a href is equals to hash
and here what we'll do is we'll write
here who fine we'll copy this piece of
code
we'll paste it again
three or four times we have four
different options we have home we have
courses and then we have pricings
and finally we have about us fine so we
are done with menu as well next up what
we'll do is we'll write the code for
card now so we'll write here div
class is equals to cart
and inside this will write
I
class is equals to
far far shopping cart for 1X so here we
have used this special class to include
the card icon to a web page now next up
what we'll do is we'll write here
div
class is equals
two number of
items
and then we'll write here
pen
class is equals to let's say noi
now what we'll do is we'll write here 0
inside this fine
I hope you guys understood what we did
till now we are working on the
navigation bar only we have created the
navigation bar so this is the code
firstly we have used a class navbar for
this particular navigation bar then we
have used the div tag for Burger menu we
have three different layers layer 1
layer 2 and layer 3. so this is actually
the icon of burger menu you can see here
if we reduce the size of our website so
we have defined this burger menu and
inside this we have four other options
which we defined later here inside the
menu bar
and we have four options right we have
home courses pricings and about us
so we are doing totally right
so till now we did some basic tasks here
right we have added all the navigation
bar elements and the next thing we have
to do is to style our navigation bar
according to the final website it's
pretty simple let's do one thing let's
save it once and check the output now
let's see if it's working so it's
totally working we have a book icon over
here we have comfort learning written
over here we have cart icon over here
and we have zero written over here fine
now we have to style those elements
accordingly to make it look like this so
we are making this navigation bar so
what we'll do is we'll move to a CSS
file and we'll start styling by doing
some default style changes to the entire
HTML document we'll write here
star
margin will be 0 the default margin will
be zero
padding will be 0
then we have
box sizing we'll write here border box
and font size will be
20 pixels for default fine
next up we'll write here
HTML will now style the HTML document
we'll write here
scroll behavior is smooth
and will
write here anchor tag we'll write here
text decoration and we'll write a text
decoration as none
and then we'll style the unordered list
we'll write a UL
right here
list style as
none fine
basic styling is done let's do some more
for the navigation bar as well what
we'll do is we'll write here
dot navbar this is the first class we
have used in a HTML page
we'll write here display is
Flex
then we'll write here
justify content as
space between
align items as
Center
height as nvh so 10 VH refers to the
viewport height it will take 10 percent
of the total height of the screen
then we have
background color as hash
e c e c e c so a little bit of gray
grayish white we can say
then next thing we'll do is we'll style
a logo we'll write here logo and inside
this will write
padding so you will write here padding
left and the padding left will be 2m
next up we'll write here logo
text so this is the next class we'll
write here
font size is 1.5
m
now the next class we have to use is
the menu bar class so we'll write here
width is 45 percent
and
margin left is
8.5 M fine
I'll let you know what this m means in a
moment so first we'll do this styling
and all next up we'll write here dot
list
we'll access the list and we'll write
here inside this display is flex
and
justify content as space between
fine next up we have the list items so
we'll write here list items
and we'll of course write here a as well
we'll write here color and the color
will be let's say black
next up what we'll do is we'll write
here
font family is
sensitive font size is
0.9 m
so you must have noticed earlier that
the default font size was 20 pixels so
keep that in mind I'll let you know the
use of M in a moment next up we'll write
here
transition as 0.4 seconds
and we are good to go with it next up
we'll
write here list items
and we'll write here
oh fine
then we'll write here
color is
black
on hovering the color of the list items
will change to Black
now the next thing we'll do is we'll
write here cart
ing right will be
2m and Position will be relative fine
we are done with the cart next up we'll
write here
cart
number
of items fine
we'll write here
display is
Flex
cursor is
pointer we are using repeat we are
styling two different classes here we
are styling the element with classes cut
and the element with classes number of
items fine we'll write here justify
contents
to Center
align items to Center
will write here color is
White
Position will be absolute
and then we'll write here left
is 18 pixels and
write as okay sorry we'll write here
left as 18 pixels and top as
minus 7 pixels
next up we'll write
background
so the background color will be hash f
0 9
D 5 1.
so this will be a the background color
we'll Define the height and width as
well so height will be
20 pixels and the width will also be
20 pixels fine
the last thing we have to write here is
the Border radius
so keep one thing in mind guys while you
are styling all these elements do check
the website after every styling event
because this will let you know what this
particular event does or what this
particular styling property does to that
particular element so do it when you are
writing this code next up we'll write
here
DOT number of items space dot knowing so
now it was the class we have already
declared we'll write here font size as
0.7 m
the next class will be styling is the
shopping cart so we'll style this icon
as well we'll write here
font size as 1.5 m
the font size will be equal to around 30
pixels
then we'll write here
cursor is
pointer
then we'll write here
Burger will
tell the menu as well we'll write here
height height will be 28 pixels
width
will be
32 pixels
and then we'll write here
display is none then we'll
style the layers as well we'll write
here dot layer 1 dot layer 2.
and Dot layer
3.
now inside this we'll write
background as
black
height S4 pixel
margin top is
4 pixel
width as
100 percent and we'll write here border
radius is 10 pixels
fine you have seen that hamburger menu
you have seen that icon we were styling
that till now now you might have noticed
here that we have used M here in this
CSS file so I'm talking about this
particular m
or we can say em as well
until now we were using rem or pixel to
define the size of anything while
studying but today we are using M
because M uses the font size for example
if the font size is 30 for the parent
class in this case the font size is 20
the default font size is 20. and the
padding is defined as 2m then the
padding will be 40 in that case it uses
the font size to determine the size of
the property that's why we are using M
and if you try it yourself you will get
to know better so just try using M and
you can also use Ram or pixel in this
case but for now we'll use M so this
might be a little bit new for you guys
but try it and you will understand it
much better
now save the CSS file
move back to the browser and you can see
here that we have a navigation bar ready
right it's looking fine although the
icons are not visible the book icon and
the cart icon is not visible so let's go
back and see what's wrong in this
CSS file what we'll do is
we'll move to HTML file and we'll see if
something is wrong here or not so
nothing is wrong in this case the error
is because we are not connected to
Internet so if this error continues just
try to connect your laptop or your PC to
the internet and the icons thing will
work fine so you can see here we have
icons over here we have the book icon we
have the cart icon and what we have to
do is we have to increase the size of
this logo and text a little bit right so
here you can see the Comfort learning is
a little bit small when compared to this
particular website so what we'll do is
we'll move to a CSS file and we'll write
here instead of 1.5 Ram we'll write here
2m fine save it
and here you can see it's looking fine
now
actually it's equal
the difference is because of this scroll
bar we don't have this scroll bar in our
website until now so this is why it
looks a little bit different to you guys
it's working totally fine other than
that
so let's move on to the next part and
the next part of our website is the
background image with the card present
on it right so let's write the code for
this section as well what we'll do is
we'll move to a HTML file
and
right here we'll write
section
class is equals to section one
so we are using the section tag to
define a particular section in the web
page now we'll write here div
class is equals to Banner
and here we'll write inside H1 tag
find your
favorite
courses
or course here
all right then inside this what we'll do
is we'll write here
a
href is equals
products so the products file will be
using Json for this so leave it for now
we'll write here shop now so shop now is
actually not a button what we'll do is
we'll use a link and we'll Define it
later so let's
save it
and move to the browser
open this website and you can see here
it says find your favorite course here
and it says shop now it's not inside the
banner because we need to style this
particular section to make it look like
a website so let's do the styling part
as well
and then we'll talk about it
so we'll move to the CSS file now
and here what we'll do
will write here Dot
section one
height
we'll use the calc function and we'll
write here
100
which minus
10 VH so what we are doing is we are
reducing the
navigation Bar's height we are reducing
10 viewport height from 100 viewport
height it means that from the whole
screen area it will reduce 10 VH and
give it to that particular image fine so
next up we'll write here
width as hundred percent we wanted to
cover the whole home page so that's why
we are using width as hundred percent
background
so we'll add the background image we'll
write a URL
and inside this will give the path of
our image
will write his images
back one dot PNG
and we'll write here
Center
cover fine
let's do some more things we'll write
here top
0
left is zero
Z index
as minus 1. fine
save it now move to the browser and see
if it's working so here we are we have
our image over here but this Banner is
not here till now we'll style it so you
can see the images over here and one
more thing guys we have two three images
over here inside a images folder I'll
let you see all of them so here are the
images
and this is the third one
okay so this is the third one so I was
not sure which one to use but if you
guys liked any of these images do let us
know in the comments below and we'll use
that particular image for now
we'll use my personal favorite image
we'll use backman.png save it now
and this is the image we are going to
use in this particular video so let me
know if you have any other preference or
if you know any other image we'll use
that as well then we'll write here
section
1
and we'll style the banner as well for
that we'll write here Banner
height
is going to be 170 pixels
width
is going to be
600 pixels
background
is going to be a little bit Krish
so we'll write here rgba
255 comma two double five comma two
double five comma
0.7 so this is the particular rgba value
and next up we'll write here
position as relative top is
50 percent
left as 50 percent of the image
we want the banner to be present at the
center of the image right so next up
we'll write here
transform
Translate
and inside it will write
minus 50 percent
to minus 50 percent
next up we'll write here display is
Flex
justify content as
space around
and
Flex direction is
column
text align
is
Center
and then we have align items is
Center
font family is going to be
sensitive again
and we'll Define the Z index as well so
this index is going to be
8 in this case fine
next up we'll inside the H1 tag inside
the banner
so we'll write here Banner
H1 and inside this
will Define the font size is
2m
now
we need to define the
link for shop now so for that we'll
write here display is
Flex
justify content is
Center
padding is going to be
1M
page two point
five m
next up we'll write here
font size is
0.8 m
so this is the font size for the shop
now button which looks like a button but
it is actually a link
so
what we'll do is we'll Define the color
of this button is white
and here the background color is going
to be
h
F 9 0 d51
let's use this color
and we'll write here transition all at
zero point
three second
now save it once move to the browser
and you can see it looks fine though the
only thing that is different here in
this website is the color of this link
right or is the color of the shop now
button so we can change the color here
the color is
sky blue so
let's try to do it so here you can see
the color seems a little bit different
now I don't know the actual value of
this color that's why I'm not sure about
it so what we'll do is
we'll make it a little
more bright
with
save it now
and you can see it looks same now so
this was the color we found that
now we have to change the color of this
button on hovering over it so what we'll
do is we'll write here
note Banner a
over
so
the background we are going to change
we'll write here hash D4
76 e
1.
okay one e
the color codes are pretty hard to
remember so we are not using this
particular color so we'll change
it to a little bit blue
save it now move to the browser and you
can see it looks nice right
and the actual website it's a little bit
dull but in our website it looks nice
right it's a little bit dark than the
original color
so that's fine you can change the color
according to you
so you have seen that this part is also
done it looks nice right till now
the task we did was quite easy the next
thing we have to do is to add products
to our website which are the courses
We'll add those images to a website
using Json only so let's do the HTML
part first let's finish up the HTML part
and then we'll move on to the Json part
so we'll
move to the HTML file again and inside
this
now what we'll do is we'll Define the
section for
products so we'll write here
section
class is equals to
section 2
and ID is equals to
products fine we'll use both the class
and the ID attribute for this particular
section
we'll write here div
class is equals
to title
and here what we'll do is we'll write
here H1
and inside this we'll write courses we
offer
here we'll again add another div
and inside this will write class is
product
close this div tag
save it and there will be no difference
on the web page you can see here we have
some text present at the bottom which
says courses we offer nothing else let's
add those images now what we'll do is
we'll move to the Json file and we'll
add those images with some properties
and pictures so let's move on to the
Json file
so here is a Json file products dot Json
what we'll do is we'll create an object
here so we'll write here
items
and then we'll use square brackets now
one thing to notice while working on any
Json file is that Json doesn't let us
use single inverted commas or we have to
use double inverted commas for Json file
so if we write here items like this
it won't work see it says this is an
error so in Json file we have to use
double inverted comma or double quotes
not single quotes So now inside the
items what we'll do is we'll create the
object for first image so we'll write
here says
and then we'll write a ID
so ID will be
1.
we have to use commas to separate the
properties so now we'll write here
fields
colon and inside this we have to use
title so the title for first course will
be
Python programming
Master course fine
now next thing we'll do is we'll write
here
the price
the price will be let's say one to three
point nine nine dollars
and then we'll write here
image
so inside this we'll Define
several properties for the particular
image we will write
fields
and we'll use colon then again we'll use
curly braces we'll write here
file
colon then again we'll use curly braces
we'll write here
URL
so you can see it just says there's an
error so we have to remove this curly
braces from here and we have to put it
here now inside URL what we'll do is
will give
the name of a file so a file is stored
in images folder and the file name is
and the picture name is
python.png fine
so it is working fine now what we have
to do is
we have to put a comma here to again
insert one more
image property so we'll copy it from
here
we'll paste it
for 8 times
then what we are going to do here now is
we are going to change the ID
the title of the course
so the second course is C plus plus
Master course
and the price for this is let's say
110.99 we have to change the path as
well this image is stored as
C plus plus dot PNG
for the third one we'll write here ID as
3
the title is going to be web development
for beginners
the price is let's say
99 because this is a course for
beginners and the file name is
instead of python we'll write here
web1.png
will do the same for all the elements
so next up we'll use ids4
and title is
Java programming
Master course fine
the price for this course is going to be
149.99 and the file name is
java.png
fine next up we'll write here ID is five
the title is going to be digital
marketing
full course
the price is going to be
109.99 dollars
and the name of image is
digital.png
then we have IDs 6 for another course
this course is going to be
advanced
web development and the price is going
to be comparatively High because this is
an advanced course so instead of python
we'll write here
web 2 because this is the name of our
image then we have ID S7
and the file name is going to be data
structures and algorithms
full course
prices you can decide by yourself so
instead of 123 we'll use 99.99 here and
inside
this will write data.png this is a file
name
then we have the ID as 8 for the last
course
the course name is
data science full course
the price is going to be 149.
and image name is
data 2.
fine
so here you can see it says there is an
error removed this comma because we
don't have any other image remaining so
we are done with the Json file all of
this may sound a little bit tricky to
you guys but it is what it is and we
have to keep certain things in mind for
that we can't see these products in the
browser until we are done with the
JavaScript part as well so let's do the
rest of the HTML part first and then
we'll see how this works in JavaScript
save it once go to the browser
and here you can see we are not able to
see those products till now
so what we are going to do next is we
are going to move to a HTML file
and inside this we are going to do the
remaining of a HTML part so what we'll
do is we'll write here div
class is equal to cart
sidebar
now we are creating the structure for
our card sidebar it means that when we
use the hamburger menu or when we
decrease the size of a web page or web
browser the card will open at the site
so we are doing the coding for that
we'll write inside this div
class is equals to cart
and inside here we'll write
fan
class is equals to
close cut
now inside this we'll add an icon we'll
write a i
class is equals for four times
and we are done with it now next up what
we are going to do is we are going to
write the code inside of our cart we are
going to write here H2 it will say
your card
and inside this we'll write div
class is equals
to
card content next up we'll write here
div
class is equals
to total
sum
and we are going to use dollars right so
we'll write here
H1
we'll write here
your total and
we'll use the dollar sign here
after this we'll write span
class is equals
to total
amount let's say we are going to change
the class name it will be total amount
we'll close this here and inside this
we'll write 0 because at this start
there will be no element or no product
present in the cart so the total price
will be 0 at the initial point so that's
why we have written 0 here
now we are going to write here div
class is equals
clear card
and inside this we are going to create a
button
so the button class will be
BTN
clear card BTN so this is going to be a
class and here what we'll do is we'll
write here
clear card fine
we are going to do the same for proceed
button as well so we'll write here div
class is equals to
clear card we are going to use the same
class for both the buttons because I'll
let you know what why we are doing this
at the end of this project now we'll
write here
button
class is equals
to button
clear card
button
fine we'll write here
proceed
we are done with the card function now
what we are going to do is we are going
to write some code for the menu bar side
menu bar so we'll write here
div
class is equals to let's say
menu sidebar inside this we'll write div
class is equals to close menu
and we'll write here I
class is equals
too far for times
and we'll close this eye tag over here
next up we'll write here after this
class we'll write div
class is equals to menu let's say this
name is menu menu bar
and inside this will write here
an ordered list class will be
menu list
foreign
[Music]
class is equals to
menu list items and we'll write here a
href
is equals to Hash we'll write your home
and we are good to go fine we'll do the
same for categories pricings and about
us so
we'll copy this
statement
we'll paste it for four times here we'll
write instead of Home categories
pricings and about us fine so we are
done with the whole HTML part now and we
are left with CSS and JavaScript only
let's do that as well let's move on to
the CSS part first and do the rest of
the styling except for the products
we'll do it for products at the last so
let's move on to the CSS file first and
what we'll do is
so that it will not create any confusion
we'll write here menu bar because we
have to write the code here between this
Banner style property and this menu bar
for the products section so that's why I
will start writing the code from here
and later we'll add a code here in
between
so we'll write here
dot menu
sidebar display will be none
and then we'll write here Dot
card
sidebar
background is going to be
hash
e-c-e-c-e-c so a little bit grayish
white we can say
we'll write here position as
fixed
right as 0
and top is 0
so these are the properties we are
defining in a CSS part then we'll write
your width as 450 pixels and
height is
100 viewport height fine
we'll Define the Z index as well we'll
write here Z index
is 10
transition
is all at 0.3 seconds and the transition
will be linear fine
next up we'll write here
transform
and inside transform we'll write here
translate X fine so inside here we'll
write
100 percent
it will go along with the x-axis that's
why we have written it over here we'll
write here overflow
crawl
we are done with it next up we'll write
here dot cart
sidebar and will right here dot cart as
well so we will Define padding here
we'll write here padding as 0 in both
the cases
next up we have
dot cart and
close card right so we'll write here for
both of them we'll write here Dot card
space close card the font size is going
to be 1.3 m
padding is going to be 1M
foreign
we'll write here Dot
for times
inside this we'll write
margin top
as 0.5 m
and we'll write here cart H2
this text
align will be center for the heading of
a cart which is your card
so we'll write a width is
100 percent
margin bottom is going to be 1 m
and
what else we have to do we have to
include the font size as well so we'll
write a font
size is 1.1 M slightly bigger than the
default font size
then we'll write here
font family let's use only one
fine
let's use vardana only
so we'll write your vardana and next up
we'll write here Dot
card product
space dot product
Dash image
space IMG now we are going to write here
something now we are going to write the
code for all the images present inside
the cart so that's why we are writing
here width
is 130 pixels
of that particular image the width is
going to be 130 pixels and the height is
going to be
90 pixel let's say
fine
we are done with this as well
next up we'll write here
dot cart
content fine
now we'll write here display is flex
direction is
column
and we have
justify content as space around
and align items at the center
we'll write your margin
left is 1M
and
height is
80 pixels fine
we are done with this as well we'll
write here dot plus Dash minus
this is for increasing or decreasing the
product number inner Cuts those arrows
you must have remember which we have
seen in the website let me show you
again
so these are the arrows I'm talking
about let me add a product
now go to cart and these are the arrows
I'm talking about right now
so we are going to style those arrows as
well
so we'll write here
display is flex
and
transform
we are going to rotate them so we are
going to write here rotate
at
90 degree
that will look cool so we'll write here
color is
again
hash
f09d51 so this is the color code for a
particular color we'll write here font
size is 1.5 m
and we'll write here
cursor as pointer
next up we are going to do the styling
for total sum so we'll write here total
sum
text align at the center
and margin is
going to be 1M
0 0 point
5m and
0 again
so it's for top bottom left and right
everyone
so we'll write here next
clear card
text align at the center
and we'll write here clear card
button
now for the clear card button we'll
write here
background
so background color is going to be
again that same one
orange we can say or little bit of
orange as well and don't know the exact
name for that color but it doesn't
matter right we can
do anything we can use any color so the
font color is going to be white
the border is going to be one pixel
solid
and
white in color for the button right if
we go back to our website and you can
see here this is our button
so we are styling this particular button
now
let's go back here
and we'll write here
padding is
0.5 m
and 1.7 fine
cursor will be pointer
and
of course transition is going to be at
0.3 seconds and
linear fine
next up we'll write here
clear card
dot button
on hovering over it what we want is
we'll write here over
and we'll Define the property now so
we'll write here
border
okay
we'll write here border model is going
to be one
pixel thick solid in nature
end of
this color so we'll write here D4
761e
fine
honoring the color will change obviously
so we'll write here this and now what we
are going to do is we are going to write
here background is
transparent
and
color is black
fine
I are done with this as well next up
we'll write here overlay for overlay the
height is going to be
100 viewport height
the position is going to be
fixed
the top is going to be 0 similarly the
left
will also be 0
we'll Define the Z index as well we'll
write as Z index as 9.
and width has
100 percent
the background color
is going to be
hash
F 3 8 5
1f
fine
so this is for overlay we'll write here
opacity
as zero point
three
and
transition
is all
0.3 seconds and
linear fine so what we are doing is we
are writing the code for this if we open
our cart you can see this particular
area or this particular field is a
little bit different from what it was it
is a little bit different in color and
opacity is also different the opacity is
0.3 here we can make it fully opaque as
well so for now we'll use 0.3 only
next up what we are going to do is we
are going to write the property
for none we'll write a none
display is none fine now what we are
going to do is we are going to write the
CSS part for tablets and for Mobile
screen so if you remember that if we
reduce the size of this Chrome browser
the size of our website also reduces and
it becomes like this so to achieve this
we have to write particular CSS code for
tablet and for phone we have to define
the max width and we have to do some
more things in there so what we'll do is
we'll write here
at the rate
media
screen and
Max width is going to be
768 pixels fine
now inside this we'll write dot logo
will change the logo
as well
right here padding left is
zero
and after this we are going to write
here dot cart heading right is 2m
after card will write here dot menu bar
so we are going to change all the
properties here almost all the
properties which we'll require so we'll
write a display as none the menu bar
will disappear we'll write here dot
Burger
and inside this we'll write
margin left the burger sign will come
into existence now will write here 2m
for the margin left for display
will write a block
next up we have to do something for
Section 1 and for product section as
well so we'll write here Dot
section one and we'll write here Dot
Banner H1
so we'll write here font size is 1.5 m
and we'll write here Dot
Banner a we are going to change the size
of our
shop now button so we'll write here
font size is 0.6 m
and padding is 1 M end
2m
fine
we are done with this as well next up
we'll write here
dot section
two
dot title
and we'll write here H1
inside this we'll write font
size is
1.5 m
so we haven't defined the section 2 when
Title styling part yet we'll Define it
later but we'll write the code for that
as well now next up we'll write here
menu sidebar
display is going to be block
position is going to be
fixed
left is going to be zero top is going to
be 0 so we'll write here left is going
to be 0
and top will also be zero
then we have
width is
100 percent
height is
100 V Port height
and
Z index is
11
background is going to be
gray again so we'll write a ecec
then we'll write here
overflow is
hidden
and
transform
is
translate so we'll write here minus
hundred
percent
and
transition is again same we'll write
here 0.3 s and
linear fine
next up we'll write here menu there's
menu bar
and inside here we'll write
display is flex height is 80 percent
justify content at the center
and we are done so next up we'll write
here menu
list we'll change the style of menu list
as well
so we'll write here
height height is going to be
100 percent
then we'll write here display as Flex We
Are rewriting the code again and again
but each time we are doing it for
different class we are doing it for
different element
so keep these things in mind
and we'll write here Flex
Direction
is column
align items at the center
and just Define content
justify content as space around now it's
time to do it for menu sidebar for menu
sidebar
and for close menu both will use the
same styling properties
we will write your position
as absolute
right is going to be
30 pixels
font size is going to be
1.4 m
and after this we'll write
Dot
menu list
items
and we'll write here
color
is Hash
f09d51 the default color we are using
till now
and lastly we'll write here
dot menu Dash list
items space a on
Hoover will write here
color is
h
F 5 7 B 0 9.
fine so here's a mistake we have
placed colon here twice
we'll remove it
and now we are done with the tablet part
so we have to change the style of almost
all the elements we are done with the
tablet part next up we have to write the
same code for mobile part as well
and we'll write here at the rate media
green
so we'll write here and Max width
is going to be
480 pixels
now what we'll do is we'll write here a
strict font size
is going to be 16 pixel here we have
changed the font size for the whole
entire HTML document we have done it
because we have used m in place of Ram
or pixels in this case or in this video
so that's why we have changed the size
here because we want the screen to be
smaller in size right if we go back here
you can see
the font size is 16 by default and if we
do it you can see the font size changes
for each and every element right to
achieve this we have to use m in place
of pixel or Ram we can say now the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to write here Dot
section
1
not
Banner
and we'll write here
width as
280 pixels for both
and we'll write here height
is 100 pixels fine
you can see here the height of this
image is 100 pixel or we can say the
height of this Banner is 100 pixel and
the width is 280 pixels so this is why
we are changing the style of all these
elements because we want all these
elements to fit inside a smaller screen
that's why we have to change the height
or we have to change the width as well
now what we'll do is we'll write here
section
one dot
Banner
we'll write here H1
inside this we'll write font size
as
1.2 M display is going to be we don't
have to use display here I guess let's
leave it
so we are done with this next up we'll
write the code for Burger we'll write a
burger margin left is going to be 1 m
for mobile
for mobile the display is going to be
block
and the width is going to be
30 pixel fine
we'll do the same for cart sidebar
will right here
width
as hundred percent of the screen the
cart will take whole screen and will
write here at the last for product
so for product we'll write here
margin is zero display is flex
justify content at the center
align item set the center
and flex direction is going to be column
so we have covered almost every HTML
element in the CSS file we are done with
the styling for everything except
products we'll style them later let's
move on to the JavaScript part now and
see how we can fetch those products so
we cannot witness every style change
right now but we'll witness them while
covering the JavaScript part so let's
move on to the JavaScript part first and
we'll start with the card section and
the hamburger menu thing
so save it and if you want to witness
the changes we made you can go here and
you can see the cart is not opening
because we need to write the JavaScript
part for that and everything else
Remains the Same if we reduce the size
of our browser you can see we have a
menu over here we can increase the size
and we have
a image adjusting itself accordingly so
we can use it and it's quite responsive
as well
let's move on to the JavaScript part now
we'll open the JavaScript file and
first of all we'll access all HTML
elements with the query selector method
so we have several HTML elements right
here you can see we have several
elements present in our HTML file we are
going to access few of these elements so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here
const
cart is equals to document
dot query selector
we are going to write here
nav space dot cart
then we are going to do the same for a
long
time so what we are going to do is we
are going to copy paste this piece of
code again and again
for several times we are going to change
the name of variables so we'll write
here
card sidebar and instead of this will
write here
Dot cards sidebar
the next one will write here
Dot
close card and here the variable name
will change to
close card
fine next up we'll take another variable
as
burger and here we'll change
the query
from nav Dot card to dot Burger fine
next up we have menu sidebar so we'll
write here menu sidebar and here what
we'll do is we'll write here
Dot
menu
sidebar
fine next up we have
close menu
and here we'll
write
close menu again after close menu we
have cart items total
so we'll write here cart
items
total and
we will use
noise
then we have total amount as well so
we'll write here total amount
and here we'll write card price total
we have to access a lot of elements so
then we'll write here cart
UI and
for this we'll access
card sidebar and cart so we will write
here dot cart
sidebar space card
fine
then we have the total sum so we'll
write here total sum
we'll put a dot over here
and here we'll write
total diff
then we have the clear button so we'll
write here clear
button and here we'll write
clear card button
then finally we have
variable name card content
to access everything present in the cart
so we'll write here Dot card
content
here we'll write
card content
so these are our 12 variables and we
have accessed almost every element
present in our HTML file which we are
going to need further so I hope you guys
understood this we have used the query
selector method to access all the HTML
elements here in the JavaScript part now
next up we'll take two empty arrays
so we'll write here let
cart
is equals to an array
and we'll write here let buttons Dom
and it's again going to be an array
fine now we'll first create some events
to open and close the card for that
we'll write here
cart Dot
add event listener
will add a click event here
and we'll write here function
now inside this we'll write cart Dot
we'll write card sidebar
dot Style
Dot
transform is equals
to
translate zero percent fine so this is
we are changing the style of card
sidebar
next up we'll write here
const body overlay will take a variable
of named const body overlay we'll write
here document
Dot
create element
and we'll write here
div inside this fine
next up what we'll do is
we'll write here
body overlay
Dot
classlist dot add
and we'll write here
only
fine
we'll use the set timeout method so
we'll write here
set timeout
okay we have written here SST so we'll
write a set timeout
then we'll create an anonymous function
and inside here what we'll do is we'll
write
document dot query selector
and inside here we'll write body then
we'll write here append and will append
body overlay here so we'll write here
body overlay
fine and the time will pass here is
going to be 300 milliseconds
we are done with this function We'll add
another event so what we'll do is we'll
write here close
cart dot add event listener
now we are closing the cart so we'll
write here
click then we'll
create a function
and we'll write here
card sidebar Dot
tile Dot
transform and again we'll translate it
to 100 percent
previously we did for zero percent and
now we'll translate it to 100 again so
we'll write here translate and we'll
pass 100 inside the brackets here
next up we'll again use the body overlay
variable so we'll copy this from here
and we'll paste it here we'll of course
change the create element value so
instead of create element we'll write
here
document
dot query selector
and we'll write here
Dot
overlay
fine next up we'll write here document
dot query selector
and we'll write here body
Dot
remove child will remove body overly
from here so we'll write here
body overlay fine
we are good to go save it now
and go to the browser
so here you can see on clicking the cart
a cart is working totally fine now we
are in this particular program so we are
in our website which we are creating
right now this is the original website
this is the final product so leave it
and we are going to work on our website
only so here you can see our cart is
working totally fine now we can open or
close our cart and we have two options
over here one is for clearing the entire
card and the other one is for proceeding
further next up we'll add some more
events for the hamburger menu now how to
open or close that menu and all so for
that we'll move to a Javascript file
again and we'll write here
Burger Dot
add event listener
and we'll add a click event we'll write
here click we'll write here
function
and then we'll write here
menu sidebar Dot
tile Dot transform and what we are going
to do is we are going to translate
again we are going to translate it to
zero percent
now the same thing we have to do for
this as well we'll write here Burger
dot add event listener
inside here Will
right click and then we'll write a
function
which will again do the same task it
will translate to minus hundred percent
we'll write here menu sidebar Dot
tile Dot
transform and we are again going to
translate it to
minus hundred percent now
fine
save it
and go to the browser
now
if we decrease the size of a web page or
if we decrease the size of a browser you
can see
okay let me decrease it first so you can
see the hamburger menu over here and on
clicking it's not working right now so
let's inspect those elements once
and there's no error but
let me check if there's any mistake okay
so we have to write here
close menu
and now I guess it will work fine
we'll save it again and we'll move to
the browser
reduce the size click on this hamburger
menu and you can say it's working
totally fine now
right
so this part is also done now what we
have to do next is we have to create a
class to get those products from the
Json file so keep your eyes open now
guys we'll see how it actually works so
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a class named
product
so this is a class
we'll write here a sink I hope you are
already aware of async and a weight
so we'll write here get product
and this is a function
we'll write here const
response is equals to await and while
awaiting it will fetch
products Dot
Json fine
then we'll create a variable we'll write
here const
data is equals to await
response dot Json
fine
next up we'll write
products is equals to
data dot items
and we'll write
products is equals
to
products
dot map function we are going to use so
we'll write here again item
and then we'll use Arrow function we'll
write the body of this function here
we'll write here
const inside this will pass
title and price of the product
and we'll write here item Dot
Fields fine
similarly we'll do the same for ID as
well inside curly braces we'll write ID
and we'll write here item dot says
then we'll write here
const
image now we are fetching the image so
we'll write here
item Dot
Fields dot image Dot
fields
we are actually giving the path right if
you see here in the Json file you can
see inside items we have says Fields
then inside Fields we have title price
image and then inside image we have
Fields file and URL so we'll access each
of them now we'll write here after
fields dot file
dot URL
and
lastly we'll write here return
title
price
ID and
image fine
finally we'll write here after this
return
products
cool
now what we are doing here is we are
getting the details of all the products
and storing them inside separate objects
so we have all the objects present over
here all those images were actually
stored inside the local storage
and now we can fetch them from that
particular storage now we'll create
another class for the user interface of
the product so if you save it now and go
to the browser
you will see no difference over here
because it's not working as of now if
you go to inspect elements and console
you can see it says
length mismatch
it's because of the live server so
there's no error over here
now we'll create another class for the
user interface of the products we'll add
those products to the cart and we can
delete them from the cart we'll do
everything inside one single class so
let's do it
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here
class let's say the class name is UI
and we'll write here
display products and we'll write here
products
then we'll right here inside this let
result be a variable
and we'll leave it empty over here
next line will use the for each Loop so
we'll write here products
Dot
for each
and inside this we'll
create an arrow function
so we'll write here
const
product div let's say is a variable and
then we'll write here
document Dot
create element
again we are going to create an element
so we'll write here div
and
after this what we are going to do is we
are going to write here product
div Dot
inner HTML
is equals to
now the main part starts so inside these
will write
div
class is equals
product card
and then we'll write
IMG
will add the image so here we'll write
mgsrc is equals to
dollar
product
Dot image we are going to fetch it and
instead of Alt
in place of alt we'll write
alt as
product
the next line will use this pen tag
again we'll write here span class
is equals to
add to cart
and we'll then right here
data ID is equals to
product dot ID
will close this tag we'll close this
spend tag we can say in the next line
we'll use the I tag we'll write a i
class is equals to
foreign
card
Plus
for One X
now what we are doing is we are going to
show the number of items present in our
cart over the cart icon that's why we
are doing all this so here what we'll do
is we'll write
style is equals to margin
Dash right
margin rate is going to be 0.1 m
and
font size is going to be
1M
fine
close this as well close the eye tag as
well
and in the next line
right here
add to cart
so the spend tag is finally we are going
to close it now this is a single tag
I have written it in such a way because
I don't want it to create any sort of
confusion for you guys so the spend tag
starts from here and go still here now
we are remaining with some more part of
it so in the next line what we are going
to do is we are going to write here div
class is equals
product name and here we'll write dollar
product dot title
and we are going to close this div tag
in the next line we are going to write
div again
class is going to be product pricing
and inside here we'll write
product Dot
price
and we are going to close this div tag
here
close
the first div tag as well
and
Omega 2. in the next line what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here
const p is equals to
document Dot
query selector and inside this will
write
Dot
product we are going to access the
element with product test class or we
are going to access the product query
then we'll write here P dot append
equal to
product div what we are doing is any
item we are adding to cart is we are
going to append that item inside the
cart so that's what we are doing till
now now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to write here a
function
get buttons
basically a Constructor we can say we'll
write here const
buttons
will write accounts buttons is equal to
document Dot
query selector
we have to write a query selector all
and then we are going to write here
inside this dot add to
cart fine we have been through all these
query selector methods previously so I
don't think that this is going to create
any sort of problem for you guys
so let's move ahead and we'll write here
array Dot
from
will write here buttons
then we'll write here buttons
Dom is equals to buttons we are going to
pass the value of buttons to buttons
Norm then we'll write buttons Dot
for each
and inside here we'll write
button and we are going to create an
arrow function over here
here what we'll do is we'll write here
let ID is equals to
button
Dot
data set dot ID in the next line we'll
write let
in cart
is equals
cart Dot
find and we are going to pass item
to this function
so we are going to
right inside here
item and again an arrow function we'll
write here item dot ID
triple is equals
to ID
fine
we are going to check the condition here
if we write here if
in cart
then we'll write here
BTN Dot
inner HTML
is equals
to in cut so what we are doing is if we
have added the
product to cart already then the button
will change as we have seen earlier that
on adding the product once to the card
the button will change to incart from
add to cart so this is what we are doing
here
next up we'll write here
button dot disabled
is equals to true we are going to
disable that button once the product is
added to cart fine
next up we'll write here
button dot add event listener
and we are going to create an event
we'll write here click
and
let e here then we'll use the arrow
function
foreign
Target Dot
inner HTML is equals to
in card
then we'll write a e Dot
current Target dot nihtml okay we'll
write a e dot current Target Dot
style Dot
color
is equals to White
e Dot
current Target Dot
style Dot
dot pointer events equals to none
and we are done with it next up we are
going to store the products in the cart
so for that what we are going to do is
we are going to write here let
cart item is equals to so we are going
to use a little bit of Json now
I'll write here
Dot
storage
Dot
get storage products
we'll write a ID
comma
amount
and the amount is going to be one
and we'll write here
card dot push
we are going to push the cart item to
the cart
so we will write here cart item
and then we'll write yes
storage we are going to store it inside
the cart so we'll write here storage dot
safeguard
and we'll pass cart over here
fine now we have to calculate the total
and we have to set the total items as
well so for that we'll write here
this Dot
set card values
we'll write here cart
and to display those cart item we have
to write here this dot add card item and
we have to add that card data so we'll
write here
this Dot
add card items
item
and we'll
pause cart item over here
fine
we are done with the working of cart as
well next up what we are going to do is
we are going to change the total value
of cart we are going to change the value
of carton increasing or decreasing the
card products so first of all we have to
write here
set card values and we have to pass cart
over here we have to write here
let's say we have a variable
time total so this is going to be a
temporary variable we'll write here time
total is equals to 0 and we'll take
another variable
for that we'll write here
item total
so item total is also going to be 0
now we'll map this card so for that
we'll write a card dot map
we'll write your item
use Arrow function so for that we'll
write here
temp total
plus is equals to
item Dot
price
into
item Dot
amount
so this is how we are going to get the
total amount and then we'll write here
item basically we are swapping all of
that so we'll write here item totals
is equal to
item Dot
amount we have to add these two values
so we'll write here item total plus is
equals to item dot amount fine
now we'll write here
parse float
and we are going to change these values
just like percent we have parse float as
well so inside pass float we'll write
time total
Dot
to fixed
and we are going to fixed it until two
decimal units
fine next up we'll write here cart items
total Dot
inner HTML
is equals to
items total
and we'll write here cart
price total
dot inner HTML is equals to
pass float
we'll write here temp
total
note
to fixed and will fix it up to two
decimal units fine
next up we'll write here add
card item
now we'll write here cart item
and inside this we'll write let
cart item
UI
is equals
two document Dot
create element
we'll write here div
we'll write here cart item
UI
Dot
inner HTML
is equals to we are again going to do
the same task
so we are going to use the backtick for
that so here we'll write
div
class
is equals to
card product
and we'll write here div
class is equals to product image we'll
write here IMG SRC
is equal to we are going to fetch the
image again so we'll write here dollar
and inside this will write
cartitem Dot
image
and ALT will be
product in this case as well
next up we are going to close this div
tag
and we are going to start another div
tag here so we'll write here div
class is equals
card
product item
sorry card product content we can say
and then
we'll write here
in the next line
div
class
is equals
to
card product name
will write here inside H3 tag
so inside H3 tag we'll write
dollar
cart item Dot title
and we are going to close this H1 tag
over here H3 tag sorry
H3 tag over here then we'll close this
div tag as well we are again going to
create another div tag this time we are
going to write the class
is
card product
price we are going to fetch the price
now
will right here
again
H3
so our price is in dollars so we'll use
dollars for now we can use rupees here
as well so we can write here
cart item Dot
price the price is going to be in
dollars then we'll
close this tag
and we are also going to close the div
tag here fine
in the next line we are going to create
the product remove card
so we are going to create a div tag for
that and the class is going to be card
product remove data
ID is going to be cart ID so we'll write
here cart
item dot ID
and then we'll write here
href is equals
to hash
and style is going to be
color is going to be
red
and then we'll write here remove
I'm going to close the
anchor tag and then the
div tag fine
so we are done with this till now then
we are going to again close this
particular div tag we used previously
now what we are going to do is we are
going to change the number of products
so we are going to use here class
is equals to
plus minus
and here we'll write
inside the itech
class is equals to
for angle
left
add amount
fine
this is going to be the class and
the data ID is going to be
cart Item ID so we are going to write
here data ID is equals to
dollar
and inside this we'll write
cart Item ID
dot ID
and then we are going to
close this tag and we are going to close
the eye tag here fine
next up we are going to use this pen tag
again we are going to write here
pan
class is equals
to
number of items
and we'll close this tag here we'll
write dollar
foreign
Dot
amount
we are going to close the span tag here
so we'll write here slash span
in the next line we are again going to
use
data ID
and here what we'll do is we'll write
here
dollar and we'll write here
cart item dot ID
we are going to close the eye tag again
and in the next line we are going to
close the div tag
and one more deep tag fine
now we are done with it
let me close this first and
next up we'll append this card content
to the cart item UI so we will write
here
card
content Dot
append and inside this will pass
cart item
UI
fine
so here you can see we are going to
close
close this so this is the closed one
and inside here we'll write
setup app
again a
Constructor we are going to write here
cart
is equals
to storage Dot
get card
we'll write this
Dot
set card values
card here
and then we'll write card dot map
inside this will write item
and inside the body we'll write
this Dot
add cart item
item
fine I hope you guys are getting this
next up we'll write the cart logic here
we'll write a cart logic
and we'll write here
clear button
dot add event listener
we are going to create an event again
we'll write here click
oh
comma a function
inside this we'll write this Dot
clear cut we are going to call this
function over here
now we have
to write the logic for
remove button so we'll do it here
we'll write here
card content dot add event listener
foreign
event
and we'll write here
inside this if
event Dot
Target
Dot
classless
dot contains
chord
product remove
then we'll again create a variable let's
say the variable is let
okay we have made a mistake over here
we have to close this bracket here
and then we have to write here
let ID is equals
to event Dot
Target Dot
dataset dot ID
in the next line will write
this Dot
remove item and will pass ID here fine
in the next line we'll write here let
div is equals
to event
dot Target Dot
parent element
and we are going to use parent element
for quite some time now so we are going
to write here Dot
parent element again
for four times so we'll write here
parent element Dot
parent element so we have written it
four times here
in the next line we'll write here div
Dot
remove
child
and we'll write here event Dot
Target
Dot
will copy it from here
and we'll paste it here fine
now in the next line
we are going to close this bracket
and we are going to start writing here
else if
event Dot
Target
dot classlist dot
contains
add amount
then what we are going to do is we are
going to use the ID variable again we
are going to write here let ID is equal
to
event dot Target
Dot
dataset dot ID
let item is equals to
cart dot find
will pass item here and
we'll use the arrow function so we'll
write here item Dot
ID triple equals to ID
fine then we'll write here
item Dot
amount
plus plus so we are going to increase
the amount
of items then what we are going to do is
we are going to write a storage Dot
Safeguard and we are going to pass cart
here
we'll write here this Dot
set card values
card
we will write a event Dot
Target
Dot
next element sibling dot inner HTML
is equals to item Dot
amount fine
now we are going to
use another elsewhere so we'll write
here else if
event Dot
Target Dot
classlist dot contains
reduce amount
so we are going to change the number of
products in our cart so for that what
we'll do is we'll write here
let ID is equals to
event dot data set
even Dot
Target dot data set
dot ID fine
and item will be
let item is equals to
card dot find
item
item dot ID
triple equals to ID
if we are again going to use an if
statement so we'll write here item Dot
amount
is greater than 1 if the number of items
is greater than 1
then
item Dot
amount
minus minus
and store it
inside the cart so we are going to write
here storage.safecard
and we'll pass cart here
then we'll write here this Dot
set card values
and will again pass cart here
in the next line we'll write here
event Dot
Target
Dot
previous element sibling
dot inner HTML
is equals to item Dot
amount
and finally we'll write here else
and inside the else what we'll do is
we'll write here
this Dot
remove item
and we'll pass the ID we'll write here
let
div is equals
to event dot Target we are basically
targeting the events we are creating
conditions for certain different events
like when the user increases the number
of products and the user decreases the
number of products and if the user
removes the product from the card so we
are writing the code for that so we'll
write a event dot Target Dot
parent element
and we'll write here parent element
again for
four times
fine
we'll write here div Dot
remove child
and inside this we'll write even Dot
Target Dot
parent element for four times again
it will check each parent element
so
here we are done with it next up
we have to create two functions for add
amount and for reduce amount so what we
are going to do is
we are going to
write here
add amount
and we'll write here
const
add button is equals to
document dot query selector
all
inside this will pass DOT
add amount fine
we'll write here add button
Dot
for each
and we'll write here inside this
button dot add event listener
and we'll add an event over here we'll
write a click
comma event
will pass event here
and then we'll write here
like this
let ID
is equals to
event Dot
current Target Dot
data set
dot ID fine we'll write here
cart Dot
map
and we'll pass item over here we'll
write here again Arrow function and
inside this what we are going to do is
we are going to write here item Dot
amount plus plus
just storage Dot
Safeguard we are going to pass cart here
we'll write here this Dot
set card values we are again going to
set the cart values and
will again use
amount UI a new variable and will
write here event Dot
current Target Dot
parent element
Dot children
fine so we are targeting the parent
element along with the children
so we'll write here
amount UI
dot in HTML is equals to item Dot amount
so we have forgot to mention here
if
item dot ID
is equals to ID
then do it fine
now we are going
to do the same thing for reduce amount
as well so we'll write here
reduce amount
and inside this we'll write
const
reduce button is equals to document
Dot
query selector all
and we are going to pass here Dot
reduce amount
fine
we'll write here reduce
button Dot
for each
then we'll pass button over here and
we'll use the arrow function again
finally we'll write here button dot add
event listener
click
event
let ID
is equals to
event dot current
Target
dot data set
dot ID
fine
we'll write here card dot map will map
it to cart
and we'll write here item
then again we'll write here if
temp item dot ID
triple equals to ID
then we'll
right here item amount minus minus so
we'll write here item Dot amount minus
minus and if
item Dot
amount is greater than zero
then what it will do
it will
store it inside the
locals to read so we'll write a storage
dot safeguard
and we'll write here cart
then we'll write this
Dot
set card values
card
const
amount UI
is equals
to event
Dot current Target dot parent element
dot children
before
Mount UI dot inner HTML is equals to
item Dot
amount
fine
again we'll write here else
what will happen we'll write here event
Dot
current Target Dot
parent element so here instead of parent
element we'll write
remove child and will write here
event
dot current Target
Dot
parent element Dot
parent element fine
and the next line we'll write
this Dot
remove item and we'll pass ID here
we are done with this part as well next
up we have to clear the card so for that
we'll write here
clear card
will again do something for that we'll
write here let cart item is equals cart
dot map inside this will write item
implies item dot ID
card item dot we'll again use the for
each Loop here
we will write here this then we'll
provide ID here
and we'll write here
this Dot
remove item will pass the ID over here
then we'll write your const
card product will create a new variable
here we'll write here
document Dot
query selector all and we'll write here
Dot
card product
write your card product
Dot
for each
for each item what we are going to do is
we are going to create
an arrow function here and we are going
to write a if item is true if item is
there
then item dot parent element
Dot
remove child
will remove the item now we have to
remove the item so for that we'll write
here remove
item and will pass ID to that item
will write here
card will update the value of cart escar
dot filter
we'll write here item
and then we'll write here item dot ID
not equals
to ID this
Dot
set card values
and we'll update the card pin
similarly we'll again write here storage
Dot
safe cart
and we'll pass card here
then we'll write here let
button is equals to this
Dot
get single button
will write here ID
and we'll change the button style we'll
write here button dot style Dot
pointer events
is equals to
unset
then we'll write your button Dot inner
HTML
is equals to
backtick
I class will be Far Far Card Plus
we are going to close the I tag here
and we'll write here
add to
cart
fine next up we'll write here
get single button will pass ID over here
and we'll write the code for here we'll
write here let
BTN
then we'll write here
buttonsdome Dot
for each
for each button
what it will do is
we'll check if
button Dot
dataset dot ID
is equals to ID
then
BTN equals to
button
fine
here we will return
button
now save it
save this program go to browser
and this is our website go to browser
and you can see nothing is visible till
now we have to write a little more code
to make everything visible here now we
have to store the data in local storage
so that on refreshing the web page we
don't lose the data so what we'll do is
we'll go back to a Javascript file and
we'll write here
class
storage
equals to
static save products will pass products
here
then we'll open curly braces and we'll
write here local storage
Dot
set item
and inside this will write
products Dot
comma
Json Dot
stringify
products
when we are parsing the product from our
Json file now next up we'll write here
static
get storage products
will pass the ID here
and we'll write here let
important
is equals to
Json
dot parts
local storage Dot
get item
and will pass
products here
and in the next line we'll write
return
products Dot
find
we'll write a item
item dot ID is equals to ID
fine
next up we'll again write a static
safe cart
now we are saving the products or in our
cart so we'll write here
local storage dot set item
inside here will pass
cart and here we'll write
Json
Dot
stringify and will pass
cart over here
stop will write here static
get card we are getting the items from
the cart we'll write here return
local storage Dot
get item
cart
you will write question mark will pass
the Json file here we'll write here Json
Dot
parse
local storage Dot
get item
from the
cart fine
here we have two
put a square bracket a pair of square
brackets
and lastly we have to write a few lines
of code so we'll write here document dot
add event listener
and we'll write here
Dom
content
loaded so we are adding
one more event to our JavaScript file
which is the Dom content loaded so we
have to write here Dom content loaded
and here we have to write
inside the function
const
products
is equals
to new product
and we'll write here
const UI is equals to
new UI
now we have to show card from local
storage so we'll write here UI Dot
setup app
and we'll write here
products Dot
get product
dot then
and inside this we'll write
products
equal
employees
UI Dot display
products will write here
products
storage Dot
save products and will pass
products here as well
fine we'll write here dot then
we are using promises so
here we'll write
UI Dot
get buttons
and UI Dot
card logic fine
now the JavaScript part is done we have
used Json here to make a web page more
responsive towards several aspects apart
from that we have used Json for adding
products to our website as well now we
are left with one more task only
let's do it and then we'll see the final
outcome of this extended code
so we'll move to the CSS file and we'll
start starting the products part let's
try if it's working or not let's save
this piece of code and go to browser
click on shop now
and it's not working we can see
okay
it says it's failed to load the resource
refresh it and you can see now it's
working totally fine we have all our
product images over here we have all of
our products we can add them to cart and
we can use the cart as well so the last
thing we have to do is to use products
now
now we have to style those products so
for that we'll move to our CSS file so
here's a CSS file
and inside this we have to write here
so we have put a comment over there
when we were not here so we have to
style the products over here so for that
we'll write here
dot section 2 Dot
title
and
text align at the center
then we'll write here section 2
Dot
title
H1
the font size is going to be
1.8 m
the margin is going to be
1.3 M then we have to write the code for
products here so we'll write your dot
product
and inside this we'll write
margin is
0.5 m
we have to write here margin
we'll write a 0.5 M and Auto
Max width
is going to be 1300 pixels
display is going to be grid
column
is going to be so his is going to be
grid column Gap and it is going to be
2m
then we'll write here
grid row Gap
and grid row Gap is going to be 2m as
well
then we'll write here
grid
template
columns and we'll write here repeat we
are going to create a grid for our
products right so we'll write a Auto
fit
comma min max
we'll write here 350 pixels
and
one draw
fine next up we'll write here Dot
product
card and now we are going to write here
text align as Center
position as relative
Max width
of the grid is going to be 350 pixels
and the Overflow is going to be
hidden
next up we'll write here
product card image
we'll write here height
is
300 pixels
width
as 300 pixels
and
transition is
0.3 seconds linear
fine
so they will do the same for product
name and product pricing so we'll write
here
product
name
comma
product
pricing
margin for them is going to be 0.3 m
will write here Dot
product
pricing and the color of the product
pricing is going to be
the one we have been using till now so
we'll write here F 0
9d51
then we have
to write the code for add to cart button
so we'll write here add to cart
will write here align items to the
center
justify the content to the center
and color is going to be white
padding is going to be 0.2 M and
one name
fine height is going to be
30 pixels
background
is going to be
the same
F9
d51
position is going to be
absolute
right is going to be 0 transform it's
going to be
Translate
along the x-axis too
100 percent
bottom is
going to be 80
pixels
we have to put a comma here
bottom is going to be 80 pixels
transition is going to be 0.3 seconds
again and linear
foreign
then we have to write few more lines so
we'll write a product card
we'll write your hover
and we'll add add to cart here
so we'll write here transform
translate X
zero percent
we'll write here
product card
on hovering over the image so we'll
write here Hoover
IMG
opacity will change to zero point
seven
let's try it and finally we'll write
here dot add to cart
foreign
and here we'll write
color as
black fine we are done with it we have
styled the products as well we are now
done with the website
save it
move on to the browser and let's face
the truth now
so you can see it's not working as of
now refresh the web page and the
products looks really big now
what we have to do is we have to move
over here and we have two
see what's wrong over here
this was a mistake and it's done let me
see what's wrong
something is not right here everything
seems fine but we have to search for the
error
so if we see here Max width is fine the
max width for product is fine
let's try to do this thing we'll write
here this save it now and I know that
this is the error we did so such small
errors sometime causes a way more
go to the browser and you can see a
website is fine now try adding the
products to the cart
you can see the products are in the cart
we can increase the number of products
the total is increasing with that
and it's working totally fine click on
the clear card button and it's not
working
click on the proceed button and it
clears the card
a simple solution for this go to the
HTML file
write clear card over here and
proceed over here save it
move to the browser
try adding products to the cart go to
the cart
increase the numbers everything is fine
proceed it's not working clear card and
the cart is clear
now that we have done so many things on
the website here is a task for you guys
we have left the proceed button inside
the card with no functionality we did it
with purpose I want you guys to do
something creative with it you can take
the user further to the login or sign up
page and you can use regular Expressions
to validate the form upon successful
validation you can further take the user
to the payment page I want you guys to
do that part and let us know in the
