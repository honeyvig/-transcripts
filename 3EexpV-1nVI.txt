1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,120
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,440
tutorial my name is Henry bshi and this

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,480
time we're going to be going over yet

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,240
again another revision for my well now

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,559
series of xcode to IPA uh this time

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,639
we're going to be going over uh not

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,320
really part three but more like part 2.1

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,600
since it's just a little extension uh to

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,880
what we've had before uh now if you

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,920
remember this is this is just literally

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,279
history uh but back in the days of xode

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,199
2 IPA version one uh it was working fine

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,800
it wasn't very practical uh it worked

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,320
though uh and then the problem was that

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,399
Wade sellers uh commented on my video uh

16
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,600
and he had a code signing issue uh so

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,520
then that encouraged me to just make a

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,559
second version which fixed 90% of code

19
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,680
signing issues and it also was much

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,879
faster and much more practical to use uh

21
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,520
in a real development

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,199
environment uh and so now I'm going to

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,480
be expanding on that and and giving you

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,239
a little extra feature uh that is still

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,239
under development uh Apple doesn't

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,360
completely allow it so it won't be the

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,960
most functional feature uh but it it

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,720
it's a workaround and that is

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,320
semi-automatic updates now what is a

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,479
semi-auto a semi-automatic update uh

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,320
basically a semi-automatic update uh is

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,000
something it's a feature in which let's

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,280
say you just start up your app it if if

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,720
uh the feature finds a new version on

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,520
your server of that app it will notify

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,840
you and say okay here's another uh

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,280
version of this app uh I'd like you to

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,960
install it and then you can either click

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,600
on no or yes uh if you click on no it'll

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,000
just remind you the next time you open

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
the app and if you click on yes uh it

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,119
will actually uh it will show a little

43
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:52,560
menu uh where you can again click yes or

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,719
no if you click no it'll again skip if

45
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,759
you click yes it'll exit the app by

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,479
itself uh and then it'll it'll ask you

47
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,039
to install manually and that's what the

48
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,520
disadvantage is but before I explain

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,079
this let's just I'm just going to bring

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,840
your attention over here uh and as you

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,520
can see we have one advantage and one

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,640
disadvantage to this using this method

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
which is basically the only method for

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,879
this that we have currently U maybe with

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,120
iOS 10 or something they'll give us some

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,800
new ways to do this but for now the only

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,720
thing that we can do uh is the advantage

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
is that it will notify you when a new

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,560
version is released for the software but

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,720
the disadvantage is that you have to

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,920
manually install this onto your device

62
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,160
uh the reason we have this disadvantage

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,760
is due to the fact uh that

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,840
um in order to install the app we need

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,280
to delete the old app and we can't

66
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,400
delete our own app and we can't delete

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
any other apps on the iOS system so then

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
the problem is that if we can't delete

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,560
we can't install if we can't install

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,800
then we can't do it fully automatically

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,519
and that just basically tells us why we

72
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,000
can't do it uh so as you can see I just

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,400
WR down Wroten down uh that this is xco

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,280
to IPA 2.1 not three uh and that we have

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,239
semi-automatic updates finally if you

76
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,400
still didn't get it uh so the bottom

77
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,040
line is that I've introduced sort of

78
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,400
semi-auto updates uh another

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
disadvantage uh to this method uh could

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,000
be the fact uh

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,360
that you are required uh to uh use um

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
more code in your apps uh and sorry

83
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,519
about that but you are required to use

84
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,560
some code in your

85
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,879
app use

86
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,920
temporary

87
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,920
code

88
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,519
and

89
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,079
view

90
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,079
in

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,360
storyboard so you unless uh it's just a

92
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,640
little disadvantage that you have to use

93
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
some temporary code in your view

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,760
controller class or whatever main class

95
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,040
you're using and also an extra view in

96
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,480
your storyboard uh but I mean uh you can

97
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,120
always remove this before you actually

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,199
distribute this and this is more for

99
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,519
those like little groups of developers

100
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,280
that are just developing a software and

101
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,639
don't want to keep manually checking if

102
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,600
there's an update but they can just get

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,759
ma uh just get notified of it uh and so

104
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,759
essentially what I've done is I took

105
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,639
just a little Remnant or a little block

106
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,880
of Swift databases mixed it with excot

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,000
IPA and we got a result uh now I just

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,960
took a little Remnant I didn't really

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,479
use databases I just used PHP it seemed

110
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,759
easier uh so let me just explain how it

111
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,800
works basically we have a swift

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,880
end over here

113
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,759
sorry we have a swift end

114
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,199
over

115
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,759
here and we also have a phpn on our

116
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
server this is where the latest version

117
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,520
will be

118
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,240
kept and this is where the local version

119
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,360
will be

120
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,919
kept okay now let's just say the local

121
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,270
version for Swift is

122
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,600
[Music]

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,800
0.0.1 and let's just say the PHP version

124
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,000
is

125
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,080
0.0.1 and I put one for a reason I'm

126
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
going to tell you why in just a second

127
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
now it's going to match the local and

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,319
the latest version numbers and now these

129
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,560
are the same so it's going to say hm

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,600
there's no update so I should not notify

131
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,120
the user so it'll just do nothing it'll

132
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,400
run the app like normal however let's

133
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,919
just say uh one of the lead developers

134
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,160
releases a new version of the software

135
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,319
and says this is version

136
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,600
0.0.2 uh or 0.1.2 or something like that

137
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
uh then Swift will say that hm okay so

138
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,280
these are different now so what I should

139
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
do is tell the user that there's an

140
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
upgrade and when there's an upgrade it

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
just uh pops up a little menu and says

142
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,960
would you like to install uh stuff like

143
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,520
that if that's a little drawing of the

144
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
view you can imagine it'll ask you then

145
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,720
if you were to click on yes it would

146
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,160
actually update from PHP if you were to

147
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,400
click on no then it just ignores it so

148
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,199
yeah that was really it uh and now I

149
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,199
will see you at the Mac part uh where we

150
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,800
will actually go into the code and just

151
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,319
before we actually go to the Mac part uh

152
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm just going to tell you that that I

153
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,759
will be repeating a little section of XO

154
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,000
tyia part two so you feel really the

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
continuity of this and how you actually

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,960
uh embed this in your apps uh but if you

157
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,080
do want to skip that then there might

158
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,960
just be a little um uh annotation on

159
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,479
screen allowing you to do so uh when I

160
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,759
actually start the Mac part uh or you

161
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
can just look in the description for the

162
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,759
timing when I start the Mac when I start

163
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,879
the real um update checking part so yeah

164
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,639
I'll see you at the Mac

165
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,000
part so welcome to the Mac part of the

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,319
video and now we're going to be

167
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,960
explaining exactly how to do this stuff

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,199
uh so let's get started as you can see

169
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,639
uh I have already installed Dropbox and

170
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,080
shenen uh and you can find out how to do

171
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,800
that from my earlier tutorial Swift dat

172
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,759
races part 2 which there will be a link

173
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,120
to in the description down below again I

174
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,280
will will be repeating some parts of X

175
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,720
typa part two in this uh so if you wish

176
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,160
you can just skip it by clicking on The

177
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
annotation that's on screen and it

178
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,280
should disappear just around

179
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,120
now okay so now let's actually get

180
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,280
started and I'm just going to go to my

181
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,440
Dropbox I'm going to go to my apps and

182
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,520
as you can see I've also installed my.

183
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,840
drop pages so you also need to do that

184
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,080
and again that will be taught in xco IPA

185
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
part two uh which there will be a link

186
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
to down in the description uh then you

187
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,000
go to your website you go to public uh

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,960
and I'm just going to create a new

189
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,759
folder for this app and I'm going to

190
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,720
call this Au for auto update uh and

191
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,440
let's just go into it uh as you can see

192
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,879
uh it's blank but I have uh first of all

193
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,840
the app that can automatically update

194
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,800
itself over here I'm just going to take

195
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,039
this app and copy it into my

196
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,960
Dropbox okay it's done uh then I'm going

197
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
to take all these files that will help

198
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,599
us install to our device and also copy

199
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:27,800
them onto my

200
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,240
Dropbox and so that'll do that and so

201
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,039
now that once we're done that all we

202
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
need to do is let's just go into our

203
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
xcode

204
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,839
project and let's just wait for it to

205
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,680
load up what I'm just going to do is I'm

206
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,959
going to go to main.

207
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,800
storyboard and I'm going to go to my

208
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,240
view uh which I'm just going to go full

209
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,959
screen in uh hide all this extra stuff

210
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,279
and then I'm going to add a label to

211
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,600
this

212
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
app which will just basically tell us

213
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,079
the current

214
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,880
version

215
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,160
is okay then I'm just going to move it

216
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,440
like this and like

217
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640
this and like that uh then I'm going to

218
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,800
go back into my uh uh view controller

219
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,760
and I'm going to create an IB outlet for

220
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,839
it right as it loads sorry sometimes it

221
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,920
does this but I mean you can't really do

222
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,519
much about

223
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
it sorry okay there so now I'm going to

224
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,320
create an IB outlet for

225
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,880
this uh IB Outlet VAR and let's just

226
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,880
call it uh label

227
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
ver and let's just give this the type of

228
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,200
UI label and down here in our viewed

229
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,000
load uh or actually viewed appear I

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
guess why not I am going to say label

231
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,120
ver. text is equal to current version

232
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,680
is and then the current version once

233
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,959
that's done uh I'm just going to save

234
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,120
this build it do not run

235
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,079
build uh and then we should be

236
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,000
safe to be able

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
to uh okay so now we should be safe to

238
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,680
be able to quit xcode uh and as you can

239
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,240
see this will just sync back onto

240
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,279
Dropbox and now I'm going to go back and

241
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,640
then I'm also going to open up terminal

242
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,720
once I have terminal open I'm going to

243
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,800
drag in just a sec going to type in CD

244
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,240
space then drag in the Au folder that we

245
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,399
have on our

246
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,399
Dropbox uh over here sorry that's why I

247
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,720
like this view

248
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,000
better I'm just going to drag back in

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
here and then I'm going to move the

250
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,079
extra space and then I'm going to click

251
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,279
on enter uh and now that we are in this

252
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,560
directory all we need to do is type in

253
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,720
IPA build okay once that's done uh we

254
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,160
are going to be able to create an IPA so

255
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,760
I'm just going to click

256
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,120
enter and as you can see it will

257
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,680
successfully or at least it should

258
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,360
successfully uh create an IPA file for

259
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,519
us uh so now we can just wait uh wait it

260
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,760
out uh sometimes it does take a little

261
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,480
bit time if your app is this big uh uh

262
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,600
so that'll just do

263
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
that and it'll give us some errors but

264
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,279
we can ignore them completely because

265
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,440
those are just temporary ghost

266
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,160
errors as you can see it is generating

267
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,200
our IPA and it has successfully built it

268
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,560
uh now once that's done we just want to

269
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,279
really wait for uh X I mean Dropbox to

270
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,959
upload this onto our server or actually

271
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,959
just uploaded onto Dropbox and sometimes

272
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,959
that'll

273
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,440
happen finder

274
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,000
crashes yeah apparently finder does

275
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,959
crash na cppy 10 so that's one glitch

276
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,200
that I just found anyway so once that's

277
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
done we have it all synced up and ready

278
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,680
to go now we can go what we can do is go

279
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,600
to the actual um uh uh online version of

280
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,040
Dropbox uh so I'm just going to go to

281
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,279
dropbox.com and I'm going to go into my

282
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,440
apps folder once I'm in my apps folder

283
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,120
to my drop pages then my tajim Manu

284
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,760
website then public and then my Au

285
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,839
folder now I'm going to click on share

286
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,800
beside the IPA file and I'm going to

287
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,079
copy this link then I'm going to open up

288
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,199
the uh pist file over here uh with

289
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,000
xcode and then once it opens up I'm just

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,959
going to change the link uh to a direct

291
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,639
link uh you know how in XO tyia part 2 I

292
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,639
tell you to remove DL uh and replace

293
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,360
www.d www with dl. dropbox.com I think

294
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,279
this means direct link probably uh so

295
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,079
then we also replace Dropbox with

296
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,480
Dropbox user content uh direct link.

297
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,320
Dropbox user content.com SL whatever

298
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,680
whatever ever slaut update autoa update.

299
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,519
IA perfect uh now I can just save and

300
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,279
quit and once this uh syncs back onto

301
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,440
our server we can go on and we can

302
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
refresh now what I'm going to do is I'm

303
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,839
going to click the share button for this

304
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,360
pist

305
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,600
file now I'm going to copy this link I'm

306
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,959
going to go to install a HTML and I'm

307
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,680
going to open this up with Sublime Text

308
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,279
to so it's just going to fetch sometimes

309
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,000
it takes some time maybe if we redo it

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,720
okay perfect now I'm going to go into

311
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,199
Sublime Text 2

312
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,079
and as you can see uh we have the link

313
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,240
here and we don't want this link we

314
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,880
actually want this link okay now I'm

315
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,920
going to remove the DL part and I'm also

316
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,240
going to replace www with

317
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,720
DL and Dropbox with Dropbox user

318
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,639
content perfect I'm going to save and

319
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,399
quit once this thing backs onto our back

320
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,480
onto our servers we are ready to give it

321
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,920
a test run now just going to get my iOS

322
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,959
device and plug it into my Mac here uh

323
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,880
so theoretically uh this should be able

324
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,360
to mirror my iPhone onto my computer uh

325
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,920
and yeah I'm just going to plug it in

326
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,320
just give me a second really quickly uh

327
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,519
uh so just one

328
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,519
second

329
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,399
um sorry this is taking a little bit of

330
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,240
time but I mean

331
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,160
yeah I'm just going to freeze that and

332
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,120
now I'm just just going to get my iPhone

333
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,560
and my lightning connector uh which

334
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
apparently uh yeah I'm just going to be

335
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,600
back in 1 second with my lightning

336
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,880
connector and I'll see you

337
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,600
then so yeah I am back with another uh

338
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,240
part of this and sorry I had to cut

339
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,839
there it's just that I didn't have my

340
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,839
lightning connector at the time anyway

341
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,839
now I am successfully streaming uh to my

342
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,800
projector and you should be able to see

343
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,360
it right as I click this button perfect

344
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,720
okay okay so now I can uh basically go

345
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,800
to the drop Pages where this is located

346
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,360
and we should be able to use it so if I

347
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
go to tajim

348
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,759
manny. drop

349
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,720
pages.com

350
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,160
and if I go slash no not emojis I don't

351
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,319
want emojis right now I want

352
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,279
slash uh

353
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,600
Au slash

354
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,600
install.

355
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,279
HTML perfect now if we go enter it

356
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,040
should give us this install link and I'm

357
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
just going to zoom in so you can see it

358
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,880
so I'm just going to click on

359
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,600
install and it should ask us if we would

360
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,199
like to install auto app update I'm

361
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,440
going to click on

362
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,959
install uh and this will or at least it

363
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,360
should install uh our automatic updating

364
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,639
software to our device ice so now we can

365
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,560
just wait for a while and just in case

366
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,120
you can't see that I'm going to point it

367
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,440
out to you right now uh using this

368
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,319
pointer apparently uh so as you can see

369
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:42,000
uh if I bring it down a

370
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
bit right there that's where the app is

371
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
in case you couldn't see it sorry it's a

372
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,759
bit down I just have a lot of apps

373
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,600
anyway so it's now

374
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,680
installing pretty useful and now it has

375
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,240
successfully installed wirelessly you

376
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
already knew this part uh but when we

377
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,519
turn this on apparently it doesn't uh

378
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,319
really like this uh I think I know why

379
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,520
because if we go into our

380
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,280
xcode uh we forgot to hook up the IB

381
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,160
Outlet to the actual label itself so

382
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,679
it's saying that okay there's a nil

383
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,319
value and there's nothing to set the

384
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,000
text of so then it just complains and we

385
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,160
don't get a chance to test out our app

386
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,720
anyway I'm just going to fix that really

387
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,760
quickly in front of you so I'm just

388
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
going to connect from view controller to

389
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,559
the current thing label version

390
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,480
uh and then just build not onto the

391
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,960
device as you can see I'm not building

392
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,760
onto my device I'm just building in

393
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,360
general by doing control B I mean

394
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,559
command B and now that that's done I'm

395
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,640
going to quit uh and now it will sync

396
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,360
this back on and then I can recreate the

397
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,640
IPA uh as you can see it's not really

398
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,600
doing anything on the iPhone but then I

399
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,960
can also delete this so it isn't taking

400
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,440
up space and then there so right as it's

401
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,720
done we can open up Safari and we can

402
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,600
install again right as it's

403
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,880
done this will just take a while I guess

404
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,640
and there it has successfully built now

405
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,120
I'm just going to wait for it to sink uh

406
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
which might just take a little a few

407
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,960
seconds actually uh so 12 seconds we'll

408
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,520
just wait for that to go um in case you

409
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,559
can't see where I'm reading the time off

410
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,720
of actually I'm just reading the time

411
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,159
off of

412
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,080
here as you can see it's just almost

413
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,880
done and there it's done now that it is

414
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,679
done I am just going to go back onto my

415
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,960
iPhone and I'm going to go into Safari

416
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
and I'm going to click on install once

417
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
again click on

418
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,919
install if I go back to my homepage it

419
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
should theoretically install back onto

420
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,400
my device and we should have uh a nice

421
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,200
working version yeah so see that's

422
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,640
sometimes what happens sometimes you

423
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
forget to hook up an IB Outlet sometimes

424
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,000
you forget to give it a certain string

425
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,640
value sometimes you make a r random

426
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,840
optional uh thing in Swift it so is a

427
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,039
bit annoying when that happens but I

428
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,280
mean it does happen

429
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,760
sometimes yeah so this is just going to

430
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,280
take a little while to install and once

431
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,679
it is successfully done we can open it

432
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,799
up and of course it doesn't crash so it

433
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,039
says that the current version is

434
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,600
0.0.1 now there's a problem uh well not

435
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,240
really a problem let's just say I were

436
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,600
to release version

437
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,440
0.0.2 now what I'm going to do is I'm

438
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,000
just going to keep this on here and I'm

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,120
not going to close it just so you can

440
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,919
see that I'm not doing anything so I'm

441
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,640
going to open up the

442
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,240
project

443
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,240
okay now I'm going to go back in and I'm

444
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,360
I'm going to change the version to

445
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,520
0.0.2 well of course has to load first

446
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,640
anyway sometimes it's really annoying

447
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,679
anyway so I'm going to change this to

448
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,640
0.0.2 I'm going to save and I'm going to

449
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,039
quit okay now this is just going to

450
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,240
refresh onto thing then I'm going to

451
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,799
redo IPA

452
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,640
build okay just wait for a second or

453
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,000
so

454
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,240
just going to wait wait wait wait and

455
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
keep on

456
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,919
waiting fake Errors By The X Cod to IPA

457
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,520
script uh and yeah in just a second it

458
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,960
will be done uh it's also going to have

459
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,919
to sync onto the server and while it

460
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,080
syncs uh I can show you how I okay there

461
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,919
now it's going to start syncing while it

462
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,799
syns I'm going to update the PHP uh to

463
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,240
reflect 0.0 2 instead so as you can see

464
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,159
this is literally the simplest PHP

465
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,159
script you could possibly have it's just

466
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,360
starting PHP we're echoing 0.0.2 to the

467
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,799
screen and we're ending PHP that's it so

468
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,480
if we were to go to this

469
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
website uh then as you can see we would

470
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,279
see um

471
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,880
update

472
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,159
check uh 0.0.2 because we just changed

473
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,039
it okay so now it has uh synced and it

474
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,799
has successfully built and we have

475
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,120
changed it here uh now if I were to

476
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,159
close open back up as you can see in

477
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,039
just a second or so or maybe actually

478
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,000
what I should do is clear this out of

479
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,279
memory then okay now if we just wait a

480
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,360
little

481
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,440
while uh we should be able to see uh

482
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,600
sometimes that'll also take a little

483
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,880
while to load it's normal it's because

484
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,279
yeah see so it just tells us that a new

485
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,559
sorry yeah see so what I'm just going to

486
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,440
do

487
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,880
uh is in our xcode project there's

488
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,240
another little thing uh is that if uh

489
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,000
you load on to another view this will

490
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,720
still be called uh and then it'll say

491
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,559
that okay now we're on a different View

492
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,480
and this is not no longer there so I

493
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,799
have to do if let underscores is equal

494
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,480
to

495
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,720
label then only do I want to change the

496
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,600
text okay so that should work and sorry

497
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,240
I just built onto the device there I'm

498
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,720
just going to stop that if it were ever

499
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,799
to load that

500
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,279
is one of the most annoying things to do

501
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,640
in the world of programming wait

502
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,080
anyway okay I'm going to stop the build

503
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,360
from happening and I'm just going to

504
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,760
build I'm not going to run onto the

505
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,360
device I'm just going to

506
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,480
build and in just a

507
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,159
second you should see that it

508
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,559
successfully builds I'm going to keep

509
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,760
the version

510
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,679
0.0.2 just just for the sake of

511
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,880
Simplicity uh but as you can see that's

512
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,600
done now I can quit out uh I can IPA

513
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
build it is going to create an IPA file

514
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,760
for us um and we should be able to see

515
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,320
uh the fact that we have a new IPA and

516
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
yeah yeah that'll take a little

517
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,559
time sorry about the

518
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,640
wait it's generating a new IPA

519
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,080
now as you can

520
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,360
see and we can just wait and wait and

521
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,120
wait and wait and

522
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,640
wait

523
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,039
anyway now it's sinking it is done

524
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,240
building it is now

525
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,320
sinking

526
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,880
um yeah it'll take some

527
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,320
time quite some time okay now that

528
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,480
that's done

529
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,919
we can actually get on uh with building

530
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,000
so now I'm just going to manually update

531
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,440
really quickly uh due to the fact that

532
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
we have just changed a really critical

533
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,880
piece of code and then I'm just going to

534
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,919
show you the automatic updates with the

535
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,400
version

536
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,840
0.0.3 so as you can see it'll do

537
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,880
that so till then what I can do is I can

538
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,600
start repairing version 0.0.3 so I'm

539
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,799
just going to open this

540
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
up

541
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,240
so I'm just going to change this to

542
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,480
0.0.3 but I'm not going to change the

543
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,520
PHP yet okay because I just want you to

544
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,159
see uh that even if we change the xcode

545
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,440
projects uh thing it's not going to

546
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,360
affect our app in anyway okay we can

547
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,279
open it up and it shows us that the

548
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,080
current version is

549
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,320
0.0.2 uh now of course it will not ask

550
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,960
us to update because that's also the

551
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,480
version in the pH HP however we had just

552
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,760
released a new version called 0.0.3 in

553
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,840
this mix uh so what do we do now let's

554
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
just do this I'm going to go back to our

555
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,760
PHP and make this 0.0.3 I'm going to

556
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,720
save and then I'm going to clear the

557
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,880
app okay now I'm going to close it

558
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,520
down uh just one

559
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,039
second yeah I didn't want that there

560
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,120
okay I'm just going to open it back up

561
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,360
and it immediately tells me that a new

562
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,200
update is available and what I like to

563
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,799
proceed with the update now I'm just

564
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,320
going to click no and as you can see it

565
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
tells us the current version is

566
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,480
0.0.2 now I'm going to

567
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,600
again open it up this time I'm going to

568
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,080
click on yes now I have two options I

569
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,720
can either let's do this or I can just

570
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,600
change my mind now I'm just going to

571
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,840
click on let's do this and it will

572
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,000
automatically close the app for me I can

573
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,640
delete this

574
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,679
app I can re uh rebuild the IPA first of

575
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,640
all

576
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,200
just wait for that to happen sorry

577
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,399
sometimes it does take a little bit of

578
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:04,840
time just make sure that's the right

579
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,919
link

580
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,679
yeah okay um right as it builds an IPA

581
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,399
we will be set

582
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:14,960
to do more stuff that's one of the most

583
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,039
uh annoying Parts building the IPA over

584
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:21,080
and over again it is a bit tedious and

585
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,520
it does get

586
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,799
annoying but again I mean it is useful

587
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,200
okay so now it has successfully build

588
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,480
and now I can click on the install after

589
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,840
refreshing as you can see I can click on

590
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,399
install and then I can click on install

591
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:42,000
again and then it should install version

592
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,480
0.0.3 and if I were to open up

593
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,799
0.0.3 it would well uh just a sec

594
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,840
retry it would successfully uh it would

595
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,679
actually not uh show me that there is an

596
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,240
update available because it would be the

597
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,440
latest version and and that this is

598
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,919
assuming that you have changed the

599
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,159
version number in xcode uh so that it

600
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,880
actually has a new version number to

601
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,520
look at uh so that it isn't just

602
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,440
pointlessly looking in the PHP file and

603
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,720
itself for no reason so now it is just

604
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,279
going to

605
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,720
install sorry about that

606
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,559
um yeah the reason it said it couldn't

607
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,480
install before is because I didn't wait

608
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,919
for the IPA to sync back into Dropbox

609
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,080
when you click on retry it's usually

610
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,440
synced already so I just clicked on

611
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,159
retry and then it

612
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,320
works the reason I know it works is

613
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,760
because it's taking much longer than

614
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,720
usual and when it takes pretty long then

615
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,760
that means it is successfully doing it

616
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,200
see so now we just wait for second and

617
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,480
it installs and we can open it up and we

618
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,760
can even wait a few seconds we can wait

619
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,399
like 10 seconds just to make sure it's

620
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,200
actually connecting and this will not

621
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,440
show anything I'm just going to wake

622
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,640
another 10 seconds right as it becomes

623
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,360
1219 50

624
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,919
a.m. okay okay so as you can see it's

625
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,240
not loading anything at all because it's

626
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,159
seeing that the current version number

627
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,240
and the version number in the PHP file

628
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,200
are the exact same so it's not taking

629
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,000
any action and yeah that was the Mac

630
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,480
part of the video uh pretty interesting

631
