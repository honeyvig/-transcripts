1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,740
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,899
tutorial my name is Hana bakshi and this

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,609
time we're gonna be going over another

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,470
Tanmay sorts video I haven't done one in

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,240
a while and so I'm going to be arriving

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,480
the series in this one video okay so now

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,620
today we're gonna be talking about a

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,350
really quick homebrew tip so if you get

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,689
this ever in homebrew which is

10
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,510
privileges error but I think this popped

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,560
up in 10.11 OS X El Capitan you rootless

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,300
but this is the error let's say I need

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,410
to install a package like get out not

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,989
brew get sorry brew install get I've

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,660
done this so many times that we're not

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,390
okay so now it's saying that I must link

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,570
XZ to brew before I can do this so let's

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,960
run brew link XZ and as you can see

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,750
gives us an error us our local include

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,800
is not writable now of course as I said

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,840
it's good to run brew doctor if you have

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,690
an issue with homebrew so I run brew

23
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,860
doctor and as you can see over here we

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,140
have another error the exact same thing

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,150
us our local include is not writable so

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,460
now how do you fix this exactly well

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,040
it's a ball you do come over here now

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,820
type in sudo CHM and this means change

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,390
owner now change owner will change the

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,310
owner of this specific directory or file

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,979
to whoever you choose in this case we're

32
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,930
gonna choose ourselves so we're going to

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,409
CH own but recursively meaning if it's a

34
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,750
directory go into its subdirectories and

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,640
its subdirectories and it's files and

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,009
every single thing in that directory

37
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,009
should be change the owner to whatever

38
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,990
you give it now we're going to make the

39
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,110
owner the current user and we're going

40
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,970
to do this for us our /local pretty

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,280
simple now let's click enter and it

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,329
would have asked you for your password

43
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,000
but I've already knew Doe before so it's

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,780
not doing that for me so now if I run

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,799
boob doctor as you can see it doesn't

46
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,890
give me that error and now if I do brew

47
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,800
link XZ it

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,740
sit properly were good on that end then

49
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,850
we can install get and as you can see it

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,710
worked it's just that I don't exactly

51
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,500
want to install it right now because I

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,620
already have it installed anyway that

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,440
