hey everyone it's no secret that the
majority of our internet usage is at the
risk of getting hacked be it via unsafe
messaging applications or misconfigured
operating systems to counteract this
void of digital security penetration
testing has become the norm when it
comes to vulnerability assessment par
security OS is an operating system that
has been become a well-known weapon in
this fight against hackers a l
distribution more cater towards
penetration testers specifically parent
security has layers of features that we
will be covering in today's lesson let's
take a look at the topics for this
video we start by learning about what
parro security is and why it should be
considered as a viable alternative next
to K Linux of penetration
testers next we take a look at the
minimum system requirements necessary to
obtain Optimum performance from an
installation of parro security moving on
we learn about some unique features that
make parot Stand Out Among the multiple
ethical hacking operating systems
available on the market and finally we
look at the multiple ways that par
security OS can be installed be it on a
single system or for portable
media so let's start out by learning
what parot security
is parat is a Dean based Linux
distribution with an emphasis on
security privacy and development it is
built on Debian testing branch and uses
a custom Harden Linux kernel while being
founded in
2013 parro security contains several
hundred tools targeted towards various
information security tasks such as
penetration testing security research
computer forensics and reverse
engineering it has become a
multiplatform solution accessible and
freely available to Information Security
Professionals and hobbies
it features a distinct forens six mode
that does not Mount any of the system
hard dis or partitions and has no
influence on the host system making it
more stealthy than regular mode this
mode is used on the host system when
there is a need for executing forensic
procedures in software development a
rolling release is a paradigm in which
software upgrades are rolled out
constantly rather than in batches of
versions this ensures that the software
is constantly up to date rolling release
distribution such as parat security OS
follows the same concept providing the
most recent Linux kernel and software
versions as they become available on the
market with the basic introduction to
the operating system out of the way let
us have a look at the bare minimum
system requirements necessary to be able
to run this operating
system first up we got a CPU requirement
which states that a 1 GHz dual Co CPU is
the absolute minimum in order to use
parat OS while multiple core systems
will provide more Optimum performance a
small beginner has been
included a very distinct thing to be
noted is that the operating system can
be installed on all variance of chipsets
be 32-bit 64-bit and the newly popular
armm portfolio of
devices unlike K Linux which requires
some amount of graphical acceleration
needed to display the operating system
correctly paret OS has no such
requirements and can be used with the
leanest of machines
taking into account the ram issue a
minimum of 256 MB to 512 MB free Ram
provides the optimum usage
scenarios even when the OS is installed
on a hard drive storage media it should
theoretically occupy around 8 GB of
information which may extend up to 16 GB
depending on the tools being installed
out of the box when it comes to booting
options we have the option of going with
the Legacy BIOS settings or with the
more modern ufi settings these are just
some of the requir ments for the
installation of parro security OS to
understand this process more vividly and
to learn how visualization can help
install an OS in our existing computer
please follow the link to a parro
security installation video linked right
above let's understand what some of the
things that make parot security unique
among all the other penetration testing
operating
systems along with all the giant catalog
of scripts par security has its own
custom hardened Linux kernel which has
been modified explicitly to provide as
much security and resistance to hackers
as possible as a first line of defense
the configurations in the operating
system act as a second Gateway taking
care of militia requests and dropping
them off this is particularly beneficial
since should there be a scenario where
the latest Linux kernel is causing some
particular issue the parat development
team will most likely iron it out first
before passing it on as an update
the custom hardened kernel wasn't
reasoning enough parid security
developers managed to install more
hacking tools and scripts to ensure a
smooth transition for the G Linux users
all the tools you found in Gali are
present in parto and then a few extra
ones for good measure this has been
achieved while keeping roughly the same
size of the installation file between
both operating
systems however it's not all
productivity points for parro OS they
provide a choice between two different
desktop environments the M desktop which
comes pre-installed by default and KDE
for those unfamiliar with Linux
terminology you can think of desktop
environments as the main UI for a Linux
system being highly modular in nature
one can use Ki Linux or paratos while
adding another dektop environment which
they find appealing while Kali has only
a single option paratos has managed to
provide two optimized Wills with made
desktop and KD desktop ready made on the
website
one of the primary advantages of parat
os over Kali is that it's relatively
lightweight this implies that it takes
frequently less dis space and computing
power to function properly with as
little as 320 MB of ram required in
reality paratos is also designed to
operate successfully of a USB stick but
Kali liux does not work well from a USB
stick and is generally installed in a
virtual machine parat can be seen as
more of a niche distribution if you're
searching for something lighter than G
Linux
now that we understand all about the
operating system let us have a look at
some of the ways we can move forward
with the
installation the first way to use parat
security is by launching the
distribution in live USB mode this can
be achieved by downloading the installer
image file or the ISO file from the
parate security website and flashing it
to a USB drive with capacity of at least
8 GB some people do not need to save
these data permanently and live USB is
the perfect solution for such cases
after the iso image is flashed the th
Drive can be used to boot a fully
working installation of the operating
system with a caviar that any changes
made to the OS in this mode are not
written permanently some cases allow
persistent storage and live USBS but
those require further configuration than
normal
situations but what if the user wants to
store data permanently in the installed
OS the best and the most reliable way to
ensure this is the full-fledged hard dis
installation this will ensure the
complete usage of the system's Hardware
capabilities and will take into account
the updates and configurations being
made into the OS on a driver level this
method is supposed to override any
pre-existing operating system which is
installed on the hard disk be it windows
or any other variety of
Linux the next alternative route for
installing pirate security would be to
use virtualization software such as
VMware or virtual box the software will
be installed as a separate application
on an already existing OS and pallet
security can be run as an operating
system in the same system as a window
the hardware requirements will be
completely customizable starting with
the allotted Ram to the virtual hard
disk capacity the usage of both a host
machine and a guest operating system
like paratos allows users a safe
environment to learn while not putting
the systems at risk if you want to learn
more about how we can go forward with
this method we have a dedicated video
where parat OS is being installed on a
VMware while running a Windows 10
operating system you can find the link
in the description box to get started
with your very own virtual machine
instance the final way to install parot
security is by using a dual boot system
to put it in simple words the parro OS
will not be overwriting any
pre-installed operating system on a
machine but will be installed alongside
it when a computer boots up the user
will get a choice to boot into either of
the operating system many people prefer
to keep both of Windows and parot
security installed so if the
distribution of work and recreational
activities is also allotted effectively
it also gives users a safety valve
should their custom Linux installation
runs into bugs that cannot be fixed from
within the OS hope you learned something
