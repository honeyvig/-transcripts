hey everyone welcome to another video by
simply learn in this video we will
discuss about a particular type of
raspberry pi that is raspberry pi zero
see what's in it for you in this session
we'll first start with understanding
what is raspberry pi
followed by we will see some of the
features of raspberry pi zero and
specifications of raspberry pi 0.
then we will see applications
and the difference between raspberry pi
0 and raspberry pi 0w
but before we begin make sure you have

the raspberry pi zero
the raspberry pi zero is a super cheap
super compact computer
the zero is smaller than a credit card
measuring 65 millimeter by 30 millimeter
and is only 5 millimeter thick
it also weights 9 grams the raspberry pi
0 is inexpensive costing only four to
five dollars
the raspberry pi zero w is member of the
pi zero family with wireless lan and
bluetooth capabilities
the raspberry pi zero uses the same
single core broadcom cpu as the original
raspberry pi
however it has been turned to 1
gigahertz making it 40 percent faster
than the original
when you consider the zero raspberry pi
with 502 mb of ram it's around three
times faster than the original raspberry
pi in terms of total performance
features of raspberry pi zero
the raspberry pi zero has a single tiny
hdmi port rather than the full hdmi port
found on prior raspberry pi devices
despite this it can still produce video
at
1080p and 60 frames per second
one micro usb port provides power to the
raspberry pi zero while the other serves
as the usb outboard for connecting a
keyboard mouse wi-fi dongle or other
peripheral
there is no standard wi-fi or ethernet
port on the raspberry pi zero you will
have to figure out how to connect to the
internet on your own
but that's the kind of purpose of this
bare bones gadget
it has an unpopulated 40 pin gpio header
and an unpopulated composite video
header
just as all other raspberry pi variants
you can use this to solder on your own
interface components if you like
which is where the raspberry pi's
enormous potential and flexibility
really shine
another important cost cutting technique
is the lack of fixed storage on
raspberry pi zero instead you will need
to provide your own storage in the form
of microsd card which you may place into
the provided slot
the raspberry pi zero like previous
raspberry pi devices runs on raspbian
its lightweight operating system based
on the dbn operating system open source
project
being free to download raspberry and
also gives users access to pi shop which
is essentially an app store with
hundreds of packages built particularly
for the raspberry pi given the raspberry
pi 0's capable hardware it can just run
about any packages
now let us look at the applications of
raspberry pi the raspberry pi 0 is
already a computer that can be used as a
desktop pc or notebook without the need
for a screen or keyboard some of the
applications are it is used to make a
wildlife camera
this is the droid you are looking for
build a portable pocket sized computer a
compact raspberry pi zero server binary
clock with unique unicon
p hat
zero board raspberry pi zero fpv robot
remote control smart drone
raspberry pi zero wifi security camera
portable game console
home network music system google home
with bluetooth speaker and many more
specifications of raspberry pi zero
some of the specifications of raspberry
pi zero are it has eight zero two point
one one
with less land
bluetooth of four point one bluetooth
low energy and one gigahertz single core
cpu five two mb of ram
mini hdmi port and micro usb otg port
micro usb power
hat compatible 40 pin header composite
video and reset headers and csi camera
connectors
now let us look at the difference
between raspberry pi 0 and raspberry pi
0w
the w in raspberry pi 0
stands for wireless and it denotes the
pi 0 models wireless functionality that
is the most significant distinction
between the two models
while the raspberry pi zero was designed
to deliver more functionality while
being half the size of a plus board
later the raspberry pi zero 0w was
released with built-in wireless
connectivity eliminating the need for a
separate accessory or module to enable
bluetooth and wi-fi
the raspberry pi 0 is 5
whereas the raspberry pi 0w is roughly
10 dollars the price will of course vary
depending on its availability and
location
the main distinction between two is this
with the rest of specification staying
the same
so with that we have reached the end of
this video thank you so much for being
