is growing and we not only decided to

succeed together as well I successfully
switched my career to postal Java domain
with a 15 salary hike and I was able to
grab new opportunities in my current
organization and also receive a 10
salary hike hey I am swamijit Basu I am
a senior QA engineer at Encore Inc and I
am show me and I work as a senior
quality Analyst at doodle blue
Innovation we started our upscaling
journey together which simply learned
and certainly we made the right choice
after our marriage I had to relocate to
Bangalore and take a year Gap after
working 45 years but I decided to
restart my career again and make a
switch to software domain so I enrolled
myself in full stack Java developer
program from Simply learn seeing my
wife's passion for learning every day
inspired me to take up a course on
simply learn as well I've always been
passionate about technology and learning
devops was always in my bucket list when
I saw simply learns collaboration with
Caltech ctme I decided to take a course
on PG devops after the course I not only
switched my career to post a Java
development with person and
increase salary but now also I can work
from home since it's a software domain
and being the new mom that's the best
thing one could ask for to spend time
with little one during these early years
for me learning devops was fun and
fulfilling at the same time earlier I
had to rely on others at work but after
upskilling myself I single-handedly can
set up the entire blueprint on my code
base alone and get the desired output
and because of that I could grab new
projects in my organization with a 10
percent salary high we enrolled to
upscale ourselves when we were
expert first child so upscaling Journey
with learn would be undoubtedly very
special to both of us while doing the
course we did come across a lot of
challenges due to the pregnancy but my
wife showed me was a great inspiration
for me as she was handling it all
together and she kept motivating and
inspiring me all the way moreover the
recorded classes and the weekend class
helped us maintain the balance between
work and learning apart from work we
love to spend time with our little one
learning with simply Learned was quite a
fulfilling experience for both of us we
believe that growth doesn't happen
overnight rather it's a journey of
several small steps and upskilling is
one of them web development offers an
exciting career path with ample
opportunities for growth and advancement
