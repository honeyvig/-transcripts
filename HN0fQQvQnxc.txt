1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,800
so hello there and welcome to the

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,799
tutorial my name is Tanner Baki and this

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,200
time we're going to be going over

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,920
another general education video so

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,480
actually this was a question sent to me

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,280
by one of my viewers and here's a clip

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,040
of their

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,240
question hi Tammy I'm Madison and I have

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,840
a little math question for you what is

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,560
LCM and GCF how can I find an LCM and

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,920
GCF of two numbers also is there any

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,160
relationship between the numbers of LCM

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,119
and GCF

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be looking forward to the next

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,399
video explaining what LCM and GCF is

16
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,079
bye so now that you've seen the question

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,719
I'm going to try my best to answer it I

18
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,440
hope it answers a question Madison let's

19
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,239
get started uh so today we're going to

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,399
be talking about the LCM and GCF uh and

21
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,280
before we go any further what does LCM

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,559
and GCF actually stand for in the first

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,640
place well LCM as you can see stands for

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,640
lowest common

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,640
multiple which I'll explain in a

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,680
minute and GCF stands for

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
greatest

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,000
common factor so essentially the

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,439
opposite completely of the

30
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,960
LCM now we can ignore this part for now

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,759
and let's look at this these are two key

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,920
words that will really help

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
us when

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,439
finding uh when actually trying to do

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,079
the LCM of the

36
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,520
GCF so there's two things here the

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,320
multiple and the

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,240
factor and so you can have a multiple or

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,360
a factor of a number for example the

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,200
number

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
eight I'm going to list out its

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,159
multiples and its factors and then show

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,840
you exact what uh the factors and

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,200
multiples mean so for eight you could

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,880
have something like uh 1

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,759
2 4

47
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,480
and8 for its multiples you could have oh

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,519
I don't know

49
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,599
eight 16

50
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:22,440
24 32 dot dot dot they can keep going on

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,080
forever okay now let me explain exactly

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,040
what these things are why have I listed

53
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,760
these numbers exactly what do these have

54
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,000
to do with the number eight well

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,480
factors are numbers that 8 can be

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,519
divided by for example you can do 8

57
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,480
divided 4 and it would give you two 8

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,640
divided by two and it would give you

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,120
four etc etc for all its factors and the

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
multiples are the opposite they are the

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,760
numbers that can be divided by eight so

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,400
for example let's just choose a random

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,000
one uh this one 24 okay so I landed on

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
24 24 ID 8 three perfect so it can

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
easily be divided and so can

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,000
this so just to sum it all up a factor

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,480
uh is a number that eight can be uh

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,040
divided by and then the multiple in this

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,959
case uh is the number uh that can be

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,080
divided by eight you could replace this

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,920
with any number and then its multiples

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,120
and factors would

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,120
change and then stuff like that now you

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,879
must have seen a pattern here the

75
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,599
factors can only

76
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,120
be less than or equal

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,720
to 8 but the multiples can only be

78
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,159
greater than or equal to

79
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,799
8 so uh this is basically how factors

80
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,400
and the multiples will work and so if

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,640
you didn't notice already I put a dot

82
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,720
dot dot here what this means is that the

83
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,959
multiples will go on Forever Until

84
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,720
Infinity however our factors will stop

85
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,560
right here at

86
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,760
8 so that's how that

87
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,840
works now that we've gotten that out of

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,880
the way uh let's actually start using

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
the LCM and the GCF of multiple or more

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
numbers and just before I go on let me

91
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,080
just clarify that an a word for this

92
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,160
sort of a set would mean this is a

93
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,039
finite set meaning there's a LUN limited

94
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,800
number in this however here there's

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
infinite the in basically uh meaning the

96
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
opposite of finite meaning this is

97
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
infinite it'll keep going on and on and

98
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,160
on and on and on and on you could do 8 *

99
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,000
5 million and you would still get an

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,280
answer you could do eight times Google

101
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,039
Plexi and then you'd still get an answer

102
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,120
which is a real number by the way okay

103
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,919
anyway getting back to the point let's

104
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,080
actually see how you find gcfs and

105
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,479
lcms our main way here is of course

106
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:02,919
going to be something called

107
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,639
factorization

108
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,000
trees and before I actually explain

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,919
factorization trees to let me explain

110
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,320
what lowest common multiple and and

111
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,000
greatest common factor actually

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,919
mean so for example here uh let's just

113
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,280
say I wanted to find the LCM uh of oh I

114
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,000
don't know uh 4 and

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,360
8 now what I do is i' list out the

116
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,400
multiples for four I'd list out the

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,840
multi for eight so for four there could

118
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,759
be um there could be four there could be

119
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,240
eight there could be 12 there could be

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,720
16 etc etc that'll keep going on till

121
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,319
Infinity for eight there could be 8

122
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,400
16 uh there could be 24 there could be

123
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,680
32 etc etc again onto

124
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,759
Infinity now as you can

125
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,120
see first of all we have the word

126
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,919
lowest in

127
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,880
LCM and we also have have

128
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,840
common so you must have found out that

129
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,720
we need to find the lowest common factor

130
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,680
I mean a multiple quite literally from

131
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,080
both of these sets so eight it's in this

132
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,680
set so our lowest common multiple will

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,880
be

134
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,280
eight and just as a little rule quickly

135
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,120
the

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,440
LCM can only be greater than or equal to

137
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,520
the bigger number in the Set uh so in

138
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
this case it's

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,960
eight if it were for example uh 8 and 20

140
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,360
it would be

141
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,840
20 now let's try to find the

142
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,680
GCF so for example here I'm going to uh

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,160
write down all the

144
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,560
factors for four

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
and8 oh just to clarify uh we found the

146
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
LCM

147
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,000
here to be 8 now let's find the

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,039
GCF so let's uh list down the factors

149
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,919
for four and eight so for the factors

150
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,879
for four would be

151
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,160
one two and that's really and also

152
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,520
four and for eight we could have one two

153
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,240
four and also eight so as you can see

154
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,039
the greatest factor that's common in

155
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,039
both couldn't be eight because that

156
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
doesn't come in uh in four but it is

157
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
four because it also comes in four so as

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,159
you can see in this case our GCF

159
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,520
sorry is going to be

160
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,319
four so now you must have seen another

161
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,440
pattern our GCF can only be less than or

162
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,960
equal to four in this

163
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
case so that's how that works anyway

164
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,560
apart from this example now you actually

165
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,280
know what an LCM and what a GCF is now

166
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,199
you might be wondering what's a really

167
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
efficient way to do this without having

168
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
to write all these factors and all these

169
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,800
multiples and everything this is very

170
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,520
manual method it doesn't work with

171
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
larger numbers and it's just overall a

172
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,440
very tedious

173
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,280
process so how can I

174
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,159
make a way to find the same GCF and

175
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,839
LCM easily so yeah we can use prime

176
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,680
factorization now let me give you a few

177
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,360
examples of that so let's start with uh

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,440
finding the G uh the LCM of a few

179
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,200
numbers such as uh oh I don't know four

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,560
and 10 so for example four and 10 now

181
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,519
again we really do not want to list out

182
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,920
all the multiples all the factors find

183
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,240
the answer it's just really repetitive

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,680
sometimes you miss one and it just keeps

185
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,560
going on and it's very unsuitable for

186
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,519
larger numbers like

187
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,880
5,659 with

188
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,720
3,291 that just wouldn't work with

189
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,160
listing out all the multiples and

190
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
factors so what we do in this case is we

191
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
do something called prime

192
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,079
factorization so what we do here uh is

193
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,399
you must know what a prime number is

194
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,240
it's a number that can only be divided

195
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,519
by one in

196
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,320
itself so I'm going to give you an

197
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,720
example of something called prime

198
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,360
factorization so as you can see have

199
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,240
first of all let's look at this

200
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,160
number what * what is equal to this

201
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,040
number 2 * 2 is equal to this number so

202
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,079
I'm going to write down two and two in a

203
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,839
tree

204
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,920
format now basically there's no more

205
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,720
that we could continue because two is a

206
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,880
prime number two is a prime number we

207
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,560
couldn't continue our tree however in

208
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
10's case you also cannot continue the

209
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,560
tree

210
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,240
it stops at two and five because 2 * 5

211
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,680
is 10 and so since these are both Prime

212
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,360
we can't continue to create more numbers

213
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,680
in a

214
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,720
tree just so that you aren't uh confused

215
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,240
let me just show you uh the tree of some

216
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,399
something like eight the reason I'm

217
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,120
going to show this to you is so that you

218
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,480
really get the concept of a tree in this

219
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,760
sense so what's uh 2 * 4 8 so I'm going

220
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,399
to write down 2 two and

221
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,880
four now two is prime but four is not

222
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,160
this uh is

223
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,440
uh forgot what that's called anyway uh

224
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,639
this is prime uh this is not prime sorry

225
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,160
uh so then we can continue two and

226
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,680
two uh so yeah now we've factored it

227
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,680
down to only literally uh prime numbers

228
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,760
so now that it's only Prime we can't

229
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,680
continue and we have successfully

230
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,639
created a prime

231
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,639
tree uh so now uh since we can't do any

232
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,160
of this with 10 and four we can only

233
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,279
have this oh yeah just remember the name

234
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,079
this is a composite number it's not

235
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,560
prime it's composite okay remembered

236
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,320
okay now let's go back to this since uh

237
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,600
there's no more down we just stay at one

238
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,880
level here in the tree uh and that

239
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,079
really works

240
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,959
out anyway let's take a look at this now

241
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,279
since since we have treed down our uh

242
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,079
two

243
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,959
numbers what we can do now is in order

244
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,320
to find the LCM let's take the number 10

245
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,800
and let's just say

246
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,839
2 * 5 because that's what it's what

247
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,360
that's what's written down here then

248
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,160
under that I'm going to write 2 *

249
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,040
2 but when you do the this sort of a

250
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,880
thing there's a little limitation I

251
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,040
guess you could call it

252
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,720
and so what

253
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,000
happens is okay look at this you have to

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
take

255
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,120
erase if two of these numbers are not

256
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
the

257
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,440
same uh and what you have to do is put a

258
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
little square

259
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,600
here another times and then the other

260
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,760
number because there should never be two

261
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,000
numbers that are not the same uh on top

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,279
of each other

263
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,320
uh so yeah that's how that works uh and

264
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,959
so just so you see it a little bit more

265
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,800
clearly I'm going to say 10 is equal to

266
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,279
uh for the sake of

267
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,920
it okay and then I'm just going to do

268
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,600
this and as you can see it's that easy

269
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,440
to be able to uh create something like

270
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,040
that anyway now as you can see uh we

271
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,360
have a little multiplication statement

272
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
but how do we get our LCM from it all we

273
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
really need to do is say okay two and

274
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,920
two they're the same so write down a

275
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,639
two then a multiplication

276
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,040
symbol five and blank so we're going to

277
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,079
write down

278
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,160
five blank and two or we could also

279
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,360
write down blank so blank and two we are

280
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,279
down to

281
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,800
two so our

282
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,160
LCM is equal to 2 * 5 * 2 so let 2 * 5

283
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,639
10 * 2

284
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,199
20 so our LCM has has successfully been

285
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,079
found to be

286
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,720
20 so that's our LCM now how do we get

287
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,160
our

288
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,360
GCF so our

289
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,079
GCF will just be equal to two how you

290
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,079
may

291
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,959
ask that's

292
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,680
because first of all and just that you

293
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
can uh I can draw some arrows for you

294
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm going to write it above so for

295
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
example here GCF

296
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,720
now as you can see two and two they are

297
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,000
common so I'm going to write two then a

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,959
times five and blank not common blank

299
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,759
and two not common so there's no more

300
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,079
numbers at the end we remove our

301
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,920
multiplication and as you see our GCF is

302
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,560
going to have to be

303
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,240
two so we have successfully found that

304
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
the GCF for 4 and 10 is 2 and the LCM

305
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,199
for 4 and 10 is 20

306
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,480
anyway continuing on with this uh Rule

307
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,680
now I'm going to show you a few more

308
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,440
examples of prime factorization finding

309
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,120
the LCM and GCF with that

310
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,199
method so now just take a few numbers

311
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,880
for example 6 and

312
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,399
10 okay now we have 6 and 10 let's prime

313
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,920
factorize

314
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,680
them that's done pretty

315
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
easy pretty

316
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,519
easy now let's find the

317
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,800
LCM so I'm going to note down two and

318
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,759
five for number

319
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,639
10 and for six we note

320
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
down two and

321
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,000
three however again there can ever be

322
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,759
two different numbers under each

323
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,959
other so what we do

324
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,560
is we

325
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,040
erase we make a little

326
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,000
box make a little

327
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,160
box and then put the actual number which

328
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,920
in this case will be

329
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,079
three so now that we have both of our

330
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,680
numbers written

331
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,000
down over here all we can do is say okay

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,720
two and two that's a

333
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,040
two times five in blank that's a five

334
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,120
time blank and three which will be a

335
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,160
three so our

336
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,399
LCM will be equal to this so now what's

337
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,959
2 * 5 that's 10 * 3 that would be 30 so

338
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,959
30 is our

339
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,480
LCM now we found our LCM let's find our

340
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,319
GCF again there's only one number that

341
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,839
is common throughout all of these so we

342
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:29,759
can assern that our GCF is that one

343
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,000
common number which in this case is

344
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,720
two so now what we need to do uh is do

345
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,800
some more examples so let's just do

346
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
something a little bit more complicated

347
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
now uh 10's not that interesting because

348
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,079
um sorry about that uh they're just one

349
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,839
down in a tree and so that really isn't

350
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,600
very fun if you think about it and you

351
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,319
really wouldn't get those many questions

352
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,839
about that

353
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,519
either so now let's do something like 5

354
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,759
and 12 for

355
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,439
example so maybe 5 12 now five is

356
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,559
already Prime so I mean we could write

357
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,679
down one and five uh but there's nothing

358
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,839
really that we would need to do about

359
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,919
that anyway but 12 that's interesting

360
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,480
because to get 12 you would multiply two

361
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,880
and six and to get six you would get two

362
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,720
and three so as you can see we have a

363
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,559
variety of different numbers now so now

364
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,919
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

365
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,880
come over here I'm going to say for

366
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,400
12 uh we have two uh so as you can see 2

367
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,840
* 2 * 3 because those are all the prime

368
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:48,000
numbers that we got 2 * 2 * 3 will give

369
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,520
us 12 because 2 * 2 that's 4 * 3

370
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,320
12 then we take our

371
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,400
five right now the thing is we can't

372
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,720
just write down a five here so what I'm

373
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
going to do is I'm GNA put a blank and

374
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,520
as you can because there's a two in

375
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,799
front of it and that's not a five so

376
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,039
they can't be the different they can't

377
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
be different so we can't put that there

378
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
so we have to do blank times another

379
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,360
blank times another blank times a

380
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,840
five and that is our valid

381
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
multiplication

382
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,840
statement so then I'm just going to do

383
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,720
this and so now as you can see I'm going

384
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,360
to just find the LC M by doing

385
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,600
LCM is equal to

386
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,120
2

387
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,159
* two times as you can see because two

388
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:46,159
blank two two blank two three blank

389
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,960
three and

390
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,600
then blank five five so we say 2 * 2

391
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,840
that's 4 * 3 uh 12 uh * 5 would be uh

392
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,919
24 wait no uh that would

393
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,159
be forgot what it was uh let me

394
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:10,080
calculate this 60 sorry got confused

395
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,559
there anyway uh but 12 * 5 would be 60

396
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,840
and so we can definitely assern that our

397
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,520
LCM is

398
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,720
60 now let's find our GCF but wait a

399
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,960
minute no matter what number you look at

400
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,640
here there's either a box box below it

401
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
or box above it this means that there's

402
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
no common

403
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,159
number so when there's no common number

404
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,159
the only thing that you can think is

405
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,880
that the GCF will have to be one cannot

406
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,559
be any other number due to the fact that

407
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,080
none of these have a common number in

408
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,039
them

409
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
anyway now that that's done uh let's do

410
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,520
some more examples uh let's just uh

411
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,679
finish it off with two more examples

412
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,039
this time we're going to do 8 and 12 so

413
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,720
12 is already there so then we don't

414
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,559
need to erase that though we can erase

415
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,559
this and

416
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,880
stuff yeah so I'm going to give you 8

417
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,039
and 12 now which I'm sure you will all

418
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,320
love this example because it's just a

419
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,760
perfect mix between uh hard and easy at

420
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,520
the same

421
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,039
time so then I'm just going to do this

422
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,080
and then stas this because I mean we're

423
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
still using 12 we're just putting in an

424
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
eight

425
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,880
so that'll work now let's prime

426
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,840
factorize 8 sorry about

427
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,440
that anyway let's prime factorize eight

428
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,919
so we take our eight what's 2 * 4 eight

429
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,400
so 2 and

430
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,440
four what's 2 * 2 4 so we have

431
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,320
successfully Prime factorized 8 by doing

432
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,159
2 * 2 * 2 is equal to 8 and that's a

433
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,840
completely valid multiplication

434
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,720
statement so now what I'm going to to do

435
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,520
I'm going to come over here and going to

436
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,080
say 8 is equal to uh 2 * 2 * blank *

437
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,640
2 because that's actually what we're

438
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,880
doing with 8 and 12 how to find our LCM

439
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,840
however I want to say

440
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:25,320
LCM is equal to 2 * 2 * 3 * 2 so 2 * 2

441
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,000
that would be 4 * 3 that would be 12 * 2

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,760
that would be 24 so our answer here is

443
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,320
24 for our

444
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,159
LCM that was a pretty nice uh way to

445
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:39,440
find our LCM now let's find our

446
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,200
GCF so as you can see there's two common

447
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,080
numbers in this uh so there's two and

448
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,440
two so we do GCF I'm just going to write

449
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,880
it here if you don't mind so

450
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,400
GCF is equal to 2 * 2 because there

451
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,120
those are the only two common

452
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,799
uh numbers there so the GCF is going to

453
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,720
be equal to 2 * 2 which is equal to four

454
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,520
so our GCF is successfully

455
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,279
for now if you watch the question

456
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,840
carefully uh yes uh Madison did ask me

457
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,279
uh the how to find the GCF and LCM but

458
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,520
she also asked me if there was a

459
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,720
relationship between the numbers and

460
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,520
their GCF and LCM and yes there is so

461
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,559
let me explain that to you right now

462
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,720
so now I'm going to be explaining the

463
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,480
relationship between the two numbers and

464
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,039
their LCM and their GCF order to do this

465
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,600
since I don't want to bore you and spend

466
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,320
the next 10 hours writing like doing

467
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,200
tons of questions I'm just going to

468
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,440
write down lots of gcfs and lcms along

469
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,400
with their numbers so this is going to

470
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,159
be number one number two their

471
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,480
LCM and their GCF

472
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,159
now what I'm going to do uh is I'm just

473
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,799
going to note down lots of number one

474
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,919
number twos and calculate older lcms and

475
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,520
gcfs and let's see if we can find a

476
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,279
pattern let's do something like uh 10

477
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,039
that would be a pretty good

478
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,240
example and so I'm just going to

479
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
calculate its

480
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,799
LCM which would be 40 so the LCM would

481
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:30,440
be 40 here and the GCF would be uh two

482
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,320
perfect so our LCM and GCF is 40 and two

483
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,640
I'm going to continue this and write

484
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,120
down lots of

485
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,640
numbers still be

486
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,360
40

487
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,279
be okay

488
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:51,159
four perfect uh then we can do something

489
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:54,080
like uh three and

490
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,159
four the LCM would obviously be 12

491
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,919
uh and their GCF would be one and I'll

492
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,120
tell you how I calculate this calculated

493
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,279
this in just a minute let's do something

494
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,440
like seven and

495
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,159
eight

496
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,720
do

497
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,880
56 and

498
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,559
one you'll see how I calculated these so

499
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,360
fast in just a minute

500
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,640
now 6 and

501
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,240
10

502
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,840
uh 30 and

503
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,640
two okay uh and then we could do uh two

504
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,520
more examples I guess or actually a few

505
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,039
more examples quite a few uh 4 and

506
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,279
20 don't think I have enough space for

507
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,880
the other pattern that I was going to do

508
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,360
so as I know 4 and 20 would obviously be

509
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,799
20 because uh that's just how this works

510
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,200
and again I'm going to be telling you

511
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,240
how I calculate these so fast in just a

512
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,880
minute and then this would be

513
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,120
four then if we were to have something

514
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,919
like 6 and 24

515
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,360
this would be 24 and this would be

516
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,039
six I think you might just start seeing

517
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,640
a pattern now but you might just want to

518
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,520
wait for a while and see what I really

519
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,080
come up with

520
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,320
next so now that we're done 6 24 24 and

521
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,000
6 uh let's go to another example uh

522
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,679
seven and 11 I guess 7 and

523
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,679
11 actually no 7 and 11 would be too

524
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,720
complicated for now or what it yeah I'm

525
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,760
just going to give you a different

526
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,799
pattern which is five and six would give

527
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,799
us 30 and

528
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,159
one so then after five and six we have

529
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:42,320
something like five and

530
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,000
seven then our answer would definitely

531
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,080
be

532
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,039
35 and

533
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,440
one so then I will do a few more later

534
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,320
but that is if I could possibly fit them

535
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,399
uh so there are a few more patterns that

536
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:04,640
I should should be explaining but those

537
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,240
will be explained in just a

538
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,320
minute so now as you know we have number

539
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,120
one number two our LCM and our GCF now

540
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,799
what's the relationship between these

541
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,760
numbers you may

542
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,159
ask well let's just look at this what's

543
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:23,240
40 * 2 we all know that's 80 because 4 *

544
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,559
2 8 i 0

545
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,080
8 what's 8 * 10

546
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,919
80 so if 8 * 10 is 80 and 40 * 2 is 80

547
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,960
we can say that number one * number two

548
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,159
is equal to LCM * GCF so this is our

549
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,240
final rule uh number one * number two is

550
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,480
equal to LCM *

551
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,840
GCF that's how that works that's a

552
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,440
really interesting concept and it'll

553
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,480
really help us uh in finding the LCM and

554
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,640
GCF and and also find number one and

555
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,440
number two now let me just show you that

556
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
this exact same pattern works with all

557
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,799
of these numbers and then I will

558
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,480
actually show you a few patterns in

559
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,039
between all these numbers which you

560
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,840
might not have

561
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,159
realized okay so let's take something

562
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,480
like uh number one and number

563
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,240
two so 8 and 20 what's 8 * 20 160 so 8 *

564
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,320
20 is 160 40 *

565
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,240
4 160

566
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,880
so these two are equal to each

567
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,919
other 3 * 4 obviously 12 12 * 1 very

568
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,039
obviously 12 then we can assern that

569
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,880
they're

570
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:48,880
equal 7 * 8 56 56 * 1 56 and so we can

571
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,519
say that these are equal this will keep

572
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,480
going on for example 6 * 10 uh 60 30 * 2

573
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,760
60 these are equal this will always work

574
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,039
100 % of the

575
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,440
time no matter what 4 * 20 though just

576
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,559
to clarify if you have any possible

577
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:14,399
questions 80 okay this is 80 20 * 4

578
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,320
80 and I'm just going to say that uh

579
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,279
these are equal because 6 * 24 uh which

580
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,679
I'm not going to do right now because

581
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,760
that would be way too much to calculate

582
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,640
uh but I mean if you were to do this it

583
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,840
would be equal to this due to our rule

584
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,240
saying so so we don't even need to

585
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,159
calculate it we could keep going on 5 *

586
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,360
6 30 30 * 13 so then these will be

587
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,640
equal 5 * 7 35 = 35 *

588
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,000
1 that's how that works and as you can

589
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,679
see this rule will actually help us even

590
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,440
though you might not think about it

591
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,600
because let's say you do have your LCM

592
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,880
but you want to still calculate your

593
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,480
GCF what what would you

594
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,159
do all you need to do is to find the

595
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,960
GCF you find number one times number two

596
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,039
divide or actually

597
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:14,640
divided sorry about that a little bit

598
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,600
too excited I guess

599
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,519
anyway okay so number one time number

600
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,679
two divided by the

601
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,840
LCM is going to be equal to our

602
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,600
GCF so so for

603
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,039
example let's find the GCF let's pretend

604
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,799
we didn't have this

605
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,919
answer okay let's pretend we didn't have

606
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,320
the

607
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,840
GCF we only have the LCM and our two

608
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,320
numbers so our

609
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,480
GCF is equal

610
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,360
to 8 *

611
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,840
10 divided by

612
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,000
40 so so what's 80 / 40 obviously our

613
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,039
GCF will be equal to 2 so our GCF is

614
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,039
equal to

615
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,000
2 so that's how that works and I'm just

616
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,360
going to give you a few more examples

617
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,159
then I'm going to explain uh two or

618
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,760
three different patterns that I noticed

619
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,720
uh when finding your GCF and your

620
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,799
LCM okay so let's just choose one at

621
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:24,840
random okay so this

622
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,960
one let's just try finding the LCM this

623
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,159
time okay so we don't have our LCM we

624
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,000
have our GCF though so what we're going

625
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,399
to do is we're going to do

626
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,080
LCM is equal

627
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,840
to 6 *

628
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,399
10 /

629
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:55,679
2 so now we do 6 * 10 which would be 60

630
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,279
/ 2 30 so our LCM will obviously be 30

631
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,760
and so we can fill in our 30 over

632
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,480
there that's how you would find the LCM

633
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,840
and GCF using the other number and this

634
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,480
actually also works if you want to find

635
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,559
one of the other numbers so for example

636
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,039
over here we didn't want to uh okay

637
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,159
let's just say we didn't have

638
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,679
10 okay we don't have

639
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,559
10 but we have 30 two which are our LCM

640
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,120
and GCF and we also have number

641
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,480
one so what we're going to

642
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,159
do is number

643
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,200
two uh number

644
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,399
two is equal

645
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,200
to 30 *

646
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,039
2 ID

647
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,039
6 so 30 * 2 what would that be that

648
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,760
would be 60 then divide that by six and

649
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,679
you get 10 so our number two will have

650
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,559
to be 10 which is correct so it will

651
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,720
work even for number one number two LCM

652
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,880
or GCF as long as you have one of the

653
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,559
other or vice

654
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,320
versa okay now that that's done let me

655
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,039
explain three patterns that I

656
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,320
have first of all you may have already

657
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,960
noticed this if the numbers that you're

658
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,200
calculating for are one

659
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,440
apart their LCM is equal to them to

660
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,440
multip applied and their GCF is 1 for

661
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,720
example 3 and 4 what's 3 * 4 12 their

662
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,440
LCM is 12 and their GCF is 1 7 * 8

663
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,039
what's 7 * 8 56 their LCM is 56 and

664
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,840
their GCF is 1 and again this is a rule

665
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
that will work 100% of the time no

666
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,440
matter what as long as the two numbers

667
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
are one

668
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,760
apart so I can give another example like

669
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,600
five and six over

670
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,279
here uh 5 * 6 30 and so our LCM is 30

671
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,760
and our GCF is

672
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,080
1 so that's basically how that works uh

673
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,720
and so that's one of the patterns now

674
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,639
let's see another pattern and you might

675
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:13,320
have really not seen this because I

676
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,480
haven't shown you an example of this yet

677
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,039
however now I'm going to erase a few of

678
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,919
these uh till there I

679
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,320
guess and so this pattern is really

680
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,120
interesting

681
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,200
so you're really going to like this

682
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,120
one okay watch this if I have number one

683
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,159
as like seven and 11 like the earlier uh

684
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,480
one that I was giving you it's LCM will

685
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,159
be 77 and its GCF will be

686
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,080
one but you wait you must be thinking H

687
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,399
these aren't one

688
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,039
apart like what's happening well I'm

689
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,960
going to give you a few more examples

690
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,360
maybe you'll find out for three and

691
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,000
seven Guess 35 you're

692
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,200
right all right

693
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,480
sorry I made a

694
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,040
mistake I I made a mistake

695
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,879
anyway forgot to do that and it's

696
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,760
actually 21 but it's GCF will always be

697
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,679
one and I can guarantee to you that the

698
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,159
next one will also be one and you'll see

699
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,560
how I thought that in just a minute and

700
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,879
I I don't even know these two numbers

701
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,879
yet and I know that they're it's going

702
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,200
to be one so I'm just going to think and

703
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,800
so five and

704
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,839
seven okay so it's LCM would be

705
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,119
35 now I want you to guess what the

706
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,159
pattern

707
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,000
is the pattern is that if the number if

708
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,960
number one and number two is

709
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,399
prime then the LCM will always be their

710
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,480
multiplication and their GCM will be one

711
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,079
that's how simple that is same thing for

712
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,960
this because three and seven are

713
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,119
prime uh 3 * 7 21 21 and 1 for the LCM

714
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:09,960
and

715
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,400
GCF 5 and 7even Prime 5 and 5 * 7 35 35

716
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,200
for the LCM one for the

717
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,760
GCF that's how that actually

718
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,760
works so those are the patterns that uh

719
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,520
we could assern from these uh little uh

720
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,400
numbers and LC M and I really hope that

721
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,560
answers your question

722
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,440
Madison cuz uh that was pretty much I

723
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,280
guess uh it for this video uh and wait

724
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,680
just one more thing for I forgot to show

725
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,880
one last pattern to you let's just uh do

726
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,480
this number one number

727
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,640
two LCM

728
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,560
GCM so the last pattern is let's just

729
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,119
say we

730
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,960
have 4 and

731
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,760
20 and also 6 and

732
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,440
24 I can immediately guess

733
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,720
these if you can't guess why I don't

734
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,599
blame you it's a pretty hard pattern to

735
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,560
find you do realize that it's basically

736
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,280
just a mirrored reflection of the number

737
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,520
one and number two but you don't

738
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,960
understand why yet let me explain

739
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,240
if the bigger

740
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,880
number is a multiple of the smaller

741
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,560
number then the LCM will be equal to the

742
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,720
bigger number and the GCF will be equal

743
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,640
to the smaller number that's just how it

744
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,880
works so for example 4 and 20 20 is a

745
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,079
multiple of

746
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,800
four so then our LCM will be the bigger

747
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,200
number which is 20 and our GCF will be

748
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,640
the smaller number which is four and

749
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,560
that's how that rule works that is the

750
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,400
last really last rule so I guess that's

751
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,560
pretty much it for this video uh and

752
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,200
yeah uh now I'm going to say my outro as

753
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,040
always however if you sorry about that

754
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,920
that actually hurt

755
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,800
anyway anyway there is a bit of a longer

756
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,760
example at the end of this video so if

757
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
you want to stick around please do uh

758
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,319
but as always for the people that don't

759
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:23,960
want to stay around I'm just going to sa

760
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,000
my outo so yeah subscribe to my channel

761
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,200
if you're new like the video if you

762
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,079
liked it comment down if you have any

763
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,880
questions or any suggestions for any

764
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,599
apps uh and that's going to be it uh

765
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,240
goodbye to everyone who doesn't watch

766
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,160
the doesn't want to watch the longer

767
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,599
version uh but hello to everyone who's

768
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:43,680
joining in for the longer version so uh

769
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,240
let's try our best to find the LCM and

770
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,119
GCF for two numbers pretty huge numbers

771
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,800
like uh 24 and

772
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,599
64 okay now how would we go about doing

773
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,280
this we're going to do is we're going to

774
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,520
use the same method as always uh which

775
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,240
is basically just Factor these down use

776
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,160
multiplication it's going to be a little

777
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,160
hard uh to do because there's so many uh

778
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,680
factors but again this is not a really

779
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,079
uh what you call it a realistic example

780
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,800
you wouldn't ever have to do this you

781
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,280
would usually use a calculator or

782
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,480
something uh but just in case who ever

783
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,160
posed with this question uh it probably

784
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,359
won't even fit on a few pieces of paper

785
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,520
but I'll show it to you anyway so for 24

786
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,680
what we do is uh 2 * 12 is

787
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,599
24 uh then 2 * 6 is

788
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,359
12 and then 2 * 3 is 6 so we have

789
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,800
successfully Prime factorized 24 for 64

790
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,720
however it's a bit different 2 32

791
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,480
because 2 * 32 is equal to

792
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,520
64 then 2 and 16 uh because that's what

793
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,720
that's equal to uh 2 * 16 is 32

794
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,400
then uh to get 16 we do two and

795
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,280
eight then to get eight we do two and

796
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,720
four and to get four we do two and

797
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,960
two now what we need to do is we need to

798
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,640
write down our multiplication uh

799
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,000
question uh and then just solve it how

800
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
simple it is so what I'm going to do is

801
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,520
I'm going to come over here 1 2 3 4 5

802
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,839
six there's six twos in 64 so I'm going

803
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:32,480
to say 64 is equal to 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

804
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,440
* 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 okay so there's six uh

805
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,760
twos in

806
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,720
64 anyway now 24 I say

807
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:50,359
24 1 2 3 two so I'm going to say 1 2 3

808
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:54,680
then times a box times a box Time a box

809
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,920
Time a three

810
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,240
so now we have to find our LCM and we're

811
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,520
going to do that by multiplication as

812
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,359
always so then LCM is going to be equal

813
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:16,119
to 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 *

814
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:19,880
3 now again you could just go 2 * 2 is 4

815
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,079
then 8 then 16 then 32 then 64 then 192

816
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,079
but that's boring and plus if you didn't

817
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,920
already already know the answer to this

818
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,079
question you wouldn't want to go through

819
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,000
this entire thing and also if this were

820
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,160
much bigger for example like 10 more

821
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,560
twos you wouldn't keep on doing that so

822
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,960
I broke it down into multiple little

823
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,920
sections which I like to call a

824
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,920
multiplication tree so then we just take

825
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,640
three parts of this question 2 * 2 2 * 2

826
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,160
2 * 2 so the answers to these will be

827
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,160
four

828
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,079
now what we do is we find the answer to

829
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,800
these two what's 4 * 4 16

830
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,680
obviously okay then we bring the four

831
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,839
down uh down

832
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,800
here we have to find 16 * 4 so I bring

833
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,960
that down to

834
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,119
16 * 2 * 2 same thing it's easier to

835
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:25,880
solve too so 16 * 2 32 * 2 64 so then

836
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,240
our answer here is 64

837
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:33,000
four then finally what we do we bring

838
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,599
down our three over here so 64 * 3 which

839
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,920
sometimes You' need a calculator for

840
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,960
unless you're really good at

841
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,240
multiplication mentally uh but I know

842
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,680
that the answer here would be

843
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,839
192 so our LCM in this case for 24 and

844
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,040
64 would

845
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,720
be92 now if you wanted to find the GCF

846
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,760
however what you would do

847
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,640
is again you would take the common ones

848
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,680
and just to do this easier I'm going to

849
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,680
make another box so there's three twos

850
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,319
that are common so I'm going to say the

851
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,160
GCF is equal to 2 * 2 * 2 there's only

852
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,960
three numbers common so 2 * 2 4 * 2 8 so

853
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,880
our GCF is equal to

854
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,720
8 and our LCM is 192 for 24 and

855
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,079
64 so that's how it's solve

856
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,319
that and yeah that was pretty much it
