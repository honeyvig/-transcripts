and welcome back to Simply learns
YouTube channel I am kaushal and today
we'll explore what web hooks are how
they work and how they can be
implemented to enhance communication
between web applications but before we
begin if you enjoy watching these videos
and find them interesting then subscribe
to our YouTube channel because we bring

any updates from Simply learn so without
any further delay let's get started with
what webhooks are
web hooks are a way for web applications
to communicate with each other in real
time
they are event driven HTTP callbacks
meaning that when a specific event
occurs in one application it triggers a
request to a predefined URL in another
application
now that we know what web books are
let's see a real life example of how a
web hook works
imagine you run an online store and want
to know whenever a new order is placed
so you can process it quickly so here's
how it order end payment the customer
selects a T-shirt and pays using their
credit card on your online store
your online store sets up a listener
called a web hook to listen for updates
from the payment system
payment process the payment system
process is the payment and sees that
it's successful web triggered the
payment system sends a message like a
text to your online store's Web book
saying payment for t-shirt successful
online store reacts your online stores
webhook gets this message and knows the
payment was successful user notified the
webhook then sends a message to the
customer like an email saying thanks for
buying the T-shirt your payment was
successful
customer receives notification the
customer checks their email and sees the
message telling them their payment went
through and the order is confirmed
in simple terms a webhook is like a
messenger that keeps your online store
updated about important events like a
successful payment when these events
happen the web hook tells your store to
take action like sending a thank you
message to the customer this helps keep
both you and your customers in the loop
without anyone needing to check things
manually
so let's explore some of the advantages
of a webhook
the first one is real-time updates
webworks provide real-time communication
allowing applications to react
immediately to events without the need
for constant polling the second is
efficiency unlike traditional polling
methods where applications repeatedly
request data even if there are no
updates webbooks only send data when an
event occurs reducing unnecessary
traffic automation with webhooks
developers can automate processes and
workflows improving overall efficiency
and reducing manual intervention
Integrations webworks enable seamless
Integrations between different
applications and services making it
easier to build powerful interconnected
systems before moving ahead if you want

implementing webhooks involves two
primary roles the sender and the
receiver so let's see how developers can
integrate webhooks into their
applications send implementation in the
sender application developers need to
identify the events they want to trigger
webhooks for and set up the HTTP post
request containing relevant data to the
web URL receiver implementation on the
receiver side developers need to
configure an endpoint to listen for
incoming webhook requests when data
arrives the receiver application
processes it and initiates the required
actions
Securities of utmost importance while
dealing with webhooks to ensure safe
communication between applications
developers can take following measures
the first is use https always use https
for webhook URLs to encrypt data during
transmission and prevent eavesdropping
Authentication
Implement authentication mechanisms such
as API keys or oauth to verify the
identity of both the sender and the
receiver
payload validation
validate incoming webhook payloads to
ensure that they come from a trusted
source and contain the expected data and
that concludes a detailed explanation of
web hooks they are powerful tools that
facilitate real-time communication and
seamless Integrations between web
applications by understanding how they
work and ensuring their security
developers can leverage web hooks to
create more efficient and connected
systems well that's a wrap on webhooks
