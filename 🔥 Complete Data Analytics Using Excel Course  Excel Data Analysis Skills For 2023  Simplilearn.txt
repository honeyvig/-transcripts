without any further Ado let's begin over
to our tutors Microsoft Excel is an
application that is used for recording
analyzing and visualizing data it is in
the form of a
spreadsheet let's have a look at few of
the functions and formulas used in Excel
and before we do that we can also
quickly take a small tour to understand
how to work with Excel now to do that
what we can do is we can type in in our
search say for example Excel and just
select your Excel app which is installed
and here you see you have lot of options
which says take take a tour drop- down
list get started with formulas make your
pivote table going forward with pie
charts and much more so we can click on
this one which says take a tour and that
basically pops up a window which says
welcome to Excel and if you have always
wanted to be better at Excel you have
this which can help you so let's click
on Create and that takes us to the store
window now that says in instructions for
screen readers which basically talks
about 10 different steps in which we can
learn Excel and using the spreadsheet
app so there are more than 11 sheets
which we see here at the bottom end and
each one gives us a simple example which
we can work on so for example if I click
on ADD now that takes me to this page
which says how do we add numbers now you
might be provided data which we can
upload by loading a file from our
machine or getting data from a web
Source or even connecting to a database
so there are various options which we
will see in some time so here we have an
option which is called Data you can
click on this one and this basically
has options where you can use existing
connections if you have created some you
can always click on from other sources
and you can get your data from SQL
Server from analysis services from o
data data feed you can get in from XML
from data connection Wizard or also from
Microsoft query you can be running in
different queries here which shows up in
the option which says new query there
are connections which you can use and
that basically will display all the
connections for this particular workbook
which we do not have as of now but we
can create them but let's look at simple
examples now you can follow these
instructions here which says basically
adding up the numbers and that could be
easily done by just placing your cursor
here and what you could do is either you
can type in the formula that is from
which row to which row you would want to
add the data so for example I could just
do a sum here and that shows up all the
different functions which are available
then we can open up a parenthesis and we
can say I would be interested in
totaling the amount
from column D and I would select for
example D4 so I could be doing this and
then I could say D4 onwards till
D7 so that's the data which I'm
interested in you can close your
parenthesis and hit enter and that gives
you the total there is also a shortcut
for for this which you can always do is
we can first delete this and you can
just place your cursor here and just use
your alt and equals that automatically
selects the numericals which we can
anytime expand or basically collapse so
I will basically select this which says
this function needs two numbers which is
number one and number two and then you
can hit on enter and that gives you the
total so similarly we can be getting in
the data here by selecting all the
fields so here it also says that you can
use a shortcut now what we can also do
is we can add numbers over 50 by
selecting the yellow cell here and then
giving a condition such as so I can
basically use something like some if and
then open a parenthesis I can select I
would be interested in this row and then
I can even drag and drop till here so
that tells me d11 to D15 you can then
put in a comma here and you can give
your condition say for example we would
say I would be interested in numbers
only above 50 and we can select this
close your codes and then just close
your parenthesis and that's your formula
so you can do this and that basic
basically gives me the total is 100 now
similarly we could do that for the
amount here I could select this now
there is also an option I can click on
home and I can go for something like
Auto sum so that's one more way of doing
it which anyway says sum is alt plus
equals so it automatically adds up your
values and I can try doing a auto sum
that automatically selects my rows and
then I can get my total now now as per
this activity here it says try adding
another sum F Formula here but add
amounts that are less than 100 and the
result should be 160 so what we can do
is we can basically select all the
numbers which are lesser than 100 so the
way we did earlier here there can be
always a shortcut so you can always for
example if you would want to avoid
typing in the formula you can always
copy it from here and then just hit on
enter so you are back into this cell and
then I can basically go here and paste
the number and then as per the
requirement we are required to select
anything which is lesser than 100 so
what I could do is I could select here I
could say let's say G and then I can
change this value to g15 and that's one
more way now we see our selected rows
have been changed so I can hit on enter
and I can check what is the result so we
would be interested in looking for
numbers which are lesser than 100 so I
will have to also change this one to a
lesser sign and that basically gives me
the total which is 160 so that's how you
can simply add numbers you can use Auto
sum you can type in the formula you can
select the fields or you can just place
your cursor where you would be looking
for a sum and then you can just do a alt
equals and that basically populates the
sum now let's look at some easy options
of filling your cells or automatically
populating the values in your cells
within your Excel sheet now here we have
an option with it says 100 now we can
click on this and that basically says it
is making a sum of column C4 to D4 so if
I click on this one I can check that
this is row number four which shows up
here and I also know this is column C I
also have D so this equals is basically
giving me a sum of C4 to D4 now what we
can do is we can always place our cursor
here at the right corner and then we can
just drag and drop and this basically
gives me a total of all the numbers for
all different rows so this is one
shortcut which we can do to get the
total Excel will automatically give the
totals which we call as filling down now
what we can do is in the same way if we
would want to get the totals here we can
first check what is this 200 and this
tells me it is C11 to c14 total so it is
totaling the rows from C11 so column C
and 11th row till 14th row and that's
the sum now what I can also do is I can
similarly like above we can do a filling
right which basically means bringing
your cursor here and then just dragging
and dropping it all the way where you
would need the totals and this basically
gives me the total there is one more
quick way to check if this is right so
the easiest option would be to select
this cell now what I can also do is I
can just select all of these fields by
just highlighting and selecting all the
fields once it is selected press on crlr
and that gives you the total now if we
would be doing this stop down then I
could select all these rows for this
particular column and then I could do a
controll d so that's your filling down
and this one was filling right so this
is an easier option of doing a fill when
you would want to have the formula
applied to every row as it occurs in the
first row or the last row we could test
this by for example selecting these
fields I could delete them and I have
here which says 130 I could just place
my cursor here and I could drag it all
the way up and that should also do the
same magic which we were seeing from top
down so this is a simple way wherein you
can fill up your cells and you can also
automatically propagate or move your
computation to all the cells let's look
at the split option which basically
helps us in splitting the data when we
have some kind of pattern or when we
have some kind of D limitter in our data
in say one particular column and we
would want to derive the values out of
it so we can always use the splitting
option now the easiest option would be
so for example we have our email column
which has the email IDs and which we can
clearly see has a first name do last
name now I see that there is a last name
Smith filled up here first name is empty
so what I can also do is I can just type
in say Nancy here now that's the first
name I can again start typing the second
name and as soon as you do that you
would see a faded list of numbers and
that's your clue to hit enter and once
you do that you would see all the first
names have been filled in here if you
would want to maintain the case
sensitiveness you can just go ahead and
delete these and let's type in as it
occurs so let's say Nancy
as the first name go down to the next
cell and just type in Andy and there is
your grade list so just hit on enter and
that basically fills up your first name
what we can also do is we can just
select this particular field and either
we can type in control e which basically
fills up all the options now I can just
do a undo by typing in or clicking
control Z and that's basically gone what
I can also do is I can select a
particular field and then I can go into
home option and under home you have an
option here which says fill so you can
select this and then you can do a Flash
Fill which is what we are doing here so
click on Flash Fill and that
automatically fills up the values so in
this way you can work within your
spreadsheet and you can be filling up
the values where a d limiter by default
default is understood and we can split
the data now however sometimes you might
have some data which has a different
kind of delimiter and there is again a
smarter way of splitting your data so
you can always scroll down here and that
says splitting a column based on D
limiters so we have some values in the
data column and these values in each row
are separated by comma so select this
your data is already selected next to
columns The Limited comma is selected
and now click on next so it basically
says what is the destination let's
select this one and I can choose what
would you want to have so that shows me
this would be my data preview now I can
basically select this one I can say
finish and say okay and now if you see
our data has been placed in in the
columns appropriately so this is how you
can split your data based on a d limiter
and then organize your data in a better
way now there are some Advanced options
which we can learn later but this
basically tells about using a formula so
this is something if say if we have some
name in one cell and if you would want
to split it into first name your helper
column your middle name last name so
that can also be done using formula
and this basically tells how would you
extract characters from your left cell
and how would you place them in your
right cell so you can try this activity
which is a little more of advanced
option the benefit is that you can
always use this wherein if you do some
kind of transformation using your
formulas if your original data gets
updated then the split data will also
get updated and that's the benefit of
using formulas where you can place
values from one cell into multiple cells
based on execution of your details in
the
formulas how about using the transpose
option now you might have heard of
situations where you would want to
switch or turn your rows into columns
and your columns into rows and that's
where transposing comes into picture it
might be useful when you have your data
in your X and Y AIS or as I would say in
rows and columns and you would want to
switch your rows to become the columns
and columns to become your rows so what
we can do is the simplest way is you can
select all your values so here we
basically have six columns and I would
say two rows now I can select all of
these and then I can select an empty
field for example the one which is
highlighted here well you can always do
a control alt V that's a shortcut what
you can also do is once you have
selected all your Fields you can just
copy them so just do a contrl c and then
click on an empty cell and then what you
can do is you can do a special paste or
paste special so under your home you
have the paste option and here you can
go for pce special and once you do that
you need to select the transpose option
over here and click on okay and now you
will see that the columns and the rows
have been transposed so your row name
was item and that has become the column
heading you had row name as amount and
that has become the column heading and
all your values have been transposed in
this particular format now there is
another way of doing that and again
that's using your formulas so what you
can do is you can trans OS with a
formula also and that basically works
when you have similar kind of data so
this has six columns and basically two
rows so you can basically do this so you
can select this and earlier we were
doing a copy but now what we would want
to do is we would want to just look at
the row numbers which tells me it is c33
c34 and it starts with c and ends in
with your H column so what we can do is
we know that we have six columns and two
rows so transposing that would actually
give me two columns and six rows so what
we can do is we can select two columns
and six rows in our Excel sheet I can
then basically start typing in the
message or I can just go to the address
bar and here I can
say trans
suppose let's go for c33
h34 it basically selects my data and now
I can just do a control shift and enter
and now if you see all the values have
been populated now you can just place
your cursor in one of the cells but if
you see the address bar the formula
Remains the Same this is because this is
an array formula so we can read more
about an array formula here it's
basically something which performs
calculations on more than one cell in an
array and in the example here the array
is the original data that is c33 to h34
so your transpose is just changing the
horizontal orientation to the vertical
orientation so this is a very simple way
in which you can basically use the
excel's capability to transpose your
data and convert your rows into columns
and columns into rows apart from working
on additions subtractions filling up
your data sorting the data or basically
splitting your data transposing your
data one of the other requirements is
sorting and filtering your data now that
can be very handy when you're working on
huge data and you would want to sort it
in a particular order say ascending or
descending or might be based on a
particular field or if that field was or
if the cell was highlighted with a
particular color sorting the data so
let's look at how Excel can be used for
sorting and filtering examples are
pretty simple here so let's check that
so if we going to sort and filter and
say this is the data I have say for
example I would want to sort the values
in the department column alphabetically
so what I can do is I can select
Department column and I'm already in the
Home tab I can straight away go here
which says sort and filter I can then
say sort A to Z and that's basically
alphabetically sorting your department
column and once once I do this you would
see the data has been sorted but it's
not just this data we can just do a
control Zed and check what are the
values we have so here we have meat
which is beef and 90,000
110,000 the values then you have Bakery
which should ideally be the first row if
we sort it in an alphabetical order
which goes with Bakery as deserts you
have the values so we can check this
again so select department and then just
do a sort and filter and let's say sort
a to zed and if you see the data has
changed but it's not just in changing
your First Column but then it has taken
care of all the data however the data
has been sorted based on the department
column so you have Bakery which aligns
with deserts which has the values and
now we have all the data which has been
filtered now what we can also do is we
can sort December's amounts from largest
to smallest so what we can do is we can
basically click any sell in the December
column let's say
20,000 and then what I can do is I can
go into sort filter and then I can say
sort largest to smallest so if you see
Bakery breads is the row which has the
smallest data or might be you have deli
sandwiches so that one looks also
smaller so let's do a larger to smallest
and if I do this you would see the
values have been shifted now so it is no
more based on the department column
because now the data is being sorted
based on the the values in the December
column and you see Bakery which was
alphabetically the first one has become
second last so either you can sort the
data based on a department column which
goes based on the values these are all
string values or words so it sorts
alphabetically if you have numbers
mightbe you can give some values and you
can sort the data you could anytime do a
custom sort and you could basically
select if you would want to select the
data so I could do a custom sort and
then I could choose which is the column
which we would want to use for sorting
what is the Sorting needs to be done is
it cell values is it cell color font
color conditional formatting and then
you can also choose the order so that's
one more way to do that now if you
scroll down that also shows how you can
sort by date or a color so for example
if you would want to sort based on the
expense date so there are different
options so what I can do is I can select
this date field I can just do a right
click I can go into sort and then I can
choose I would want to sort oldest to
newest so since I selected the date
field it basically has sorted all the
data and it has taken the expense date
in into consideration now there are
these filters which you see on the row
headings we could have also used those
so I could have selected this and that
basically says or mentions which are the
dates I would be interested in looking
at I also have sort by color here I can
do a sort oldest to newest or newest to
oldest so I could also use these filters
which have been applied here now we have
the data which is in color so if I would
want to basically select the color
columns or color cells I could select
this I can basically do a right click
here and when I go into sort I could
choose put selected color or cell color
on the top and that basically will make
sure that my data is sorted and it has
also sorted that in a descending order
so in this way you can sort or basically
filter your data what we can also do we
can add filters so sometimes we can go
for formulas which we would want to use
what we can also do is we can basically
select the filter which has been applied
here now how does the filter come in
there so if I would select a particular
row I could select a particular row and
then I could decide if I would want to
just add a filter to this one and that's
how the filter has come in so we have
the filter what we can do is we can
basically click on this drop down and
then you have something like number
filters so we can always go here we can
basically choose one of these so we can
basically choose above average so I
could select this and then basically it
shows me the values we could also delete
the filter by clicking on this one and
we could say well I'm not interested in
this filter anymore so I could clear the
filter and that shows me all the values
or I could say that let's click on some
other field for example food I can go in
here I can go into number filters and
then I could say well I'm interested in
values which are below average above
average might be greater than and then I
can choose what is the value so for
example if we say I'm interested in food
which is greater than $25
I could give a value here I could say
okay and now I have applied the filter
similarly you can select this and then
you can just clear your filter and your
data is back so remember no data is lost
it is just hidden or basically based on
the filter not shown so that's good
enough for us and in this way you can
sort and filter the data so for more
details obviously in all these sheets
you have the link things which point to
more information on the web and you can
always refer to these so this is simple
way in which you can sort and filter any
amount of data which has been stored
within your Excel within a particular
sheet now that we have learned about add
fill split transpose sorting and
filtering it will also be good to learn
how to work with tables or basically
converting your data into a tabular
format and then doing some easy
computations so click on this tables
option here now here we see there is
some data which is in five columns and N
number of rows so I can basically select
this data and then what I can do is I
can insert choose the table option and
then it says my table as headers and
we'll be okay with that I'll say okay
and now if you see this is the table
create
it basically has different filters which
we have learned earlier how to use and
this is basically my table which is a
collection of cells which has some
special features so we can easily add
rows to this table we can add columns to
this table and we can even do some
calculations so for example here I can
click on this one I can basically enter
some field and then I can hit on enter
and we see see that this row has been
inserted wherein we can easily fill in
values for example I would say
chocolates I could give some value here
say
25,000 might be
35,000 and then basically I can given
some values here now what you can also
do is you can continue adding rows in
this way and say for example you would
want more columns so you you can select
this option here in the top bottom right
corner you can just drag it towards the
right and that basically has
automatically created columns for my
next months wherein I can feed in the
data so this is a simpler way wherein
you can keep adding more rows and
columns to your data if that has been
converted in a tabular format now let me
just do a controll zed that that
basically deletes the columns again
contrl Zed deletes the last row which we
added and I can stop here or I can even
remove my values by doing multiple
control Zed I'm removing my rows so this
is how I converted my data into a table
and then I can easily work on this what
I can also do is I can do some
calculations so what we can do we have a
table here we have a total field and
what we can do do is we can just select
one cell here now as we have learned
earlier we can do a alt and then equals
and that basically says what is this
doing so it says it is calculating the
sum of the last 3 months and if that's
what you would want to do just hit on
enter and it has automatically
calculated the totals for all your rows
for these three columns so so the sum
formula is getting filled up now I can
select any particular cell and I can
look in my address bar so it has already
given me the formula where it has
started calculating the sum from the
October column till the December column
and has given me the calculated values
of the columns what we can also do is we
can get total rows in the table now
that's a simpler option so what we can
do is we can select any cell in this
particular table and then we see that
there is a table tools design option
showing up here now I can select this
and then it says well let's get a total
row so let's select this and it
automatically populates the total here
and if you would want the average then
we could select this and from the
drop-down I can select what I'm
interested in so for example I would
want the average values and not the
total I could just select this and that
gives me the average of these values so
we can always do simpler computations
here by converting our data into table
format let's learn about one more
efficient way of working with the data
and that's using your drop- Downs so
let's see how drop downs work here now
say for example you have this data which
has the values in the food column and
department is empty and say for example
you would want to enter the values in
Department however you would want to
select that department should either
have produce or meat and bakery and
these are the only three options which
should be available for any user to fill
in the values how do we do that so we
can basically create a table by pressing
contr D so what I can do is under my
department here I can select one of the
cells and then I can do a control T that
basically converts this into a table I
can say okay and my table is created now
what I can do is once this part is done
we can select all the blank Fields here
where we would want this drop down to be
applicable now under your data tab you
can and go in and select data validation
and this has an option called Data
validation click on this which basically
says allow any value so here I will
select I would want to give a list of
values and then I can type in my values
here which I can say produce say for
example meat and then say Bakery now
these are the values so we can click on
okay and once we have done that we
basically have a drop down here next to
Apples which will only show us the
values which we can feed in under the
department column so I can go into every
cell and then I can basically choose
what is the department which handles
this and then basically I can select one
of these from the drop-down so this is
an easier option of creating your
drop-down and then feeding in the values
from from the set of values which you
have defined here on the right so this
is a simple example of using your drop-
Downs working with your tables working
with your sort and filter transpose
split filling up your data adding in
some data here and similarly you can use
Excel for more than one use case using
its inbuilt features to easily work with
your data let's see how we can import
data or bring in data into our Excel
from your local machine or from an
external web source so what we can do is
we can open up a blank Excel sheet and
say for example you have been provided a
text file or a CSV file and you would
want to import that data into your Excel
sheet that can be easily done so right
now I've opened an Excel sheet now I can
click on data and here I have an option
which says existing connections from
other data sources so or you can click
on connections if you have already
created some so we can click on from
other sources so this is one option
where you can connect to your different
data sources and you can get the data
from one of these what we can also do is
I can click on connections now it says
there is none I can click on ADD it says
will show the connections where
connection files on
network connection files on this
computer so I can say let's get some
files from this computer now if that
does not show up something so say browse
for more and that basically shows you
different options so let's basically
select a folder where I have some data
sets I'll click in here and this is
basically a folder where I have some
data sets now let me select this
particular file and I know it is a CSV
file so let's click on open now if you
would want to verify this you could have
gone and looked into the properties of
the file and it says it is a CSV file
which is what we are interested in so
I'll take this file I'll say open now
this basically shows me the text import
wizard option which says is the file
delimited I'll say yes yes click on next
so I will select comma as my delimiter I
can say text qualifier is none now this
is my data so my data preview is already
showing me the data is what is the data
in the CSV file you can click on next
and then you have an option which says
data format is General you can go for
date format you can go for advanced
options so I'll just say finish and
basically now this has been created here
so we basically have this and now I can
click
on close now once you have done that you
can click on existing connections it
shows me the data which we have here the
connection which we have created say
open and then it says do you want to
import this data or bring this data into
existing
worksheet you can also say add this to a
data model model if you're doing some
data modeling so click on okay and now
this data is automatically inserted in
my Excel file I can basically save
it
into this particular sheet now what we
can also do is we can also start a new
sheet and that does not have a data and
we can get some other data from web so
what I can do is I can go into my GitHub
and let's say I would be interested in
this CSV file so I can select this and
this is my GitHub path a path on web so
I can click on draw and that basically
gives me the raw path where this
particular file is now you can select
this copy this particular path and here
you can come back to your Excel sheet we
would be interested in getting the data
from web might be from a text file where
we will have to specify the D limiters
or let's go to web and here I can give
in the web path from where I would be
interested in getting the file let's
give the GitHub path which is publicly
available and then click on import now
once you click on import it tells me
there are two Fields data and value
these
are within double Cotes separated by
comma so first let's click on import now
once we do this it will basically get
the data from web and put in in here it
says existing worksheet so we had
already created a new worksheet so let's
click on okay and now you have the data
coming in but then this basically shows
me in one particular field so what we
can also do is we can just do a control
a that selects all my columns here and
that's my data so we can then
basically filter this out so we can say
text to columns it's a delimited file
click on next we can select comma and
let the text qualifier be Cotes it shows
me data preview click on next so you
have the general format it shows the
destination that's the column click on
finish and now your data has been split
and you have the data which you have
imported from web so this is the data
which is coming in from web this is the
data which came in from my local machine
and similarly we can even create
connection with an existing database so
I can basically click on connections if
I would want to do that so I have an
option called connection here and it
says where the selected connections are
used I can basically click on ADD I can
basically choose if I would want to get
the files from Network or from computer
like we did earlier I can click on
browse for more which should show me
different other options to create
connections say you would want to create
a new SQL Server Connection you can
connect to a new data source coming in
from different place you could basically
choose what kind of connection would you
want so these are all the different
options which we can go for and we can
basically connect to a database for
example if I have some database
and say for example access
database I can see if there are some
files with that particular database and
I can import it so similarly we can also
uh click in here which says new query
and that also gives you an option of
getting the data from your files from
all these folders from databases so you
can basically click here and then you
can import data from a mySQL database
provided
that is set up on your local machine or
on a particular server you can go from
cloud you can get it from online
services you can get it from other
sources which says from web from your
Hadoop file system from active directory
from a blank query and you can even
combine queries wherein you can run a
power query editor you can get the data
from different sources and then you can
bring it into your Excel so so in this
way you can get your data from different
sources into your Excel into your
spreadsheet and then you can continue
working on those data sets we have uh
already learned some basic operations
which you can do in Excel and let's
Implement our knowledge by working on
this particular data which is coming in
from housing data set now here if we see
some fields we have agent date listed
area list price and this is basically
the data which has been sorted in newest
to oldest order of date listed so how do
we arrive at this so what I can do is I
can just click on data listed and then I
can either go in here I can select sort
I can get into custom sort and then I
can choose the column based on which I
would want to sort the data so I would
look for the newest data to the oldest
data that means that would be in a
descending order of dates or you could
say the oldest date or the earliest
month will be towards the lower side of
your sheet so here we can select date
listed now I can say let it sort based
on Cell values and the order what we
have here so we have newest to oldest so
let's select this I can say okay and now
if you see the date has been sorted so
we have your 10 18 2007 on the top so
that seems to be the latest date and as
we go down we will see an earlier month
hour and earlier month than that in this
date listed so we have sorted our data
into newest to oldest order and that's
based on your date column so the result
shows up here now what we can also do is
we can have different questions which we
would want to answer so for example I
would want to sort the data in ascending
order of area and descending order of
agent name how do we do that so let's
look into this so this is here I already
have the result here and how did I get
this so I'm looking for ascending order
of area and descending order of agent
name so we can can start with any
particular column that does not matter
so for example if I look into this Excel
sheet I have my agent name select this
which we want in a descending order so
we could either do a sort and then go
for descending sort Z2 a we could also
use the filter option here on the top
right and we could do it or I could just
say sort Z2 a and then it has a arranged
the data based on the agent column being
in descending order now I can go into
area and then I can again do a sort and
I wanted my area column to be used for
sorting the data ascending to descending
and that basically not only changes the
order of this particular column but for
my complete data so let's do that and
now if you see we have the data which
has been sorted so so we can see how
many values we have here and the area
values which we see and this is how you
get your result so I'll just do a contrl
zed and again and I'm back to my
original data and this is the sorted
result which we are seeing at similarly
we can answer other questions for
example sort the data according to the
following order of area that is we are
saying count T set Central and then your
county so we can basically choose in
which particular way we would want to do
it so it is County Central and then
again County so if I look into my sheet
three so here I basically have my data
which is having some South County then
you have your Central and then you have
your North County so we would want to
sort the data to solve our problem which
is according according to the following
order so first we go for area then we go
for South County Central and North
County so what we can do is we can
basically have area field selected and I
would want to sort this particular data
so I have South County Central and North
County so I can basically go for custom
sort and then I can choose which is the
value or column which I'm interested in
let's go for area we will go for
something like cell values well you can
also try to explore conditional
formatting icon if this is what you
would want to use or we can basically go
for just sell values and here we can say
if I would be interested in first
getting my values for South County so
for example I can say custom list and
then I can basically give the new list
here so I can say
s dot
County and then I would want Central and
then I would want North County so let's
select
this as it exists we can basically say
add and that's basically the order which
we want say okay and then then say okay
here and now what we would want is we
would want our data so we can compare
that with the values which we see here
it starts with Kelly you have in the
12th row something like Lang and that's
what we are doing so we can basically
arrange the data in a particular order
by choosing a custom list and then
sorting your data so that's one more
simpler task what we have done where we
have sorted the data in the order where
under our area column we first wanted
South County then we wanted Central data
and then we wanted North County so this
is how you can do it now let's look into
one more problem so it says find all the
houses in the central area and we would
want to basically apply a regular filter
let's let's see how do we do that so we
can click on this and here we have the
data so the problem statement is we
would want to find all the houses in
Central Area now how do we do that we
can do a sorting but we would want to
use the filter which you see here is
implemented so how do you do it so you
can select this area and say for example
I would want to apply filter I can just
go in here and I can say let's get a
filter on my first row and now I I have
filters applied so we are interested in
looking into the Central Area houses
let's go in here it says all these
fields are selected that means it shows
everything wherein your area has all
these values let's unselect this and
then I will only be interested in the
central so let's say okay and then say
okay so now you see the area filter has
been applied and we are looking at the
the central column so what we have done
is we have applied a Syle filter and we
are looking at our data at any point of
time if you do not want the
filter then what I can do is I can
select this and I can say well I'm
interested in all the data so I could do
this or you can clear the filters from
area and you get your data back so
that's in one way you can filter out
your data so let's look at an example of
sort and filter where we might have to
filter the data based on two columns or
multiple columns with different kind of
values where it could be and and or
condition now say for example this is
the data I have and this is the question
which we need to answer such as find the
list of all houses in the central region
with pool and South County without pool
now if it was a simple filter based on
on one cell I could have just selected
my header row I could have then applied
the
filter and once I have the filter I can
look in area where I have three regions
so I'm only interested in Central and
South County so I can get rid of North
County and that's fine but then we have
two different conditions here so we need
the data in central region to have the
value for pool being true and for South
County the value has to be without pool
now how do we do that so what we can do
is we can first create a copy of these
headers here so let me do that now the
area has to be South County so basically
I can either just select this and I can
choose this value
and then I can select this and then I
can choose Central so that's the
criteria which I have and the pool value
has to be so central region should be
with pool so then this one basically has
to be
true and this one has to be basically
false so south county is without pool so
let's select one of the values here and
this is my criteria now to get my result
uh we can always place your cursor here
and you can check this is M column and
eth row okay so we would want the result
here so let's go ahead and now click on
data and then in filter you have an
option called Advanced and here what I
can do is I can say I would want to
filter the list in the place but that's
not what I would want to do so I'll say
copy to another location and here if you
see the list range will tell me that
this is the data so A1 to J 126 so a to
J column selected and all the rows
criteria range is basically based on
what I've given here so that is
M from 1 to V which is three so I'm
selecting these columns and then I'm
saying all the way whatever criteria
given and copy to I'm saying
M8 to V8 so that basically will give me
my filtered result so you could
basically just say okay and now I have
my data which has been filtered and I
have my area which is South County that
is without Pool Central with pool again
South County without pool and then if
you look at your Central value that's
pool so this is an advanced filter which
we have applied where simply we have
filtered the databased on two columns
and then we have our result so in this
way you can have your customized filter
applied on two different columns and get
your data which can be either replacing
the existing content or in the same
sheet in different set of columns and
rows you can have your result let's look
at one more example of filtering where
you are trying to filter the data based
on a and condition condition being met
in two different columns and then you
would want to filter out the data for
only specific columns so the situation
is the agents with a house in North
County that should be County area having
two and a single type family so we are
talking about two bedrooms and we would
basically have a single type family and
here the criteria is that we would want
to only populate these columns which is
Agent area bedroom and type now what you
can do is as I explained earlier that
you can get your result in the same
sheet in a different location so here I
have created these headers which says
agent area bedrooms and type now this is
basically a copy of all the columns what
we have here agent data listed area list
price bedrooms bath square feet and so
on so you can basically create a copy of
the headers here and this is where we
will give our Advanced criteria to
filter the data so the conditions which
need to be met is we need to look at
North County so for example here in area
I can basically go ahead and select one
of the values North County now the
criteria is having two bedrooms only so
let's say bedrooms and let's say the
value should be two and then basically
I'm saying a single type family so when
you would want the single type family so
here under type I can give the criteria
single type so this is my and condition
so we are saying North County area
having two bedrooms and the type is
single family now this is the criteria
which basically means if I select this
this one tells me that this is M1 row
onwards till V 2 so this is what we have
and we would want to filter based on
this so let's go ahead and then go for
data filter Advanced and here in
advanced it says filter the list in
place now that's not what we would want
to do so I'll say copy to another the
location this basically selects the list
range so which is telling me
A1 to J 126 so that's
the columns and rows selected criteria
range is based on M1 V2 which we have
given here and copy to I would say for
example from M7 2 p7 now this is the
area where I would this is the place
where I want the result
let's say okay and now I get my data
which is based on the question which has
been asked that you would want the
agents with a house in North County area
having two bedrooms and single type
family so in this way you can basically
do Advanced filtering get your data and
get it stored in the sheet anywhere at a
different location well I could have
also done filtering in place and that
would have replaced the
data which we have but that's not what
we want we would want the filtered
result in a different place so this is
how you can do some Advanced filtering
we can also use Excel to filter out the
data in one particular column which
might be conditional or say using some
numerical filters now here say for
example the problem statement is that
you would want to display all the houses
whose list price is between
45,000 to
600,000 or say for example we would want
to filter out the data to something else
say for example let's say I have I would
want to filter out the data between
300,000 and 400,000 so we can basically
update this say for example I'm saying
I'm interested in
300,000 to
400,000 and that's the criteria to
filter out the data now there are two
different ways or there are two easier
ways to do it one is I would want to
look at the list price so I can select
this I can go ahead and to a filter here
and in the list price now this is where
we would want to do the filtering so
it's pretty easy you can click on this
one and then you can go into number
filters and you can choose between now
that's one easier way of doing it so I
could basically select this I could say
I'm looking for Value which is greater
than or equal to
300,000 and then is less than or equal
to
400,000 so if I just do this I have
applied my filter and I have my data
which is filtered based on my criteria
right so that's one easy iier way of
doing it or let me do a controll
z now let the filter be there which you
can anyways use but what we can also do
is as we have seen earlier methods so
get a set or get your column headers
here and then you are giving two columns
here now the only difference
between my this set of columns which I
have 1 2 3 4 and then you have 7 and 10
columns and if you see here we have four
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 right so whenever you
want a and condition you will basically
add the columns where I can give add
condition if it is the same column if it
was a different column then it would be
same number of columns but and
conditions will lie in the same line and
or condition would lie in a different
line now here I can give this value so
I'm looking for listed price being
between 300,000 so I'm saying it should
be greater than or equal to
300,000 and then I can say less than or
equal to 400,000 now that's my criteria
and then I need my result here which is
in
M7 so what I can do is once I have given
my criteria which I'll be using to
filter I can get into Data I can get
into advanced and then I can say copy to
another location so it is selecting my
a12 J
126 criteria range is based on M1 to
W2 and then I would want my result from
this particular column so let's say okay
and now you have your data filtered out
in a different location in the sheet
which has been filtered based on your
and condition so you can filter out the
data in this way or you could just apply
a filter on a column and give the
conditions now let's solve one more
interesting problem and here we would
want to use Excel where we would have an
and and an or condition so say for
example this is the data given to you
and the question is that you would want
to find all the house is in North County
again that's a spelling mistake but then
they are North County area with a list
price greater than
300,000 and having three or four
bedrooms so the bedroom has conditional
so it has R three and four and then
basically you have list price which is
greater than 300,000 now I could have
obviously selected The Columns and then
basically gone on for a filter so I can
just do a filtering here and then I'm
looking for list price being greater
than 300,000 so which we can always give
a number filter and I can say greater
than and then I can say greater than or
equal so I can say greater than and then
I can give 3,3
300,000 and that's basically the filter
which we would want and here I would
want to select the bedrooms which should
be just either three or four so if for
example I go in here and I unselect this
and then I say three and four right so I
am getting my data which is greater than
300,000 and it should have the bed ring
values which will be either three or
four selected now that's one way of
doing it let's do a contrl zed and get
it back to as we were or you can even
just say clear filter so you get your
data back as it was so what we can do is
we can here give the criteria so for
example I have my list price now this is
what I would want as a condition so
let's say greater than
300,000 300,000 and bedrooms should be
three
and then I can say greater than
300,000 and then I can say four so this
one basically gives me a situation where
your list price has to be greater than
300,000 and bedroom should be either
three or four so we have given our
filtering criteria now to get the result
what we can do is we can go into Data we
can go into advanced and we can say copy
to another location so our list range is
selected which is columns a to J row
number 1 to 126 your criteria range is
given in M1 to V3 where we have
specified and we are saying the result
would be in M7 to V7 so if I do this now
I have got the same data which we were
seeing earlier and here the bedroom
values are three or 4 and basically the
list price is greater than 300,000 so
this is a simp simp way in which you can
create your filters and all this
Advanced filtering what we are seeing it
will be saved with your sheet you can
always go back and change this value or
you could do filtering where one person
has to look into the filter to see what
values have been
selected now that we have looked into
some operations which we can perform in
Excel using filter filter or sorting the
data creating your tables let's also
quickly look at functions and formulas
which can be used for doing some easy
calculations or computations now Excel
can be used in different kind of data
analysis so for example you have
different inbuilt functions which can be
used and we can always check for a
particular function so for example if I
had if I wanted to look at a particular
function I could just type in here
something for example is and then it
shows me all the possible functions and
you can always have a look at the detail
of the function for example you have is
even which will return true if the
number is even if we would say is
logical so I could search for is logical
and that tells me whether a value is
logical value true or false and returns
your value true and false now we can
obviously say subtotal so you can search
for any of these useful functions and
that tells me what this function can be
used for so returns a subtotal in a list
or a database you have many other such
functions such as integer sum average
you may be interested in working on
truncating some data getting that
absolute value getting the square root
basically getting a count or getting a
max value you can look for any
particular functions within your Excel
sheet now you also have other functions
such as now or time for example let's
look at Now function so I can search
for now and here it is so this is
Returns the current date and time
formatted as a date and time so this is
the function which we would want to use
and if I just give the function it tells
me what is the current time let's first
look at the description of time here so
say for example I would want time it
says converts hours minutes and seconds
given as numbers to an Excel serial
number formatted with a time format so
for example if I would say 2 hours and
then 10 30 minutes and 30 seconds and if
I do this it has basically converted
this into your time format so you can
always use different inbuilt functions
for your work now we will also look at
some Advanced functions like some if or
some ifs you have count if and count fs
and you can be working on various
functionalities of excel to easily help
you into doing some calculations
computations working with your data
working with your different cell values
so let's look at some example of using
functions like sum or Su if so for that
let's go to this sheet and here we have
some data now I have already applied a
filter which can allow me to filter out
the data so it says find the total units
that were sold in the East re reg now we
know that in region we have
east and I have multiple regions I could
basically be saying unselect all and
select only East and say okay and that
basically gives me the units which were
sold and if I place my cursor here and
then if I did a auto sum so it would
basically give me the function which is
being used so something like subtotal
and it is basically working on your rows
which is E2 to
e44 and here we can just do this so that
gives me the total but this is this is
fine you could do that but it would be
good if we know how do we use a function
like Su if to do that so here I'm seeing
this is the subtotal where I'm looking
at the values and basically what I have
done is I have filtered out the region
and then basically I'm getting a count
but this does not give me clearly how a
sum was calculated from all the values
which were listed what we can also do is
let's do a controll zed and let's get it
back so now we have our data and we
would want to get the total units that
were sold in the east region so what I
can do is I can start typing in my
formula and for that I'll use an inbuilt
function so for example I would be
interested in going for Su if now it
says Su if adds the cells specified by a
given condition or criteria when you
talk about some ifs this is when you
could give set of conditions or multiple
criteria so let's look at some if let's
do this now obviously this gives me an
error because the
formula is not right so we have to
basically come in here and let's start
with some if now when I say some if it
shows me there is a function with some
if which we would want to use and here
once I open up the bracket it tells me
okay what is the range of data which you
are interested in so I'm interested in
all the units that were sold in the east
region so we are interested in the
region which is here so I can basically
be selecting this and this tells me you
are interested in the data here so let's
not take the header value so let's say
B2 and then we can go all the way to the
end so we can basically select this
way that's the data we have select this
and hit enter so now here it has
selected B2 to B4 but we need to
basically now give the criteria so the
criteria is either a value or you can
point it to a cell which has that
particular value so as per our problem
statement we are looking for the units
which are sold in east region so I can
select the value East here and then my
sum if needs the range on which you want
to calculate a sum so let's select this
and now we are interested in finding out
the sum of units so that's basically
this column e column so I can basically
type in instead of selecting so I can
say e and I'm interested in E2 to e 44
so that basically selects the area or
all the values and now let's do this so
that basically gives me the sum is
691 right now this is the criteria where
I have pointed it to a cell and whatever
value that cell has well I could have
done something like this so I could have
selected East giving the value and then
doing it it still does the same thing
and in this way you have more clarity
that you are using some if you are
filtering the data so you have given the
rows you you are given the criteria and
then you have given the range on which
you would want to sum up the values now
similarly if the question was what was
the total revenue generated from
binder now we would want to find out
what is the total revenue generated from
binder that means my filtering criteria
will be
binder and then I want to find out the
total revenue generated so we have the
revenue generated field also here and we
have we don't have any region to be
filtered we are just looking for binder
so let's again start doing the same
thing so we can go for some if we can
open the bracket now it needs the range
so we are interested in revenue
generated now that's the summation we
want and we would want to get the range
of data so here we can basically
select uh d 2 2 D
44 so that's the data selected now I
would want to give the filtering
criteria so let's say binder and then we
need to give the range on which the sum
needs to be calculated so that's my
Revenue column so that's G so I can say
G 2 2 G
44 and that basically selects the column
and then you get your sum so it tells me
what is the total revenue generated from
binder now I could be doing this for
other things also so say for example if
you would want to filter out something
else you could basically just drag and
drop here and then I could come here and
change this to say instead of binder I
would be interested in
say
pencil if that's the criteria you are
interested in remember to change this so
that you take all the
values and here we will
change it to select the relevant rows
and then this is the data I'm getting so
I know that this is the revenue
generated from from pencil this is the
revenue generated from binder now this
is a simple use case where we are using
some if what if we would want to use
some ifs so some ifs let's have a look
at how we get to some ifs so some ifs is
where you would want to work
on doing some calculation but then you
would
want multiple criterias to be met so
let's see how we get this so here what I
can do is let's work on this problem
statement which says what is the total
revenue generated from central
region where the item is a pencil so
that's something which I would want to
check now when we are answering this
question we can also look at the order
in which things have been asked in the
question so it says what is the total
revenue generated from central region so
we need the total revenue generated we
know there is a revenue column we are
interested in getting the total revenue
generated we are saying the filtering
criteria is central region and we say in
that we would be interested only in the
item if it is pencil how do I do it so I
can use sufs where you can pass in
multiple criteria so so let's start with
some
ifs and when I start with some ifs let's
open up the bracket so it says sum range
it says criteria range then it gives one
criteria and you can give in any number
of criterias so for example we are
interested in total revenue generated
now that's my G column so let's follow
in the same order so let's say
G2 so that's my first value and then I
know that there are 44 rows here so I
can say G 44 and you can obviously check
if that has selected all the rows now
that's my total revenue generated so I
would want the total revenue generated
so I'm saying setting this sum
range then I need to give the criteria
range so it says from central region so
central region comes into column two
that's B so let's say B2 to
B44 so that's my criteria range then you
have to give your criteria but we need
to filter out the region being Central
so let's select this now either I could
point to a value in the cell or I can
just give the exact value here we can
also give a wild card or matching
pattern pattern so that also works now
this one is fine we are now also
interested in finding the total revenue
generated when the region is Central and
the item is pencil how do we do that so
for item we know the columns the column
is D2 so let's select D2 to
d44 so that basically selects all the
rows in the D column and we need to give
the filtering criteria so let's do a
comma and then just given our value so
let's say pencil and then let's close
your bracket and that basically gives
you the result so we need to just follow
the order of our question which says
what is the total revenue generated so
we are looking at the revenue column we
are selecting all the
rows then it says from the central
region so we need to select the region
column and give the filtering criteria
as Central or point to a cell which
contains that value and then it says we
would be interested only in item being
pencil so then you select the column
which has all the items and provide you
a filtering criteria that is pencil so
that's your easy calculation of using Su
if which we compare with some if here so
Su if here was just
having your
criteria so basically you are selecting
your rows giving your filtering criteria
and then your sum range in some ifs we
are giving multiple condition now same
thing can be done here it says how many
units were sold by sales representative
John's or Jones where the cost of each
item was greater than four so how many
units were sold by sales
representative so when we talk about how
many units that's your e column so let's
start with that so let's say some ifs I
would be interested in E
column then let's give the range so it
says Su range so those are the number of
units on which we would want to find the
sum then it says unit need to give the
criteria range so we say sales
representative where the name is Jones
so sales representative is in sales rep
column C so let's say C2 to
c44 now then we need to give our
filtering criteria so let's say
Jones is the sales representative where
we are interested about whom we are
interested in and then we the question
says where the cost of each item so cost
of each item is what we are interested
in you have unit cost so that's what we
are interested in so that would be F and
then say F2 to
f44 and then you need to give your cost
so it says where each item is greater
than 4 so let's select this and
let's do this so this tells me
301
now similarly let's answer our third
question which says how many units did
Jones sell
excluding pencil item so we would want
to find out what was the total number of
units units that were
sold and that units or that should not
include the pencil item how do we start
doing this so let's start with some
ifs now we know that you start with some
ifs you need to give the sum range so we
are interested in the number of units so
let's basically go in and select our
number of units which were sold so
that's your column e so I can say E2 to
e44 that's where I would want to perform
the sum now I'm
saying how many units that were sold
where we are talking about sales rep
being Jones so let's see let's select
the column C and then
give the range after that we need to
give our giving filtering criteria which
is Jones and then we are interested in
the items but excluding pencil so items
is in column D so let's say d to
d44 and then we have to give our
criteria so we can say well that should
exclude pencil so I can basically
say
pencil and let's close
this and let's check so that's my
formula which says that these are the
number of units which the sales
representative whose name is Jones had
sold and that does not include pencil as
an item let's also look at an example of
using count if or count ifs now both of
these can be very useful when you would
want to calculate certain values so for
example if I would want to work on count
if let's try solving this problem now
remember you can answer these questions
using filters and that can be an easier
way but then sometimes you may want to
get the formulas so that you can make
your spreadsheet and your calculation
more dynamic in nature and that will
basically depend on the values in the
columns or rows so for example if I have
find the total number of times Gil has
made a sale now if I look at my data
here it tells me that for every three
sales representative there is some value
in the sale and it says sales has
greater than three so for example Jones
you have sales greater than three or you
have Jardine which is sales greater than
three and so on so what we are
interested in is doing a quick count in
finding out the total number of times
Gil has made a sale how do we do that so
we can use this count IF function and if
I go into count if it says counts the
number of cells within a range that meet
the given condition now what's our
condition our condition is Gil and we
would want to find out how many times
the name say Gil appears or Gil has made
a sale now I could just say count if and
then open up a bracket I need to give a
range so let's say we are interested in
looking at the range so let's say we
will
choose sales rep so I can say C and then
I can say C2 to
c44 now that's my
range let's not give that in
codes so you have to give a range so
let's do a count if that selects the
data and then we need to give the
condition so for example let's here give
the name which is Gil and then close
this so that basically tells me it is
five times skill appears here we can
check this so I can go in here I can add
a
filter and then might be I would be
interested in looking at only Gil and
that basically gives me five right so we
can always do that and we can be using
formulas like this now what about this
question so which basically says with
sales representative made a sale more
than three times now we it might be
looking little confusing when I say for
example let me clear out this
filter now we have sales greater than
three and we would want to find out
which sales representative made a sale
more than three times now I could
basically check for every every sales
representative here if they have made a
sale more than three times and what I
can do is I can just say equals I can
start with count if then I need my
filtering criteria so that's your range
so first thing is we will choose for
example let's choose C2 to
c44 and then we need
to give and criteria what is the
criteria we need basically a sales
representative so I can choose the value
here in
C2 and then I can close this and then I
can say the sale has to be greater than
three and let's check so it tells me the
Boolean value that yes this guy has made
sales more than three times and what we
can do is we can just drag and drop
which basically gives me the value for
other sales rep you can always check the
value is automatically changing to this
value in sell and for example let's go
in here so this is obviously two so it
says me false right and you can
basically get the values for all your
values so that basically tells me which
sales representative has made a sale
more than three times now like some IFS
we also have count ifs where you can
give multiple criterias so for example
the question is how many orders were
placed from the east region after this
particular date so we have a date
criteria we also have the region
criteria and we need to basically get
the count of number of orders which were
placed now I can in this case use
count if
and this basically says that you can
start within criteria so it says how
many orders were placed from east region
after particular date so date is in My
First Column so for example I could say
a start with two and say for example
let's go
a44 that should have selected all the
rows and then then I need to once I've
given the criteria range I need to give
the criteria so we are saying the date
has to be greater than 10th Feb so let's
Give It 2 10
2019 and then you need to say how many
orders were placed so you need to give
the criteria second criteria range so we
are looking at the number of orders
which were
placed from the east region so when I
would want to look at the region that's
your column B so I can basically say B2
2
B44 and
here I would basically give my criteria
so the criteria is
East let's give that and once you have
done this you would want to find out the
total number of orders so let's select
this and if I do this it tells me 13 now
is that right so we are looking for your
date your region being East and then
getting the total number of orders so
here I can just do a count if I'm saying
A2 to
a44 wherein I have given the date
criteria that it should be greater
than 10th Feb because I do not want to
count 10th Feb it says after 10th
February and then you're saying the
region has to be East so we would want
to find out the total number of ORD so
my region is east and that gives me the
result now similarly you can also find
out how many times
Gil sold pencils so here we will have to
to give the range so let's start with
count
ifs now here I would want that item is
pencils so we can as well select column
D2
t44 then you have to give your criteria
so that's
your pencil
and then we are looking for sales rep
which is Gil so that is my column C so
let's say c 2 2 C
44 and the value should be just
kill so it tells
me it's twice where Gil has sold pencils
so we can obviously check this by going
in here choosing my filter and then
let's search for rep being just
Gil okay and now we are interested only
in the item being pencil so I can say
well let's get to pencil only and that
tells me twice so you can obviously
reverifying filters but using functions
or using
formulas it is always good to calculate
and that can be making your computation
and calculation more
Dynamic let's look at one more
interesting feature of Excel and that's
your conditional formatting now as you
see on the screen conditional formatting
has different rules which can be applied
on your data and that allows you to
basically differentiate or easily
identify data values which are based on
certain criterias or rules so when you
talk about conditional formatting you
have different options such as you can
highlight cell rules you can get top and
bottom values you can apply different
rules apply different color scales and
you you can easily manage these rules so
conditional formatting is very useful
for people who would want to work on
huge amount of data and easily perform
some data analysis it's easy to use as
it is shown here and with your
conditional formatting you can format
cells based on a preset condition you
can perform conditional formatting to
identify cells you can highlight a few
significant cells and you can easily
perform conditional
formatting as shown on the left side now
how do we work with conditional
formatting let's have a quick look so
say for example we have our Excel sheet
and if you see here I am highlighting
the salesperson who have generated
Revenue greater than
10,000 so we can be looking at the
values where the revenue generated by a
particular sales person is greater than
10,000 it has a particular color and how
do we get here here so for example let's
select this
data and what I could do is I could go
into conditional formatting now I could
basically highlight cell rules and we
could just say greater than that's an
easier way I could also go ahead and
create a new rule but then I can use one
of this option I can say greater than
and let's give some value might be we
would be interested in looking at any
value greater than 12,000 so let's
choose
12,000 and here it says what color would
you want to select so for example I
would say something
like yellow filled with dark yellow
text and let's say okay so right now
what I'm doing is I have all the values
where the revenue generated was greater
than 10,000 but then I have also
selected all the sales people who have
made or who have generated Revenue
greater than 12,000 so I can just do a
control Zed to see the previous result
now here I had the values which were
greater than 10,000 and the one which we
did just now
basically highlighted the values which
are greater than 12,000 so this is one
simple example now we can look at some
other examples say for example you want
to format cells using three color scale
so if you look at the values here I have
a three-c color scale mainly in green
yellow and red and how do you do this so
for example I can go in here and I can
go to conditional formatting so I would
want to go for color scales and here you
can create different rules so we can set
up up a two color scale so we can say
format only values that are above and
below average I can format only cells
that contain something I can get the top
and bottom value so these are different
ways in which I can have a three color
based scale now what I will do is I will
select this and let me show you the rule
which I have so for example I can go
into manage rules and if you see see
here there are certain rules which have
been specified now what does that mean
so you would want to specify a three
grade scale so for example if I would
want to look at my first rule it tells
me that I'm choosing three color scale I
can choose lowest value percentile and
highest value and that basically will
select the cells based on their values
so what we could have done is I can
basically use one of these values I can
delete these rules which I have created
so for example I have all these rules
but you should always carefully remember
that the rules will be applied in the
order shown so for example if I just
delete these
rules and then say apply and say okay my
data is back now it does not have any
highlighting now I can go in here I can
say condition sorry conditional
formatting I could go for color scales
or I could basically going
to new rule so I would want the cells to
be using three color scale so let's
choose three color scale now when you
say three color scale it says what will
be the color of lowest value and we
could choose my might be any one of this
let's choose red I can say midpoint is
percentile 50 and then the highest value
is green and if that looks good let's
say okay and now if you see the lowest
values have been highlighted as red you
have mid values and then you have the
positive value so this is the three-c
color scale and that easily helps me in
identifying the data based on the cell
values now in conditional formatting
what you can also do is you can
basically color the sales based on their
value so what we are seeing here is if
the
revenue generated is greater than
average then that shows in green and if
the revenue generated is lesser than
average that's shows in Orange now how
do we do that so we can basically again
manage some rules so I can basically
create a new rule now here I can select
one of the options which says format
only values that are above or below
average and that's the option I would
want to select now I can select this and
it says format values that are above
average so in our case we had it in
green so for example I'll say above
average and then here I can go for a
particular color so you can go for a
particular size so let's go and look
into the formatting so for example let's
choose
yellow say okay now I'm saying wherever
the cell values are above average it
would be yellow instead of
green and let's go in here let's go and
look into manage rules so this is
basically the rule which we are applying
now we can also add a new rule and I
need to select the values so for example
I will
say here so we had gone for above now
we'll go for below we'll go for format
we will choose red we'll say okay we'll
say now these are
basically the rules which we have
created and here it's says applies to
your data so right now it has not been
applied so for example if I select this
and then I could basically choose my
area just hit on enter and similarly you
can go in here and then select your area
hit on enter and say apply say okay and
now if you see I have really chosen
bright colors but then I have said
wherever my revenue generated is above
average it should be in yellow and below
average should be in Red so we wanted
above average to be in green and below
average to be orange so that's what we
have here right so you can always color
code your cell values based on some
rules which you are setting up now
similarly you can also find the top 10
and bottom 10 values and that's pretty
easy so you can just select this and
then you can go into conditional
formatting you can go for top and bottom
values top 10 items bottom 10 items or
you can go in for more rules so you can
say format only top or bottom ranked
values so you have top 10 now you can
choose the color and for example Le I'll
go for
blue and I'll say okay so now if you see
my top 10 values are blue now similarly
I can add one more rule so I can say new
rule and I can say let's go for top or
bottom let's go for bottom let's go for
format let's say orange say okay say
okay and that's it so so now you have
your values which are top or bottom 10
values so you're using conditional
formatting where you are basically
highlighting your cell values based on
different colors and here easy
conditional formatting based on
different rules helps us to do that now
similarly you can also have the
values which is
basically showing you how the values are
increasing so what we can do is we can
select our columns either you could
apply this to all the columns now here I
have applied this only to Jan and April
now I could apply this for June so let's
say June so you can go for gradient fill
you can go for solid fill you can
obviously just select the color and that
takes care of the things you can say for
example select this and now this is
selected but I would want to might be
format this so I can go in here I can go
into manage rules now that will tell me
what rule has been
applied in the order so I can just do a
edit Rule and that basically says this
is a solid fill which is color you have
no border this is basically color is
black now I can go for something like
gradient
fill and I can say okay and now if I say
apply and okay so this basically is Like
Your First Column so you can use
conditional formatting for various use
cases and you can highlight the values
so anyone who would look at the value
would automatically notice which are the
higher values which are lower values
might be here the revenue is getting
generated or was getting generated but
did not grow Beyond a particular value
and so on now similarly you can also go
in for different options say for example
here we would want to see if the revenue
was
dropping or if the revenue
was if the revenue decreased or say for
example if the revenue was going up for
this particular salesperson so here we
are looking at Carol so in Jan the
revenue Generation by sales was very
high then in Feb it was falling down in
March it was kind of stable then in
April it went way below so we can
obviously work on this wherein we can
grade our cell values so what we can do
is we can go in for highlighting the
cell values now you can go for color
scales you can go for Icon sets and this
is where you can choose your different
shapes so you could choose one of these
shapes so for example I would be
interested in looking at the indicators
like directional I could go using this
three arrows I can go in for this color
I can choose directional and then my
values are
automatically using directional now what
we can also do is we can then go into
manage rules and that basically tells me
what rules have been applied so for
example the latest one is the icon set
which I have chosen it shows the
selected columns I can obviously do a
edit Rule and then I can choose so I'm
saying the format style is icon sets I'm
not using a data bar I'm not using color
scale now here I have chosen the style
of icons and then here here you can
basically give some values so you have
icon which is green when the value is
greater than or equal to 67
percentage when I say hyphen or minus it
is less than
67 it's way below 33 percentage then you
give this value so you can obviously
edit and easily highlight your cell
values based on this icon set so I can
apply this and that's how I use
conditional formatting so conditional
formatting can be very useful if you
would want to use icon set if you want
to use your datab bars if you would want
to highlight particular values if you
would want to color code based on some
calculation if you would want to use a
three color or a two color scale or if
you would want to just find out values
based on on some simple calculation so
conditional formatting is used
extensively by data analysts or people
who are working in business intelligence
teams or people who would want to use
Excel to easily identify the
data easily identify the cells which
contain particular value or finding out
less significant or more significant
cells to then pull out values and carry
out your computing ation s calculations
or analysis let's continue learning on
using Excel for various things now we
have learned on conditional formatting
and seen how that can be very helpful
let's learn one more feature of Excel
and that's basically your data
validation now this can be very useful
when you would want to work on
validating the data which is being fed
in the cells so you could limit it to
basically a number between a particular
value you could also add some messages
to it if you would want or you could
even Circle invalid data or clear
validation circles so data validation
really helps us in validating the data
which is being fed in two particular
Fields now it's a feature in Excel which
is mainly used to control what a user
can fill in a cell you can decide what
type of values must be entered you can
also restrict user to enter on the valid
data and if any invalid data is entered
an error message will be displayed now
that's where you can use your data
validations so let's see how that can be
done so for data validation let's see
some exercises here so for example you
have a name column and you would want to
restrict that the name should accept
only 15 characters now how do you do
that so you can basically select the
cells or you can just select a
particular cell and then we can later
drag the property to other fields now
here once the cell is selected so for
example let's try this out and let's see
if that works so for example I will say
Peter
Johnson okay and that is basically five
and
9 and 12 characters so let's
say
junior and if I do this it says input
length is greater than 15 do you want to
continue if I say yes right so basically
it is allowing me to add the value here
but then it has basically violated the
rule now this is giving a message to the
user that the username should be entered
less than 15 characters now how do we do
that so for this we can basically select
the column and then we can search for
data Tab and get into Data validation so
this is where you can create or select
different kind of rules so for example I
can go into Data validation I can go
into settings and I can say that text
length and that should be less than 15
now this is the maximum I'm giving and
it says apply these changes to all other
cells within the same settings so I can
do this or I can just drag and drop so I
can
basically apply this formula and now you
can in fact randomly check in any
particular cell is the rule applied so
it says text length less than 15 so we
can basically control data validation in
this particular column and that will
allow only 15 characters it will pop up
a message if the user really wants to go
beyond the particular limit now you also
have similarly date of birth so the
Restriction is date of birth should be
between 10 Jan 1990 to 30 December
1998 so this is what we want to restrict
how do we do that so we can select the
field we can click on data validation
and if you see here I have selected date
and then date is between and then
obviously you can give a range that is
10 Jan date 1990 12 30 1998 so that's
the start and the end filter which has
been applied and once this is done you
can also check your input messages which
says when sell is selected shows this
input message enter a valid date so if
you see here on the left there is a
popup which is coming up which says
enter a valid date now I can also say
when user enters invalid data show this
error alert so I can say stop I can say
invalid
entered and this is how I have set a
rule so for example if I just do
something like this and that says
invalidate enter
I can do a retry it will take me back
here but unless and until I do not give
the right format the date will not be
accepted and again the same thing
applies to all the cells similarly email
so we are saying the email should have
at the rate present in the value
provided now for this we can use a
formula and we can select well I would
want to apply this rule to all these
rows starting from C2 to c14 so let's
get into Data validation let's look in
settings and here we are choosing custom
now within custom I'm choosing what is
the formula so I'm saying is
number and then I'm saying find at the
rate for the rows C2 to c14 so the only
thing we are concerned about here is the
value should have an email
icon you can input a particular message
you can say what has to be done for
error alert so for example we can
basically go in here and we can
say invalid
email that's the title I'm giving and we
can say email show should
contain at the rate so if I do this and
if I say okay now you can test it so you
can say A B C D and that says email
should contain at the rate and basically
that will not allow me to add the values
so now you have the field called salary
it says salary should be greater than
50,000 now we can limit the values by
choosing a whole number
so for example for salary I can go into
Data validation I can go into settings
so here I can say something like decimal
or I can go for whole number so both of
the things are fine it depends on what
kind of values get into this particular
field so if I say whole number and if I
say it has to be greater than
50,000 so I'm saying the minimum is
50,000 or I could have given a decimal
and then I can say greater than less
than equal or anything or even between
so I can select greater than and then I
can just say okay now for rank the rule
is rank should be between 100 and 200 so
again we can use a whole number so ranks
will generally not be decimal so this
would be whole number salary is can be a
whole number or it could be decimals so
we we have chosen decimal here and in
rank if you click on data validation I
have chosen whole
number I've set data between 100 and 200
input message nothing error alert
nothing but that depends I can give this
so this is how you can just do a simple
data validation and control the values
which land in the cell okay so now let's
also understand how we can restrict the
values in a particular cell which might
be based on a list of items now for
example here if you see I have two
columns so one column basically has the
values of city names and then you have
places within that particular City so if
I would want to implement a data
validation based on this so for example
if you see here City and that basically
shows me only the four values which can
be entered and if I go to place then it
tells me for Maharashtra I can only
enter Pune Mumbai nask now how do I do
this so say for example you take an
empty field and you want to restrict the
values of city names so I could select
data validation I could basically select
list and then it tells me you need to
enter the list values that is the source
so you click here and then I can just
select these fields now if I do this and
if I say okay it has implemented a data
validation but if you look into this it
will show me the same thing but then it
shows me some empty cells which did not
have any value so this is fine but it
would be better if we do it in a
different way so I can select this and I
have already given my city names here so
I can just do a data validation and here
in the source let me get rid of this now
I can just have my cursor here I can
select these values and then if I say
okay so now if you see my city names
have been restricted to these values and
that's how you can Implement your data
validation so I have this data
validation here but I will get rid of
this one by just doing a control Z now
I'll come here here and say for example
I would want to implement the same data
validation now the easiest way would be
in doing this for all my four cities now
if you see here I have data validation I
could choose Bangalore and if you come
and check here there is no data
validation but we have implemented data
validation here now how is that done so
I could select this or for example I can
go in here I can select data validation
I can select list and then here in the
source I will say for Bangalore the
values should be these and then if I
basically say
okay now if we see these are the values
which are fed into Bangalore so we could
do this or like what we have done here
so if you can check the data validation
rule I have used list and then I have
said indirect F2 so basically I'm giving
in a formula which relates to the value
which is in for the city Maharashtra so
we could do this or in a simpler way we
could do this and then just drag and
drop here so we could check for
Maharashtra what are the values let's
choose a different city so for example
Kolkata and here I will choose now since
we did a drag and draw
it has basically taken the values of
Bangalore so that's not right so we
select this we go into Data validation
and here I can
either feed in the values that is such
as Bangalore I could basically say
something like this Kolkata and I could
say okay so now if you see it shows me
the places in Kolkata now here we have
let's choose a different city so so for
example let's go for Delhi and here I
can go to data validation and I can just
say Delhi so this is an easier way of
doing it or if you remember the formula
then what you can do is you can just
give indirect and then basically give
the value of the cell for which you
would want to keep in the values so this
is how you can do list validation so you
can provide a list of values and then
you can restrict the values in a Cell
which should be belonging to a
particular list so this is how you do a
simple data validation by restricting
the data in the form of a list now let's
learn about pivote charts and tables
which is one more very useful feature of
Excel and which allows you to work with
your data or perform data analysis now
pivot table is a summary of your data it
is used in cases where there are
numerous rows and columns in your data
set and it allows you to group your data
in several ways so that you can derive
meaningful information from it now the
visual representation of a pivote table
is termed as a pivote chart now how do
we do that so let's see an example now
here is some data here you see see we
have some row labels which basically
gives me some category of items here it
also tells me the sum of sales and
basically it gives me per item what is
the total sum of sales which were made
now how do I get this here so for
example if I would want to delete this
and I would be interested in getting the
total sales under each category of items
now we know that we have have different
data here and it's huge for example on
the row end if I just do a control and
right arrow it tells me what's my right
last column and if I just do a control
and down arrow it tells me there are
9,994 rows now I can use this and what I
can do is I can basically work
on insert and go to pivote table now
this basically tell else you need to
choose the range now since I have chosen
my first row and First Column it
basically has selected the data and
that's fine now do you want the result
in a new worksheet I'll say existing
worksheet and I can choose a location
now that basically needs me to select a
field mightbe we can just select this
field and that should be good enough so
for example if I close this or if I say
Okay so
this is basically an indication that my
pivote table will be created now what
are the fields we are interested in so
as per the problem we need to find out
what the total sales for each category
so let's go in here and let's select the
field category now as soon as you do
that it shows that the rows which are
being selected are for this column
category and now we are interested in
getting the sales so we would want the
sales per category so let's select this
so you see some of sales is selected now
close this and that's it that's that's
your data so it shows you row labels it
tells you what are the different
categories and it also gives you sum of
sales which is per category now this is
one easy example where we have solved
the problem where we have tried to find
what were the total total sales under
each category of items so for example
let's have another data set so again you
can just check how many rows we have and
it is basically the same
9,994 and if I look in columns it
basically shows me profit is the last
column and here we would want to find
out which category so for example let me
get rid this which subcategory C of
items sold the maximum under each
category so we have some categories here
which says fature and it shows some
subcategories and then it shows me
office supplies and then some
subcategories and same thing with
technology now we know how we got this
data but this is different than what we
were seeing here so here we were just
getting the categories what but we did
not have any breakdown of subcategories
within this particular category and here
you see there is a breakdown and then
basically you can also apply a filter
which basically says what is the data
you want and if you are interested in
finding out a particular value now how
do we do this so for example let me get
rid of this now we know how we can find
out the category of items but we would
want to find out which subcategory of
items sold the maximum under each
category so here we are not looking at
sales but we are looking at the quantity
okay so what we can do is we can go to
the first row and First Column click on
insert click on pivote table data is
already selected let's choose existing
worksheet let's choose a location in our
worksheet where we would want to have
this so might be I can select this
particular field and then just close
this so it says this is the existing
worksheet say okay and now you need to
select your columns so for
example if I would want the data for
categories so I can select this now I
know that within category these are the
options which we have and then there is
a subcategory so let's select that and
if you see here now we have the data
which will be filtered So based on your
category and subcat category and then we
will choose quantity so it automatically
understands that this is something on
which summation can be done so let's
select this and close on this now if you
see here we have got our items where we
can see the subcategories within a
particular category now I can basically
close this and that just shows me high
level categories here so here I can
again select a
particular row and column I can go
for either a new pivote table so we
could basically select this the row is
already selected existing worksheet is
what I want so now I will select this
particular place say okay now we do the
same thing like what we did earlier so
we will select category subcategory and
quantity so the data has already come in
just select this and now you already
have all your data but this is not what
we want we want to basically apply a
filter to this now how do we do that so
we can go for slicer so I can go for
insert slicer and then it tells what are
the subcategories which you are
interested in so for example
if I go for something like subcategory
and say Okay so this tells me what are
the categories you are interested in so
for example we know that furniture has
Furnishings with the highest value so I
can select save
furnishings and then I was interested in
office supplies So within office supply
I can
basically search
for here
binder so I can just do a control and
select
binder and then I can also know for
technology I can select phones so I'll
say control and select phones and now if
you see the filter has been applied and
we have these subcategories which are
selected so we have our data here now we
don't need really this so I can just
delete this and I have my data which
shows me furniture being the main
category and that has only Furnishings
office supply having binders and
Technology having phones and that
basically is a filter applied on the
result of your pivote so this is how we
are seeing with subcategory of items
were
sold maximum for each category so this
is how you can easily use pivote tables
and you can do some analysis let's look
at some more examples
now let's see if you have to answer this
question which says which were the top
three states for each region that made
the highest average profit now how do we
calculate that so for example this is
the data we have and as I've instructed
earlier you can select the first row and
First Column you can click on insert go
into P table and that basically selects
all your data we will choose the result
should be in this existing worksheet so
select this click here and then
basically let's
select this cell and I will say okay so
now my pivote table will be here so we
are interested in finding out top three
states within each region which have
made the
highest profit or which have made the
highest average profit so for that first
we will select
region so when we select region it
shows here region and within region you
will then select state So within every
region you have multiple States so
that's what we are selecting and then we
are interested in looking at the profit
so let's select profit and that
automatically shows up here so we can
now say close this so basically we have
all the data but we are looking at the
sum of profit but that's not what we
want we are looking
for top three states from each region
that made the highest average profit now
how do we change that so here we have
sum of profit so I can do a right click
and basically I can say summarize values
by average so now I'm getting the
average here and that basically tells
per region I have the average profit but
first is let's sort this data so let's
go to sort more options and here I have
average of profit or for example as I
said you can select region say okay and
now it is basically having the regions
and then you have your state value so
again we can do a sorting here and I can
say let's go for more sort options I'll
say descending the State values should
be based on average profit so let's say
okay and now if you see in particular
region we have the data which has been
sorted wherein you have the highest
average profit on the top now what we
can also do is we can basically then go
for filtering we can say top 10 but I'm
not interested in top 10 so I could
reduce this to top three and this this
is the items average of profit say okay
and now you see per region you have the
data which
is showing me top three states what are
the average and then you are also
looking at the subtotal so which
basically says average profit for your
West now if you would want to arrange
this your west and south and east and
Central in a particular alphabetical
order if you would want to sort it you
can always do a sorting and you can
choose sort Z to A if that's what you
would want to do or you can go for
sorting more sort options and you want
to sort the region which is as of now
based on descending z2a let's make it
ascending say okay and now you see the
data has been filtered so it says per
region
now you can always select this and you
can say what is this so this is
basically your average of profit now we
are looking at each region and the
states the top three states as we wanted
within the region and what is the
average now we have one more question
what is the percentage contribution of
each subcategory of products under each
category to the total Sal so we know
there are different products there are
different categories and all the
categories contribute to the total sales
so we would want to find out what is the
percentage contribution of each
subcategory of products under each
category so we not only want the
category percentage but we would also
want what is the contribution of each
subcategory to each category to the
total sales how do we do that so for
that we need to
again just place our cursor here or
select the first row and First Column
click on your insert click on your
pivote table and now the data is already
selected existing worksheet place your
cursor here and then let's select this
cell say okay now your pivot table
fields are here so we are interested in
category so let's select select category
and then within a category we will have
subcategories and we are interested in
the sales data wherein it is already
going to give us the sum of sales but we
would want this in the form of
percentage rather than just the sum now
we can click here value field settings
and it says if you would want to
summarize this it says show value as and
what are the values you would want so
you can straight away go ahead here and
say percentage of grand total so we
could do that because we know we will
get a sum of sales and grand total now I
could basically say percentage of grand
total say okay and then just close this
so once you have closed this you see
already the data is
in percentage so now we have our data
with subcategories but we also want the
data to be sorted might be in a
descending order which tells which
subcategory is contributing more than
others we can select how many
subcategories we are interested in so we
can basically select one of the
subcategory CES right click now you have
option filter and you have sorting so we
can say more sort options now here I
will say descending and you want the
descending to be some of sales which is
already showing as percentage click on
okay and now you see for each category
it shows the percentage contribution
towards the sales it shows the
subcategories
contribution to a particular category
and also to total sales so technically
speaking if you look at all these values
which are subcategories and if you would
total them that would be your total
grand total so this is how we can solve
a simple problem like this what is the
percentage contribution of each
subcategory of products under each
category to the total
sales the next question is which
customer made the lowest profit in the
home office segment in each state now
here we know that we are looking for
home office segment we are looking for
customer which made the lowest profit we
are also looking for the state
as the main criteria so in each state we
would look for home office segment and
within that we would look for customer
which has made the lowest profit that
means the lowest value of the profit so
how do we do this so let's say let's get
into selecting our row and column we
will go into insert I'll say pivote
table I'll say existing worksheet and
let me get my result here so let's say
okay now that gives me the P table so
the first thing is we are looking at per
state and I would be interested
[Music]
in home office segment or I could first
start with segment now here we have
segment and in segment I can basically
select home office so I can just do a
uncheck and select home office only and
now I can
select state so that will be my
subcategory within segment and then
within State we would want to find out
the customer so let's get the customer
name and we are interested in finding
out the lowest profit so let's select
profit and here we have some of profits
so the fields are selected close this
and now you have your date
which basically shows me the names of
customers which made the profit but it's
it's not sorted so we can sort this and
we have state entries also so that's
fine so what I can do is here I can
basically say sorting go to more sort
options I can say I want to do a
descending or I want to do an ascending
an ascending based on sum of profit so
let's do that now you see the topmost
value is the lowest value per state
within home office segment now what we
also want is we just want one value per
state so how do we do that so we can
just go for filtering go for top 10
values I'm interested in bottom value
and in that also I'm looking for only
the lowest value so let's select one one
say okay and now you see we have data
for home office
segment per
state customer who has made the lowest
profit so we have easily answered this
question using our pivote table now say
for example we have a question which
says find the sales made in each quarter
of 2016 for all the regions so the data
has to be divided waterly and use order
ear as a slicer we can do that by
selecting what data we would want to
slice and then we would want to create a
pivote chart also so for example how do
we do that so for example I will get rid
of this I will get rid of this my pivote
chart which we can recreate so find the
sales made in each quarter of 2016 for
all the regions so this is what we want
now how do we do this so for example
let's select this we will do a insert
pivote table we will basically say
existing worksheet and then I can select
this particular cell I'll say okay and
now I'm interested in data quarterly so
first let's select our field here so we
should basically have
if all our fields are selected say for
example if I say order date
now you see we have quarters and years
which are selected now we could be
selecting these fields which
says quarters years and if I would want
data to be filtered based on years I
could do that or I could get rid of
years so I have quarters I have ordered
date
so that's being already selected now
what else we need we need to find
out for every region so let's select the
region and we can also add region as a
column here so that will basically give
me all the regions as different columns
and then finally we want the sales so
let's select this and now let's look
what we have so if you see
here we have our data which
is for each
quarter it gives me the total data but
what we would be interested in is not
looking at the total data but we are
only interested in quarter of 2016 now
how do we do that so what we do here is
we have row labels so let's click on
this so we have date filters and then in
date filters we can go for between and
then we will say
2016 and the value has to be one and
then let's select this and let's change
this to
2016 and this is 12th
month and then we can say
31 so we are saying the date has to be
2016 and it basically says not a valid
date so let's
select let's select a particular date
and see so the month has to be here so
let's change this and let's make it date
and say okay and now we have our data
which is
for
2016 so for example I could basically
select this and here I could be looking
at what what are the filters we have so
it says clear filter from order data so
we have applied the filter on order date
and these are your date filters which is
basically date 16 or this is wrong so
this one has to be changed to
2016 so select this and now we have our
data for
2016 so we have found the sales made in
each quarter of 2016 for all the regions
the grand total for a particular quarter
if we are looking at the value or for
individual months in a particular
quarter and we have sliced the data now
we could have also introduced a slicer
by
selecting which field we would want to
implement so for example if I would
select a particular field and then I
could click on slicer I could choose I
would want to slice the date based on
order date and then could have done it
or we have just given
the date for 2016 now we just need to
plot a graph for this and that's very
easy so you just need to select the
complete pivote data and here you have
the chart options so let's go for line
chart and that basically shows me the
line chart so we can select this we can
just drag and drop it here and then we
can basically check if that is showing
us the data so if you see here this is
line chart where it has divided the
regions in different colors so we have
all the regions we could filter out in
pivote chart a particular region we have
the
quarterly time here in order data the
filter is applied it says it is to
2016 in quarters it tells me it is 16 so
we have our data we have created a
pivote chart and basically we have
sliced the data for
2016 let's answer one more question and
that's finding the profit made in each
year for all the categories of products
in east and west regions only and then
we would want to create a histogram for
the same pivote table so histogram
usually gives us the frequencies so
let's look at how do we calculate the
profit made in each year for all the
categories so what I can do is I can
basically select my row ID here and now
I'll do a pivote table so the data is
already selected I'll choose existing
worksheet let's select this particular
cell say okay now what are are we
interested in now if you look at the
fields we don't see any years or
quarters and so on so for example here I
can just choose order date and then
basically I can choose say for example
years or
quarters the data which is coming out
from my order date so here I will just
select
years
now then I have my order date
so we are interested in the Years orders
and we are interested in let's look at
our column or the question what we had
here so we have years find the profit
made in each year so let's select profit
so that basically says sum of profit but
then I'm also interested
in for all the categories of products so
what I can do is here I have my field
which is category and that I'll add to
the columns so that shows me what are
the different
categories and this looks fine now I'm
also interested in east and west regions
so that is basically in the region so
either we could add a slicer or we could
do a filtering here by adding the
filters so first is I'll click on region
and here it says select all I'm only
interested in east and west so let's
select this take this put it here let's
say okay and now we have the data which
has been filtered based on the region so
here we have region so you can always
look at the filter it is east and west
and we have our year data per year we
have different categories you can always
look at what are these column labels so
this is my different categories and this
is the profit per
category and then you have your grand
total so we have already our data now
let's say close this so we have our data
for all these years different categories
the profits made per year and if I would
want I could go into an year and I could
look into different months so that also
is showing up and now we would want to
basically plot a histogram with this
data so I can just place my cursor here
I can select this and then I can go into
insert and here I have different options
so we can go for bar chart we can go for
insert hierarchy chart we can go into
waterfall funnel stock surface or radar
chart so there are different options
what you have here and we will go for a
simple histogram which is
two-dimensional let's select this and
here you see you can obviously select
different
regions you have your ears which shows
up you have your order
date and then you have your categories
which can be chosen for your histogram
or for your bar chart and that basically
is how you use your pivote table you use
some calculations and then you can plot
your needed graph to visualize the data
and understand it in a better way hi
everyone welcome to this tutorial on
Microsoft Excel let's look at an example
of uh one more useful function in Excel
and that is V lookup now V lookup is
used to see if a value exists in a range
of values and we can create a range of
values which is nothing but a block of
cells which has a name and can be
referenced so mainly to use we lookup we
need to create a named range and that
can be referenced anywhere in the
workbook or the other option is you can
always drag and select uh the range of
data in which you would want to search
something now there is also U other
functions such as H lookup which pretty
much does the same thing however it does
it horizontally that is left to right
instead of vertically there are other
functions like look up and X lookup and
so on so when we talk about we lookup
let's see how we do that so for example
this is the range of or this is the data
which has been given to you and here is
the question find the employee name with
employee ID 107 now assume that you
might have huge amount of data and you
may want to search something so how do
we do it now here I have created some
column and then some basic formatting
I've given it as an employee ID I've
given employee name now what I can do is
I can create a range of data now how do
I do that or a named range so what you
can do is you can select the data and
then you can do a right click now here
you have something like get data from
table range so you can do that you can
define a name so you can click on this
and here you can give a name to the
range what you would want to call it so
for example let's say our search now
that's the named range I'm creating and
just say Okay so the scope is workbook
and I've have created a named range
which you can see here so it shows for
search our search so you have created a
named range now how do we do a v lookup
here so so for that we can use a formula
so for example I would want to search
for employee name where employee ID is
whatever you would want to search for so
employee ID we can give here
107 now that's what we would want to
search the employee name for and
employee name is what we are interested
now what we can do is we can use the
function option here I can do a insert
function and that shows me different
functions which are here
now V lookup is showing up because I
have recently searched for it or you can
basically just type in here look and you
can do a go so that shows you all the
lookup options what you have like lookup
Edge lookup match V lookup and so on so
we would be interested in V lookup so
let's select that and click on okay now
that basically opens up this function
arguments and it shows what does this
function do so it says looks for a value
in the leftmost column of a table and
then returns a value in the same Row
from a column you specify by default the
table must be sorted in an ascending
order now you can basically say this is
what you would want to search for what
is the lookup value if you place your
cursor here it says what is the table
array that is nothing but the range
which we can use our named range here we
have the column in index number which
basically tells me what is the column
number in the range which we want so
what is the value we want from which
column and then basically you have range
lookup which basically is the fourth
option and range lookup is nothing but
it can have two values so true or false
so true basically means closest match
and then false should be an exact match
so let's do that so for lookup value we
would want to give a particular value
which is nothing but we would be
interested in say employee name so I can
basically search for a value based on
the lookup value now how do we do it so
we are saying we would want to search
for employee ID which is 107 so what I
can do is I can select this
cell here which tells that this is
the value or employee ID for which I
would want to search the employee name I
could actually select the cell here
which is H so that whatever value you
feed in here you can search for that
value so mightbe we can select this one
which is H6 and whatever value we key in
here we will be searching for employee
name for that employee ID now table
array is we would want to give a range
so what we can do is we can give our
range so for example we had selected
something like our search and if you see
here that already selects or shows me
employee ID employee name email address
so it gives me the range now column
index number so
which column are we interested in that
means what is the value we are searching
for so we are searching for employee
name which is the second column so I can
just say two and that basically is the
column number and then you have to give
a range lookup which is a logical value
so either you give an exact match or you
can basically give a closest match so we
can say for example do a zero which
basically means false or you can say one
which is true so let's go for zero now
that's our formulas so it says V lookup
you will search for the value as per S6
in the range and then you are looking
for employee name which is column number
two and then true or false so let's
click on okay and that basically gives
me the value which is
perlop Burge so here I'm searching for
employee name and you can basically drag
this for other columns and you can do
that so if it finds
employee ID here now say for example if
we had an employee ID somebody enters an
employee ID which is not in the range
for example let's try 121 and then you
see this is basically an error right
because it does not have any employee ID
with 121 now how do I take care of this
so there is a Formula which is called if
error and that can be used use to take
care of this so if the value is not
found then it will show whatever I would
want
to show here so what I can do is I can
still select this and what I can do is I
can search in function say for example
this is the function we are looking at
but what we can do is we can test it
here so for example if I look in
function and if I search for error and
so go so there are lots of functions
here and this is the function we are
interested in if error so if I say okay
now this takes the value and what is the
value if error so for Value what I can
do is basically I can
select the value from here which is
nothing but our vlookup formula and
value if error so for example I will
basically say for example not not found
so we can try this and we can say okay
now here it says not found so whenever
it is na it is not found
now if we look at the formula here it
says if error it takes the value of H 7
which is nothing but our V lookup and
then it is showing us the value which we
have entered so for example if I would
say
107 like earlier and then hit on enter
so it says op cruise and it shows us the
value right and if we enter something
else then
basically here it shows Na and it shows
not found but what we want to do is we
want to merge these two so what I can do
is I can get rid of or I can basically
take this
one now what I would want is I want this
formula to be here so what I can do is I
can say if error and then basically
given your
vlookup option or function here and then
say for example not found here not found
now that basically will take care of any
kind of error if the value is not found
so when we say 121 it basically says not
found but if I say 107 which is found
then it shows me the value so we are
using we lookup but then then we are
also using IF error which will take care
of our error message or basically the
not applicable pound not applicable
replaced with whatever value we key in
similarly we can do the same thing here
so we have the find the job title so we
are interested in finding out the job
title once the employee name is given
now employee name can basically have a
value from the cell or whatever value
you would want to key
in how do we do it so we basically start
with our V lookup so that's the function
we are interested in so you can just do
a double click now you are interested in
finding out the value whichever is given
here so that's the lookup value and then
you are interested in finding out the
job title from the range
so I will still give our range which
basically also shows for example let's
do
a double click here and that basically
selects the range and now I'm interested
in finding out the job title so that's
column number four and then I can just
give zero which is for false so now we
have given our V lookup but that shows
not applicable because we have not not
given any employee name so we can key in
the value here which says Fred Stone and
now if we are basically giving the value
so Fred Stone now we will have to search
if there is any job title which is Fred
Stone so here is the value so that
should be showing up let's check what
has gone wrong so we are giving our
range we are interested in finding out
the value but what the mistake what we
did here was that when we want to search
for a value say for example let's take
this we lookup and let's replace this
value of h12 with the value here so Fred
Stone and then basically we will give
our range we will say which is the
column we are interested in and then
give true or false so we can also
basically take care of this error
message so for example let's take this
complete formula from here and
just just copy this
formula and now we can put in here the
formula but then this is where we were
searching for S6 which was employee ID
now that's not what we we are interested
in we are interested in finding out the
value so let's take this one and replace
this with the value given
here and then I give my range I say
which is the column I'm interested in so
I'm interested in looking for job title
and then let's search so it basically
tells me not found so let's check
this now the error which we were facing
was because when we talk about your V
lookup let's look at the formula again
and here say for example I go for
function and then I select we lookup and
say for example I say okay now just look
at the description here looks for a
value in the leftmost column of a table
now earlier the range which we had
selected had the leftmost column as
employee ID and that's why it was giving
an error so how do we fix that so for
example let's
basically remove this function from here
now what we want to do is we would want
to search for the stock broker now if
you see here I have given a range which
is B1 to
D21 so we would want the value for what
we would want to search say employee
name that should be the leftmost column
so so that's how we have our function so
let's do that so say for example the
name is given here so we want a range so
either we can create a range like
earlier by selecting say for example
this data now am I interested in salary
no I'm interested in job title right so
I can basically just select these three
columns and then I can Define a name so
I can say
our search to and let's give a named
range and that's only because we would
want to easily reference or use that
named search or named range now here we
would want to use V lookup but we would
also do an if
error now within that we can say V
lookup and then you need to
select what is the value what your
function takes so basically this is my
function we will say if the value is not
found then we will give this so you can
create an external structure and then
within your V lookup we will say the
leftmost column which we are interested
in so that's your employee name so in
employee name we have the value so
either I can directly select the value
here in the the column b or I will give
the value whichever is fed in here the
employee name then I need to give a
range so let's select our range so
that's your our search to and then you
need to select the column number so we
are interested in finding out the job
title so that's the third column so
let's say three and then just give a
zero and then hit on enter so it says
not found because you have not given any
employee name now
let's try to find the job title of
fredstone so I can just select or I can
say equal and then I can just given a
value and that basically shows me the
job title so this is how you use vlookup
we have also used if error which
basically takes care of error message if
the value is not found so for example we
can test this here we have Fred Stone so
for example if I just empty this this
and I point it to something which does
not exist so that shows me not found or
if you just select this and then key in
a value it shows you this might be we
can just type in so if I say Fred then
basically it says not found because we
are looking for exact match now if we
had changed this to the closest match
something like this then it would have
tried to find something but then we
don't have anything which which is just
with this so there are different ways of
doing it so what we can do is we can
always go for the exact
match and that's basically the
value and here we can basically key in
any value for example I would be
interested in finding out this one and
let's give this so you can search in
this way so you can also have statements
which can be searching one related to
other
now here the question was to find the
job title of Fred Stone so let's type in
Fred Stone and that basically shows me
the job title which we are interested in
so let's search
for job title let's go for exact match
and then search so it is stock broker so
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more
now that we have looked at V lookup it
would be interesting to see how
horizontal lookup or H lookup works it
basically works in the on the same lines
but here instead of vertically searching
to the columns the range is more of
horizontally defined so we search in
rows rather than in columns so for
example this is the data which has been
given to you and you have various
columns so you have employ employe ID
you have your employee name you have
employee email address you basically
have the job title of different
employees and then basically you have
the salary so this is the data which has
been given to you and you are asked to
search or you are interested in finding
out say the salary based on employee
name or job title based on employee ID
so what we need to do is we need to
Define the range here now range can
depend on what you are searching for so
for example when I'm searching employee
name and salary so I am interested in
these four rows when I'm saying employee
ID and job title then might be this is
the range and I don't need salary so I
can create a named range if we are
interested in so that we can easily
search for it or we can straight away
give the the first cell value which is
basically A1 here and then the last
value here which is G and then you can
give five so you can do that or you can
create a named range whichever way you
would want to do it so for example we
would want to create a named range for
our first question which is find the
salary of Eden Connell using H lookup so
we are interested in this so let's
select the these four rows all the way
for your columns now like we did earlier
we can just Define a name mightbe we can
call it our search three and uh we can
just give okay so that's the named range
which we have created now what we would
want is we want to search for the salary
based on employee name so here we can
insert our function so let's look up and
let's search for look and just click on
go so here you have H lookup and
basically that's the function I'm
interested in say Okay so this says what
is the lookup value which you are
interested in so we are interested in
finding out the value based on the
employee name so for example let's
select this cell that gives us more
dynamism and you can add in any name and
you can search for the
salary or you can basically give the
employee name exactly from the employee
name value here which is
D2 so we can give addin conal from here
so let's select this now table array so
we need to give our range so let's say
our search three then you need to give
the row index number now this is
different than vlookup in vlookup you
have column index number and here you
have row index number so what are you
interested in searching for for so we
are interested in searching for salary
now in our range that is basically the
fourth row remember we created a range
from employee name to salary so let's
give the row index number which is four
and the range look up we'll say zero
which is basically exact match and that
completes our formula so click on okay
and that basically gives me the salary
for Eden conell now that's basically
because we have fed in the value here
and that is basically giving me this so
I can again do if error if I would be
interested in to basically take care of
error message if the value is not found
for that you can look into the previous
example which is we lookup now similarly
we are interested in finding out the job
title for employee ID 1 05 how do we do
that so we need to use Edge lookup well
we could have done with V look up but
here the data is more arranged in the
form of rows so how do we do that so we
can again use H lookup but and we can
give a range or named range or let's for
for this time let's basically key in our
range manually so we can do that so
let's go for HED look up now what do we
want to search for so we will say this
is the value then we need to give a
range now as I said if you would want to
give a range manually so for example
I'll say a and then I'll say a
one colon and then I'm interested in G
and then the row will be four so salary
row is not what we are we are not
interested in so let's say G and then we
can give four so that basically gives me
the range right instead of having a
named range so we can do that and then
we need to give the row index number so
we are interested in finding out the job
title which is basically in our range
the fourth row and then give zero for
true or false so if you see here it
tells if it is one it is approximate
match false is an exact match and we can
close this bracket that completes our
formula it takes the value which is
given an employee ID and then it will
try to search for the job type
so that basically shows wherever the
employee ID is 105 the job title is
fabricator again you can use if
error wherein your if error can then be
working on hookup and can take care of
error so that if an employee ID is keyed
in for which there is no matching value
then it will not show you a not
applicable error in instead of that it
will replace with the word whatever you
have specified so in this way you can
easily use hookup to search from the
range of data which is horizontally
arranged and in the previous example we
were seeing how you use V lookup when
the data is arranged
vertically so we have looked at V lookup
and H lookup and what we have seen is
vlookup has a limitation in one way that
we need to basically give a range where
the leftmost column is the one which is
used now instead of that we might be
interested in searching in specific
columns and not all the columns well
that can also affect the time taken to
search for the data wherein we can
select particular columns or particular
ranges rather than selecting all the
data which has to be searched for so for
example we have this question find the
salary of Hank Saunders now that's the
employee name which we have here and we
would want to find out the salary so
what are the columns we are interested
in so one is your employee name and one
is your salary and these are the only
two columns which we are interested in
so instead of using we lookup now like
I've shown earlier you can create a
named range for these two columns and
you can use that or we can manually give
the range here here so let's go for
lookup function here and lookup function
will basically help us in searching what
we are interested in so we are
interested in finding out the employee
name and we are interested in finding
out the salary based on the employee
name so how do we do that so here in
lookup I can first give the value which
is here employee name now
whatever employee name is key in here we
will be searching for salary of that
employee now lookup function needs a
lookup value so we are searching based
on employee name then it says look up
Vector so we will basically then say
what is going to be our lookup Vector so
here we need to give a range so what are
we interested in we are interested in
finding out the salary based on employee
name so first goes our range based on
which we need to search so that's your
employee name so let's for example
select this one so that's our range B1
to
B21 so that will basically have the
employee name in which we will be
searching for and then we are interested
in searching out the the result Vector
that is basically the column from which
we want the value that's our salary
column so let's select this and that
complet reads our lookup function so now
if you hit on enter it shows that for
this employee where the name is hunk
Saunders the salary is
5,400 now you can test it by basically
giving some other name so for example if
I replace this with say Fred
Stone and that basically shows me the
value for Fred Stone we can replace it
to the question which we have that is H
Saunders and that shows me the salary so
that's a simple example of Lookup which
allows you to search by selecting a
range of columns rather than having the
leftmost column which has to be
referenced similarly we have one more
question find the employee ID of this
particular email ID so we need to again
use our lookup function so we'll say
look up now what are we interested in we
will search based on this email address
so I will select this then I need to
give that based on email address we are
searching the employee ID so email
address is in this column so let's
select this range and then we are
interested in employee ID so then goes
our result Vector so select this column
and that basically completes your
formula so close this bracket and hit on
enter so that basically shows me the
employee ID for an employee with this
email address so this is how you use
lookup now as I've explained earlier you
can be using the if error and you can
basically see how your index match can
be used now here is an example of if
error so basically this shows how if
error helps so say for example as I
showed in your sheet one so check for
employee James Bond if the value is not
present display not found and what are
we doing we are are basically nesting
our V lookup inside if error with a not
found option which basically says if the
value given in this cell HED is not
found then
basically it will display not found so
here you also notice that the range
which has been given has been selected
that is B1 to
c21 now we could have used a name name
range which basically helps us in
searching for multiple functions we are
searching for two that is the column
number two here that is employee name so
check for employee James Bond if the
value is not present or no so we are
basically just searching for employee
name here and then give your zero or one
so that's basically usage of your if
error which I've shown earlier and the
same thing can be applied for your Edge
look up
also now suppose you have been given
some additional questions for example
you know instead of using your V lookup
or hookup or lookup examples what we
have seen say for example you are asked
to find the salary of Peter Daniels now
we already know how to find that using
we lookup right so for example we want
to find out the salary for this employee
name which is Peter Daniels I can use a
vlookup however sometimes we may also
want to use a index match and index
match is also un useful function to do
that so we can basically search based on
that so we have to define the range of
data we have to then say what do we want
to match so that's basically an employee
name and then we are interested in
finding out say for example based on the
range of employees you would want to
find out the value of salary so we are
then giving a range and doing it how do
we do that so for example here I can use
a function which is called index and if
you see here it says returns a value or
reference of the
cell at the intersection of a particular
row and column in a given range so this
is where index function can be useful
now we can start with this function it
says it needs an array that's nothing
but a range so we can basically select
all our data so I can say A1 all the way
to E21 so that basically is my range now
I would want to find the salary of this
employee name which is Peter Daniels so
I can use internally here basically you
need to give a row number
so what we can do is we can do a
match so we can use an internal function
match now we need to basically give it
correctly so we need to say match now
how does this match function work so we
need to basically match for a value so
for example we'll select whatever
employee name is given here so that's
Peter Daniels now that's basically what
we would want to match now where do we
want to match this so we want to match
in the column B which has
employee names so we can give a range
which is B1 to
B21 so that's basically within the
employ names we are looking for a match
which is given here that's in
H6 and we want to do a match so we want
to do a exact match so let's do a comma
zero and then we are interested in
finding out the salary based on this
match and salary is an our fifth column
so let's basically give the column
number here and then just close this
bracket so that basically completes your
function and just hit on enter so that
shows me the salary of Peter Daniels
right so this is an easy way wherein you
can use the index function remember
first you give the
range then you need to give your
matching conditions So when you say
match I would take the value whatever is
given in this cell I will search in the
range of values which is employee names
I will find an exact match and what I'm
interested in is finding the salary for
Peter Daniels now similarly say for
example you have been given a question
find the employee ID with salary 10,000
so so you want to find out the employee
idid wherever the salary is 10,000 so we
are obviously looking for an exact match
now how do we do that so we can start
with our index function and within index
function we need to give a range so for
example I'm interested in finding out
say for example our range which is
A1 to
E21 so that's what I'm interested in or
you are actually interested in searching
based on say your salary so you
interested in searching the employee ID
so mightbe if I just do a a21 let's see
what happens here now then I can just do
a
match so match will be now done based on
the value which is here H 13 so I will
do a match for this one now I need to
give a range
so let's basically give a range which
will be we are interested in searching
employee ID based on the salary column
so that's your e column so I will say E1
to
E21 that's what I'm interested in
searching finding a match for this
salary we want an exact match so first
let's close this one now that's fine I
mean we are interested in finding out
the employee ID based on the match which
is within this
range and then what we would want to do
is we would want to basically find the
employee ID employee ID is in my column
A so what I can do is I can additionally
give a match here and then I can say I'm
interested in the finding out the value
for employee ID and that basically needs
a range so the range here here will be
just the the column headings so we will
give A1 all the way to
E1 so that's the range in which we would
want to search and we would want to find
a match for employee ID we want an exact
match so let's close this one and that
basically closes my match and we need to
close our index function so now that
shows me employee ID where the salary is
10,000 so this is how you can do your
index matches where you can give a range
then you can say what you need to match
within which particular column whether
it is an exact match or approximate
match and then the column from where you
are interested in finding out the value
so same thing we did here we basically
gave a complete range and if you closely
see we were only interested in finding
out the employee ID so here I give a
range A1 to a 21 which is basically this
particular column so that's where we are
interested in finding out match
basically will give your lookup value so
that's
h13 then we gave a range which is salary
that's what we are interested in and
then we said when we are doing a match
we are only interested in finding out
the employee ID which is in a range of
column names and then doing an exact
match so this is how you can use index
match instead of of lookup which can
also give you uh some exceptions in
searching for specific columns or
specific rows now if error we have
already discussed where you Nest your V
lookup or H lookup inside it so this is
how you can use your lookup functions
hookup V lookup lookup or index match to
search for data some function like this
which shows up xln dox look up and then
you're trying to search for something so
don't be uh surprised with that so xln
is basically a prefix added to functions
that don't exist in the version of excel
you are using you have Excel 2013 and
say your friend has a new version of
excel say Office
365 or Excel
2016 and basically he uses your new cool
function and sends the file to you so
that's where you will have this xln
prefix as I'm showing up here so for
example what is the job title of Xavier
power is what you would want to search
and here the function which shows up
Xcel and X look up and then you are
searching so this is basically something
which is the function now if I just
select what it has selected here and if
I hit on enter it shows that this does
not work in my Excel here and that's
because of of the version but what I can
do is I can fix this by removing this
details here and that basically shows
lookup we are searching for job title
based on employee name which is in this
field
H6 and then we need to give a range so
we need to give a range of names
employee name and then basically the job
title range which is basically the job
title so now if I just hit on enter it
gives me the value so it's as simple as
that similarly here what is the employee
ID of the person with this email we have
already looked at the lookup function so
if it shows your xln X lookup all you
need to do is remove this and then keep
the lookup function searching for the
value based on the range of values and
then searching for a value within a
range of values so just hit on enter and
that gives you the value and same thing
goes for this job title so what is the
job title and salary of employee name so
we have this function now what I can do
is here I'm interested in finding out
the value for this particular function
how do I fix this I can basically select
this and then just do a lookup based on
the values and it basically says you
can't change part of an array so we can
fix this now what we need to do is we
need to basically search based on this
particular value so we will basically
say I want to do a lookup now lookup
should be based on employee name
whatever name is given here then you
need to find the job title and salary so
for job title I want to find based on
employee name so I will give a
range and then basically I will say I'm
interested in finding out the job
title so I will give a different range
and then basically close this so that
basically shows now this is basically
because of the function which we have
here so basically to fix this what we
will have to do is we will have to
delete all the columns here which were
selected such as employee name job title
and salary because that was giving you
an error you cannot delete a part of an
array now what we want to do is we want
to find the job title and salary based
on the employee name so we can do that
using lookup as we have done earlier so
we will use a lookup function now what
we are interested in finding out is the
job title based on employee name so we
can select this cell which does not have
any value then we need to basically say
from which range or based on what you
want to search so we want to search
based on employee name and we want to
find out the job title so we can
basically give a range of values and
then we will be interested in finding
out the job title so let's select the
job title range and that basically
completes our lookup so let's close this
and hit on enter now it says obviously
error because this does not have any
value we will fix that by giving in a
value here same thing we can do for
salary so for example I can just drag
and drop it here and in this one instead
of basically having a range which is
your we will be interested in finding
out the salary
so let's see what is the range we give
so the range should be employee name so
we will basically select employee name
as the
range and then we are interested in
finding out the salary so we will select
this particular range and what we are
interested in finding out is basically
employee name or we are interested in
finding out based on employee name so
let's
select this particular column and and
then hit or enter so both of these are
na values now just feed in an employee
name so we will say for example Eduardo
and that basically gives me the job
title and salary so that's how you can
fix your Excel FN error so same thing
goes here so it shows you xln is what
you would want to search might be if you
don't find something you would want to
push in name not found so first is we
will have to fix this part so we will
have to remove this because that's not
supported in my Excel and then I have
lookup I'm searching based on
h24 which is basically employee ID
you're giving a range which is A2 to a21
because we would want to find name not
found for a particular employee ID so
I'm giving a range which is A2 to
a21 I'm trying to search for the name
which is from B2 to B21 and then I'm
giving name not found so say for example
we can do this lookup but then with
lookup you don't have this direct option
what we can do is we can use if
error if error and then basically try to
search so that gives your lookup value
and then you will have to close this one
and then again if if it gives you some
error like this we can obviously go for
V lookup and fix this so here we are
searching for a particular range and
then let's search for this value and
basically to fix this what I did was I
just use a v lookup so we know that
employee ID 121 does not exist so I'm
just using IF error I'm doing a v lookup
where I'm searching for the value given
in h90
and then I am saying that I would want
to search from a range which is
basically B1 to c21 that is in employee
name and say email address for example
and we would want to basically search
for name not found so we can instead of
giving B21 or B1 to c21 we can restrict
it to just B1 to
B21 we are searching in column 2
we are searching for exact value and if
it does not find then it says name not
found and that's how we do it so we can
always replace and fix this Excel FN
errors if you are
using uh some spreadsheet which was or
Excel which was sent
by um someone else who is using a
different version so in this way we can
use your D different lookup functions
take care of your errors use index match
we are here with an amazing course
through which you can catch the eye of
top Recruiters in the industry here is
post-graduate program in data analytics
by simply learn so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll Now find the
course Link in the description box in
this video we will learn some of the
important features and functionalities
of power Query in Excel also we'll be
doing an extensive Hands-On
demonstration using various data sets
so if you want the data sets and the
demo files then please put your email
IDs in the comment section of the video
I'll team will send you the files over
email let's
begin so what is Excel power
query power query is an advanced feature
of Microsoft Excel that allows you to
prepare your data for analysis you can
perform numerous text computations and
numerical analysis to make your data
more powerful and informative Excel
power query is a data preparation and
transform engine it allows you to carry
out the extract transform and load
operations on the data sets from
multiple sources now let's look at the
challenges solved by power
query earlier in Excel there was
difficulty in data connections Now using
power query you can connect to a broad
range of data sources such as relational
databases web files text CSV Json files
and even fetch data in the cloud volume
variety and velocity are the
characteristics that define Big Data it
was a major problem to handle such data
now power query enables you to transform
your data to an appropriate size it also
allows you to work on any shape of data
from any
Source earlier updating your data and
refreshing it in real time was an issue
using power query a repeatable process
query is adopted to update the data in
real time and in the
future in Excel it was not so easy to
Res AP transform and manipulate data but
using power query provides a highly
interactive experience and sophisticated
tools to prepare your data
now from Excel 2016 onwards power query
on Windows has been fully integrated
into Excel but in Excel 2010 and 2013
for Windows powerquery is a free addin
you can go ahead and download the link
once installed the power query tab will
be visible in the Excel ribbon now
coming to the features of power query so
Excel power query allows you to clean
transform manipulate and process your
data for analysis it helps you to
automate repetitive task that you want
to do it over and over again you can
search for data sources and make
connections as and when you want Power
query helps you to prepare and shape the
data in the right format for performing
analysis and finally once your data is
ready you can share your findings or use
your query to create interactive reports
and
dashboards now let's have a glance at
the demo that we are going to work on in
this
video so we look at how to load data
from different
sources you will understand how to
extract tables from web files so we'll
extract tables present on Wikipedia
Pages then you'll learn how to sort and
filter
data up next you'll see how to group
your data how to split a column into
multiple columns and then pivote and
unpivot your
table then date columns and make some
transformation
understand how to append tables and
merge tables vertically and horizontally
now let's open msxl and start with
importing a simple text file so you can
see here I have my Excel file opened and
in the middle you can see I have my
employee txt file now this is a comma
separated file meaning that the values
are separated by commas as you can see
it here the columns have been separated
by commas and all the values have a
comma between
them now this text file has information
about the name age company and the city
to which the employee belongs to let's
see how easily you can import this EMP
text file into Ms XEL here I'm using
Excel 365 or Office 365 where power
query on Windows has been fully
integrated into this version of excel so
what I'll do is first let's go to the
data Tab and you have this section
called get and transform data so I'll
click on get data under get data I'll go
to from
file and select from text SL
CSV once I click on it it will ask me to
give the location where the file is
there so my file is on desktop I'll
click on power query files and here you
can see I have my employee txt file you
can see the type here it says text
document click on EMP and hit
import now this will take some time to
import the file onto
Excel it's a stab arees and connections
so we have made one query and have
loaded the employee data it gives a
preview also you can see it here and if
needed later you can go to edit and
change some values that we'll see later
now you can use this data to create
simple visualizations so let me show you
how to do it so let's first select the
data and we'll go to the insert tab
under insert tab I'll click on
recommended
charts let's say I want to know how many
employees belong to a particular City so
I'll click on the second chart which
says the count of Name by City And I'll
click on okay
here you can
see we have a nice clustered bar chart
and you can see in Bangalore there were
five employees in Hyderabad we had two
and in nask we had one you can see the
count here this is a pivot
table if you go back to our actual data
here you can see in Bangalore we had
Vidya Sonam ainash vun and himani and
there were two more people from
Hyderabad and one from nask so you can
use the Excel power query feature to
import data onto Excel and make some
visualizations now if you want to fetch
some data that is present on the web or
on the Internet Excel power query
features and functionalities can help
you import those data as well we will
now see how to import data specifically
a table that is present on the web here
I'll be using a Wikipedia article on the
list of European Cup and UFA Champions
League finals let me show you the page
first so this is my Wikipedia page on
the list of European Cup and UFA
Champions League finals if I scroll down
you can see all the details here and I
would like to import this table which
has the list of all the finals so we
have columns like season winners score
line Runners up venue and attendance
let's import this table onto
Excel so I'll copy this URL first now
let me open a new sheet I'll go to sheet
one and then on the data tab under the
get data section I'll go to from other
sources and here I have from web which
allows me to import data from the web
either you can follow this path or if
you see here there's an option to get
data from the web if I click on
this it is asking me to enter the URL so
I'll paste the URL of the Wikipedia page
here and let's click on
okay now it's navigating and okay you
can see Power query feature in Excel has
given us a list of tables which you can
see here we have something called as
document there's a key table and here
you can see there's one table which was
extracted from the Wikipedia page and
the table which I'm interested in is
this table which has the list of
European Cup finals you can see it
here Excel power query feature has
automatically detected these rows and it
has given
a list of columns as well you can see
these are the
columns now we'll explore the transform
data tab present in the
power query now if I click on transform
data it will take me to the power query
editor Let me just click on refresh now
this is the most important
section using the power query editor you
can clean your data filter your data
manipulate your data and make it ready
for
analysis now let's explore a few tabs
available here so we have a Home tab
that has a section you can see you can
reduce rows manage columns sort the data
transform the data combine different
tables now there's another tab called
transform which allows you to select
your data type transpose your rows and
columns pivote and unpivot your columns
and here you can see you can find out
some summary
statistics and you can manage your date
values as well now if you want to add
some new columns to your data you can do
that as well and you also have a view
tab now
here if you see the first two rows the
values are the same you can see season
season these are all repeated which we
actually don't need and these are pretty
similar to our column names similarly if
I scroll down you see there are some
rows
which have null values so actually these
rows do not add up any value or do not
add any value to our data so we'll clean
this data
first so let's see how to do it now if
you want to remove certain rows in the
table what you can do is go to the Home
tab and under reduce rows click on
remove rows and then choose remove top
rows
if I select remove top rows it will ask
me how many rows do you want to remove
from the top you can see it here I'll
give I want to remove the top two rows
now let's click on okay you will
see that the Excel power query editor
has removed the first two rows and on
the right you can see the steps that
were
applied you can see it here previously
we had these two rows which were
redundant
and once we applied the step it has
removed the first two rows similarly
let's go down and remove the last 1 2 3
4 5 so we are going to remove the last
seven rows from the
table so again I'll go to reduce rows
and click on remove rows now this time
I'll select remove bottom
rows and here I'll choose
I want to delete seven rows from the
table from the bottom I click on okay if
you
see the last seven rows have been
deleted now let me show you the last row
which is this one so the last season of
Ufa Champions League was held in 2020
which is this year and Bayern Munich won
the Champions League against a French
team that was Paris St Chans by a score
of
10 now if you see the last value that is
the
attendance is zero which means there
were no Spectators in the stadium it was
because of the covid
conditions now let's do some more
manipulation to our data suppose this
time I want to add a new column let's
say a stadium name by extracting values
from the venue column so let me just
show you the venue column so this is our
venue column so the first value is the
stadium name then we have the city in
which the stadium is there and finally
we have
the country name so I want to extract
only the stadium name so you can see we
have some stadiums like Santiago
babo there Wembley
sanso and other stadium so I want to
extract only the stadium names so let's
see how to to do that I'll click on the
venue column and go to add column tab
under add column here you can see we
have extract if I click on this drop
down there's an option to select text
before D limiter so if I choose text
before D limiter here I'll give my D
limiter as comma so everything before
the first comma will be considered as
the state name now let me click on
okay now here you can see under applied
steps it says
inserted text before D limiter if I
scroll to the right you can see the last
column has a stadium names let me double
click on this and change this to stadium
name
column and hit enter even this step is
applied here you can see renamed column
similarly let's explore a few more
features now I want to add a new column
called stadium city so if you consider
this venue column whatever is there
between the two commas is the stadium
city for example Santiago bernabo is in
Madrid similarly Wembley Stadium is in
London sanso is in Milan so these medal
values I want to extract into a new
column called as stadium city so let's
see how to do it so I'll click on the
venue column and go to extract and again
I'll select the extract Tab and here now
I'll choose text between D
limitter and my first D limitter I'll
give is a
comma and a space you can see here all
the values have a comma and a space and
my end Del limiter will be another
comma then I'll click on okay this will
add a new
column to the extreme right of the table
you can see here we have text between D
limits and it has extracted the stadium
city let me go ahead and rename this
column as
stadium city and hit enter you can see
the applied step
here
now I want to split the score column
into two columns so here we have the
score column
and the left value presents the number
of goals that were scored by the winning
team and the right value presents the
number of
goals that were scored by the losing
team so here I'll split the column into
two columns as winner score and loser
score so what I'll do is Select this
column and go to the Home tab under the
Home tab we have split column I'll
select split column and then choose by D
limiter so automatically Excel power
query detects that this Dash is my D
limiter and I'll split at each
occurrence of the D
limiter let's click on
okay now you can
see the score column has been split into
two it has renamed the column as score.
one and score
do2 what I'll do is I'll go ahead
and will'll rename this column as winner
score and this will rename it to Loser
score I'll hit enter and I have renamed
it
successfully next let's change the
winnner team and the runners up team
values to upper case so suppose I want
to change all the values or the club
names of the winners team to upper case
so what I can do is I'll select this
column and go to the transform tab under
the transform tab I have this option
called
format so here I'll click on format and
then you can see I can change the case
to lower case upper case capitalize each
word so here I want to make all the
winner teams as upper case I'll select
upper
case there you go we have successfully
converted all the winner team names to
upper case similarly Let's Do It For The
Runners Sub team as well so here I have
my Runner sub team I'll go to the
transform tab click on format and select
uppercase now we saw how to do some
simple manipulation of our data so we
created a few columns split a few
columns now to save all this I have to
go to the Home tab and then click on
close and
upload this will take some time and load
our data onto this Excel
sheet you can see here it's loading the
data this will take a bit of time there
you
go Excel power query feature has
successfully performed some
manipulations on our data some
calculations on our data and then it has
saved the final version and loaded it on
to excel Now using this clean data we
can do some analysis let's say I want to
find the seasons in which the winners
team scored more than three goals so we
have a problem statement at hand where
we want to find the seasons in which the
winner team had more than three goals
scored so what you can do is select any
cell in this data and go to the insert
Tab and click on pivote table here I'll
click on existing worksheet and then
I'll give my location I'll place my
pivote table somewhere here and click on
okay all right now since I want to know
the seasons I'll drag season onto row
and I'll also drag the winners team
column onto
rows then I'll choose my winner score
under values here you can see we have
the peoe table
ready now we need to filter this table
to see all the winning teams that scored
more than three goals so what I'll do is
I'll select this winner score column and
place it under
filters and here you can see I have my
filter let me click on this drop- down
and I'll select multiple items from this
multiple items I'll choose 4 5 and 7
because these values are greater than
three and click on okay here you can see
I have filtered my P table and left you
can see the season
and the winner team that had scored more
than three goals in the
finals all right similarly you can
perform some more analysis suppose I
want to know how many times Real Madrid
won the championship so let's see I'll
click on one cell in the data set go to
the insert Tab and click on pivot
table I'll choose existing worksheet and
give my location here let's say I want
to place my pivote table here and click
on okay all right so the question we
have is how many times have Real Madrid
won the championship so I'll
choose the winners team column and place
it under
row and let's say We'll select the
winner score as
well and let's convert this winner score
from sum to let's say count and click on
okay and since I want to check only for
Real Madrid so what I'll do is I'll go
to the insert Tab and I'll insert a
slicer here I'll choose winner teams as
my slicer and click on okay and out of
this I want to choose only Real Madrid
so I'll select Real Madrid you can see
it here Real Madrid have won the
championship 13
times okay let's say you want to
compress your data and remove
unnecessary columns without losing any
information you can do that using a
feature in the power query editor called
unpivot to perform this task we'll use a
sensus data of India from Wikipedia so
let me first show you the Wikipedia
page so this is my Wikipedia article
which says list of states in India by P
population and and if I scroll down you
can see it here there's a table which
says by P population from 1947 to
2011 so there are a few columns like
rank this state or Union territory and
we have population starting from 1951
till 2011 which was our last
census here you can see if I scroll
further there are nearly 29 States and
we have seven union territories so we
will extract this table and load into
Excel
first okay so let me click on a new
sheet and we'll follow the same drill
I'll go to my data
Tab and click on get data under get data
I'll go to from other sources and click
on from
web here it will ask me to provide the
URL link of the Wikipedia page so I'll
paste the URL here and click on okay
now once I have done that it will load a
few tables onto Excel you can see there
are a few tables here I'll click on the
first one so we have our table here now
let's do some transformation to this
data this opens in the power query
editor okay I'll click on refresh
first this will take some time to
refresh the entire data okay we are done
now if you see this data
clearly the first row in this table is
not necessary at all because these are
our column names so we also have our
column headers already present so let's
go ahead and delete the first row so
we'll go to the Home tab under remove
rows I'll click on remove top
rows now I'll give
my number of rows as one so we want to
remove the first row only I'll click on
okay
you can see the first row has been
deleted if I scroll
further I actually don't need the last
row as well which is the total so what
we can do is we can also remove the last
row from the
bottom so I'll select one click on okay
you can see the step has been applied
and you don't see the last row that was
the total row anymore
so the task that I want to do here is I
want to
compress all these columns which are
basically the population
columns so I'll select my state or Union
territory column and go to the transform
Tab and here I have the option to
unpivot columns so I'll click on this
drop- down and select unpivot other
columns you can see here the step has
been applied and all the population
column from 1951 till 2011 have been
unpotted if you want you can go ahead
and rename these columns let's say I'll
write it as population
column
and let's say this
is I'll rename it to total population
value
all right now we are done with our
preparation of data let's go to the Home
tab and click on close and
load now this will take some time to
load the data onto
Excel all right so we have our Census
Data here so first you can see rank one
is uttar Pradesh and we have the
population starting from 1951 till 2011
then we have for Maharashtra if I scroll
down down you can see the other states
we have Tamil Nadu Rajasthan there
Karnataka if I scroll further we have
udisha this telengana Kerala now if you
see here the population values from 1951
till 2011 for the telengana state are
all na which means there was no data
available now this is because telengana
was only formed in 2014 so there was no
census for this
state let's continue with our demo and
let's explore a few more features and
functionalities of powerquery
editor now the next table we are going
to use is an adventure Works customer
table now this data set is provided by
Microsoft for practitioners who want to
learn powerbi Excel or similar
Technologies and want to do some
manipulation some calculation some data
analysis stuff so let me go to a new
sheet and let's import the adventure
Works customer data set it's a CSV file
onto Excel first so I'll go to my data
Tab and click on get data from here I'll
go to from file and
choose from text SL
CSV you can see it here in my power
query files folder I have my adventure
Works customer table I'll select this
and click on
import this will take some time to load
the data set you can see the preview of
the data set here so we have columns
like the customer key we have the prefix
of the customer name the first name the
last name of the customer date of birth
marital status if I go to the right we
have annual income total children
education level occupation and homeowner
column as well so let's click on
transform
data here we'll learn a few more
features of power query
okay we have our data on our power query
editor so first what I'll show you is
let's change the prefix column the first
name column and the last name column to
proper case so you can see it here the
prefix first name and last name columns
are all in uppercase now if you want to
change the values to proper case
just hit control and select the three
columns
and go to the trans form tab under
transform tab you have
format so if click on format here you
can see we have lower case upper case
now proper case is to capitalize each
word so I'll click on capitalize each
word you can see it here now we have
converted the prefix first name and last
name column into prop case The Next Step
I'm going to show you is let's merge all
the three column colums the prefix
column the first name column and the
last name column into one full name
column so what I'll do is I'll select
the three
columns and then let's go to add column
and under add column we have this option
called merge columns let's hit merge
columns okay now it's asking you to give
the separator I'll select my separator
as a space
and click on
okay okay so before click on okay I want
to change my new column name from merged
to let's see full
name and now let's click on
okay you can see here it says inserted
merged column and if I go to my right
you can see it here we have a full name
column now if you want to shift the
location of the full name column you can
do that as well just hold this and keep
on dragging to the
left this will move the
entire table to the right and you can
place it wherever you want so I want to
place it let's say
here
okay now actually I don't want all these
columns so let's delete it so click on
this and I'll right click I click on
remove you can see we have removed the
prefix column similarly let's remove the
other two columns you can either right
click and do or go to the Home tab and
then select remove
columns all right
now let's say we want to add a domain
name column from AWS customers by
extracting the characters between at
theate
andom so actually I'm talking about the
email address from this email address we
want to create a new column called as
domain name for that we'll extract
characters that are present between
atate
and.com so let's see how to do it I'll
select the email address column and then
I'll go to add column under add column
I'll click on extract and this time we
want to extract between two dmit so I'll
select text between DMS and I'll give my
starting limiter as at the
rate and my end D limiter would be
Doom now let's click on
okay so this will insert a new column to
the extreme right you can see we have
our domain name let's go ahead and
change the column name to domain name
and hit
enter all right you can see the step has
been
applied now we are done
with our preparation of customers table
let's just go to the Home tab and click
on close and
load so all the transformation that we
did in the power query editor will
reflect here so you can see we have our
full name
column and if you see we have our domain
name as
well okay using the power query editor
you you can perform some statistical
analysis now let's explore those
statistical features for this we'll be
using another data set called Adventure
Works product data set again this data
set is also provided by
Microsoft so let's go to the new sheet
and here I'll go to the data tab click
on get data under from files I click on
text SL CSV here you can see we have
Adventure work products I click on
import let's click on transform
data so we have our data loaded onto the
power query
editor the data is mostly clean alter
this data let's straight away go ahead
and explore some of the statistical feat
features that we have here now let's say
if you want to find the total number of
product names in the product
table we have this product name column
and say if you want to find the total
number of product names in the table how
to do it so what you can do is click on
this product name column then go to the
transform tab now in the transform tab
you have an option called statistics
click on the is drop down and select
count
values now this will open another
window that will return the total number
of products in the table you can see the
value here it says
293 now to move back to the query editor
so let's just click cancel or close we
are back again all right now let's say
you want to calculate the average
product price from the product table so
if I move to the right you have a column
called Product price so let's see what
is the average product price from the
product table so I'll select this
product price column go to the transform
tab under statistics I'll select average
so this will give me the average product
price which
is
714
4373 you can consider any unit you want
let's say this is in dollars now again
we have to cancel this step to move
back
okay now if you want to find the maximum
and minimum product price you can do
that as well so let me select my column
product price and go to the transform
tab under the transform tab we'll click
on this status drop down and let's say
I'll select minimum so this will give me
the minimum product price which is
2.29 similarly if if you want to find
the maximum product price so select this
product price column go transform Tab
and then choose
maximum so this is the maximum product
price in the product table we have let's
cancel this
step okay now you can also round the
product cost and product price column to
two decimal places so if I show you both
the columns you have your product cost
and you have the product price column
you can see the floating values or the
decimal points are not constant it's
varying so let's limit it to two decimal
places what you can do is Select both
the columns and then go to the transform
tab in the transform tab you have here
rounding I'll click on this drop- down
and select
round now here I'll give my decimal
places as
two if I click on okay you can see here
both the columns the product cost and
the product price column have been
rounded up to two decimal
places I can scroll down you can see all
the values have been rounded up to two
decimal places all
right now let's say you want to add a
column called discount price column by
multiplying .9 to the product price
column and let's say you also want to
round that new column to 2 de places so
how to do
it so we want to give a discount of 10%
so I'll select this product price column
go colum and then I'll choose custom
column here we'll write a
formula so I'll give my new column name
as discount
price and my formula would
be I'll select product price
I'll click on insert and then I'll
multiply this product price by
0.9 so this will give me my 10% discount
on the product price and click on
okay you see here we have a new column
added which is Discount price
so if the product price is
34.99 if you give a 10% discount it's
31491
all right now the next question was to
change the or round the decimal places
to two so I'll go to the transform tab
under rounding I'll click on
round let's say I'll give two and click
on
okay so even this has rounded the
discount price column to two decimal
places now we are done with our math
before making any English United States
instead of English India
so I'll just scroll down and here we
have I click on okay now once this is
done I'll go to my data type and I'll
select date as my data type I'll choose
replace
current okay now you can see my date
column has been formatted the date tab
you can see I have access to all this
operations on this date column column
go to add column here under add column I
have select those so I'll click on this
d d let's say I'll click on close and
load now this will load
the data set onto Excel you can see it
here we have the data ready now you can
use this data to make some
analysis draw a pivote table draw a
pivote chart and do a whole lot of
things
now while working on a project it is
possible that not all your data will be
in a single file it could be stored in
multiple files so it's important to
combine and bring all your data together
now we will see how to join your data
vertically I have my data present in a
CSV folder so let me show you the folder
first so this is my CSV folder let me
open it and I have some files these are
named as project 1 2 3 4 and 5
let me open just one of the project
files it has a very small quantity of
data you can see it has a month column
and an amount column let me close
this and let me show you to you again
let's open project
4 all the files have the same number of
columns you can see this also has a
month column and an amount
column now we'll combine all this data
together and load it into Excel let's
see how to do it so I'll open a new
sheet and I'll go to my data Tab and
click on get data then I'll go to from
file and this time I'll choose from
folder now this will ask me to give the
you can see it here it says sheet
one
okay now it's processing all the data
files present present in that CSV
folder and this will be uploaded onto
our power query
editor now you can see here on the power
query
editor all my data files have been
combined vertically here you can see the
month
column on the extreme right it's the
amount column and to the extreme left we
have the source name or the source file
where the data came from so first is
Project one then we have project two if
I scroll down we have project three
files project 4 and similarly we have
project 5 now this is one way in which
you can mge your tables vertically so we
are done with it let's just go to the
Home tab and click on close and
load all the transformation that were
applied you can see it here we have our
final
table and we have successfully
combined five Excel
files again you can also join your data
horizontally this would be like an SQL
join where the data is present in
multiple files or sheets based on a
common key column you can join the
tables so you can perform a left join a
right join an inner join based on the
problem that you are trying to solve so
let's merge two tables based on a column
I'll show the data set first it's an
Excel file which has three worksheets
s so here is my Excel file which we'll
be using to merge our data horizontally
you can see there are three
worksheets the first one is year 11
which has data regarding the student
name the gender of the student and the
course the student had opted for
similarly we have another for 2012 or
year 12 we have the student name gender
as well as the
course and finally we have a courses
table or a courses sheet which has all
the details regarding the course so we
have the course name the teacher who
teaches or teacher who taught that
course we have the lesson type the
number of credits and the assignment
type now we'll use this data sets to
load it onto Excel using power
query so I am on my Excel sheet let's
just open a new sheet I'll go to the
data Tab and here I'll click on get data
and this time I'll choose
from Excel workbook and I'll select my
file which is students and courses I
click on
import so we'll just see how to import
two tables and join them horizontally so
let me first select the courses sheet
and I'll click on transform
data now this has loaded the courses
table onto power query editor the table
looks fine we have the course column
teacher everything is fine now let's
load one more table and then we'll merge
it so here under the Home tab you have a
section called new source I'll click on
file I'll again select my students and
courses and click on
import and this time let's choose
another table let's say year 11 which
has the column name as student gender
and course I click on
okay it has successfully loaded this
table onto power query
editor now if you say this the first row
is actually
are column names so I'll go to the Home
tab and select use first row as headers
so this will push the first row to the
column names you can see we have done it
successfully we have my student name the
gender column and the course
column now let's merge it so if you see
here in the Home tab we have a section
called merge
queries let's click on this drop down
and select merge
queries here I have my table which is
year 11 and let's choose one more table
that
is
courses now the kind of join I'll choose
as left outer join which means it will
take all the rows from the first table
and matching records from the second
table here I need to select the common
key column so if you see both the tables
we have the course column as the common
key column so I'll select this and now
you can see there's a tick Mark which
means it has selected the rows and the
columns successfully you can see it says
the selection matches 175 175 rows from
the first table and let's click on
okay let's just expand
this and click on
okay if I scroll to the right you can
see I have successfully merged both the
tables now if you want
you can remove
unnecessary rows or columns suppose if
you see I have the course column from
the year 11 table and here also I have
the course column now this is redundant
let's just remove one of the columns
I'll just select this column I'll go to
remove columns and I'll select remove
columns okay the rest looks fine we have
successfully
merged both the tables by using a left
outer
join let's just click close And
load now this will take some time to
load our data onto Excel you can see it
here we successfully loaded it onto
Excel now we are done with our demo
part now let's just see what all we have
done in our demo so I'll go to my my
first sheet here you can see we had
imported a simple text file first and
then we plotted
a graph which is a pivote chart then you
saw how to
upload a file from the web so here we
imported a UFA Champions Le table which
was present on Wikipedia and then we
plotted some graphs and charts s you can
see we made some analysis using pivot
tables and then we imported another web
file which was based on a population
data and we used the unpivot option or
the unpivot feature in the power query
to reduce the number of
columns then we made some calculations
to our customer table which was from
Adventure works then we used another
table called the products table here we
saw
some statistical calculations and we
added a column called discount price
where we used conditional
operations and then you saw how we
manipulated a date
column and then we saw how to append and
merge multiple tables in this video
we'll be creating two dashboards using a
sample sales data set so if you want to
get the data and the dashboard file that
we'll be creating in this demo then
please put your email IDs in the comment
section of the video our team will share
the files via
email now let's begin by understanding
what is a dashboard in
Excel a dashboard is a visual interface
that provides an overview of key
measures relevant to a particular
objective with the help of charts and
graphs dashboard reports allow managers
to get a high level overview of the
business and help them make quick
decisions there are different types of
dashboards such as strategic dashboards
analytical dashboards and operational
dashboards
an advantage of dashboards is the quick
detection of outliers and
correlations with Comprehensive data
visualization it is time-saving as
compared to running multiple
reports with this understanding let's
jump into our demo for creating our
dashboards we'll be using a sample sales
data set let me show you the data set
first so here is the sales data set that
we'll be using for our demo so this data
set was actually generated using a
simulator and is completely random it
was not validated though we have applied
certain transformations to the data
using power query features so this data
as you can see has thousand rows so
using the simulator we had generated
thousand rows of
data similarly if I go on top you can
see this data set has 17 columns now let
me give you a brief about each of the
columns so first we have the region
column so we have have Middle East and
North Africa there North America Asia
subsaharan Africa and others similarly
we have the country names from which the
item was ordered the third column is the
item type so we have different items
Cosmetics vegetables there's baby food
cereal fruits Etc then we have the
representatives name or you can see this
as the customer name who ordered the
product then we have a sales Channel
column so there are basically two
channels whether the item was sold
offline or online next we have the order
priority column now here C stands for
critical then we have H which is for
high priority orders then we have M for
medium priority orders and finally we
have L which is for low priority orders
you can see the order date column then
we have the order ID the ship date next
we have units sold which is basically
the total number of units sold for each
item then we have the unit price column
this is the price at which each product
was sold then we have the unit cost
column which is basically the production
cost for each of the items next we have
the total revenue the total revenue is
actually the product of unit sold and
unit price then we have the total cost
column now the total cost column is
actually the product of unit sold and
the unit cost similarly we have the
total profit column so total profit is
the difference between total revenue and
the total cost and finally we have
created two more columns that is order
year and then we have order month now
these two columns were actually
generated using the power query features
so we use the order date column which is
this column and extracted order year and
Order
month so first we have going to create a
revenue dashboard where we'll focus on
generating reports for Revenue by order
year Revenue by year and region Revenue
by order priority and much more we'll
create separate P tables and po charts
and format them to make them look more
interesting and presentable We'll add
slices and timeline to our dashboards in
order to filter it based on specific
Fields now let's create our first report
to see the total revenue generated each
year so we need to create a poot table
for for this I'll click on a cell in my
data set and then I'll go to the insert
tab here we have the option to select
the pivote table I click on this you can
see my table range is
selected next I want to place my pivote
table in a new worksheet and let's just
click on okay there you go so we have a
new sheet where I can place my P
table so first I need to find the total
revenue generated by each year so what
I'll do is I'll drag my order year
column under rows and then I'll select
the total revenue column under
values you can see I have my P chart
ready now if you want you can sort this
so from the data you can see we have
order Year from 2010 to
2017 now B based on this data let's
create our pivote chart so I'll click on
any
cell go to insert and here you have the
option to select recommended charts I
click on this now actually I want a line
chart so I'll click on line here and
select
okay there you go so we have
successfully created our first pivote
chart now let me show you how you can
format this chart to make it more
readable so first let me delete these so
I'll right click and select hide all
field buttons on the chart so this will
delete the buttons present on the chart
now let me go ahead and edit the chart
title so the title I want is total
revenue I'll type it
down by
Year all right next let's let's do a few
more
Transformations so if I click on this
plus sign which is actually for chart
elements we have some options like to
add access access titles chart title
data labels this grid lines Legend and
others okay so let's remove the legend
now you can see the total Legend is gone
now let me add access titles so we'll
label our x-axis and y axis so here
under
x-axis I can write it
as
ear similarly on the y axis I'll put
Revenue okay now you can move a bit all
right
now let me select this chart Style
option and go to Colors
first here I'll select yellow color okay
and then let me go back to style let's
select a new style from this
list I
want this style okay now you can also
add data labels so I'll just click on
data labels you can see we have the
revenue for each of the years now this
is not readable at all so will format
this a
bit if I click on this Arrow here I have
more
options if I scroll down you can see we
have something called as number here
I'll expand this and under category I'll
select
custom now here we'll give a format
code which is a bit
different so this is actually a kind of
formula so I'll write if my Revenue
value is greater than let's say 9 lakh
999,000 let me make sure there are six
nines here so 1 2 3 4 5 and six okay we
are good to go I'll close the
bracket I'll give a
hash give two commas
so if the revenue is greater than 9 lakh
99,000 I'll put it in the format of
millions So within double quotes I'll
write
M I'll give a
semicolon followed by another
hash and if the value is less than the
desired
number it should be 0 million let me
click on ADD all right you can see how
nicely we have formatted our data and
you see here we have I'll select custom
and we will use this format that we
created for our previous chart there you
go we can see our access labels have
been changed in terms of millions now so
let's close this and let me save it now
you can reduce the font size or increase
the font size let me just show you
suppose you want to increase the font
size of the chart title so you just
select it and from here you can either
reduce or you can increase you can see
now it's 12 if you want you can make it
16 similarly you can also edit the
access labels also by selecting the
chart title you can also move it to left
or right or you can place it in the
center as the time being let me just
keep it to the left all right now we'll
see the revenue and total cost by each
region and we'll create a combo chart
for this so let me show you how to do it
I'll go to my data sheet I have my cell
selected go to insert and click on
pivote table let me just click on okay
all right so for this I'll select my
region onto
rows and
then I'll
have two columns under values the first
one is going to be total revenue and the
next column will be the total cost
column all right so here we have the
pivote table ready now based on this
pivote table let's create our pivote
chart so I'll go to recommended charts
and if you see below at the bottom we
have combo chart so this is the preview
of the combo
chart all right now let me just click on
okay there you go so we have a nice
combo chart ready here now the way to
look at it is the bars represent the
total revenue which is this
column now the line
represents the total cost so let me go
ahead and edit this chart a bit so first
of all let's delete the field buttons
all right and let's also remove the
legend from
here next we we'll add data labels so
I'll click on data labels here okay so
these are the data labels
for the bars or the revenue column now
let's format the data labels in terms of
millions so I'll click on this Arrow go
to more options if I scroll down I have
number from here I'll select custom
and I choose my type that is in millions
all right so you can see we have
formatted our data next thing we'll add
a chart title so here I'll write as
Revenue
by
region it's actually revenue and total
cost by region
before moving ahead let me rename the
sheets as well I'll write revenue
and total
cost
similarly sheet three also I'm going to
rename it as
Revenue go to the data sheet and create
our P table first I click on okay now
I'll select order priority under rows
and under values I'll select total
revenue so this is a very simple pivote
table so you have your order priority so
C is for critical H is for high L is for
low and M is you can see the different
country names and we have
the
revenue
cool now let me go ahead and rename this
sheet so I'll write
Revenue
by
countries and hit enter
okay and finally we'll create another
report which is going to be part of our
Revenue dashboard and this is revenue by
items so we'll visualize our revenue for
different items present in the table so
if you see this we have cost vegetables
cereal fruits the cloths snacks
households and other products as well so
let's check the revenue for each of
these
items so we'll continue the same drill
I'll create my P table on a new
worksheet and this time I'm going to
drag item type under row and we'll have
the total revenue under values so here
on the left of the table you can see we
have the different item names and then
we have the total revenue so let me just
short this total
revenue from largest to smallest so you
can see here office supplies meet the
highest amount of Revenue followed by
household then cosmetics and fruits meet
the lowest amount of
Revenue I'll click on this go to insert
and select recommended charts this time
I'm going to create a bar chart so this
is how my bar chart is going to look
like I'll select okay all right now
let's format this chart a
bit I'll delete the field buttons and
I'll delete the legend as
well
and let's edit the chart title so this
is going to
be
Revenue by items
cool we also want to change
the color of the bars so I have selected
all the bars I'll go to my home Tab and
here let's say I want to select green
color all
right I've edited my chart a bit
now
let's make
it for R and I'll remove the
Bold okay here if you want you can
change the font Also let's keep it in
blue color all
right finally let's rename this sheet so
I'll write Revenue by
items
cool finally now it's time for us to
merge all the charts that we have
created to our dashboard so let me show
you how you can create the dashboard
I'll create a new sheet and first thing
I'm going to do is I'll click on The
View Tab and uncheck grid lines so this
will remove the grid lines present in
the
worksheet next I'm going to insert an
image so we'll have a background image
on our dashboard so the way to do is
I'll go to the insert Tab and under
illustrations I have the option to
select pictures or insert pictures so
I'm going to insert
picture present on the device that is my
computer I'll go to desktop and here I
have a folder called Excel dashboard
files and I'll select this dashboard
background and hit
insert so this is going to insert an
image now let me just drag this image so
it covers a Fen of
portion so I'll hit shift and I'll drag
it all
right so you can see I have successfully
added a background image if you want you
can
still expand this background image a bit
to the right
cool now the next
thing is going to be the title of the
dashboard so I'll click on insert and
here I have the option to select a text
box so I'll click on a text box
and I'm going to place a text box in the
middle and I'm going to name this text
box as Excel
Revenue
dashboard on
sales
I'll centrer line
it let's do some more formatting so I'll
select this text box on the top you can
see shape
format here I'm going to expand this
shape fill and I'll select no fill so my
text box is transparent now and I'll
also remove the outline all right now
let me just double click on the title of
my dashboard and I'm going to
select a font you can select whichever
font you
want let me stick to britanica
bold and I'll increase the size to let's
say
30 all right I'll just drag the text
box I'll make the text as white instead
of black all right so we have
our title of the dashboard ready now if
you want you can also insert some icons
to this dashboard so I'll go to insert
and I'll click on illustrations again
and select pictures
I'm going to
add this two pictures which is of a
store and a
cart to make it
look visually appealing so I'll place
the
icons here and similarly let me just
copy
it and I'll place
the cart and the
store to the right as well
all
right
next the idea is
to bring in all the charts that we have
created and place it on the
dashboard so let me
copy each of the charts and place it on
the dashboard so I'll hit control V to
paste it
and we'll resize this as
well all
right similarly let me bring in all the
other charts as
well all right so now you can see I have
added all my charts and graphs to this
dashboard so you can see here we have
our line charts our column charts the
combo charts the Spy chart and others
now let me go ahead and format these
charts a little more so you can see this
looks a bit cluttered so let's adjust
the labels let me bring this down
similarly I'll bring 190
million a little
below all right this looks fine
now one more thing we are going to do
is we'll remove the white background
from each of the charts and make it
transparent so let me show you how to do
it so I'll select this chart then I'll
right click and go to format chart
area here on the right you see we have
an option called No fill so if I select
no fill you can see the white background
is gone now similarly let me also remove
the grid lines so I'll select the grid
lines and hit delete so you have also
removed the grid lines from here
now let's also remove the white outline
that we have so I'll select this chart
go to format and here I'll go to shape
outline and I'll select no outline you
see this so we have our total revenue by
year which is a line chart and this is
completely transparent now now what I'm
going to do is I'll place this chart
over a box so I'll go to insert and in
insert we have the option to create a
shape so I'll click on illustrations and
here I'll choose a shape and let me
select a rectangle so I'll just create a
rectangle
here all right and now what I'll do is
I'll select this and bring this to front
I'll right click and choose bring to
front and I'll place this shape
below it all right now the next thing is
to edit the shape so first I'll change
the color of this box so let me select
this blue color and and let me increase
the transparency so I'll right click and
go to format shape here I'll increase
the transparency let's keep it to
25% or let's say 20% all right
next thing we'll just convert all the
font to white
color including the axis labels the
chart
title will
also convert all
the access labels to white color so it
looks better now we'll just adjust
our chart over here
next thing let's just remove the outline
so I'll go to shape outline and I'll
select no outline you see we have now
formatted our chart let's just pull this
a little
up all right now we'll add this blue
background to all the other charts so
we'll first add the background make it
transparent and then we'll convert the
font text to white color to make it more
readable and visible so for the time
being I'll just pause the video and come
back
again all right so now you can see on
your screens we have nicely formatted
our dashboard so I have added a few
logos for each of the charts you can see
the logos here so for Revenue by
countries we have a globe then if you
see here this is kind of a map or a
location similarly we have all formatted
the color of the bars then we have also
formatted the labels in terms of
millions if you look on the Y AIS even
the revenue for year and region are all
formatted in terms of
millions if you want this you can also
format the total year by Revenue in
terms of millions so the way to do is
you can select this graph right click
and go to format access
here if I scroll down you have
numbers and under category I'll select
custom then I'll select my type as this
format which is in
millions and you see here we have
successfully formatted our y AIS
labels all right so the next thing is to
add slicers and timelines to our
dashboard now slic sers are used to
format your data based on a particular
column suppose if you want to see
Revenue by certain items you can add
item as a slicer and you can view the
entire dashboard similarly for timelines
you can add date columns so if you want
to see what was the amount of sales or
revenue generated on a particular year
or a particular month you can do that
using a timeline so I'll select one of
the charts and then either you can go to
the insert Tab and here you can see
under filters we have slices and
timeline or if you go to the pivote
Chart analyze tab here also you have
insert slicer and timeline option so I
select insert slicer here first now it's
giving me the list of fields present in
the data set so I'll select country
region and let's say we want to know by
item type and sales channel so these are
going to be my four slicers I'll click
on
okay you can see it here we have our
four slicers here and these are the list
of values under region we have Asia this
Europe North America and others
similarly we have the different country
names for Country slicers and then for
item type also we have have all the
items that were present in our data set
now moving ahead we need to connect all
the slicers to a dashboard so what I'll
do is I'll right
click on this option and I'll go to
report
connections okay so under report
connections you have all the pivote
tables that we
created you currently see only one of
the pivote table is selected so we need
to select all the P tables so let me
check all the P tables present in this
workbook and click on okay all right now
that we have connected one of our
slicers we'll now connect the other
remaining slicers so I'll right click on
this go to report connections and I'll
check all the pivote tables present in
this worksheet click on okay similarly
let's do it for the country ier I'll go
to report connections and let me
select all the pivote
tables and finally we have the item type
so I'll right click go to report
connections and then I'll select all my
Pivot
tables and let's hit okay all right now
let me just organize this a bit so I'll
place my Pivot
tables to the right
I'll just reduce the
size let me scroll
down I'll
add my region slicer
here
similarly I'll add my final slicer that
is sales Channel now in our next
dashboard which is going to be the
profit dashboard I'll show you how to
add a
timeline all right now I have arranged
all my
slicers so let's say you want to find
the revenue that was generated for an
item type let's say beverages so you can
just select beverages here and all your
charts show the respective revenues so
you have the total revenue by year for
for beverages
only similarly here you can see the
revenue by year and region only for
beverages item type if I scroll
down now this chart represents the
revenue that was generated in each of
the countries only for item type
beverages let me just uncheck
it all
right let's say you want to see
the revenue generated for a country like
India so I have selected India here and
now you can
see my graph has changed only for
country
India you can see here it is showing
only for India
now now similarly you can also filter
your revenues based on the different
regions let's say you want to know the
revenue generated
based on sales channel so we have two
sales channel that is offline and online
suppose you want to know the revenue
generated offline so I'll just select
offline you can see the values have
changed so these were the revenues
generated for each of the items only for
offline if you see here now these were
all the offline sales for the different
regions so
this is our entire Excel Revenue
dashboard on sales we created multiple
charts and graphs then we applied
different formatting we added different
icons then we formatted the labels also
next we added slicers and finally we saw
how we could filter our data based on
these
slicers likewise now we are going to
create a profit dashboard board based on
the same data so before moving ahead let
me rename this sheet as Revenue
dashboard I'll write
R dashboard
okay now we'll move to our data sheet
and start creating our P tables and poo
charts for the profit
dashboard all right so let me go ahead
and create my first pivot table
so I'll create a new
worksheet this time I'm going to create
a line chart to visualize the profit for
each year so I'll drag my total profit
column to values and my order year to
rows so here you can see we have
our pivote table ready now you can sort
this data to get an idea as to which
year had the highest profit and which
year had the lowest profit so from this
pivote table you can see since I've
sorted this data in descending order so
2014 had the maximum amount of profit
and 2017 had the least amount of profit
I'll just do control Z to undo it all
right now based on this P table let me
go ahead and create my P chart so I'll
go to recommended charts and click on a
line chart so this is the preview of the
chart
I'll click on okay let me close this
similarly we are going
to edit this chart now so first I'll
hide all the field buttons present on
the chart and I'll rename the chart
title as
total
profit by
year next I'm going to remove the legend
so I'll delete
this let's do some more formatting
so I'll go to
style
and this
time I'm going to
select my style type okay and if you
want you can choose the colors as well
for the time being let's have this
yellow color next let me add the data
labels so again if you see here this is
not formatted properly so let's go ahead
and format
the data labels so I'll click on
number and I'll select custom
here and the type I'm going to select is
in millions and I'll click on close so
here you can see we have
our line chart ready which shows total
profit by year let's rename this sheet
as
profit by
Year all right now let's move back to
our data sheet
again next we are going to show the
total profit by countries for this I'm
going to create a map so let me first
create my pivote table so I'll go to
insert and I'll click on pivote
table let me click on
okay since I want the country names so
I'll select country under rul and then I
I have my total profit under
values the next thing I'm going to do is
I'll just rename the RO labels as
countries and then I'm going to delete
the grand total which you can see at the
bottom so here we have the grand total
let me just delete the grand total so
I'm going to select this P table go to
the design tab here we have sub totals
and Grand totals I
switch off the grand total let me just
verify it again I'll scroll down you see
the grand total has gone now all right
now we want to create a map out of this
the way to do is I'm going to select my
data copy it I'll go on top and I'll
paste it here using this data I can
create my field map now so I'll go to
insert here we have the option to create
a field map there you go you can see we
have our map ready I can expand this now
as you can see our map has a color scale
which comes from light gray color to
dark blue color so the countries that
are in Gray or you can say light blue
have the lowest amount of profit while
the regions or the countries that have
been shaded
in dark color or dark blue color have
highest amount of profit I will go ahead
and delete this
scale okay next we need to connect this
map to the original data source so what
I'll do is I'll right click on this map
and I'll go to select data here instead
of the previous range I'll give my new
Range now so my new Range will be my
original P table that I had created I'll
go on top and click on okay so we have
our map ready now now if you want you
can change the color of the shade so
I'll just go to colors and let's say
we'll keep green
color so the countries that are shaded
in dark green have the highest amount of
profit while those which are highlighted
in light green color are are the
countries that made least amount of
profit okay now moving
on
next we want to create a pivote table
that will show us the profit by year and
sales channel so for this we are going
to create another line chart I'll go to
insert and click on pivote table so I'll
select new worksheet here since I want
to know the profit by year first of all
I'll drag my order year column to rows
and then
I'll choose my total profit column under
values next I'm going to select my sales
Channel under columns there you go so we
have our pivot table here based on this
pivote table let me create my P chart so
I'll go to recommended charts and I'm
going to create a line
chart I close
this you see here based on this chart
you can tell the profit generated with
online sales were actually lower than
that of offline so here the Blue Line
represents offline profit and the Orange
Line represents Online Profit if you
Mark Clearly in year 2012 the Online
Profit was actually higher than the
offline profit so let me go ahead and
edit this chart a bit so we'll delete
the field buttons I'll also delete the
legend for now let me go ahead and add a
chart title so I'll
write
profit
by year
and sales
Channel
okay so this is my second report before
moving ahead let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write profit
by
countries
similarly let me rename this sheet as
profit by year and let's say SC for
sales
Channel
okay moving
ahead now I want to create a pie chart
based on a pivot table that will show
The Profit by sales Channel only so this
is going to be a simple pie chart so
I'll first go to insert click on pivote
table and click on okay so I'll drag my
sales Channel under row and then we'll
have the total profit column under
values so this is my simple pivote table
now let's create our pivote chart which
is going to be a pie chart let me
explore the other types of pie charts we
have okay so I'm going to select a donut
chart here I click on okay
let's edit this chart I'll remove the
field buttons let me now remove the
legend as well I'll just resize it and
this is going to
be
profit
by sales
Channel
okay let's also
add data
labels and here again I'm going
to format this
label I'll select the category as custom
and my type will be in millions okay let
me just move
this to the
left and this to the right
okay let's also delete the lines
cool now let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write profit
by let's say which stands for sales
Channel cool finally I'm going to create
a report that will show the revenue and
profit by items so I'll go ahead and
create my pivote table first this time
I'll choose my total profit under
values and we'll also have the revenue
column
so I'll put my Revenue at the top then
I'm going to
select item type under rows so here is
my pivote table based on this pivote
table let me now create a combo chart so
you can see the preview of the chart the
blue bars represent the total revenue
and the Orange Line represents the total
profit I'll click on okay let me close
this
first let's remove the field
buttons let's also
remove the legend
here then we'll add a chart title I'll
name it
as
revenue
and
profit by
items okay if you want you can also go
ahead and change the color of the
bars so let me just
select one of these colors
okay all right so we have our five
reports ready that we are going to use
for our profit
dashboard next let's create a new sheet
and we'll get started with building our
dashboard so I'll click on a new sheet
let me just rename this as profit
dashboard
all right we'll continue with the
previous drill so first of all let's go
to the view Tab and remove the grid
lines now we'll insert a background
image like we did for our Revenue
dashboard so I'll go to insert under
illustrations I'll click on pictures and
select this device I'm going to have the
same background I'll click on
insert all right so you can see we have
a picture of a company or you can say an
organization let's just drag
this a bit to the
right we'll adjust the size
also all
right now let's copy the title of my
profit dashboard so here you can see I
have brought my Revenue dashboard
and I'll copy the title and the logos
that we used for the revenue
dashboard I'll paste it on my new
dashboard let's just align
it in the
center all right the next step let me
now go ahead and edit the title so this
is actually going to
be
Excel profit dashboard instead of renew
now
we'll copy each of the charts that we
just created for example the revenue and
profit by items then we
had profit by sales
Channel all this we are going to copy
one by one and put it on the profit
dashboard so let me just copy a few
now I'll paste it
here and later on we can make the
adjustment copy this as well
similarly I'll bring the other three
charts onto my sales
dashboard okay so here on my profit
dashboard I have added all the
charts and I have aligned and reshaped
it so that it looks good I've also made
some formatting for example I have
reduced the size of the chart
title now let me go ahead and show you a
few more formatting that we also did for
the revenue dashboard first let's remove
the white background from all the charts
so I'll select the first chart I'll
right click and I'll click on format
chart area here under fill I'll select
no fill next I'm going to remove the
grid lines so I'll just delete it let me
close this now we also have have a
outline so I'll go to
design actually format and I'll remove
the
outline next I'm going to
add a blue box at the back like how we
did for the revenue dashboard so let me
select a blue box from here and I'm
going to paste it here okay let me just
select the chart and I'll bring this to
front
and I'll move
this to the
back next I'm going to change the font
color all to White so that it's clearly
visible and it's more
readable I'll do it for the xaxis as
well okay so here I have my first chart
ready the same I'm going to do for the
rest of the
charts okay so now you can see here I
have formatted all my charts I have also
added a blue
background you see here I have also
formatted the by labels in terms of
millions which is actually the profit
similarly here I have added the data
labels this is for
Revenue some of the charts also have the
data Legends so here you can see the
blue color represents
offline and the red represents online
similarly here you have the legends I've
also formatted the map as well okay now
the next thing is to make this dashboard
more interactive so we'll add our
slicers as well as timeline first let me
show you how to add a timeline so I'll
select one of the charts and I'll go to
insert under insert I have the option to
create a timeline so I'll
just click on timelines
so timeline is actually based on date
columns so since in our data set we only
have two date columns one is order date
and one is ship date so Excel has only
shown us two columns so I'm going to
create my timeline based on order date
so I'll select my order date column and
I'll click on okay you can see here this
is called a timeline I can expand this
now this timeline is pasted on months
now and if I scroll this timeline you
can see here I have
my order year 2010 and I have all the 12
months similarly we have for 2011 then
we have for
2012 all the way till
2017 now you can filter this in terms of
years quarters months or days let me
just select year now so I have years
from 2010 till
2017 let me just squiz this and I'll
place it somewhere here on the right
now let me go ahead and create a few
slicers for my profit dashboard so I
have selected one of the charts under
insert I'll click on
slicer you can see it gives me the list
of columns from which I want to create
slicers so I'll create region let me
also select
country let's say I
want the representatives name or the
customer's name and I'll click on okay
so here I have created three
slicers let
me first resize it and I'll place
it on the right s code so I'm going to
click
on the multiple select option and go to
report connections here I'm going to
select all the pivote tables that are
related to
profit so here I have select Ed four and
I need one more which is po table number
10 I click on okay similarly let's
create or connect my region filter to
all the P tables so I right click go to
report connections here I'll choose all
my Pivot tables which are based on
profit I'll click on okay let's do it
for the
contract all the P tables related to
profit then I'll click on okay let me
now go ahead and create another slicer
based on sales channel so I'm selecting
one of the Poo charts I'll go to insert
click on slicer and I'll select sales
Channel and hit
okay so I have my sales Channel slicer
now let me connect it to all the
respective pivot
tables that are based on
profit click on okay
now let me just bring it here all right
the next thing I want to show is how are
we going to use the timeline first so
you see we have all
the years here from 2010 till
2017 now suppose you want to know the
profit that was generated in the year
2012 so I'll just click on this range
and now you can see
are charts only show information for
2012 so this dot represents that was 51
million profit in the year 2012
similarly you can see
here the profit by sales channel for
2012 from the map you can see the
different countries and the profit each
of these countries made in
2012 if I scroll down you can see the
revenue and profit by it items now if I
select another year let's say
2013 I can just drag this to the right
and now you can
see our profit by year and sales channel
for offline and online you can see the
map or the line chart for total profit
by year so in 2012 it was 51 million and
then it went up to 54 million in 2013
similarly our map has also changed now
this is a sort of an information that we
have you can click on this
and check the information that Excel has
prompted all right so this is how you
can use a timeline now as I said we
checked by years you can also see it for
months and quarters as well let me just
uncheck
it I'll send it back back to the place
where it was and I'll reduce the
size okay now suppose you want to check
the profit made by different
Representatives you can select them one
by one let's say Adam
churel this is
the profit generated by Adam
Churchill similarly you can select
multiple persons as well now suppose you
want to see the profit by different
different countries so you can use the
country slicer let me just bring this to
the middle and let's expand our chart a
bit okay so here you have
the profit by different countries chart
I'll just bring this to the front so
that you can see it clearly okay now
here suppose you want to see the profit
generated in let's say United Kingdom
you can select United Kingdom so this is
the map of United Kingdom and it tells
you the total profit that was generated
in United Kingdom and Below you can see
the revenue and profit for all the items
that was sold in United Kingdom so you
had beverages cloths household office
supplies so you can see clearly office
supplies item meet the highest amount of
profit in United Kingdom now you can
also select multiple countries let's say
I want to know for France as well so
my map will change accordingly so now I
have United Kingdom and France selected
and the other charts present in my
dashboard change accordingly now I have
my country selected as India you can see
the map of India
here and these are the respective profit
values now one thing to note here is
this is actually not Millions this
should be in K that is Thousands so
please mark this as thousand and not in
millions even for this this is actually
K and not million all right so we have
successfully created our second
dashboard that is on profit let me just
resize this a bit and we'll place it
where it was
earlier
cool so we saw how to create different
peot tables and poot charts and then we
formatted our poot charts based on our
requirement we saw how to edit the
colors now let me show you one more
thing you can also change the look and
feel of the dashboard by going to the
page layout tab under page layout you
have themes
so here you can select different themes
currently we are with the office theme
now let me just select another theme
let's say face it you see the colors
have changed and it
looks really
beautiful similarly let me try out
another theme let's say organic you see
our chart has changed let me just delete
this okay so now once you change the
theme the text also change a bit you can
see the slicers are in a different
font let me explore One More theme let's
say this time I'm going to choose
depth and this is more of a green type
of
color you can play around and select
whatever theme suits the best all right
now let me just move back to my Revenue
dashboard and see how it looks there you
go so since we changed our theme even
our Revenue dashboard is also
impacted
so this is how it looks
now you can always go ahead and play
with different themes colors fonts and
effects all right so in this demo we saw
how to create a revenue Dash board so we
created line charts this combo chart pie
chart horizontal and vertical bar charts
and then we learned how to add slicers
and connected to different pivot tables
and we filtered our data to see Revenue
as well as profit by items by countries
by different regions sales Channel we
learned how to create a map and lots
more
let's quickly see some more examples of
doing data analysis using Excel and for
that we can use some inbuilt addins
which can be added to our Excel sheet so
for example if you would want to do a
descriptive analytics or descriptive
analysis on your data say for example
getting your descriptive statistics such
as your mean median mode and so on so we
can do that and we can use Excel for it
so for example you can if you are given
some data say I have temperature price
of ice cream unit sold and I would want
to have descriptive statistics on this
what I can do is I can click on file and
here in file you can click on options
and within options click on addin now
within addin you have Excel addin which
is selected here so click on say go for
examp example and that shows what addins
are available and you can choose which
ones are you interested in so for
example I have chosen analysis tool pack
and solver addin and click on okay now
that basically should add more options
to your Excel so if you click on data so
here you see data analysis and solver
and this is what we would want to use to
get our descriptive statistics for these
three columns so for example let's say
temperature or you can even give the
names later once you get your
descriptive statistics so for example
let's go for data analysis and here it
says what are you interested in there is
a two factor with replication you have
correlation
co-variance descriptive statistics you
have histogram so let's click on
descriptive statistics click on okay now
this one basically asks your input range
so while your cursor is blinking here
also it is said grouped by so let's give
it a range so for example I will say say
temperature now if I do this and I have
selected The Heading just look at that
and now you need an output range so
let's just select this and then you can
have your cursor blinking here let's
select save Fields here and this is
where I would want the output now it
also say what options do you want so it
has output range we can then select
summary statistics confidence level so I
will say summary statistics is what I'm
interested in say okay and this says
input input range contains non numeric
data now why is that because we chose
temperature The Heading also so click on
okay and here we will alter the range so
this one is our range should be only the
values numeric values on which we would
want the descriptive statistics we have
output range already selected we have
summary statistics and now you can click
on okay and that basically gives your
descriptive statistics for temperature
so here I could
basically given a value for this so I
can say
temperature and that's my descriptive
statistics for temperature might be I
can just do some
formatting and that's it so that gives
me descriptive statistics for the values
here now similarly we can do it for
price of ice cream so what we need is we
need to basically go for
data data analysis descriptive
statistics say okay now you need to give
a range so here I will change my range
to these values output range is already
selected now we are interested in
summary statistics click on okay and
this says output range will overwrite
existing data press okay to overwrite
data in range I will say cancel no
that's not what we want to do we need to
give a new Range so let's select our new
Range which is here and now click on
okay so now we get the values which is
for your price of ice cream so again we
can basically select this and say price
of ice
cream and we got our descriptive
statistics for price of ice cream and
like we did earlier I can select this I
can basically do a merge and center and
that gives me descriptive statistics for
price of I screen so we could also
basically change this now I can go into
data and I can go to data
analysis descriptive statistics so we
know that we had selected this B2 to B8
and this one which is H6 to h19 we would
want to shift it might be two columns up
so mightbe I can just say
H5 and I can manually change it to H7
and let's say
okay and we will basically get this and
I can get it of this so I can have it in
the same range so similarly so this one
will have to be renamed and I can
basically say price of ice
cream and that's basically my
descriptive statistics for my price of
ice
cream and similarly we we can do it for
the third column which is units sold so
we would want to have this now let's see
we can click on data we can click on
data analysis descriptive statistics so
we need to give the range correctly so
this time our range changes to units
sold now we can also say labels in first
row okay if we were selecting The
Heading so let's do it in this way okay
so in my range in my range let me empty
this I can basically select this which
we know has non-numeric data in the
first row say for example I'll say
labels in first row I'm interested in
summary statistics and this range will
now have to be changed from H to
basically something like J so let's say
J and let's select these values so that
should take care of things and now you
see you have your units sold you did not
have to manually rename it and you have
basically got the descriptive statistics
so this is how you can simply perform
analysis using data analysis here you
can basically get your descriptive
statistics for your columns and then you
can do whatever needed formatting you
need to basically make your data look in
a good way now let's look at one more
example of data analysis where we may
want to look at the frequency of values
or frequency of values occurring in a
range of values so for example if you
have been given temperatures you have
been given some pins where you would
want to identify how many values fall
into the range of 0 to 20 20 to 30 30 to
40 40 to 50 and the easiest way to do
that would be creating histogram now
histogram is usually used for data
analysis where you would want to look at
different variables or say features for
example temperature is one such feature
might be there might be one more
variable or feature such as sale of ice
cream and you would want to see if uh
the increase or decrease in temperature
affects the increase or decrease in sale
of ice cream be sale of ice cream is a
is a response based on temperature so it
depends so sometimes you may want to
find a relationship between two
variables whether they are positively or
negatively related or you would want to
do different kind of analysis and in
certain cases we may want to first to
analysis on one single variable look at
the frequency of values might we also
look at the defects and for which we can
use some something like par chart so we
can go for histogram and that basically
gives us the frequency of values now how
do we do that so we have already added
the addin which is data analysis earlier
so we can just use the same thing again
here we would want to create a histogram
so let's say okay now I have already
selected input range so if you see here
my input range is temperature which is
also with the headings and I have bin
range which is basically the range of
values so for example I can select this
and that's my bin range I am selecting
or the option labels because I'm using
the first row which has the heading such
as temperature and bins now we need to
give a output range so for example let's
say I would want my data here and that
becomes my output range so you can have
a sorted histogram or basically a Paro
chart so if that's what you're
interested in looking at the frequencies
for your different ranges and here I'm
also selecting chart output because I
would want to have a visual histogram
which gives us the frequency and it's as
simple as this just click on okay and
now you get your bins so it basically
tells you frequency of values which is
basically 20 but that does not mean it
is only talking about the values 20 it
is basically talking as a range of 0 to
20 so we have 0 to 20 that is two so we
can basically say there is one 12 here
with the 20 being the maximum value and
then there is one more 20 so that's your
0 to 20 then you have 20 to 30 which
shows three values so might be in that
case I can say
26 is one thing then I can say 30 that's
the second one and then basically I can
look at 22 so basically this one does
not select 20 as the lower range but it
basically selects 30 as the higher range
so I do see 20 to 30 there are three
entries similarly we can see values for
40 and 50 and since we have selected
Paro or sorted histogram that shows in a
descending order what is the highest
frequency of values within a particular
range so that shows me highest frequency
is five and then you have three and
three and then two so this is how we can
create a histogram and we can perform
analysis on a single variable now as
discussed earlier as I said sometimes we
may be interested in finding out the
correlation between different variables
such as say here we have temperature
price of ice cream and units sold and we
may want to find out the correlation
between one variable to another variable
or we would want to find out the
relationship between variables are they
linearly related are they positively
related negatively related and so on and
for that we can use the
correlation of your data analysis add in
so for example you want to find out
correlation of temperature and unit sold
and what we can do is we can find out
that using a formula so for example if I
search for something like Co relation
and let's search so there is a function
called correlation which we can use and
we can use this to calculate the
correlation of temperature and units
sold so for example let's select this
and that's the function so it says give
me an first array and a second array so
we are interested in finding out
correlation of temperature and units
sold so let's select the range of values
for temperature and then I'm interested
in finding out the correlation of
temperature and units sold so let's
select this and that basically gives me
a range of values it gives me the
correlation value which is
2859 say okay and that's your value so
similarly we can do it for temperature
and price ice cream stream so let's go
for correlation so that's the function
we are interested in you need to give a
range of value so here we are interested
in temperature and price of ice cream so
let's select temperature and then the
second array or list of values is price
of ice cream let's select that let's
close our bracket and here we have the
correlation value of temperature and the
price of ice cream similarly you may be
interested in find finding out
temperature and units sold like what we
have done earlier so we can do the same
thing based on function so this is same
as correlation of temperature and unit
sold so I can get rid of this one now
how do I do it using the data analysis
add in so for that what we need is we
need to go into Data we need to go click
on data analysis and here you have the
option called correlation let's select
select this now that basically needs an
input range so we need the range now I
might be interested in finding out the
correlation between temperature and
price of ice cream and units sold so
I've selected all the columns here we
will say Group by columns obviously we
need to select labels in first row
because that is basically taking care of
the first row is heading now output
range you can just give one simple cell
and that's where your data will start
from or you can give a new workbook so
click on okay and that basically gives
you that basically gives you correlation
of your different variables and what are
the values and we can check these values
based on the values what we have here so
we have basically temperature and price
of ice
cream and that basically shows me
96149 you have temperature and units
sold so you have
2859 now you can also look at units sold
and say for example price of ice cream
you can look at these particular values
so if I would be interested in finding
out what is the relationship between
these variables I can easily find using
correlation so I could be basically
writing in a formula here and selecting
what are the cells so here we were
selecting A2 and C here we were
selecting A and B now might be I'm
interested in price of ice cream and
units sold and if that's what I'm
interested in then I will give a range
of B2 to B8 C2 to C8 and similarly you
can get your analysis or correlation
values so it's very simple in Excel and
you can use either the data analysis Tab
and get your correlation or you can use
formulas and do that now one more
important part of data analysis is doing
your sampling now sampling could be
periodic sampling or random sampling so
sometimes you may want to look at a
variable and you may want to get some
values based on periodic data that means
might be I'm in interested in range of
values I'm interested in seeing a sample
of values for uh a particular period
which could be
basically uh a range of values or you
could just do a random sampling so for
example if I go for periodic sampling so
out of these values which I see here
might be I want to see say periodic
sampling that is a frequency of two
values how many many times we have these
values occurring here or I would go for
random sampling so basically randomly I
would want to pick up say three
temperature values now how do I do it so
for example here I have seven values now
if I go for periodic sampling the sample
or periodic sample value which I need to
give has to be lesser than the total
input values
so for example we can do this let's go
in here and let's go for data analysis
so we can go for sampling here click on
okay and that needs a range of values so
we will select A2 to A8 now I could have
selected all the values for this one
temperature and in that case I can give
labels which is going to take care of
the first row now here we can go for
number of samples which you are
interested in or giving a period so
let's go for period and say for example
I have seven values so what if I select
five so for example if I say five that
means I could just get one value so
basically when I'm saying five out of
seven so that's just giving me out of
five I want one value so I can then just
give an output range so here
I can basically select this cell I'll
say okay and now you see it just shows
me one
value so out of the first range that is
I have said five it has given me the
fifth value that's your periodic
sampling so for example we want more
values so let's reduce this period to
might be two which basically gives me
every second value so I can basically
say for example example two and say okay
and then say okay so that shows me
26 then you have 35 then you have 40 and
then well this one does not have any
more values so that's your periodic
sampling now if you go for random
sampling that's basically randomly
picking up values and you can choose how
many values you want so go for data
analysis go for sampling I'll go for
number of samples how many you want so
for example out of seven values randomly
I want three values and I can just give
this say okay and then we will do a
cancel because we need to change that
range so let's select this and say okay
and that gives me random three values
from this values of temperature so we
can use Excel to do a simple sampling
and we can choose whether we would want
to go for periodic sampling or random
sampling let's continue learning Excel
and how Excel can be used for data
analysis now we have seen uh sampling
histogram correlation descriptive stats
and now also let's look at regression
now what is regression so when you talk
about statistical modeling regression
analysis is used to estimate the
relationship between two or more
variables and basically we would want to
look at two or more variables and
basically a relationship of those
variables with the response or the
Target right so for example if we look
at our data here we have temperature we
have price of ice cream and then we have
units sold and we can go ahead and make
predictions so for example when you look
at regression here you see something
like this which is regression statistics
you have Anova you have different plots
which we have here which is X variable X
variable 2 and then you have normal
probability plot now we have already
seen how you can have your addin that is
data analysis which helps you in doing
different kind of data analysis here
right now how do we do this so we have
our variables here which is temperature
price of ice cream units sold and when
we talk about regression we need to
understand which one of these are
independent variables which one of these
are dependent variables right so when
you talk about your X that's your
independent variable or we can say
predictor or explanatory so when you
talk about your independent variables or
as we say predictors or explanatory
variables these are the factors that
might influence the dependent variable
and when you talk about dependent
variable that's your response or Target
that's the main factor you are trying to
understand or predict so we can plot a
scatter plot to see relationship between
variables if they are linearly related
are they positively related negatively
related and so on we can also get values
such as R squ which is coefficient of
determination regression line and then
analyze the relationship between
variables so here is one of the links of
one of my Ed other videos where we are
learning on machine learning and also on
regression but that's programmatically
and using a processing framework such as
spark now here let's see how do we do
this in Excel so basically we would want
to use our variables which is
temperature price of ice cream units
sold and then get these plots so what we
can do is for example I can get rid of
this and might be I can just say no
borders and uh when it comes to these
plots we can have them generated again
that's not a big deal using your data
analysis addin tool so we have been
given variables here now as I said when
we talk about your regression analysis
we need to understand whether we have
one variable or we have multiple
variables right so you might have heard
of univariate analysis bivariate
analysis and so on well here we are
focusing more on using
Excel to do our regression analysis so
I'll not go deeper into regression
topics but certain things as Basics
should be known that when we talk about
regression analysis what does it do it
helps you understand how the dependent
variable
changes when one or more independent
variables vary and it basically allows
us to mathematically determine which of
those variables really has an impact so
technically when we talk about
regression analysis model that is based
on the sum of squares which is basically
a mathematical way to find the
dispersion of data points so mainly the
goal
of the model is to get the smallest
possible sum of squares and draw a line
that comes closest to the data so that's
what we mean by our regression line or
basically looking at the points and
seeing if the points fall on a
regression line if there are residuals
that is points which do not fall on the
regression line and in terms of
statistics when we talk about uh
statistics we differenti iate between a
simple and multiple linear regression so
you have something called a simple
linear regression models which basically
gives you the relationship between
dependent variable and one independent
variable using a linear function and if
you use two or more variables that is
explanatory variables to predict the
dependent variable we are actually
dealing with multiple linear regression
so if the dependent variable is modeled
as a nonlinear function because the data
relationships do not follow a straight
line we have to use nonlinear
regression now what we will do is we'll
see how we can work on this so here we
have some variables and if we look at
this might be based on temperature price
of ice cream we would want to find out
how many units were sold now what we can
do is we can basically start looking in
by creating a simple scan plot which is
quite easy in Excel so if you have been
given variables what you can do is you
can click on insert you can then choose
the kind of plots which you want and
here you have insert scatter plot so we
can choose this and you can choose the
first option so that gives you a blank
layout and what you can do is now you
need to select data so for example let's
click on select data and then you can
say add so what we would want is we can
given name so we want X values and we
want our y values right so when you talk
about y That's your dependent variable
or your response or Target so that is in
our case unit sold and X values are one
set of features or variables or multiple
variables so here I can click on this
series X values and then I can select
this now in y values what I can do is I
can select these and then I can just say
Okay so that shows me that it would be
giving me a regression scatter plot now
let's say okay and we have some points
plotted here now if you would want to
see the impact of one individual
variable such as temperature or price of
ice cream you could as well do that now
what you can also do is you can add more
meaning to this by giving in a title
title or you can also go into Quick
layout and you have various options here
so you see it gives you what is the
access title what is the series and I
would prefer to use here something like
this one so that gives you your
regression line that also gives you your
R squ and that gives you your Y and X
that is your
coefficients so let's select this one
and then we have some values which we
can use to compare this also shows me
the regression line and you can keep
this for reference if you would want you
can change the chart title to something
else say scatter plot of uh
dependent uh West
independent variables and you can give
any name which has more meaning and uh
we can get rid of this one so we have
series and we can say what these points
if you would want to add in Legend if
you would want to do that or I can just
get rid of this and I will keep these
values here which we will see when we do
a data analysis we can always compare
these values so here I've created a
simple scatter
plot and then I can look at dependent
where independent
variables or I could have selected one
particular variable so this is just for
reference
now we can add more details we can say
what is my x axis what is my y AIS so
basically you can here say for example
just say Y and might be here I will say
x and we can rename that later now how
do we perform data analysis or get into
regression right now what we would want
to do
is we would want to get or we would want
to do the regression analysis to
demonstrate the relationship between
dependent and independent variables so
normally when you talk about your linear
regression equation you might have known
about it so it is basically Y when you
say y equals you can say BX + a + C and
this would be normally the math
mathematical equation for a linear
regression where X is your independent
variable Y is your dependent
variable your a is the Y
intercept which is expected uh mean
value of y when all X variables are
equal to zero so basically on a
regression graph that's the point where
line crosses the Y AIS and that's your
intercept
when you talk about B that's basically
your slope of regression line which is
the rate of change for y as X changes
and then you also have your constant
right so that's your uh sorry that's
basically your random error term right
which is basically the
difference between the actual value of
dependent variable and its predicted
value so your linear equation
always has an error term because in real
life predictors are obviously never
perfectly precise right now what we can
do is we can also reduce this equation
to Y is BX + a and that's the equation
of a line we can look into this and the
linear equation can be understood
mathematically in this way now how do we
do it in Excel so what we can simply do
is uh
uh here let
[Music]
me
yeah so we need to get into data and
then here we have our data analysis add
in you can click on this one and from
these different options you can choose
regression so that's what we would want
to do now we'll say okay now here you
need to give your input y range so as I
said you will have to select the depend
and independent variables right so we
would want to do some regression
analysis here and here we have your X
and Y so y being your target that's
basically your units sold so we can
select this along with the labels when
it comes to X either you can select one
variable or multiple variables so I will
select temperature price of ice cream
and then since we have chosen the
headings we will go for l labels right
now we can always look at the confidence
level we can change that so you can say
whether you want it in a new worksheet
or you can just say output range and I
will probably just click here and select
one of the cell here now we can also
choose the other options which we would
want to see as a part of this regression
analysis so basically we have selected
input y range which is your dependent
variable you have selected X range which
is your independent variable and if we
are building a multi- regression model
then we have chosen temperature and
price of ice cream both now we can
choose the labels which we have done we
can choose your output range which is
basically on this sheet and then we can
select the residuals so that basically
gives you your residuals now we can also
get your fit plots which you were seeing
earlier you can also go for your normal
probability plots and then basically
just say okay and let's say okay and
that basically gives you your regression
analysis output so we basically have
your summary output we also have a Nova
we have a residual output that's from
the previous one and uh basically we can
get rid of this that's not
required I can get rid of this
one yeah so now we have our regression
statistics we also have our plots so we
can basically look into these so we have
our
normal let's get rid of these let's get
rid of this let's get rid of this and
then what we can do is since we had some
existing data it has overwritten so let
me get rid of this and I'll repeat this
step
again and uh let's say no water yeah so
now what we want to do is we want to do
regression analysis so we go get into
Data we get into Data analysis we choose
regression we have already chosen our y
range which is column c x range is
multiple variables we have gone for
labels output range which we would want
to select a particular cell so let me
select this I'm going for residuals line
fit plots or normal probability plots
and say okay so now we have our
plots we can just separate them to have
a better understanding
yeah and that basically shows you the
variables so here it shows me units sold
and then what are the predicted units
sold and here the variable is
temperature here the variable is price
of ice cream right so that's your one
variable and second variable and then
you also have your normal probability
plot now to interpret this or to
understand what we have here where we
look at
your sum output so it is good to
understand what Excel is helping us out
so basically when we do a regression in
Excel it is performing all the
calculations automatically the
interpretation is something which we
need to understand so basically we are
looking at multiple r value here and we
can let's also find you this one yeah we
have our values here and if you see we
have our R squ now we can then basically
look at our multiple R so what is your
multiple R that's your correlation
coefficient which basically measures the
strength of linear relationship between
two variables
so this can be any value between your
when you talk about your correlation
coefficient it can be any value between
minus1 and 1 and its absolute value
indicates the relation ship strength so
the larger the absolute value the
stronger the relationship so one
basically means a strong positive
relationship minus one means a strong
negative relationship and zero means no
relationship at all now when you're
looking at r squ that is the coefficient
of determination which is used as an
indicator of the goodness of the fit so
it basically shows how many points fall
on the regression line so your R square
value is basically calculated from the
total sum of
squares uh when we say precisely it is
the sum of squared deviations of the
original data from the mean now when we
talk about looking at the value of your
R square so it is basically we can be uh
seeing uh that this is uh 45788
that's the value which I'm talking about
so it basically means 45% of our values
fit the regression analysis model so in
other words 45% of dependent variables
that is your y values are explained by
the independent variables that is your X
values so normally if you have r s value
higher then that is considered as a good
fit and here we have considered multiple
variables now when when you talk about
your adjusted R square it is the R
square adjusted for the number of
independent variables in the model so uh
you would want to use this value instead
of r s for shows the Precision of your
regression analysis so the smaller the
value the more certain you can be about
your regression equation so when when we
talk about your R square that represents
the percentage of dependent variables
variance
that is explained by the model and
standard error is basically an absolute
measure that shows the average distance
that the data points fall from the
regression line so you will have to look
back into
regression statistics terminologies to
basically understand more of this and if
you're already from data science
background that then you already know
what I'm talking about we are just
seeing how Excel easily helps us in
doing these things
now we can also look at observations
here which is basically the number of
observations in our model which is seven
now when we talk about regression
analysis and if we look at analysis of
variance that is your Inova values here
so we basically see DF you have SS Ms F
and significance F now to understand
these so basically what we are doing is
is or what Excel is doing is it splits
the sum of squares into individual
components that give information about
the levels of variability within your
regression model so when you talk about
your DF that's basically the number of
degrees of freedom associated with the
source of variance you have Su of
squares that is your SS so smaller the
residual SS compared with the total SS
the better your model fits the data
right now when you talk about Ms that's
your mean Square you have f is basically
the F statistic or you can say uh F test
for the null
hypothesis basically it is used to test
the overall significance of the model
and then you finally have your
significance F which is the P value of f
so uh when we when we usually talk about
simple linear regression the in Anova
part is uh not uh really used or it's
rarely used right but when we look at
the significance F value that gives an
idea of how reliably or statistically
significant our results are so if
significance f is less than
0.05 that's 5% our model is okay if it
is greater than 05
we will have to better choose another
independent
variables right now we can also look at
the output of coefficients and that's
what we would want to look at so you
basically have your intercept here so
when you talk about your intercept
temperature price of ice cream so we
know we are looking at our variables and
then we are also look at looking at our
intercept which basically gives you more
details or your coefficients so the the
main important thing when we talk about
regression analysis is basically your
coefficients it basically enables you to
build a linear regression equation uh in
the form of y equal BX + a which I
explained earlier and then basically we
can understand our regression analysis
output better now when we look at the
residual output which we are seeing here
so that gives you your observations how
many observations we have it shows what
is the predicted unit sold and then it
also gives you your residuals so we can
compare the estimated and actual number
of sold umbrellas based on the
observation so we have
11.29 here and if you compare that's
basically 12 the second one is 15 and
here it is
13.5 you you have and similarly you can
compare all the values of actual units
sold and what our regression has
predicted so basically what we can do is
we can compare these and we will see if
there is any difference or no right so
obviously there will be or there would
be some difference because independent
variables are never perfect predictors
of your dependent variables and the
residuals
basically help us in understanding how
far the actual values are from the
predicted values so that's what we see
here in the residual section so for
example when we look at this one which
is
11.29 and the actual is 12 we see what
is the residual and how far is the
predicted value from the actual value so
similarly we can also look at the
percentile values so that gives you your
probability output and this is what we
have in our graphs so we have basically
our variables we are looking at our
variables and also the units sold and
the relationship between them we can
basically uh add in more details to this
particular plot and you also have normal
probability plot which is basically
getting your values from your
probability output here so this is how
you can perform a simple regression
analysis now what you can do is you can
as I said you can basically be looking
at your scatter plot you can be looking
at your y and x and your R square values
right but remember what are the
variables which you are selecting and
then you can compare these with
basically the values what you see here
so remember here I've have chosen my
both set of variables
and you can
choose one variable and then basically
see what is its impact on the response
or on the target so it's pretty simple
here you can add more details to your
scatter plot or the plots what we have
created or Some people prefer to do it
using formulas so basically we have some
statistical functions that can help you
do linear regression anal is such as you
have linest you have slope you have
intercept you have correlation and so on
so basically you can use these
particular functions and what you will
have to do is you will have to basically
go in for a function if that's what you
would want to do and then you can search
for functions and say for example I'll
just say
lest and say go and and here I have my
function so if I would want to really
use this one I can do that what I will
have to do is then select the variable
so if you just say okay and that
basically says your known y's known X
your constants your stats and basically
you can use the formula also but we are
not covering that here might be in the
later videos we can do that so just try
out and perform some regression analysis
and try to look at your different
variables and try to interpret that so
that basically gives you an easier way
of Performing regression analysis using
your data analysis add in in Excel in
this tutorial we will be talking about
macros used in Excel and also the Visual
Basic application programming for macros
so what is Excel macro you do certain
daily task and daily reports or monthly
reports that you generate and you use
data from your Excel and use scrub data
and you basically have the same things
performed or done on the Excel sheet
every time and every day or monthly or
bi-weekly or any number of times that
you open your Excel you remove certain
columns you add certain things and you
change certain values and these are the
things that you do an N number of times
on an Excel and this can all be done by
simple
automated way which is macros so what it
does is it is a set of tasks that you
can execute as many number of times as
you want when you create a macro
basically what it does is it will record
all your mouse clicks and keystrokes
basically if for example you have your
monthly accounts report that is there
and it comes every day and you have to
put it and extract certain data and
remove certain columns that you do every
time that you open that sheet for
instance you remove that column I which
has the obsolute values of of your
accounts or the sheets that you have and
you remove that column and you edit some
names you add such things every time
that you open that report and then you
format it in a proper way and send it to
your management so this can all be done
in a simple running script called macros
so what you do is you record those Mouse
clicks and keystrokes and record a macro
for it save it and next time tomorrow
when you come you just run that macros
and this will do everything for you and
you do not have to do that same tedious
task every day so this is basically a
set of codes or a task that you can
execute and automate and which can be
done a number of times so it makes your
life easy now so next thing is how you
actually activate the macros in your
Excel it's a simple uh tab that you need
to add in the ribbon section which I'll
be showing you across and this will
enable the macros on your Excel so you
go to
files go to options and then you need to
customize a ribbon click customize
ribbon and then there is a developer tab
which you see here it should be
activated so you just need to select
that click on the uh tick mark and just
click okay so this will add a developer
tab here and this will enable the macros
so now you you have your data and you
can run macros or record a macro and run
it over on your Excel
there is also an option to do it a
different way right click on any of the
tabs on the ribbon customize ribbon and
you can add or remove your Macros from
here so this is two ways that you need
to that you can activate uh your Macros
so how you record a macro is the next
thing so here I have a work orders sheet
that I receive every day or one of you
will receive every day okay and how you
record a macro you have certain set of
task that you do and you know this
report has so many things that are
obsolete which you do not need which has
to be put across uh to your management
or your for your use so how you record
or uh uh start a macro you go to the
developer tab and start recording a
macro as soon as you click on this
record macro button it will start uh
recording your key strokes on the mouse
mouse clicks and you can save that and
run it as a script in the next sheet
that you do so this is the sheet that I
have and we'll try to run a macros on
this and see what it
does so here I have and uh this actually
works this way uh I need to go to the
developer tab and start recording a
macro so when I click record macro it uh
starts uh recording my mouse clicks and
keystrokes so in this sheet I have to
you know remove some columns and uh the
columns that are Obsolete and the data
that looks uh feir here should be
removed and all what I need is the
workorder number the district and the
tactician name and the kind of service
that we provide and the request date
work date the cost and the payment so
this is what I want and I do it every
day when I receive the sheet and I have
to make these changes and send it across
to the accounts team so what I do is I
simply um automate this by running a
macro so I go
to let's see how it records the
macro I click record macro I save it as
work
order
accounts and I'll add a little
description
like work
orders
for account
team
cost click okay
and see what I do is basically I add the
borders
first so that the data looks proper and
then I do not want this column I delete
it I do not want the number of
technicians that are there I do not want
all these and I also want the labor art
the account and what kind of payment
this is very crucial for the FM schem I
do not want any of these obsolute
data so I just delete this okay and then
I just want to have some cosmetic
changes done so
so I make sure this doesn't have any
border and that's it this is the task
that I
perform every day I still don't need
this and I go to the developer tab and
click stop recording so now I have the
macro save and when I have it I have you
know automated these all these steps in
one simple click and and how I execute
it in another sheet so I will show it
across to you the next thing so here I
have the next uh report that has to be
uh changed or formatted and send it
across so I simply go the next morning
and go to the developer tab and go to
the macro and I have this macro Save
which we ran the just now and I simple
with a single click I will be able to do
these daily task
and execute in a Flash so I just click
run and it does the rest for me I have
my report ready and is in a proper
format that is required and it can be
sent across so here as we see it is done
in a single click by running simple
macro continuing our work on macro we
can simply do this by a single click of
a button by adding a button so what what
you have to do is go to the developer
tab and in the control section you will
see the insert option when you click on
the insert drop down you will see uh
form controls and you can say select a
button and here I select a button and
the mouse uh changes to into a cross and
you can add your macro and assign it so
as we have saved it work order accounts
as a macro and when I I just uh assign
that macro to this button I can edit the
text
by making it as work order accounts just
to make it simple
okay and now if you see if I just click
this button it will run the
macro and format our sheet so this is
how we run the macros in a single click
of a button by adding the
button there is another alternative way
to go to the macros in instead of the
developer tab and you go to the view
button and then go to macros at the end
you can view macros you can record and
you can edit your Macros so when I click
view macros it will show you what are
the macros that I have and that I can
run and you can simply run it
alternatively and you can record record
a macro as well instead of from the
developer tab if you just click on
record macro it will do the same
functions that we do from the developer
tab okay the next thing is to edit the
macro how do you edit your macro you
have uh to use a simple application in
Excel which is the VBA Visual Basic
application to edit your macro go to the
developer tab and then click on visual
basic this literally opens another
window like this and you will see the
module that you have been working on and
you can edit the macro here so as we see
if you go back to the Excel we see that
uh our sheet we have been working on um
the sheet and it has the column still K
and the actual sheet is this so if I go
to the Visual Basic
editor and uh I'll make sure they know I
remove the columns that are existing
from the column M and I just delete that
and I click
run I go back to my sheet and you see
these changes are not there
okay this is our old macro and this is
our new
macro as we see this sheet has the rush
column which is the priority of my
orders so these are the things that we
can edit with the VBA what is VBA Visual
Basic application it is basically a
Visual Basic application language uh
that is used for macros in
Excel so what it basically does Visual
Basic application is a programming
language of excel that helps you
automate task by writing macros we have
seen how we use macros how it simplifies
our TDS daily task by running a simple
macro now to help us you know write
these macros and help us get the best
use of our abilities
to ease our work and automate our task
we use VBA
so why VBA there are many advantages of
using VBA and why we prefer VBA in
macros for Excel so basically it is a
very simple language it saves time in
Pro performing TDS tasks you have number
of tasks that you do every day as we
have seen in the previous section how we
uh you can simplify your daily task by
just running a simple macro and this VBA
helps us in performing those tasks in a
very simple manner another thing is it
supports english- like statements there
are multiple statements that you can use
and which are very basic English
language statements and this can help us
or it is very easy to program or code or
edit these commands you can select a
range you can it is like a if and lse
statement
and things like that we'll look into
those in details in the next sections
now one more thing is it improves the
functionality of excel by allowing you
to make Excel behave the way you want
there are multiple function that you
perform in Excel like selecting a number
of rows or columns or selecting a set of
cells in particular you do it on a daily
basis so these things can easily be
performed and easily edited and executed
by using VBA we will look into those in
detail now what is the VBA editor
interface this is particularly uh an
interface which you will have a look in
detail U where where you can edit your
commands or your codes for your Excel
now how this is uh achieved we will see
it here now these are the this is
basically the VBA editor interface
where you can see the uh this is the
toolbar section where it shows all the
options where in undo or save or file
we'll see those details in the next
section this is basically the toolbar
section of the VBA editor interface the
next thing is the menu bar menu bar as
we all know it is simply shows you the
menu wherein you have all the options
like file edit view insert insert is the
one very important uh menu bar option
and when you can insert different
modules and buttons and all we'll look
into those in details run is one more
important thing all these things fall
under menu bar the next thing is the VBA
code window VBA code window as it says
is the code window where your actual
code resides where in you can go into it
and edit the codes or write the codes
and select the different range of
functions that you can perform and this
is basically the VB VBA code window
where you edit your or write your codes
the next thing is the project Explorer
project Explorer is simply like a
Windows Explorer but this is in
particular is specific to your VBA where
in it shows the different options that
are there the the Excel sheets or the
worksheets that you're working on or the
modules that you have saved and so on
basically it is an Explorer for your p
ba like a Windows Explorer which is for
the file explorer the next thing is the
properties window properties Windows
shows you the properties of the
worksheet that you're working on for
instance here we are working on the
sheet two and it shows the properties
what are the kind of uh uh worksheet
that we have the page breaks the right
to left whether it is enabled or not the
name of the sheet and so on whether it's
visible and things like that the next
thing is the immediate window and the
watch
window now what is the immediate window
immediate window is basically a tool or
a window wherein you can run and execute
simple lines of codes individual Excel
code that you can run it will allow you
to test individual lines which is very
useful and handy when you're writing and
debugging codes uh the output of the
lines that you execute can be seen here
in the immediate window whereas watch
Window watch window is similar to it but
it displays the value of the watched
expression in its current current state
so this can be extremely useful again
while we are debugging the VBA code
adding a watch is a great utility and
we'll see uh the use the advantages of
having a watch window in your uh VB a
interface so these are the things that
we'll learn and look into it in detail
in the coming section now we continue
our topic for Visual Basic for
application for macros and uh I'm going
to show you how to you know run some
codes and run some macros in the codes
and perform some simple to complex task
using the VBA Matrix so there are two
ways to open the visual BAS basic
application and uh first thing is you
can run alt f11 click on the sheet and
just just press and it will open the um
Visual Basic for application window or
alternatively you can just go and click
on the Visual Basic and it will open the
Chic for you I mean the code window for
you and as we have discussed before
these are the windows that we see this
is the code window and this is the
project Explorer
and this is the immediate window will we
can run some testing codes immediately
it will show you the output so here we
see the project Explorer window where we
see the mods and all for our Visual
Basic for
applications so as we see the code is
empty here we'll try to record a macro
and see uh how the code develops okay so
I just go here and click uh record macro
and I save it
as a
format and
columns okay this Qui and I just save it
quickly and it has started recording so
now what I'll do is I make it simple and
I just delete some columns
here okay I do not need this I delete
this theate I want this I want the mode
of payment parts cost labor hours I do
not want this number of technicians
forget
it
okay and I go for the left and see what
all do I need I need I don't need this I
delete all these
and I just expand this so that it's
clearly
visible and then I want to change the
format I mean the font
so I select
this and I change it to times
[Music]
room
okay go back to my developer tab click
stop recording it is
saved
okay now I go back to my
code and see the macro here so we see
the macro here and we can see uh in
detail what it looks like so we see the
code what it's doing and what the macro
run has generated the code with so we
see we have basically the name of the
macro is format columns and what it is
doing we just selecting The Columns and
deleting some we checking the range on
some columns e e select that is the E
column we have selected and then again
so on and the next thing is the font
selection that is mentioned we are
changing it to Times New Roman size is
11 so it is basically a basic VBA code
so it starts with the sub and it should
end with N Sub so this is the code or a
format of the VBA code that it looks
like and we'll try to do some basic
functions with the VBA and discuss this
in the details so for ease of
explanation I have picked up a blank
spreadsheet and uh I'll try to explain
some basic uh functions and the commands
and the codes that we use to accomplish
the task that we with
VBA so as we see this is the blank sheet
and I have selected a new module for
it so here I uh start the code and as it
says it starts with sub and I am
specifying the the module name as number
so I'll just try to make it quite simple
and you know so we as soon as we enter
the sub it it sends with the end sub and
so this is the uh start of the code and
this is the end of the code and whatever
is there should be here and this is the
name of the code of the macro now uh
I'll explain it further about the dim
statement why is it used and what does
it use for so dim is basically a keyword
which is the a short form of Dimension
and it is used to declare a variables in
the VBA so here I am trying to specify
uh a variable called X and how I'm going
to do it I will as it have it as a
number or an integer or anything so here
in this example I'll put it as an
integer or a number okay and as I put as
it populates the prompt so I select
integer and for example I select the
number to
be 500 okay and here I'm trying to
assign a variable integer a a cell a
value of uh 500 with the dim keyword so
where exactly I want to put this you
will see it when you execute the code
okay range I am selecting it should be
under codes where I'm going to put the
value of x as and I close the bracket
and what should be the value we will
value should be X so now as I click run
sub or you can do it with the by running
the alt or F5 key and it will run the
code so you see here in the Excel sheet
it executes the value of the cell b 5 to
be 500 so this is one simple function
that you can do with the uh Dimension
keyboard or dim
keyword and you can assign the value as
integers now proceed we proceed further
with certain more example some more
examples and how we assign the string
value as a as a text or something else
okay now I'm going to show you what dim
can be execut I mean used as to set
variables T can be used as a uh double
when double is basically a longer form
of single variable it usually takes more
space but uses uh needs more larger
numbers okay and then you can
set double and I just uh don't specify
it and you can use date it basically
stores the date values okay and then
again string string so what string does
if you use string it stores the text it
can contain numbers it will have some
text as calculations or anything can be
performed so these are the basic thing
that I will cover
and you can also use different uh values
for it so I will discuss this in the
next
example
okay so in the next example I'll try to
sub or use a string value for it and I
put it as string sub
string
so
value this is my name so as soon as I
hit enter it ends with the end sub
prompt and now I can get my code so I
put it as DM book as
string okay now
I'm trying to use uh uh uh to name a
country or put a value of a country to
one of the cells so let's see how it
goes and I select country and in country
I select
ma okay now what is the value or the
cell that basically takes the or we will
put the name of the country as so I have
to specify a range and as soon as I hit
it goes and I have to specify
the the cell here so here I put it as
G and uh four okay so I close
it and I put a value to it what value
I'm going to assign it is a
country
okay now try to run this code by simply
and see G4 the name populates as a
country here so this is a dim keyword
being used as a string in our VBA code
so uh we can also use uh VBA to you know
pop up a message or an alert or a kind
of a button or a message pop up pops up
when you execute this code so this
basically can be uh executed using uh
the code here which I'm going to
put and we use
the okay let's give it a
[Music]
value I'm going to name it as double
value and again the name keyword I'm
going to use the keyword good as double
okay why double is used is basically uh
it gives a longer it can be used for a
longer form of single variable takes it
usually takes more space and larger
numbers and we'll try to assign it okay
now I'm going to pop up a message in the
which says value of a is so and so so
I'm going to give value of a
as
250 okay and how I it pops up a message
okay so there is a message
box which you know can be used and it
will give you a value I mean uh it will
prompt you to enter the value what kind
of button you want and you know you can
enter the text and you can enter the
value so here I'm going to uh write a
code which you know which gives a popup
message a message box saying that the
value of a is so and
so that of a is I'm going to put it in
n%c code so it actually takes the value
of a okay now that's it and let's try to
run this and you will see a message box
popping message box popping
up okay so the value of the message box
pops up saying the value of a is 250
so in in the next example I am going to
write a code where in you know you can
give a value or a string you can assign
it to a selected cell and this basically
used when you have some you know when
you have a a task of you know giving a
value to a particular cell or you have
to assign a text or say something about
a report okay so this let's see how it
goes and we use
the I will say it
as fun with some
[Music]
procedures this is the name and again
name so here I am giving to I'm going to
give a user input and it will be as a
string okay you can give any I mean any
string or any statement what my user
input will be I will Define it
[Music]
here
course this is the report for a let's
make it
simple okay and where I'm going to put
it is in the active cell or the cell
that
I have it select okay what will be the
value
the value will be the user
[Music]
input I have defined user input as this
is a report for VBA so this cell turns
into you this is a report for
VBA I run this and you see
this so in some cases you need to run
this and you know it makes life quite
simple when you use VBA for this as we
have seen before we we have used message
box now I'm going to use the same
message box uh to display my name or you
can use it to display your name so let's
see how it goes I'm going to name it as
name okay and it's very simple you have
to define a message
box which displays your
name and I'm going to put it under codes
that my name name
is and we'll try to run
it see
here so it pops up uh message saying
that my name is itan so this is a
message box that you can display and I
can do anything with
[Music]
this this is a PBA
[Music]
okay I run it again and it pops this
message so these are the things that you
can use to customize or you know when
you open an Excel sheet or try to run a
workshop or a report and it pops up a
message customary welcome messages that
you can customize or you know Define a
she report or kind of data in it and
this can be used using uh run using the
message
box now I have another good example
wherein you know you can write a code to
tell Excel what is the value of a a cell
or what is the number that is there in
the cell so here it is I put this
sub okay number
and it will again populate a message
box which we set it
to
the the
entered value is and it should tell
me which or I specify which cell it is
that we are going to find the value of
okay so I give a range
of I have to give it in codes I'm going
to code
completed and it should tell me the
value of the number that is present in
the cell
A1
okay it ends let's try to run it
run it and it will give me the value so
this is how we can use Excel to
determine or show our populate a message
box which will give us the value of the
uh number that is there in the cell so
here I can change it
to a
4 as well and try to run it and it will
give me the number so this is simple way
of you know populating a message box
which will tell us the
value of
a uh let me show you one more simple
example where in a message box pops up
or a welcome message that can be po set
when you open the uh Excel or worksheet
so so let's uh name it as
Auto
[Music]
open and then again message box I want
it to populate and what does it say
I put it in codes
Welcome to
our
worksheet our
[Music]
Workshop it's very simple you just run
it
and see it pops up a message saying
welcome to a workshop so these are the
one more this is one more way where you
can you know run a code or to simple
welcome message on
Excel next I'm going to show you a code
wherein you can give a value or assign a
value to a particular cell by
simple
Cur so we name it as add
value now I specify the range I mean
where I'm going to specify a
cell where the value will be given to
the cell now I'm going to give it as
V5 okay I put it in codes close the
parenthesis what is the value that I'm
going to give value
equals
250 okay so now with this code I mean
I'm going to assign a value of 250 to
the cell B5 let's see
run it
see again I do it to
10
okay so this is how you can assign a
value to a particular
cell now I can run uh the same thing and
give a range of cells I mean let me make
it very simple
here B
I give it as
B1 through
b 5
as 450 so let's see what it does see
here I'm going I'm specifying the range
to be B1 through B5 so it is doing it
for the whole range
okay and
then and then I can give a another set
of range here like uh let me specify
it range to
be
[Music]
C1 I have to give it in course it will
give me an error C1
colon
C4 and I separate it with a comma and I
can specify another range so the next
one will be
D1 to
D4 and then I close the codes close the
parenthesis what is the value that I
give
is let's
say 2 three
0 and I try to run it so it gives the
value of C1 through C 4 and D1 through
D4 as 230 as be specified in the code so
this is one one more example whereing
you can assign values to
the uh so range of cells or cells and
with the
BBA one more thing I can U you know
assign a value to a particular cell by
specifying the cells it's a very simple
just specify the cells like uh oh
six Comm 7
okay and I close the
parenthesis I assign a value to it value
equals 10 let's
see see here it assigns the value to
that particular cell that we have
specified row six and column 7 okay so
this is one more uh example wherein you
can assign values to particular cell
else okay in the next example uh there
will be a scenario where in you need to
select a range of cells in a sheet so
this can also be done this task can also
be performed using vpa so I will show
you
how this is
our let's say
select
range okay and uh
and I am going to set a dim variable as
example okay let's say it as example and
what I'm doing is I'm specifying a range
because I need to select a range of
cells okay now I'm going to set the
variable
as set example where I'm going to define
the range of the cells that should be
selected so let's say a one
t
five okay this will be the
selection and what I'm going
to set the value okay I going to set a
value
example I'm going to give it a value of
256 so let's see how it pans
out okay so here I'm selecting a set of
cells a range of cells and I'm going to
assign a value with this function so
this makes it quite simple and this will
be used in a regular daily task where
you know there is there will be a
scenario whereing you have to select a
set of cells and give give a value to it
so you can do it with a click of a
button with the vpa now I can simply
tweak this with the you know by just
selecting it so there
is I'll remove
this and instead of assigning a value I
just put an option to select
it now let's just run it and see what
happens
next okay so this is one way of you know
just selecting it okay and then you it
becomes easier for you to copy paste and
do some functions in so you can select
this and you can assign a value and you
you can also give a set of values to a
particular range or cells with these
codes now what if I want to do a
selection of the same rows and columns
in the next sheet and I can do this with
the set of another set of command so I
will show you how so here let's say you
know we set the same thing and we
specify the worksheets okay worksheet
I want it in sheet two okay so I just
put it as sheet two and I activate it
basically activating it and now I'm
going to specify the
worksheet two and what is the range that
I'm going to select the same thing okay
the range will
be
A1 to D5
okay what I'm going to do I'm going to
select
it okay and see what happens
here okay P so here I am selecting the
worksheet to and I'm activating it and
I'm going to assign range and I'm going
to select it so I can just copy the same
or select the same set of cells in the
next sheet okay now when there will be
as I said there will be you know a
requirement where you need to copy some
cell contents and paste it to another
location so how you do that it's a again
a simple code that you can write and
let's
say let's say it as a copy and paste I'm
just making it simple by giving
something that we can understand and
relate
[Music]
copy
paste okay so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to select this range and I'm
going to copy it and paste it somewhere
here okay so let me just remove this and
I'll show you first we have to specify
the range where you want to copy the
cells okay so let's say it is again
A1 should be in codes
call
D5
course and I am going to select it okay
then what I'm going to do is uh once you
select this the selection that you have
should what should be the function and I
am going to specify the selection and
the function should be copying it okay
so I just set that and where I'm going
to paste it so I have to now specify the
range where I have to paste this
selection and you can just mention
the column here uh let's say
G uh
10 okay and close
it I'm going to select it and then where
I'm going to past it I can do it in this
sheet okay active sheet
and paste so we are selecting a range of
cells selection and that selection what
we are doing is we will copy it and now
we are going to specify the range where
you going to select it and then paste it
quite simple
that's okay
see and
you can just change it so it is visible
on
this
G5
okay so this makes uh quite easy and you
can run it uh the next scenario will be
like when you need to get the count of
the number of cells like you have to
have a selection and you need to count
the number of cells so this can also be
done and it's quite easy I am going to
show it to
you let's say the
subb
count
cells should always be relatable so that
you know you remember and you understand
what is the output and why you're using
it and I'm going to set a variable let's
say I'm going to set an example for this
and what we going to do is we are going
to specify a range first okay we we will
specify the range of the cells that we
are going to that we need to count
basically so I'm going to set a variable
as a range and then what we're going to
do
is
example and we specify the range
here you can specify the range or your
selection where you count the where you
need the count of the number of cells so
E1 colum D5
CS this is n now how you want the output
you want it you want a message box to
pop out so you will set a message
box
and what should it give you will give
you the count of the variable that is
the variable is here is examples okay so
it will count the number of cells in
this area
okay uh let's see it
says okay here I think I missed it so I
just specify the number here and let's
see so it gives you the number of count
in this 20
okay now let's see I want
to
six so it gives you the selection so
it's quite simple it will be very useful
in our daily task and where you need to
count the number of cells so this is one
way to get it well I can further tweak
this and to determine the or to count
the number of rows or columns so it's
again very simple I just need to do some
changes here I have to set the column
count so if I want to calculate the
number of columns
just let's see how it it should
calculate or give the message the number
of columns here see it gives there are
five columns okay 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 okay so
it gives us the number of columns here
if I change it to should give me
four for number okay similarly you can
count the number of rows
here just change it to
rows see says six rows are
there
okay should give me
m see so this way you can calculate the
number of uh count the number of uh
cells number of columns number of rows
with
this the next thing I'm going to talk
about is the if statement if statement
is one of the most widely used statement
and whoever is in programming are very
much familiar with this function so what
it does is we specify a condition if a
condition is met then the out output
should be such and such we can specify
the condition and it will check whether
that condition is there
and if it is uh spec mean if it is
achieved then you will have to specify
the output as well so this can be
achieved with the if
statement okay and it is very easy
because it is it understands the basic
uh English language so you it's not very
complicated and I'll show you how so the
syntax can be like this if suppose you
specify a condition and if that
condition is met then the result you
specify the condition and the result
both okay so this is one thing and then
you can specify the else or else
condition where you know you specify D
condition two then the result should
be
this so here you are going to specify
two conditions or multiple conditions
wherein you specify I this and if it is
there then result will be this if it is
this condition and then the result will
be something else let's take an example
wherein you have to you have some scores
or
marks and you have to select the result
you can't do this manually entering so
just you can write your code suppose for
example I have it here
okay let's
show and I specify
as
if
statement okay now I have to specify the
variables now I have two variables I
have a score and and I have a result and
the score is an integer the number and
the result is a string pass or fail so I
specify this okay
dim
score I specify it as integer okay and
then there's another variable that I
have to set
result
as string okay
now what the score will be the score I
have to specify the range score I'm
giving it as a range ad me
the it's in
my cell
A1
okay I specify the range what is it it
is a
value
okay
sorry should be a
okay and then I'm specifying a condition
here if score VAR the
variable is greater than or equal so as
I said it's quite simple and it takes
the basic English uh language
functions
then the result result is another
variable that I have said result what it
should be it should be in codes
pass okay so if this condition is met
then the result will be this okay and
now where I want to specify my result I
should give a range for that as well so
I give it in the next column or
anyone this is the basic uh
example value should be the
result okay let's see H
DRS see say
pass change it to
40 it doesn't give me anything because I
have specified only one condition here
okay change 75 let's see howrs
see so this way it's very basic
condition that you are specifying you
are specifying two variables the score
and the result and then you are giving a
value for it and you are specifying the
condition if the score is greater than
then the result should be
pass now in the next uh section uh we
will simply tweak this and use an if
then else statement we'll attach an L
statement with it and see we'll specify
another condition and see so here again
we'll use two variables that is a score
as integer and the result as a string
and let's uh stick to the same
values and now um I'm going to specify
it and if the score is greater than
60 then the
result so the result will be pass as it
is before and then
I'm going to specify another condition
here
else the result should
be should
be
okay okay and now I have to put it as a
end if statement I have to specify the
end and the result will be again in the
value I mean the range will be B so let
let's see if it is more than 60 then it
is passed otherwise it is
fail okay it this pass let's see 40
and run it
again so okay so we are specifying two
variables again we are giving it a range
and we are specifying one condition if
this condition is met the result is
passed otherwise else it is failed
so another set of
example uh the next uh statement that we
use uh or we going to discuss is the
loop statement that is the for Loop
statement and why we use it there are
there are situations and uh task that
you need to execute and you need to do
it separate number of times these are
basically executed sequentially it means
one after another so the first treatment
or the function is executed and the next
is taken up so and then the next and so
on so these uh loop statements allow us
to execute a statement or a group of
statements multiple number of times many
number of times and this happens only
when the first task or the first uh task
is done and it executes that and it goes
to the next one so here we'll discuss a
simple example of the for Loop statement
so let's see how it works and I'm going
to set up a loop statement okay again
the I'm going to make it as Loop one so
here it is I have to specify the uh
variable that is
dim and I'm going to specify X as an
integer okay I'll try to execute it and
then explain it what happens and how it
executes okay for x equals to one
to 24 okay let's see and I'm going to
specify the
range range as so what I'm going to do
is basically I'm going to fill the
column A from 1 to 24 with some value
from 1 to 24 with the values of 1
through 24 okay so I'm setting up a
range
and How It Ends is it gives me a
value now it executes this and goes to
the next so I'll explain you how so we
are setting up a loop we are setting up
a integer variable X as integer and we
are setting the value of x to be 1 to 24
so here for one it executes the first
thing is it it takes X as one and it
fills in
A1 and then the next value of x will be
two and it goes to A2 and fills the
value as two so just let's try to
execute this and you will see the row
column A filled with one through
24 see it's quite simple it executes one
condition and then goes to the next and
we are defining it with the number of
values and the variable as X
and the number of values is 1 to be
24 okay so this is one basic example of
a for Loop
statement uh now let's do some more uh
addition to this uh uh example by you
know executing another set of for Loop
and giving the output and we'll code the
output to be the color coded once in the
column B so how we do it it's a basic
simple example that I'm going to take
and and again what I'm going to do is I
will have this values here and I'm going
to col code the B column with certain
color index for each number there will
be a different color so let's see and
what I'm going to do is I'm only going
to change the
B and what action is going here we put
up a value now we going to select it and
with this selection
what I'm going to do is it should select
it and it should color the interior with
what with the color index
okay and the value of
x and then I'm going to specify the
pattern what uh pattern it will take for
the box to be colored and and I'm going
to put it as a
solid it will fill the whole thing with
the
solid and then I just execute it see it
takes
this color B and let's code it like this
so these are the simple things that you
can set up with the codes and for Loop
statements so there are numerous
examples and exercises that we can
perform task we can perform with the
BBA and uh this can be uh found in
detail now next courses Advanced courses
