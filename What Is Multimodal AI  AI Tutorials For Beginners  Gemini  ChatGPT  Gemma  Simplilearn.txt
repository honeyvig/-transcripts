hi everyone welcome to the simply Lear
YouTube channel today we will discuss
about booming topic of this era
multimodel AI let's understand with an
example imagine you are showing a friend
your vacation photos you might describe
the site you saw the sounds you heard
and even your emotions this is how
humans naturally understand the World by
combining information from different
sources multimodel AI aims to do the
same thing let's break the model AI
first multimodel refers to two different
ways of communicating information like
text speech images and videos where AI
stands for artificial intelligence which
are systems that can learn and make
decision so multimodel AI is a type of
AI that can process and understand
information from multiple sources just
like you do when you look at your
vacation photos before delving more into
multimodel AI so here is a just quick
info for you craving a career upgrade
subscribe like and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FasTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back if you want to switch careers with
AI and ml then try giving simply lar
postgraduate program in Ai and machine
learning from P University in
collaboration with IBM this course
teaches in demand skills such as machine
learning deep learning NLP compter
Vision reinforcement learning generative
AI prompt engineering chat gbt and many
more so don't forget to check out the
course link from the description box and
pin comment now that we have understood
what is multimodel AI let's now go a bit
further it is obvious that multimodel AI
is not the only AI out there but what is
big deal about multimodel AI that
everyone is talking about that is what
we will discuss in this segment so now
let's understand the difference between
multimodel Ai and the generative AI
while both multimodel Ai and generative
AI are exciting advancement in AI they
defer in their approach to data and
functionality so generative AI Focus
creates new data similar to the data
it's strained down and in multimodel AI
focus is to understand and processes
information from multiple sources that
is text speech images and videos data
types of generative AI are primary works
with a single data type like text
writing poems or images that is
generating realistic portraits whereas
in multimodel AI data types works with
diverse data types enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the world
the third one is examples like chat
boards text generation models image
editing tools whereas multimodel AI
example covers virtual assistance
medical diagnosis system and autonomous
vehicles strength are can produce
creative and Innovative content
automative repetitive task and
personalize your experience whereas in
multimodel AI strength are provides a
more humanlike understanding of the
world and improve accuracy in Ence
generative AI excels at creating new
data while multimodel AI excels at
understanding and utilizing exising data
from diverse sources they can be
complimentary with generative models
being used to create new data for
multimodel AI systems to learn more from
and improve their understanding to the
work next let's understand what are the
benefits of multimodel AI the benefits
of multimodel AI is that it offers
developers and users an AI with more
advanced reasoning problem solving and
generation capabilities these
advancement offers endless possibilities
for how Next Generation application can
change the way way we work and live for
developers looking to start building Vex
AI Gemini API offers features such as
Enterprise security data residency
performance and technical support if
your existing Google Cloud customers can
start prompting with Gemini AI in Vex AI
right now next let's see what are the
multimodel AI big challenges multimodel
AI is powerful but faces hurdles the
first one is data overload managing and
storing massive diverse data is
expensive and complex the second one is
meaning mystery teaching AI to
understand subtle difference in between
meaning like sarcasm is tricky the third
one is data alignment ensuring data
points from different sources saying in
tune is challenging the fourth one is
data scarcity limited and potentially
biased data sets hinder effective
training the fifth one is missing data
Blues what happens when data is missing
like disorted audio the last one is
Black Box Blues understanding how AI
makes decision can be difficult so these
challenges must be addressed to unlock
the full potential of model AI next
let's see what is the future of
multimodel AI and why is it important
multimodel Ai and multimodels are
represent a Leap Forward in how
developers build and expand the
functionality of AI in the next
generation of application for example
Gemini can understand explain and
generate high quality code in the
world's most popular programming
languages like python Java C++ and go
freeing developers to work on building
more featured field application
multimodels AI potential also bring the
world closer to AI That's less like
smart software and more like an expert
