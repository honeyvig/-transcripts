the description box below so moving
forward let's see what is mlops mL of
short for machine learning operation is
a set of practices tools and principles
that aim to streamline and enhance the
deploy appointment management and
monitoring of machine learning models in
production of environments it draws
inspiration from devops development and
operation practices and applies them
specifically to the challenges of
deploying and maintaining ml model
effectively moving forward let's see
what is the use of mlops mloff serves
crucial purposes in the context of
deploying and managing ml models in
production environment the first one is
efficient development mlops helps
automate the deployment process of
machine learning models making it faster
reputable and less error prone this
enables the organization to quickly
transition from development to
production reducing the time it takes to
make model available to end user the
second one is collaboration mlops
encourages collaboration between
different teams such as data scientists
machine learning engineer operation and
business stakeholder by frosting better
communication and Alignment mlops helps
deliver solution that meets Technical
and business requirement the third one
is monitoring and in it mlos provides
tools for monitoring the performance of
deployed models in real world condition
this allows teams to detect anomalies
track key performance metrics and
address issue promptly ensuring that the
models continue to deliver accurate
result over time the fourth one is cost
efficiency by optimizing resource
utilization and automatic process mlops
can lead to cost saving efficiently
managed deployment reduce operational
overhead and resource wasted making
machine learning project more
economically viable the fifth one is
Security in many Industries compliance
and security are Paramount concern mlr
provides practices for managing access
controls data privacy and regular
environment ensuring deployed model
adhere to necessary standard so in
summary amylops plays a critical role in
maximizing the value of machine learning
by ensuring that models are efficiently
deployed monitored maintained and
improved in production environments it
enables organization to drive consistent
reliable and scalable benefits from
their machine learning investment moving
forward let's see some real world
application of mlops so mlos find
application in various areas where
machine learning models are deployed in
real world production environment some
typical application of ml Ops include
the first one is Predictive Analytics
mlops helps deploy Predictive Analytics
that analyze historical data to predict
future events these models are used in
finance market sales and other
Industries to forecast Trends and
optimize decision making the second one
is image video analysis ml Ops is used
to application like image classification
object detection and facial recognition
these Technologies are employed in
security system autonomous vehicles and
Medical Imaging the third one is
Healthcare and Medical Diagnostic mlops
AIDS in development and deploying models
for medical imaging analysis disease
diagnosis drug Discovery and patient
risk assessment the fourth one is
autonomous system amylops is crucial for
autonomous systems like vehicle drones
and Robotics ensuring that AI model
function is liable and adapt to changing
condition so these are some just a few
example of mlo and the application of
mlops are continuously expanding as
organization explore new ways to
leverage machine learning in their
operation so accelerate your career in

we're join now seats are failing fast
course link is in the description box
below and in the pinned comment moving
forward let's see component of envelopes
the extent of ml Ops in machine learning
project can vary based on the project
needs sometimes ml Ops covers everything
from preparing the data to making the
final model other times it might just
involve putting the model into action
most companies use mlops for the first
one is exploded data analysis looking
into the data to understand it the
second one is getting the data ready and
making valuable features from it data
preparation and feature engineering the
third one is model training and the fine
tuning the fourth one is model review
and the governance fifth one is model
inference and serving model six one is
model deployment and monitoring the last
one is teaching the model again
automatically when needed moving forward
let's see some difference between
amylopes and devops the first one is
mlops specifically focus on the
deployment monitoring and management of
machine learning model while devops
devops Family Focus on the collaboration
and integration between development and
operation the second one is it is
centered around machine learning AI
application addressing the unique
challenges of deploying and maintaining
models while in devops it applies to
software development in in general
covering all aspects of software
engineering and deployment the third one
is mlops involves automating the
end-to-end machine learning lifecycle
from data pre-processing to data model
monitoring and retraining here while
devops aims to streamline the deployment
lifecycle automate deployment pipelines
improve collaboration and ensure faster
and more Reliable Software releases and
the fourth one is mlops employs tools
for model versioning model packaging
model monitoring automated returning and
model explanation while devops employs
tools like Version Control Systems like
git continuous integration containers
deployment cicd pipelines configuration
management and infrastructure as code to
achieve its score the last one is
efficient model deployment continuous
model performance monitoring
reproductively collaboration between
data scientists and engineers and
adapting to changing data and
requirements here the faster development
Cycles continuous integration quick and
automated deployment improve team
collaboration and increase software
reliability
in somebody
while devops and mL of share concept of
automation collaboration and continuous
Improvement devops has a broader focus
on software development and deployment
while ml Ops is tailors to change the
challenges specific or to deployment and
managing machine learning models in
production setting both practices aims
to enhance efficiency collaboration and
reliability in their respective domains
and with that we have come to end of
