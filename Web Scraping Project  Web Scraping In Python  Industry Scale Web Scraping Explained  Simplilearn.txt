hello everyone I am M and welcome to
this video on web scrapping with python
web scribing is a powerful technique
that allows you to automatically extract
data from website turning the vast
amount of information available online
into something you can easily analyze
and use whether you are gathering data
for research building a data set for
machine learning project or just curious
about how websites work behind the
scenes web scripting is an essential
skills to help have in your toolkit on
the other hand python is one of the most
popular programming languages for web
scripting thanks to its Simplicity and
the wealth of libraries available in
this video we will explore how to use
Python to scrip data from website and we
will dive into practical examples using
python libraries like request and
beautiful soup to fetch and parts web
content but it's not just about the code
web scripting sces with its own set of
challenges and ethical consideration we
will talk about how to script
responsibility respecting the rules set
by websites and ensuring that your
scraping activity don't negatively
impact the sites you are collecting data
from so by the end of this video you
will have a solid understanding of how
to start scraping data from the web
using python whether you are new to
programming or looking to add web
scripting to your skill set this video
will give you the knowledge and tools
you need to get started so let's jump in
and see how python can help you unlock
the full potential of the web craving a
career upgrade subscribe like and
comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we start if you want to
learn Ai and ml from the industry
experts chice influance postgraduate
program in Ai and machine learning from
P University in collaboration with IBM
this score teaches in demand skills such
as machine learning deep learning NLP
compter Vision reinforcement learning
generative AI prompt engineering chat
GPT and many more so don't forget to
check out the course link from the
description box below and the pin
command so without any further Ado let's
get started so here I using this Google
collab for the web scraping okay you can
use your
own like jup notebook visual code Studio
any okay so here I will write
scraping using
python okay then here first you have to
install some libraries like you know uh
request and you have to install
beautiful
so and you have to install that you know
pandas because we will create one data
frame and we will save it then we will
check our data okay and you can install
some basic p
like and all that okay so here first I
will
import
request okay then I will write from
bs4
import
beautiful
so
okay then I will write in cot
pandas as
P fine then now what I will do okay
let's see what is this request and all
the so request is an STP client library
for the Python programming language so
request is one of the most you know
downloaded python libraries okay like
more like over 2,000 not exactly 2,000
sorry 200 or 300 million monthly
download okay so what it does it Maps
the stt protocol onto Python's subject
oriented semantics and here Beautiful
soap So Beautiful soap is a python
package for you know parsing the HTML
and XML documents including those with
know Mal phone mark it creates a parser
for documents that can be you know used
to extract data HTML from HTML which is
useful for web script let me run it here
our second step will
be Define the URL and the address okay
URL
add so URL okay from where you want to
Che your data so I will write here
simply
Lear that this okay let's open this PMP
certification C it yeah so here I will
write this
and
headers equals
to so these are the headers okay so like
in which you know device or you're
working on which browser you are working
on so these are for the headers so now
what I will do I will send a get request
to the simply lar page okay this URL for
that
know
sending get
Quest okay have I
response
request dot
get then you
added comma
headers question
headers okay that we run it okay working
fine so now uh let's check if the
request is successful or not for that
if
response do status
code equals
toal
200 then
so it
for okay then
response do
content
comma
HTML pass
okay
here so here I write
codes titles why because here I'm you
know initializing the list to store our
titles or whatever the things are okay
basically the data okay why I'm writing
course here because this is again course
page that's why nothing else okay here I
will give the MD
list so now we will find all course
titles based on the actual HTML
structure what is HTML
structure you have to go to the page
right click then inspect
okay according to this HTML structure
means what is the class name what is the
you know this PMP certification is which
heading H1 heading H2 heading which
heading it
is okay so let's
see which heading it is okay this PMP
certification training H1 heading okay
just remember H1
adding so here I will write
for codes and
so do
find
or
H1
okay then
title equals to for
text do
strip okay
then here I write
course
titles dot
append T
okay now what I will do I will
check if any data was extracted before
it not okay I will write if
course titles
here I will create a data frame
DF PD do data
frame in this I will write course trt it
will be a you know uh that column name
so for write course seta
okay
then
course titles
okay then here I will write
DF do
2
CSV then uh just create simply l. CSV
okay so our data will be Sav in this
simply le. CSV CSV fine here what I will
do I will write index equals to false
print
data print data is save in
CSV simply run.
CSV
fine so here I will
write
else
print web page
okay
right retrieve the we page okay that's
it let me run
it
okay it respond to this
group spond subject has no attribute
status code okay
okay
title it is text some minor spelling
mistakes are
there sorry sorry my
bad again
okay
sorry D will be capital F will be
Capital yeah so now you can see data is
saved in simply. CSV so what I will do I
will write data equals to everyone know
how to read CSV in Python pg. read
CSV what was a file name simply learn.
CSV okay let me copy paste run it and
then find
data okay PMP certification training
data is fed okay here you can see H1 we
gave and that's why PMP certification
trading came let's take what's in
H2 okay in H2 there is leading Premier
PMI partner something is there okay I
will change
here H H2 then I it
okay
fine see leading Premier P PMI okay let
me make it big yeah so now you can see C
data we mentioned
so if you will see this H1 didn't come
why because we have mentioned H2 that's
why so these all are the s
to okay so what is this I don't know
okay this is a Time series graph this is
Google C thing okay so this is how you
can literally retrieve your data from
any website okay just remember that some
websites don't give you access to their
you know for the scrapping just like
Amazon don't give so you have to use at
that time API and this is not ethical
also to use someone's data okay without
asking or whatever you guys so with this
