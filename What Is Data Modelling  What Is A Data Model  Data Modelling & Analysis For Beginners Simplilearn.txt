hello everyone welcome to this video by
simply learn have you ever felt
overwhelmed by the sheer amount of data
your company collects customer
information sales record and website
analytics can all become a jumbled mess
without any clear structure or
organization that's where data modeling
comes in data modeling is the process of
creating a blueprint that shows how
different pieces of data relate to each
other it's like having a map to navigate
the landscape of your company's data let
me demonstrate with a story ran is a
marketing Analyst at a rapidly growing
e-commerce company his boards gave him
the important job of using the company's
data and finding insights from the data
which will help the company grow and
increase sales ran soon finds himself
drowning in an ocean of data from his
company no matter how hard he tries he
cannot make sense of it at all that's
when his Sophia introduced him to the
concept of data modeling by creating a
data model for sales and customer data
they identified key entities like
customers products and orders and Define
the relationship between them suddenly
the chaotic data starts to make sense
and patterns emerge with the data model
as a guide ran could now easily analyze
customer behaviors identify Trends and
uncover opportunities he presented
valuable insights to his boss who
recognized the power of data modeling
data modeling allows you to understand
and organize your data effectively it's
the foundation for extracting meaningful
insights that drive better decision
making and business growth so if you're
feeling lost in your company's data
remember that data modeling is the map
that can guide you through the Maze and
unlock the true potential of your data
assets all right let's get started in
this video I will break down everything
you need to know about data modeling and
Analysis and provide a comprehensive
study of data modeling and Analysis we

so without further Ado let's get started
all right let's get started data
modeling my friends it's all about
defining the structure of your database
imagine you've got this raw data coming
from an API or maybe some sales
information it's usually a bit of mess
right just a bunch of numbers letters
and codes representing transactions
customer details and whatnot well data
modeling helps you bring all to that CHS
by aligning the data and integrating it
into your existing database think of it
like this suppose you are an architect
designing a blueprint for your data you
decide how different pieces of
information relate to each other like
how payment connects to orders or how
customer details link to their purchase
history it visually represents the
different data elements and how they
relate to each other following certain
predefined rules and guidelines but why
bother with all of this you might ask
well data modeling is a foundation for
everything you do with your data it
ensures data integrity and accuracy
making sure your machine learning models
aren just training on garbage data or
giving you nonsensical predictions
moreover it aids in database design
application development and data
analysis allowing you to extract
valuable insights from your organized
information and let's not forget about
data governance having a clear
understanding of where your data lives
what types of of data you're storing and
the security measures is the key to
compliance with those pesky regulations
and standards now let's talk about the
different types of data models out there
at first we've got a good old model
which is the relational model this uses
tables to store data and establish
relationships between them it's
relatively simple to set up and has
powerful query capabilities making it a
popular choice then we've got the
objectoriented model which combines data
and operation s into a single model
these are great for applications with
complex relationship and operations like
maybe modeling the robotics of a car
factory but probably not an AI model
that wouldn't make much sense right
we've got also network data models which
are an extension of hierarchial models
it allows for multiple parent records
for each child representing more complex
relationship and let's not forget about
the entity relationship model which
gives you a clear logical View of your
data by mapping out entities attributes
and relationship it's like a giant web
of connections making it easy to
understand how data flows from one point
to another now when it comes to
implementing data modeling you've got a
bunch of tools at your disposal from
dedicated Solutions like er studio and
DB schema to open source options like PG
modeler and MySQL workbench you've also
got collaborative online tools like
usage chart which is perfect for teams
working together on data models and
let's not forget the good old Oracle SQL
data modeler and IBM infosphere data
architect for those who are in business
intelligence and analytics game but wait
there's more the data modeling process
itself is a journey first you start with
the conceptual modeling where you get a
high level understanding of the data
you're working with and what your
stakeholders need from it it's like the
rough draft of your data blueprint then
we move on to the logical data model
where we get technical details
attributes primary Keys foreign Keys
relationship between tables next we have
physical modeling this is where we
design our database schema and optimize
it for performance indexing and
partioning to make sure your data runs
like a well oiled machine after that you
finally create the database and start
ingesting your business data but the
fund doesn't stop there you've got to
keep maintaining and updating your data
model as your needs change cap uring
those data changes over time and making
adjustments to keep everything run
smoothly and there you have it data
modeling is the backbone of your data
Universe ensuring that your application
analytics and decision making process
are built on solid foundation of well
structured and organized information
after establishing a robust data model
the next step is to delve into the
fascinating world of data analysis this
is where the real magic happens data
analysis empowers you to uncover hidden
pattern PS Trends and relationship
within your meticulously organized data
through data analysis you can transform
raw information into actionable
intelligence that drives ined decision
making it's like uncovering a treasure
drove of knowledge buried within your
data waiting to be exploded and
leveraged for strategic Advantage now
let's switch gears and talk about data
analysis well data analysis is all about
evaluating the data itself it's like
being a detective looking for Clues and
patterns in the data to tell a
compelling story you might run reports
create custom queries or even merge data
from multiple sources to get a complete
picture it's like piecing together
puzzle but with numbers and information
instead of colorful pieces we will now
discuss the several types of data
analysis each serving a different
purpose at first we have descriptive
analysis which help you to see what has
already happened by looking at the past
data then we have the diagnostic
analysis to determine why something
happened by examining the data
predictive analysis uses past data to
predict what might happen in the future
and finally prescriptive analysis
combines all others to make
recommendations for the future where
does a data analyst fit into this
intricate web of data modeling well a
data analyst is the master architect
designing the blueprints that bring
order to the chaos of raw data they
Define how different pieces of
information relate to each other
following predefined rules and
guidelines it's like creating a massive
catalog for your organization data
assets ensuring everything is accounted
for and organized to be a master of data
analysis you just need two crucial
skills first you need to have a solid
understanding of the business what the
data means and how it impacts the
organization operation but that's not
all you also need some serious technical
chops you need to know your way around
databases business intelligence systems
and the tools needed to extract and
analyze the precious data and let's not
forget the demand for skilled data
analyst is soaring according to the
industry reports the average data
analyst salary in the US projected to
reach around
$75,000 with the opportunities for
experienced professionals to earn well
over six figures now you might be
thinking are in data modeling and
Analysis two different Skillets well
you're not wrong but here's when it's
get interesting data analysis and data
modeling data modeling and data analysis
often overlap to truly understand how
data moves from one system to another or
how different field maps together you
might need to flex your data analysis
and dive into the raw data itself this
Synergy has led to the rise of combined
business intelligence and business
analysis role a dynamic duo where data
modeling and data analysis Joint Forces
to create powerful business insights and
intelligence it's like having a
superhero team from where each skill set
compliments the other now you might be
thinking but wait aren't there still
opportunities for more General
functional business analysis roles while
dedicated business intelligence is in
high demand there's still a thriving
market for those who prefer a more
broad-based approach let us now discuss
the career paths in data related rules
the key thing to understand is that data
modeling and data analysis go hand in
hand good modeling ensures you have
accurate structured data skilled
analysis that allows you to truly unlock
the value in the data through insights
companies need expertise in both areas
for a comprehensive data strategy if you
really enjoy digging into Data to find
hidden insights a dedicated business
intelligence analyst role could be
perfect but there are also General
business analyst role available that
still requires good data modeling skills
whichever path you choose having skills
in both data analysis and modeling is
very valuable with strong abilities in
these areas your data projects are much
more likely to succeed and that's all
