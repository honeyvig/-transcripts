hi everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel in this session we will
be learning user interface and user
experience designs
now before we begin i would like to tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn
so without further ado let's get started
with today's session on user interface
and user experience
so the user interface or user experience
design or also known as uiux is the
process of creating digital products
with a user-first approach
the goal of ui ux design is to provide a
product that is both aesthetic and
extremely pleasurable to use
it is a common idea that ui and ux are
essentially the same thing and belong to
the same discipline but that is not
totally accurate
they are separate fears that concentrate
on different aspects of the user
interaction with a digital product
however they are closely related and
overlapped in so many ways that they are
largely merged into one profession
so to start off with let's have a quick
look at the agenda for today's session
we will start off by understanding what
is ui ux we will move on to what skills
do ui ux designers need and what are
their tasks next we will see the
difference between ui and ux then what
are the research techniques in ui ux and
how they work together and what are the
disadvantages of combining them both
so i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda
now what is user experience and user
interface is our first topic let's get
going
so how a person will engage with a
product understanding your users
complete journey and translating it into
a product
the interaction of human user with daily
products and services is the subject of
ux design
it includes user engagement
user engagement would come up if you
were to summarize the aim of your user
experience efforts
they maintain a connection with their
user interests motivations and ambitions
through engagement
next objectives
objectives as in the industry ux design
seeks to increase consumer satisfaction
and loyalty through the usability
simplicity of use and enjoyment provided
in the engagement with a product ux
refers to the complete user experience
that customers receive with a product by
evaluating products usability we can
tell whether consumers can execute tasks
successfully and quickly good usability
is the basics for a successful user
experience and it is frequently confused
by user experience and the simplicity of
use a part of user experience ux design
is usability usability is the second
level of user experience therefore you
must address your product's usability
once you've established that it can
resolve users problems the degree to
which a designer's features fit users
demands and situations determines how
usable the design is
and usability involves navigation
the discipline of creating analyzing and
implementing ways for users to navigate
through a website or app familiarity
next is consistency
a usable and user-friendly design always
provides a consistent experience
followed by that we have error
prevention
alerting a user when they are making an
error with the intention to make it easy
for them to do whatever it is they are
doing without a mistake
next we have feedback feedback is used
to engage and explain and can improve
the user satisfaction
followed by that we have visual clarity
visual clarity is the measure of how
effectively visual design prioritizes
and conveys information
lastly we have flexibility
it is about knowing your customers and
giving flexibility for different
customer intents now that we have brief
understanding of what ux is let us
understand what is ui
ui or user interface the point of human
contact and interaction on a device is
called user interface this can include
desktop displays keyboards mice and
other pointing devices it also refers to
the manner in which a user engages with
a website or application
in other words they design the user
interface of a website or app
after knowing what is user interface we
will see the different types of user
interface
first we have command line interface or
cl line cli enables users to input
commands into a terminal or dashboard
window in order to communicate with a
piece of software and it is a platform
or channel where users respond to a
visible prompt by typing a command and
receiving the system's response
next we have gui or graphical user
interface graphical user interface
enables people to engage with just an
operating system using graphics in the
graphical user interface there are menus
like windows scroll bars buttons wizards
painting pictures alternative icons and
much more it is simple to understand and
natural the user is shown or given
information in any format including
plain text videos photos etc followed by
that we have touch graphical user
interface a touch graphical user
interface can be used with either the
user's fingerprints or a stylus to
control graphics
this can be done on a desktop computer
laptop or a portable device like mobile
phone touchscreen graphical user
interfaces are increasingly used in
hospital situations and provide both
patients and healthcare workers with a
number of advantages
there are a lot of skills required for
both ui and ux let's have a look at
those skills
skills ux designers need due to the
nature of their work
ux designers require a technological
skill set such as design or development
with programs like sketch caused by
defect and adobe xd successful ux
designers have had the following soft
talents or abilities
let's discuss the different skills for
ux designers
in addition to hard capabilities are
research problem solving and
communication
research research is a fundamental skill
designers must derive useful insights
from the data they gather both in early
stages and during the real world testing
next we have problem solving in a
process called dynamic ux designers look
at a variety of methods to solve a
single user problem
they not only fix difficulties during
prototypes but they also continuously
develop and improve goats or services to
make them more user-friendly finally we
have communication
because ux design is indeed a highly
collaborative process communication is
essential
this includes being able to effectively
communicate within the team and to
customers about the user's needs and
requirements when using the product
now let's discuss about the skills that
ui designers need
to work as a ui designer
they must need some hard skills
ui designers must keep up with current
trends methods and technologies to grow
they must be familiar with design
aesthetics user interfaces and brand
design layouts and other aspects of
graphic design
they must also know how to use graphic
design and wireframing software
there are some of the following skills
required to become a ui designer
creativity the only way ui designers can
effectively fix problems is by coming up
with novel ideas
since imagination is a part of
creativity businesses seek out creative
individuals
teamwork and communication
the user interface designer must work
well with others they collaborate
closely with product architects and web
developers
so clear communication is essential for
a successful end product
adaptability technology evolves at a
rapid pace
to consistently develop their products
and services good ui design embraces
changes and keeps on top of the industry
trends
after knowing the skills required for ux
and ui designers we will look into their
different tasks
ux designers
ux designers start by researching
in-person interviews are frequently the
first step in user research
these conversations allow them to have a
better understanding of the user's
motives and problems
user tests are also conducted by the
designer to observe the user activity
they improve and deliver the greatest
possible user experience by detecting
both verbal and non-verbal stumbling
obstacles such tasks done by ux
designers are user understanding analyze
interaction and wireframing or
prototyping
so the first one is user understanding
the depth research is typically the
first step in ux design with the aim of
understanding the audience their needs
and wants
a key competency for us designers is
empathy it aids ux designers in
comprehending and revealing the hidden
wants and
reactions of the target audience
next the analyze interaction
designers of user experience examine how
users interact with things including
their routines preferences and shortcuts
better design solutions are proposed
during all the available insights and
the last one is prototyping
a prototype is a model or a trial
version that ux teams use for testing
before launching
it seeks to test and validate ideas
before sharing concepts with
stakeholders and ultimately handling of
the final versions to design engineers
for the development process ux designers
are always active in how a product is
put together
to make sure the design is going in a
proper direction they communicate with
each team member now after knowing tasks
done by ux designers we will look into
ui designer task
ui designers the web designer is in
charge of creating how the product is
set out graphically once the ux team has
completed their process and handled over
a wireframe they must of course design
from the user's perspective
this includes understanding interface
design and implementing basic design
principles it also entails selecting
fonts menu designs buttons icons and
other elements with care to both express
the brand and satisfy the user
there are several tasks done by ui
designers
and the first one is testing in general
ui testing sometimes referred to as
testing is a process designed to test
the features of any product that the
user will interact with
typically this involves doing tests on
the visual components to ensure that
they are performing and functionally in
accordance with the
specifications communication typically
the technical team ux designers and ui
designers collaborate closely
communicational abilities are needed to
grasp technical viability
wireframing one of the most important
processes in ui ux design is wireframing
this involves modeling the framework of
digital applications a wireframe is a
product outline that shows what software
components will be present in important
pages it is an essential step in process
of design interactions now we will see
the difference between ui ux
two of the terms used in web and
application design that get mixed up and
confused most are ux design and ui
design
and that makes sense
on the surface they appear to be
describing the same thing because they
are frequently combined in phase ui ux
design but don't worry we will try to
understand the basic differences between
ui and ux
user experience relates to the user's
experience of the product or service
whereas ui refers to the visual
components through which humans connect
with a product therefore ux focuses on
visual interface elements like fonts
colors menu bars and much more whereas
ui focuses on user and their experience
with the product after knowing the
difference of ux ui we will see the
research techniques in both ui ux the
practice of gathering information from
actual users in understanding their
demands and travel areas is known as
user research there are the following ux
research techniques
user persona a user persona is a
fictionalized picture of average user
the objective of this is to assist ux
designers to develop solutions with
particular target user in mind as
opposed to a general one user interviews
user interviews are a great method to
get user data learn why users encounter
certain issue and determine whether your
design fulfills their needs
next surveys a specific group of users
is sent a set of questions by designers
as a part of ux research survey to learn
more about their attitude and
preferences now we will see the research
techniques of ui designers
research ensures that user wants and
expectations are taken into
consideration while designing user
interfaces which is typically the very
first stage in the process
after the user experience has been
established the ui design process begins
the best color schemes patterns and
other visual components must be
determined by ui designers this makes it
possible for the ui designers to get
ideas and ensure that the design
components they select are in line with
users choices and needs
now we will see how they work together
while ui and ux design involve quite
distinct technical skills they are both
majorly elements that must work together
to provide the optimal user experience
without a proper ux design a beautiful
ui design might become clumsy and
complicated to navigate understanding
the user's demands should be the first
step in any front end design and
development process
now after this we will see the
disadvantages of combining them both
it's almost like wearing two hats at
once when you have a combined ui ux
function
ui and ux designers have diverse skill
sets even though most firms advertise a
ux ui function as a single unified rule
its main focus way of looking at things
and approach to prototyping a product
are very different
it might be difficult and reduce the
amount of focus needed for each
discipline in a mixed ui ux role to
constantly transition between ideas and
representations
so with that we have come to an end of
this session on ui and ux if you have
any queries regarding any of the topics
covered in this session or if you
require the resources that we used in
this session like ppd etc then please
