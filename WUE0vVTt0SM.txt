1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,240
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,520
tutorial my name is Henry bshi and this

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,080
time I'm going to be going over a

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,800
question that Lan sent me Lan is uh is

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,000
in Brazil uh he speaks Portuguese so

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,519
this question that he sent me is going

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,200
to be in Portuguese however there will

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,480
be an English translated version uh

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,720
which I will be saying after this

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,600
question uh and there will also be a

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,279
question down in the description uh so

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,000
yeah I'll show you the clip of his

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
question

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,000
for so now I'll explain exactly how this

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,480
app works so essentially this app will

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,520
be able to uh start off and then when

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,640
you click a little plus button uh you'll

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,199
get to to a view where you can click on

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,239
the customer button once you click on

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,199
the customer button uh you will be able

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,080
to see a list of your customers from a

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,840
database on the web which I will explain

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,640
in just a minute you can click on one of

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,880
the customers and you will get a

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,560
description the equipment they have from

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,119
you and their contact uh and so

27
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,400
basically all their information so now

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,920
let me give you a little bit more

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,400
detailed look on how this actually

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
works so let's see over here first of

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,560
all as you can see here we have our main

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,960
view uh and so this is written

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,240
Portuguese most of this but I mean uh

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,520
I'm going to be translating this to

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,200
English right as we continue first of

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,680
all chato in uh Portuguese means call in

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,600
English uh and so right as you click

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,680
this little plus button here uh you'll

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,799
get to this page on this page uh you can

40
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,880
click either this back button to get

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,439
back to this page or you can click on

42
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,520
the client button uh sorry if I'm not

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,000
pronouncing that right but in Portuguese

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,159
uh client in English would mean uh

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,119
customer so once you click on this

46
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,360
customer button it will show you this

47
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,119
little page now it retrieves all the

48
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,959
customers uh that you have from a

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,120
database like this as I've explained in

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
all my other Swift databases Parts uh

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
this is how it works so basically Swift

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,640
over here oh sorry not

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,360
eight too used to doing algebra

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,760
anyway okay so Swift over

55
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,519
here

56
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,480
wants to contact this

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
database now the thing is Swift can't

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,239
just directly contact the database there

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,840
has to be a bridge in between and that's

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,200
PHP so Swift will contact

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,560
PHP uh and it'll give it the request

62
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,959
that I want uh everything from the data

63
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,480
database PHP will go over to the

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,720
database the database will give to the

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,400
PHP and then the PHP will give back to

66
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,319
Swift That's how simple it is in order

67
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,120
to make an app like this so basically we

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,599
want this view this view

69
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,959
controller which is represented by Swift

70
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,360
want something from this database so

71
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,120
first it will use this to contact PHP

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
and give it the request PHP will then

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
continue the request in the second Arrow

74
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,000
over

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,159
here uh and then go to the database the

76
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,319
database will then give back to

77
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,920
PHP and then PHP will give to

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,319
Swift That's how simple that is anyway

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,239
so basically uh the database will

80
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,920
contain uh all the

81
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,760
customers

82
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,680
uh and so Swift wants to retrieve all

83
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,599
the customers which it has and it's also

84
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,040
put it into a table view so now let's

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,840
just say we were to click on

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,079
International meals and this gets

87
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,280
selected then what we do is we click on

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,079
the back button now it takes us to this

89
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,720
view however our view will look like

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,000
this due to the fact that basically when

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,479
we go back from here it'll tell you

92
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,280
it'll tell this view what you clicked on

93
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,840
depending on what you clicked on it'll

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,280
get all its information from the

95
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,320
database

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,960
again once it gets all the information

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,520
what it's going to do uh is it's going

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,639
to give it to this and

99
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,280
then it'll remove client from the table

100
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,320
view first of all then it'll add its

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,759
contact which is the email the equipment

102
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,720
that it took from you and also the

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,320
description of that client or that

104
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,280
customer

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,360
sorry and then the uh International

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,880
meals uh basically customer name will go

107
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,240
into a little label uh and then so

108
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,759
basically this is the same view just uh

109
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,440
it's been a little bit uh redesigned

110
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
with

111
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,680
code and then again since this is the

112
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,080
same view this back button will do the

113
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,120
same thing and bring you back to this

114
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,240
view

115
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,440
here and then you can start the cycle

116
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
all over again and just keep doing that

117
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,000
and that's how the app

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,520
works and yeah that was simple descrip

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,919
destion of the app and now let's get to

120
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,360
the Mac

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,560
part so yeah welcome to back to the Mac

122
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,479
part and now we're going to be

123
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,440
explaining exactly how the app works and

124
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
also the code behind it now let's get

125
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,720
started now and so this is the starting

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,199
UI of the app again this is running on

127
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,479
the simulator uh and this is going to be

128
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,759
uh Swift uh or actually Swift 1.2 xcode

129
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,360
6.4 uh so the source code will be down

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
in the description if you want to take a

131
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,400
look at it maybe edit it maybe use it

132
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
for yourself you're completely allowed

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,319
to do that anyway let's get started so

134
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,039
this is the starting up view as you can

135
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,360
see this is our shim's view which means

136
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,520
call view now we can click on this

137
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,240
little plus button

138
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,840
here and as you can see uh we can go

139
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,360
back to our view but let's just stay

140
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,080
here and as you can see there's a little

141
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,800
blank space and then our client uh which

142
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,240
actually means uh customer in English

143
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
from Portuguese so if I just click on

144
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
this as you can see it will query the

145
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,319
database get all of our uh um customers

146
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,360
and then it will just uh list them here

147
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,319
in a table View and then we can click on

148
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,160
any one for example the international

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,280
meal company now I'm just going to click

150
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,199
on it as you can see it highlights it

151
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,360
automatically uh and then I can just go

152
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,319
back and it'll give me all the

153
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,960
information about the international meal

154
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,919
company uh such as their contact uh

155
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,280
their equipment and their description

156
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,840
which are not in the database yet uh but

157
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,639
uh we decide to put that in a bit

158
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,120
later anyway now we can go back to our

159
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,800
shad's view everything's the the same

160
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,440
but right as we click the plus Button as

161
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,800
you can see it's black back to client

162
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,560
because whenever we click the plus

163
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,280
button sorry about that I'm clearing up

164
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,879
this label and I'm also putting client

165
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,160
back into the array of the data for this

166
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,599
table view so that we only have the

167
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,759
client and when we click on it it works

168
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,440
that was how that worked and now let's

169
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,000
see the code for

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,319
it so now actually I'm just going to

171
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,800
give you one more example here uh and so

172
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,520
let's just use wraps for examples so

173
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,160
that you know that it's not just

174
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,440
International meal company that works

175
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,720
and as you can see wraps at impress.com

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,080
equipment description wraps and we can

177
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,440
do lots more things like that such as

178
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,840
CMS and then it just works like that

179
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
okay now see the code and yeah let's get

180
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,599
started so this is our storyboard it's

181
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,039
pretty simple storyboard actually I'm

182
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,840
going to stop the app and then show it

183
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,840
to you there okay so as you can see we

184
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,400
start with a navigation controller so

185
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
that we can actually valid uh do push

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,800
sees um and not get exceptions while you

187
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,080
try to do them anyway apart from that

188
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,680
then we have our shim's view which is

189
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,400
our main view uh and over here uh we

190
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
just have a blank table view uh maybe I

191
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,360
might add another feature where you

192
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,680
actually use this table view but

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,720
currently you don't uh there's just this

194
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,879
little plus button which will contact

195
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,440
this new view uh which has a label

196
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
that's that actually gets set to no text

197
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
um and then it has the uh table view

198
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,599
which will'll have eventually client in

199
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,000
it then uh when you were to click on one

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,640
of these cells it would come over here

201
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,320
to this page where it would just query

202
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,519
the database get all of the uh customers

203
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,360
list them here click on one of them

204
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
click the back button that'll appear

205
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,279
here uh it'll show the information click

206
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,800
the back button again and it'll come

207
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,320
back here and then you can just continue

208
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,240
that like a little

209
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,000
cycle that's how the storyboard looks

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,560
and now let's look at the first uh view

211
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,600
which is the shimano's view which

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,360
actually just doesn't really have much

213
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
at all that's it uh we're just checking

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,800
if we're moving to the new customer view

215
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,040
uh which

216
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,240
is this one if we're moving from here to

217
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,360
here then what we want to

218
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,440
do uh is check uh first of all what we

219
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,120
want to do set the text of the label to

220
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,240
nothing set the objects to a blank array

221
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,720
and just append client to it now that I

222
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,160
think about

223
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,760
it d uh one line of code less anyway uh

224
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,839
so now that that's done uh we can

225
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,959
actually jump over to our client TBL

226
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,959
viewcontroller.swift

227
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,120
file over here we are declaring a global

228
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
variable for text and this will be the

229
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,160
text for the variable which is over here

230
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,079
if I just run this really

231
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:59,680
quickly like right as I click on this

232
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm this uh labels text is in a global

233
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,040
variable currently uh which can be set

234
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,560
by anyone so basically what I'm saying

235
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,880
is right as you click on restaurant it's

236
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,760
already put the text in for the label

237
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,800
and it's already put in all the details

238
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,480
inside of the table view but right as

239
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,959
you click the black button it'll render

240
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,079
it onto the screen anyway so then in our

241
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:27,160
client table view controller which is

242
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,079
um this one

243
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,279
over

244
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,360
here actually just let me make sure uh

245
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,760
no actually uh the one over here is this

246
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,320
one so this um uh view controller class

247
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,639
uh is associated with this specific t

248
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,399
with this specific um View and so first

249
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
of all we're creating an object Global

250
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
array uh which is just a new string

251
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
array with client in it then we are

252
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,360
declaring Class View controller which

253
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,079
confirms to UI view controller UI table

254
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,839
view data source UI table view delegate

255
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,720
and UI navigation controller delegate

256
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,000
after that we're creating two iets the

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,320
first one is just an automatic one uh

258
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,720
which is the table view uh and then we

259
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,440
just have our title label uh and so this

260
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,079
is the label that's over

261
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,279
here then uh after that we in our viewed

262
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,399
load function uh we are setting our

263
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,839
title labels text to the text which is

264
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,120
the global variable in our video load

265
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
again and then we are just reloading our

266
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,519
table views

267
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,600
data and in view will appear uh I'm just

268
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
doing viewed load which is not required

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,360
anymore uh and we also don't need this

270
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,160
anymore okay apart from that now we have

271
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,399
our table view

272
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,600
classes first of all number of rows in

273
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,360
section where we just return objects.

274
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,160
count then self row index path where we

275
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,279
do let cell is equal to self. table. DQ

276
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,000
reusable cell with identifier the cell

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
because that's our identifier uh for the

278
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,160
index path which is our current index

279
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,800
path as a new table view cell after that

280
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,639
we're saying cell. tile label. text is

281
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,480
equal to objects index path. row so

282
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,880
whatever um uh basically um respective

283
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,000
um object it's currently on it'll put

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,760
into that cell then we just return the

285
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,440
cell with the correct text so that it

286
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,639
puts it into our table View

287
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,320
after that did select row at index path

288
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,720
table view function uh so here we're

289
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,199
just saying self. view. the select row

290
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,639
at index path and then the index path uh

291
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,480
and which just just make sure that it's

292
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,519
animated not just a uh straight up

293
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,120
animation after that we have our prepare

294
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,880
for SE function sorry this isn't uh

295
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,360
really

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,720
uh yeah so on our prepare for SE

297
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,839
function um

298
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,320
we have just a

299
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,480
second over

300
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,199
here okay so in our prepare for SE

301
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:10,600
function uh we are just creating the

302
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,240
upcoming view controller uh we are

303
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,560
creating an index path and we are

304
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,279
creating a title string which apparently

305
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,199
we don't need this okay sorry I didn't

306
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,920
need this function

307
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,399
actually uh but anyway now that uh this

308
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,279
entire class is uh done uh we can go to

309
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,560
the next one which is going to

310
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,639
be this

311
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,600
one now that we're on this uh we can

312
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
just say okay first of all as we can see

313
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
there's nothing but a table view here uh

314
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,720
and so this is going to be pretty

315
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,360
simple over here we can just see again

316
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,639
we declare this Global text variable and

317
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,480
then inside here uh we just create our

318
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,959
table view IB Outlet we create create

319
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
our data as an nsarray which is our uh

320
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,000
customers and then the value to pass as

321
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,600
a string

322
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,639
which we do not exactly need again this

323
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,920
is just like cleaning up the code when

324
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,480
you read over it anyway now we're

325
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,839
setting the data to the data of Json and

326
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
then uh luan's website and we're getting

327
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,920
specifically client select. PHP so if I

328
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,680
go to it right now in Google

329
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,120
Chrome let that load

330
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,199
up if I paste that

331
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,240
in as you can see it gives us all the

332
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
well I didn't want that show

333
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,160
original perfect it shows the entire uh

334
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,480
Json and it's pretty

335
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,639
simple next we are just printing the

336
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,160
data for debugging purposes to make sure

337
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
that everything works in our number of

338
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,759
rows and section uh table view function

339
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,199
we just return data. count in our self

340
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,800
rowa index path function uh we just

341
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,880
create the cell as an additional info

342
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,839
cell uh and we give it the identifier of

343
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,120
of second cell because that's our

344
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,240
identifier in the table View and then

345
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,519
we're checking if index path. row is

346
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,519
less than or equal to data. count just

347
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,040
in case something were to go wrong uh

348
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,480
create main data is equal to data index

349
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,920
path. row as NS dictionary so we get the

350
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
current current customer their um name

351
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,920
their email their login uh what whatever

352
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,480
this means in Portuguese sorry I don't

353
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
know what that means in Portuguese

354
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
anyway uh then after that uh we are

355
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,720
saying cell. client name. text is equal

356
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,000
to the name from name data as a string

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,199
so what's that going to what that's

358
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,880
going to do uh is wherever you find a

359
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,920
name for that specific entry put it into

360
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,360
that cell then return that

361
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,040
cell that's how simple that was and then

362
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,959
of course our classic data of Json

363
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,160
function

364
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,920
uh where we just create the data

365
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,279
variable or actually constant and we say

366
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,079
NS data contents of URL NS URL string

367
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,639
URL which is the URL we got from our

368
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,759
parameter uh Force unwrap this and then

369
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,399
actually Force unwrap this and then

370
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,120
don't do that here then we just return

371
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,399
nsjs serialization Json object with data

372
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,160
we give it the data we get the options

373
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,480
which is NS Json reading options.

374
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,920
mutable containers we don't give it an

375
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,480
near Handler so it'll just throw an

376
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,959
exception uh and then we just say as

377
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,800
ansr because we are 100% sure that this

378
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,519
will work because again we're coding

379
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,720
this

380
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,839
down so now what we're doing is we are

381
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,920
overwriting the table view function uh

382
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,519
for did select row at index path so when

383
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,959
you select something over here what it's

384
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,839
essentially doing like a Red Lobster and

385
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,959
come back here and I'll do this anyway

386
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,480
when you select something uh it'll

387
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,160
create variable user data I mean URL

388
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,839
data of data of Jon on again the same

389
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,360
link it'll sorry about that um it will

390
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,199
set the um uh what do the um the uh

391
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,799
contact variable to email because this

392
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:12,760
is the parameter that we want uh for

393
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,160
email uh then we actually don't need

394
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,959
these lines uh because these were for

395
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,400
the older version of this

396
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,640
app uh and then so apart from that now

397
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,160
we have text is equal to the URL data

398
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,160
from index path. row and specifically

399
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,799
get the name Force this as an unwrap and

400
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,640
force this as a downcast to

401
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,480
string and so then uh we're basically

402
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,160
putting the name of the of the index

403
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
that was selected into this

404
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,640
label then what we're doing is we're

405
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,559
setting objects Zero from client into

406
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,320
contact URL data index path. row

407
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,480
cont force and force what this will do

408
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,679
uh is it will basically uh put in url

409
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,400
data specifically for the indexp pass.

410
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,360
row which is the uh current index that

411
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,320
we're on we want to get their contact we

412
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,000
want to force this as an unwrap Force

413
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,320
this as a downcast to the string

414
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,520
class then we append the equipment and

415
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,320
the description to the objects but of

416
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,919
course since that's not in the database

417
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,159
yet uh we cannot append them into the

418
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,600
objects and that was essentially the

419
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,640
entire code for this app there's nothing

420
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,760
really else here uh that we are using

421
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,240
except for the additional info cell

422
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,400
which only has a client name in it and

423
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,520
the table view cell which again only has

424
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,760
a title label in it and that was really

425
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,080
pretty much it for this video and again
