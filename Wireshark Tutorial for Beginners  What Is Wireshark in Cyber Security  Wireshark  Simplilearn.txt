you know friends that wi shark is a
powerful Network protocol analyzer that
helps you capture and analyze Network
traffic in real time it allows you to
Deep dive into Data packets traveling
through your network giving you insights
into Network performance security and
troubleshooting in this tutorial we'll
guide you through the basics of using v
shark from setting up your capture in M
to interpreting the data by the end of
this tutorial you'll have a solid
understanding of how to navigate why
shark interface set of filters and
analyze the network traffic for
different use cases so guys let's get
started craving a career upgrade

guys let us start first by understanding
what is V Shar so guys V Shar is a
comprehensive open-source Network
protocol analyzer that basically allows
user to capture and analyze a data
traveling over the network in real time
it is widely used by Network
administrators Security Professionals
and also Developers for various purposes
for example guys like Network
troubleshooting where you have to
identify and resolve network issues by
examining the traffic patterns and
diagnosing the connectivity problems the
next one is network analysis which will
also be doing in our Hands-On where you
have to understand and optimize Network
performance by analyzing data flows and
interaction between Network systems the
third one is security auditing you will
also have to detect and investigate
unusual or potentially malaci Network
activities such as unauthorized access
or data breaches and finally you have a
protocol development where you can deug
and develop Network protocols by
capturing and analyzing protocol
messages and behaviors the key features
of Vias Shar are the first one is Packet
capture vas Shar captures packets of
data transmitted over the network each
packet contains a wealth of information
including source and destination
addresses and also you get protocol
types and payload data so as you can see
all over here I've already downloaded V
sh and I'll guide you also how to
download it but as as you can see these
are the lines that shows that the Wi-Fi
packet you know graph is showing that
this is how the packets are transmitting
so this is basically the real time
analysis what you can get through in wi
Shar next one is you get a detailed
inspection guys wire shark also decodes
and displays data at various protocol
layers example you can get ethernet IP
TCP HTTP which allows for detailed
examinations of network communications
if can also perform filtering and
searching then you'll also get a chance
to do data visualization which includes
features for visualizing Network
traffics such as flow graphs as you can
see all over here and also statistics
which can helps in understanding Network
behavior and performance W shark is
available for multi-operating systems
like for Windows Mac OS Linux and many
more now there are certain scenarios
where network security Engineers use it
suppose for Network performance
monitoring where you track and analyze
the performance of network applications
and services you also get an incident
response you investigate and respond to
network security incidents by analyzing
capture traffic and you also do the
protocol analysis where you examine and
troubleshoot Network protocols and
ensure proper implementation now let us
start with the wi shark so first let us
download the wi shark and before we
download it I expect that you would have
got some brief idea regarding what is
wire shark now what what you have to do
guys you have to go at this link wihar
org. download. HTML so since I'm using
Windows so I have clicked on Windows x64
installer just right click on this so as
you can see it will start downloading so
guys since I've already downloaded it I
may not have to do it again and the
steps are very simple just you have to
click yes yes and it's going to download
all the required dependencies and your
installer will be ready and after
clicking all the okays you are going to
get some like this so this is your entry
of the wire shark Network analyzer now
so as you can see all over here you can
capture the network packets from these
interfaces so you can see local area
connection 10 adapter look up graphic
capture Bluetooth is there then you have
the eets okay so let us choose the Wi-Fi
as a network interface okay and just
click on this so as you can see all over
here so many of the packets have started
running up okay and this is a shark icon
so basically it is uh doing the realtime
packet capturing where you have all
these things so now let us try to
understand what is there in wire shark
so you can see you have file basically
for managing files you have open save
export okay so these kind of options are
there you can also export the TLs
session Keys okay you can export the
objects and uh you can do print quit
then here in the edit so edit you can
modify the preferences settings and
profile files if you talk about view you
can adjust the layout all over here or
wire shark if you talk about go you can
navigate through the packets all over
here then here is a capture you can
start or stop all over here you can
restart it then next is analyze so as
you can see all over here you have
display filters display filter macros
display filter expressions and many more
okay similarly you have statistics okay
which helps in viewing Network
statistics and data summaries here you
have telepone for using these kind of
protocols okay then you have wireless
okay then you have tools all over here
firewall ACL rules Mac address okay and
there you have the help icon so this is
a very basic outview of this application
now let us do some basic exercises first
so let us try to capture a traffic first
okay so since I've already selected uh
our network interface as Wi-Fi and let
us restart it so you can just go on
capture and just start the restart okay
so this has started now go to your
browser and just type say
HTTP okay and say bin org is the file so
guys this is a basic website that we
have requested on our browser and let us
go to our wire shark and stop this for a
moment so as you can see all over here
this icon shows applying a display
filter now go all over here and type the
filter say HTTP okay and you can say our
filtering would be done so as you can
see here you have the source you have
the destination here you have the time
here you have the number here you have
the length of the packets okay and this
is the info okay so now let us do the
general analysis of the wire shark
output so as you can see all over here
the first one is HTTP request and
responses so as you can see this is our
source okay we are sending a request to
the destination address with
44219
81240 the protocol is HTTP and the
length of the packet is 480 and it is
basically a get request okay so get
http/1.1 now there's a reply from this
destination all over here and to the
destination at our source the protocol
is still HTTP now the length of the
packet is increased is 887 and what we
are getting guys all over here that the
status is 200 and it says okay now as
you can see what we are getting
basically an HTML file all over here
okay now similarly we are again
requesting and we are getting a Json
file all over here now getting a
specific Json HTTP 1.1 and similarly
reply is coming so as you can see it's a
two and from motion where we are
requesting to a destination which is the
browser with the protocol HTTP and
similarly we are getting a reply from
our destination so guys this is our
device and this is the given uh resource
we are trying to access on our browser
so basically now we can see these are
the content types which is text HTML for
the HTML structure okay and also you can
see all over here this is a Json type
okay and uh these are the type of
content we are trying to access it okay
and this is the
uh request what we have uh done to our
destination which is the browser okay
with the bin org and it is returning and
text. HTML file I hope so guys you would
have got a brief idea like how you can
do the general analysis of the W shark
output now let us try to do one more
example which will make our Concepts
more clear now guys I will show you one
more use case of this that you can
diagnose the network issues with ping
and Trace command Okay so with the help
of v shark this can also be done guys so
what you need next is you can open a
terminal okay and just right click all
over here and now in this what we are
going to do guys we are going to
generate an icmp traffic so with the
help of ping command okay so now what we
do we type ping say
google.com and you can see all over here
the request and reply have started and
now what we will do guys we will use the
Tracer command for tracing our packet
flow
so so you can see something we have got
all over here we will discuss about this
but later now let us open our wire shark
okay
and what we'll do guys we will type icmp
okay and just click all over here okay
so guys go to the filter and type icmp
okay and just click all over here and
but before that you have to stop this
and now let us try so you can see all
over here that here the destination is
showing unreachable but here we are
getting the reply okay now let us try to
examine this protocol okay so what all
over here let us try to understand first
what we did in the terminal okay so guys
is when we are typing the command ping
google.com this command is basically
testing the reachability of google.com
by sending the internet control message
protocol or icmp Echo request packets
and waiting for the replies which is
Echo response now guys let us break down
the Ping results so first three replies
we are going to see that each reply
shows the IP address of 142 250.1
93110 which is one of the Google servers
and you can see the round trip time
latency for the packets for the first
time it is showing around 76
milliseconds for second round trip time
it is showing around 88 then third is 99
and fourth one is 30
milliseconds now you can see uh there is
something called time to live also and
in this case the time to live for each
packet is around 55
milliseconds okay so basically this
field indicates how many hops or routers
the packet can pass through before being
discarded okay now you can also see the
request timeout so the fourth packet is
a request timeout meaning no reply was
received within this set time and you
can also see the Ping statistics so you
can see here sent a four packets
received four packets and there is no
loss okay so this is one thing and also
approximate round trip in milliseconds
you can see minimum is 30 milliseconds
and maximum is 99 milliseconds average
is calculated 73 milliseconds so this is
statistics what we got now you can see
all over here we have the tracert
command okay so here no arguments are
provided first so let us try to
understand the d means do not resolve IP
address to host names okay where H means
maximum number of hops of routers to
search and w means time out in
milliseconds for each reply so suppose
if I see Tracer google.com so guys this
will show all the Hops that the packet
has to travel through reach the Google
server which will help to diagnose where
the delays or issues might occur on the
path now you can see all over here there
are a lot of options are given so
similarly you can read this now let us
try to do the wi shark analysis so you
can see all over here with our source
10.10
1.5.18 and we are sending the request to
the Google server and this is internet
control message protocol so you can see
all over here this is Eco this the Ping
request with ID
0x1 and we can see the sequence is also
given the time to live and we are
replying in 7641 milliseconds so this
packet is basically what we are doing
guys we are 7630 is our packet number
and this is what we are sending as a
request then 7641 is a reply from the
Google server with the given ID okay the
sequence number of this and the time to
live and it is also giving the request
one now what you can do guys you can
also apply one filter all over here we
can
okay
now with the help of
this you can just see there are a lot of
options as a filtering okay so you can
read the documentation for this
and whenever it is turning red guys it
is showing something as error okay and
now uh let us do this and let us type
our IP address
say 101
okay 1
do
5.18 okay so this is also one of the way
you can apply the filter okay so it's
going to filter out the IP address okay
say let's do this so it is going to
filter out our IP address which is
basically the same which is sending
because we have not given any other ping
requ Quest so guys here what we can see
so this is kind of the analysis what we
are doing basically okay so guys this
was a wire shark analysis for diagnosing
the network issues with the help of ping
and frees commands and you can do lot
more other things with the help of w
shark basically these tools are used by
Network administrators hackers and also
Network Engineers to understand the
network performance diagnose the network
issues okay so this was a short exercise
