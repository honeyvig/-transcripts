in this ever evolving landscape of
digital world cyber security remains a
Paramount concern as technology
continues to advance so do the threats
that look in the digital Shadows to
ensure the security resilience of a
digital infrastructure Professionals in
the field of cyber security must stay
ahead of the curve in this video on
cyber security roadmap 2024 we will walk
through the cyber security landscape for
2024 focusing on the learning path
prerequisites available job
opportunities salaries and the promising
future that awaits those who embark on
the jury in this video we will be
covering first of all the learning path
then pre-requirements when company
hiring and salary then the future score
but before we begin let me ask you a
quick question so what type of attack
involves a hacker eavesdropping on a
communication between two parties
without the knowledge option A is
phishing option b is man in the middle
option C is Ransom way and option D is
SQL injection now you can pause this
video and answer in the comment section
below so in this video on cyber security
roadmap 2024 we will start with the
learning path so the first step to start
with cyber security journey is learn
Linux Linux is like Solid Ground on
which cyber Security Experts build their
Knowledge Learning Linux is essential as
it provides the foundation for
understanding the technical aspect of
cyber security you will gain Proficiency
in command line operations system
administration and file management
mastering Linux enables you to navigate
various security tools and perform tasks
efficiently it's the starting point for
anyone aspiring to be a cyber security
expert as it Fosters a deep
understanding of systems in our workings
and all these skills lay a foundation
for cyber security so after
understanding Linux your next step
should be networking networking forms
the foundation of the internet and plays
a vital role in cyber security it
involves how computers and devices
communicate and share information
imagine networking as the road system
term of the digital world connecting
various devices and allowing data to
flow between them at its core networking
revolves around two essential components
Mac addresses and IP addresses a MAC
address is unique identifier assigned to
each network interface card like a
physical address for your computer
meanwhile an IP that is Internet
Protocol address is like a digital
postal code for devices on a network
enabling them to locate and communicate
with each other understanding these
fundamentals is vital for cyber security
it allows you to spot irregularities in
data traffic identify potential threats
and Safeguard information Additionally
you will learn about network
architectures security models and tools
like firewalls intrusion detection
system all of which contribute to
creating a secure digital environment
third thing you can do is understanding
web so the internet is commonplace where
many cyber threats begin which is why
understanding web security is really
important in this part of learning path
we will look at things like HTTP https
HTML and JavaScript to see how websites
and web apps work we'll also talk about
some problems like SQL injections
cross-right scripting and cross-site
request forgery csrf that can make
Webster plus secure learning how to find
and fix these issues is a big deal for a
cyber security pro because it helps to
keep web apps safe when you get how
webtech works you can do a better job
stopping cyber attacks the target web
stuff you will also get to know about
HTTP requests HTTP responses and request
headers which are the building blocks of
how web communication happens all right
the next thing is practice yes to get
better at something you need to practice
to do this you can set up a home lab
where you can experiment with different
cyber security techniques in a safe
environment alternately you can use
online platforms like hack the Box try
hack me or virtual hacking Labs which
provide real world scenarios to test
your skills these practice sessions help
you learn more about cyber security and
develop your problem solving abilities
remember the more you practice the
better you become at keeping digital
information safe from cyber threats all
right now the next step would be
certification you can explore various
cyber security certifications you can
start your journey towards cyber
security expertise with the
post-graduate program in cyber security
by simply learn it is meticulously
designed to equip you with the skills

today to unlock your full potential also
to opt for this program following things
are required a bachelor's degree with an
average of 50 percent or higher marks
and the candidate may have known
programming background and the candidate
are not required to have Pride work
experience now you can also listen to
what our Learners has to say about the
course hi I'm Philip I'm 61 years old
