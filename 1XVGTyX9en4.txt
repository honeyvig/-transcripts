1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
machine learning is super exciting but

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,140
it's pretty complex and not a lot of

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,430
programming languages I've dealt with

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,540
machine learning in mind

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,160
that's why Julia was purpose-built for

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,019
scientific computing for a long time

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,910
I've been using Python as my main

8
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,799
programming language but I'll consider

9
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,170
moving to Julia the issue that the

10
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,480
community is really small and tutorials

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,330
are scarce but now I have timely teaches

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:21,900
Julia

13
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,210
whether it's super technical or speaking

14
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,390
to children he can illustrate at a point

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,660
in a very easy to understand method at

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,579
this book it goes from a to Zed

17
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,290
regardless of what platform you have is

18
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,910
for anybody that wants to learn Julia

19
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,010
with the initiative to get into machine

20
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,870
learning by leveraging cutting-edge

21
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,629
compiler technology Julia enables a

22
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,789
faster and more convenient coding

23
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,010
experience for developers trying to

24
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,719
integrate machine learning technology

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,360
into their applications timing teaches

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,770
Julia will guide you through several

27
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,820
machine learning examples my favorite is

28
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,350
how many features Julia is the perfect

29
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,730
book for learning about next-generation

30
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,980
technologies even if you haven't coded

31
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,960
before this is definitely a must-have

32
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,489
book I would definitely get this book

33
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,680
for my little sister for Christmas this

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,470
is the time and this is the perfect way

35
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,900
to get into coding and machine learning

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,060
you
