finally we will wrap up this email
marketing full course with some
interview questions and answers on email
marketing now the problem with email is
that it always hasn't been so sexy in
creating value to the company
marketers when they got a hold of email
started asking themselves what's
possible rather than asking should we do
this and as a result when you ask people
what the problem with email is they'll
tell you I get too much it's not
relevant it's not important it's I'm
getting email from people I don't even
know
and so because of that email suffered a
reputation problem
there were things that we were receiving
that we didn't know how to control lists
that we got on that we don't know how we
got on those lists and ultimately the
messages were just spammy and not even
targeted
and so this created almost a split
personality now that emails the primary
source of spam that I receive but it's
also the primary messaging medium from a
lot of companies that I do want those
messages
and so email has had a bit of a comeback
because of the technology because of
mobile marketing and because of
companies using it in a way that's
smarter and more targeted in creating a
conversation with the customer
one study by the direct marketing
Association shows that for every dollar
that was spent in email marketing
companies received forty dollars in
Revenue
the power of email marketing is that it
creates loyalty among your customers and
your customers respond to that because
they get to know you it's a way to
educate to expand and to grow customers
into knowing more about your company
which results in a higher lifetime value
than most other marketing channels
email creates value to the company
how has email been transformed from this
once spam filled marketing method to
becoming one of the most powerful
marketing methods now in your marketing
Arsenal
the first thing is most people start
their day not only with that first cup
of coffee but going through their email
they're looking to see all the messages
that they've received all the marketing
deleting reading keeping up on the news
mostly that's through email
but also the proliferation of mobile
devices has now increased the
accessibility to email
people have their email with them all
the time and now one out of every two
email opens is on a mobile device
customers actually prefer to receive
marketing messages via email rather than
any other channel
they want to control that and they have
the time to deal with it when they can
and so email is the preferred method of
receiving those messages and it also
contributes to a higher lifetime value
in getting customers and getting new
customers to your business
in this introduction course I want to
challenge you with your thinking about
email do you really know it
a lot of people assume that they know
email and it's become a very boring
subject it's typically how I get all my
spam is from email has what a lot of
people say
but the problem is you don't know what's
been happening in the email industry
over the past few years
email has become one of the most
powerful ways of reaching new customers
retaining old customers and building a
lifetime customer that will continue to
be a part of your business so what is
email marketing well email has been
around for a very long time of course
and in the very early days there wasn't
an email marketing service that you
could use yeah you couldn't easily send
out hundreds of emails so what you did
you were actually using the BCC or the
blind carbon copy in your email system
to send out emails to many people of
course the I.T Department of companies
in those early days they didn't like
that because it would block the email
system of the company so they come up
with little marketing email Marketing
Solutions on the company's Mainframe but
it was all very inflexible you had to
take your email you had to take your
mailing list give that to the guy in the
IT department and if you're lucky then
maybe in a couple of days later your
email would be sent you wouldn't get any
data at all about those emails yeah you
knew how many emails were sent but you
didn't know who would have opened to
email or who would have clicked on the
email
nowadays of course things are completely
different yeah now you have email
marketing where you can use email
service providers who offer you lots of
tools and lots of analytics to manage
and plan and measure your email
marketing campaigns
so what actually is email marketing it
uses email addresses from people to
inform your email list about your
product or service we call these
commercial emails which is completely
different of course from the billions of
personal emails that are being sent yeah
around the the internet every day so
this is a commercial email that you sent
to an email list about your product your
service or a newsletter and what have
you
Additionally you can integrate it into
your marketing automation so you can and
it can help your customers to see your
latest products and offers and you can
obviously use the email list to and
persuade them to buy your book a demo or
sign up for a trial or register for an
event
yeah we call this email nurturing where
you can send a range of emails to take
people through that journey to help them
to make the decision
so what are the different uses of email
marketing it can be used in relationship
building with existing customers who
bought a product for instance sentiments
thank you email it could be to boost
brand awareness it could be about
promoting various pieces of content it
can help you in generating leads or to
promote or Market your products and very
important you can use it to nurture
leads
so what are the types of email marketing
there are a whole range of different
emails that you can send through email
Marketing Systems we'll talk about
welcome emails newsletter emails could
be a lead nurturing email a confirmation
email specific emails to specific people
invitations promotional emails or an
email to do a survey or seasonal
marketing emails so a whole range of
emails you have available that you can
use for different marketing purposes so
now that you understand the basics of
email let's talk about how you get
started with it it's not that
complicated first of all like with many
marketing activities you need to Define
your audience and establish your goals
why do you want to use email marketing
and then you start with one of the most
important aspects of your email
marketing that is about building your
email list and that is the most
important it's a very important aspect
because if your email list is not up to
date yeah there will be a lot of bounces
on your email and your email service
provider may get back to you say hey
your email list is not up to date so we
may actually block you because you may
be spamming your customers you then
choose the the email campaign type that
you want to run you make a schedule when
you want to send out the emails and then
of course you need to measure your
results
so as I said a very important part is
creating your email list and how do you
go about that there's lots of ways that
you can create emails the simplest ways
is when you are at an event just put a
little box at your reception desk and
ask people to leave their business cards
and that gives you already a lot of
emails that you can enter in your email
lists database yeah there's other ways
you can take your existing customer list
and upload that in the email system or
you can use two very powerful methods
which is a lead magnet and an opt-in
form
now what is your lead magnet a lead
magnet is a document or a piece of
content like an ebook a white paper
infographic or a report or a checklist
or a template or a webinar or a tool and
you put it on your website you promote
it through your email so you have those
documents available on your website
through your marketing campaigns you
drive traffic to your website where
people will see the tech the checklist
or the template they will click on the
link and before they download they have
to enter their email address
yep and then that email address will
automatically be added to your mailing
list yeah now how do you design an
effective lead magnet usually it's done
by creating a landing page and on that
landing page you have only one message
and that is the solution that you offer
or the piece of content that you offer
you make sure that the asset is simple
to use yeah that it helps you in
promoting your offer
you can use it as a Cornerstone to your
page solution so maybe you promote a
freebie that will lead to a paid
solution and you make offers that are
relevant for the face that the customer
is in in the buying process yep now the
next four that we talked about was the
opt-in form an opt-in form is a form
that can pop up on your website where
people just need to fill in their name
address email contact number Etc you can
specify What fields you want to capture
yep and again they can do that to
register for something or if they have a
question or if they want to have a
conversation with you
opt-in forms are important that you make
sure that the header stands out visually
and people will see it when they are
visiting your websites yeah often you
see websites when as soon as you get to
the home page that form will pop up
yeah and then make sure that once people
have seen the form and they they click
it away or they filled it in that they
won't see it again there's nothing more
annoying than every time you get to a
home page that form pops up make sure
that relevant copy is there to encourage
readers to take advantage of the offer
keep the form easy and make sure you
have double confirmation enabled yep and
make sure everything flows smoothly on
your form so having gone through those
basics of email marketing what we're
going to do now is giving you a short
demo of MailChimp
one of the leading email Services now
what started off as a simple email
Marketing System yes so you put in your
email addresses you create an email
campaign you link the campaign to the
email addresses yep and then you send it
out MailChimp would take care of that
and then MailChimp would also give you
the reporting now this meltd's email
Marketing Systems they became more and
more advanced they know that digital
marketing is not only email marketing
there is no pay-per-click marketing
there is social media there is
um what's it influencer marketing there
is advertising you name it so they had
to enrich their services yep and you
will see that when we go into MailChimp
that there is now a whole range of
additional Services even down to
developing your own website that
MailChimp can offer you but at the core
of
MailChimp is its email system so let's
go and have a look into how to use
MailChimp and how to set up your first
email campaign so if you go to
mailchimp.com
yeah you can see here a little overview
of what it does yeah then again we're
going to go into automations I'm going
to show you some of the analytics I'm
going to show you how you can segment
with um with MailChimp and how you can
synchronize with other applications in
MailChimp as well so lots of stuff that
you can do here is a little promotional
video and here is the pricing so you can
see that a free version gives you
limited functionality but it does give
you all the functionality you need to
send emails to up to 500 contacts per
month
yep and then it goes up to 11.70 and
then the premium version gives you all
the Full Features 299 dollars but let's
focus on the free version again that's
what I kind of like often of MailChimp
so let's go into my account yeah so I go
on to
took two
let's have a look I'm logged in yeah so
here is my
audience
so here you see the features that
MailChimp has to offer
so first of all there is create you can
create campaigns
yeah that is where you run your email
campaigns and where you create your
marketing campaigns a very important
part of your MailChimp is your contacts
or your audience
of course if you don't have any emails
in your database if it were then yeah
then there's not many people that you
can send stuff to so contacts are very
important that you get an email list
that you can connect with your campaigns
there are automations that you can do
which basically means you can send
emails automatically there is analytics
there is website you can create your own
website and modules of it there is
content so that is sort of your library
of assets and then there are different
Integrations that you can do here you
see kind of your dashboard of the
campaigns and this is your audience
dashboard
so the very first thing of course that
you need to do when you are starting on
MailChimp that is create an audience
yeah and that's where you go into your
contacts so there is your audience
dashboard as you see here you can have
all an overview of all your contacts you
can create signup forms that you can add
to your website to capture people's
email addresses there are tags that you
can set to content so you can group your
content into segments and you can do
surveys and there is your inbox if
people send you messages
yeah so lots of functionality but your
first challenge will be
how to get your emails there's lots of
ways to do that first of all there may
be your existing customer database or
your existing customer list you probably
have them in a spreadsheet
yeah so what I'm going to show you in a
minute is how you can enter or import
that spreadsheet into a MailChimp yeah
so that is one way second you can
actually set up on your website a form
that people can fill in to sign up for
your newsletter for instance
or you can run a campaign where people
go to a landing page and if they
download a certain piece of
documentation then they need to give you
their their email address
yeah so there's lots of ways another
really effective way if you're at an
exhibition for instance have a little
box on your your counter where people
can leave their ear their
um their their business cards
yeah and then you can take all of that
information and put them in your your
MailChimp so the question here then is
of course how do I bring contacts into
my
MailChimp audience so let's go to all
contacts
yep and then you see I already have two
contacts in my my co
that's the name of my audience
yeah so I'm going to add additional
contacts I can get an overview of my
contacts I can add contacts manually I
can add a subscriber
yeah and then I can just put in the name
yeah so that is Mark at
uh
simplylearn.com and then it's Mark
there is
simply learn don't have to put in a
dress I can get phone number I can get
birthday I can get company name that
would be simply learn
I can add a tag so that would be
training
add or create a tag
yeah that could be training
there's my tag now very important what
SIM what about the MailChimp wants to
know that you people that you have in
your database
that you that they gave you permission
to email them yeah they're a very strict
requirements these days for people yet
that you need to respect your privacy
you need to have permission before you
send them an email
yeah but there's different ways that you
can ask that permission you can ask it
on the website before they fill in a
form you can ask it in your newsletter
yeah so make sure that you have those
permissions because if people get
unsolicited email through a commercial
email campaign yeah in principle that is
not allowed and you may be subject to a
fine the you may have heard of the gdprs
regulations in in Europe and there is
also regulations in the United States
there's regulations in Asia yeah that's
a real tightening of those privacy
regulations when it comes to email
marketing if this person for some reason
is already in my audience then I can
update it will update your profile so
let's click subscribe
let's see
there's probably one
field I ever got
phone number that is 075
yeah so this phone number was a required
item as well
yep and then I click subscribe
so if I now go back to all contacts you
will see that Mark at simplylearn.com is
now has been added to my database so
that is one way to get emails in your
audience list
the next way is if you go to add
contacts you can import contacts
there are three ways how you can import
contacts you can import contacts from
another surface
there's a way you connect with another
piece of software you can upload a CSV
file or a text file and you can even
copy and paste
yeah so if I import from another service
you can see you can import for
Salesforce from Squarespace from Shopify
and there's probably a lot more
Integrations that you can have
if you want to upload a file it will
then basically ask you to upload your
file so what we need to do we need to
create a spreadsheet that we save as a
CSV file so if I go to
Google Drive
and I'm going to actually I already have
a file here
yeah so let's open this file
so you see
that I have these names in there I'm
going to take them out very important
that you add first name last name
company email and all the fields that
are relevant for you yeah so let's say
telephone as well so then we're going to
say the first name is uh Jacob
last name is Jones
company
is Biko
and email is Jacob jones.com
telephone number is oh one two three
four five six seven
yep then the second name is
um Anne Murray
Carol
and that is Carol
dot com
and that is n
at Carol dot prom and that is 987654
telephone number okay Stakeout at dollar
sign
right yes so now I have the file and
this name is MailChimp or whatever
MailChimp one
so the first thing I'm going to do of
course is to save this I am going to
download this file as a comma separated
values file which is a CSV file
and MailChimp wants me to upload this
CSV file into
this field yeah so that's how I can
upload my contacts so I'm going to my uh
YouTube
downloads here is my MailChimp CSV file
yep so there it is I'm going to continue
to organize now the first thing that
MailChimp is going to do now if I'm
wearing any
existing contacts they will be updated
the first thing I can add a tag yes so
I'm going to let's say a member and I'm
going to continue to match that is what
MailChimp is going to do now remember
the first line of our spreadsheet was
sort of the field names first name last
name company name and telephone
MailChimp is going to match those
MailChimp things that the first line was
first name the second name was last name
so these are correct company it has
picked up it doesn't know what to do
with telephone yeah so what I can do I
can edit this column yeah and I can look
at the fields that they have
yes so is telephone in here
I don't hear phone number yeah and I'm
going to link it with phone number
so now it is okay and I can now see here
five columns will be imported and I'm
going to say finalize Imports
yep so now it has added two contacts to
the list so I'm going to say complete
Imports
and if I now want to view my contacts
you will see that my contacts have been
added to my email list
yeah so now I have two additional
contacts in my list
I could also
add a subscriber actually have done a
copy and paste
go back
add contacts import contacts I could do
a copy and paste so I'll show you how
that works continue
so but I go back to the spreadsheet and
I would copy these just copy it command
copy
going back to my MailChimp and I can now
just paste them here just like this and
now
MailChimp is going to analyze this yeah
and it says okay this is what I think it
is and it goes back into that same stage
that we saw in when we when we imported
the spreadsheet
yeah you see here first name last name
company name and then the telephone
yep now I'm not going to import this
again because we've already imported
these contacts but this is how you
import your contacts
okay
now a few tips on your database
yes very important
are you sure you want to exit this okay
yes so you may build up a list of a
couple of hundred contacts in your in
your MailChimp and that is fantastic
yeah the bigger your list the more value
that you will get from it a very
important aspect of this is to make sure
that your database is clean
yeah people may ask to be removed from
your database people change businesses
yeah make sure your database is clean
when you run a campaign
and you use your email list and there
are a lot of emails that cannot be sent
because there are a lot of wrong emails
in your list
yeah you will have what we call a high
bound rate
and if you have a continuous high bounce
rate
MailChimp may come back to you and say
hey why do you have such a high bound
rate
and if you can't explain why you have a
high bound rate MailChimp may actually
block your account
because MailChimp wants you to work with
a clean database that is also the risk
if you buy an email list that you don't
know the source from
and if you import it and then run your
first campaign if you get a whole lot of
bounces on your emails yeah then
MailChimp May block your account so be
very careful make sure that your emails
are correct that your bounce rate is low
and never buy
email lists because you don't know what
the quality is of the list
make sure that you segment your mailing
list and then you can within one mailing
list you can send it to your different
segments it could be customers could be
prospects could be
suppliers or what have you yeah
constantly work on growing your database
make sure you don't spam people always
get
um people's approval yeah that they are
happy for you to send them
um emails and of course owner
unsubscribes as well if people ask you
to unsubscribe them from the mailing
list make sure you do that
okay just a few tips when it comes to
managing your database
so now that you have your email audience
set up your contacts setup let's look at
a campaign
let's
when you go into the campaigns here you
have an overview of all the campaigns
that you've run now we haven't run any
campaigns here is a draft campaign yeah
but what you're gonna do you're going to
create a campaign
yes when you click here on the top right
on the create campaign button you have
then the different types of campaigns
that you can order and create you can do
a regular email
you can actually create a landing page
or you can also create an embedded form
yeah that helps you in capturing context
that could be part of your landing page
campaign
but what we're going to look at is
regular emails
yeah so when I click on email I can just
side click here design email
yeah then there is a new email Builder
that you can use and since you're
probably new to Simply learn a new to
um to MailChimp I click straight onto
the new Builder because that is a lot
easier to work with
yeah so here you see it's time to design
your email
yeah I put this little icon already in
yesterday yeah so there's different ways
of doing that here you see sort of your
editor for your email here you can
preview the email here you see your
editing building blocks the layout The
Heading paragraph button Etc here you
can specify Styles and here you can
specify templates for your emails so
here you see an whole range of email
templates
yeah if you click on the creative
assistant that is beautiful but it will
drive you to a premium
account yeah so I'm not going to show
that I want to show you the free
features of MailChimp so let's say we're
going to go for a little design here
we're going to go for this one we could
do preview that's how it will look like
yeah and then we're going to click apply
continue with start with a clean
template

have you can change your image

to type in the name

now your subject line of course is very
important in email marketing because in
the subject line people will when they
read the subject line people will decide
whether or not they will open the email
yes so the subject line always has to be
catchy so when it could be five reasons
why you shoot read our latest
email newsletter

yeah or any other subject line but they
are they need to be short and sweet yeah
you could use emojis you need to in that
one line you need to give people the
reason why they shoot open this email
preview text appears in the inbox after
the subject line yeah so in today's
newsletter
we will talk
about
social media
and email marketing
for instance and you click save
so that is your subject that is your
content
yep and then here is part of your
contact you can send yourself a test
email
that is always useful to send it to
yourself and check it on your desktop
and check it on your mobile so I send
myself a test email send a test to any
email yeah so let me quickly check here
my Gmail
that is uh
to me
that is tube for Mark
okay so I'm going to send that email to
tube for Mark okay I can send it to
multiple people and I'm going to click
send test
email has been sent
so let's check the email so here we see
the email test five reasons why you
should read our latest newsletter
and then here you see the email and then
you check it on typos you check it on
the links that are in there yeah make
sure that your social media buttons work
etc
and if you're then happy with your email
you can then publish it
yeah and there's two ways of publishing
it you can schedule it
when you schedule it you can set a
delivery date and a specific delivery
time but in order to use that feature
you need to upgrade to Premium
okay so you can send it directly
so when you click Send it will go
straight to it
yep so very important or you can say
finish later if you don't want to share
your campaign you see here the link for
the campaign
yeah and you could change that
your default campaign URL yeah so
MailChimp generate randomly five reasons
why you should read our email if you
upgrade to premium you can turn this
MailChimp into your own URL
okay good and then you can track your
your campaign your email campaigns but
um we'll print they will usually we'll
cover that in a in the next video on on
MailChimp when we go into more advanced
features okay so I'm just gonna click
finish later
and if we're now having our list of
campaigns then here you see we have our
MailChimp demo as a draft ready to be
published
so that is the so that is the campaigns
how to create a campaign on MailChimp
right now let's have a look at a few
more things so first of all a new
feature in MailChimp is the analytics
when you send out an email campaign you
will get basic analytics here in your
campaigns dashboard as well but
MailChimp now also has an analytics
dashboard
and here you see the type of data that
you will get in MailChimp and it is
using sample data so we can explore the
dashboard so here you see number of
emails sent whether it's up or down you
see the number of people or the
percentage of people that opened the
email
and very important the actual percentage
of people that clicked on the email or
clicked on the link in the email and
that is very important yeah so that's
where you can really follow through on
your email campaigns yeah on who opened
it who clicked it to the form the
phrases that needed to be filled in so
very useful information that you can get
out of your campaign and you can see
that from various periods yeah you can
even actually in the other reports you
can actually see who are the people in
my
mailing list in my audience who actually
clicked on the email and who are the
people who opened the clicked on the
link
and then you can approach them
separately
yeah so here you see engagements
email sent and the click rate
yep so here you see by email the number
of recipients the open rate a click rate
the revenue that you made
if you had that set up so lots of data
that you can get on your email campaigns
open rates are very important and they
differ by industry yeah and general and
the open rate
anywhere between up to 15 and higher are
usually good open rates
okay so that is the analytics that you
can get and then finally what I really
like in MailChimp is that you can use
MailChimp to create landing pages so if
I'm going back to my campaigns
and I'm going to click create campaign
then I can also decide to create a
landing page
name of the landing page is Michael
select an audience Michael and I'm going
to click begin
yeah and here you see
a number of templates that I can use for
my landing page
yeah so very simple templates so let's
take this template
except
I'm going into the editor
yeah so here is the editor for the
landing pages I can add text I can do
box text I can add dividers images I can
change the text
yeah you see here band mates that is the
logo I can change the logo
yeah so I can replace the logo and I can
edit a logo and what hit you I'm just
going to stick with this text for the
time being and here is my email address
form yeah and the beauty about it when
people fill in their email address in
this form it will automatically be added
to my mailing list
in MailChimp so that is a very powerful
feature I can also create this as a
separate form
Okay so
so here you see the available fields
that I have email I can add first name
if I want to yeah I can add last name
and I can add phone number as well
yep I can then go to the settings
I can do the style different styles that
I can have so this is my sign up form
yeah the button text is subscribe I can
then also send visitors to a
confirmation message
I can preview the confirmation message
success you've been added to the
audience
yeah exit preview
yep and that is my sign up form and
again it will automatically be added to
my campaign email list and I click save
and close
yep and here is the full campaign
yeah and when I'm happy with it
I can click save and close
so here is my landing page
and it's now
here I have the page title and site icon
here's the social share preview here is
the URL of mic and my landing page here
is the contents
and I can then get my
finish it later or I can publish it and
as soon as I publish it
this URL will be live
yeah so click publish
so this landing page is now live
so if I now go to this landing page
yeah so here you see email address I'm
saying uh
um cherry
oh
cherry.com
com and that is
cherry
and I'd say subscribe
so now let's check the litmus test if I
go to my contacts and I'm going to all
my contacts
and here we have cherry Henry the famous
Arsenal football player who has just
joined my mailing list so that is the
power of MailChimp
so now that you understand how to use
MailChimp let's finish this video with
having a look at the pros and cons of
email marketing and answering some
standard questions that you may have so
the advantages of email marketing is
that email
is the most personalized form of
communication and it stays in the inbox
until it is read deleted or archived so
that is a big advantage of email
marketing it can really help in
increasing brand awareness and traffic
to your website and it lets you test
your email marketing software lets you
test your subject lines lets you test
your
um your headers let's let you test the
text you're using in your your emails
and it can help you in testing your call
to actions in your emails so very
powerful and very important as you show
in MailChimp you can Target users by
segments by democracy and by tags that
you set so lots of advantages that you
get from email marketing but there are
disadvantages as well as soon as people
get the idea that your email is Spam
they will delete
yeah so make sure that you don't spam
people make sure that you keep your
emails short because when your emails
are large it may take a long time to
load so don't use video or High
um big Graphics keep it small
yes so make sure that you are aware of
the cost of the email service provider
that you're using yeah they can become
quite expensive depending on the number
of emails that you want to send out
of course people get hundreds of email
every day so it's very difficult for you
to stand out from the competition yes so
make sure that your email has a really
good headline as a really good title and
makes you stand out from your
competitors
so make sure that your emails are
engaging I always call it the blink test
if you're not able to see what the email
is all about within the blink of an eye
yeah then the email is not worth opening
so keep that in mind yeah we're sending
out and preparing your email campaigns
so let's close today's video then with
the FAQ so here are some regularly asked
questions question one how do I prevent
my email messages from being marked as
spam yeah you see that often it is one
of the disadvantages of using an email
service provider first big companies may
have filter set automatically in their
email systems where they will block
emails coming in from email service
providers like MailChimp or Constant
Contact
but the best thing of course is to make
sure that your emails in your database
are the best quality those emails are
complete they are no typos in them yeah
and the best emails are obviously when
they are emails from the company so try
to avoid email addresses like Gmail or
mail or what have you another way to
prevent email messages to go into the
spam box is simply ask your customers if
they can whitelist your email and in
Gmail it is as simple as dragging your
in the spam email from the spam folder
into the main email folder and from then
on all the emails from that customer
will go from you will go into their main
email box
but the most important thing is don't
spam yeah don't use silly titles don't
use weird characters in your email
headers Etc so keep it like real emails
can I use email marketing in conjunction
with some other approaches of course you
can email marketing is just another
digital marketing instrument or digital
marketing channel that you have
available and they work perfectly in
combination with pay-per-click with
social media and any other digital
marketing tool that you have
how significant is the subject line in
an email
well I can tell you it is very important
yeah people will open their email based
on the subject line and if your subject
line does not tell them in one blink why
they receive the email what you have to
offer and why they should open it then
they will not open the email so your
subject line is very important
final question how much does connecting
with your audience via email marketing
help
it often email marketing is used once
you've got the first awareness stage in
place so you're using email marketing to
start taking customers through the
buying cycle you nurture the
relationship and you take them by the
hand through your emails from being
aware to interested yeah to
ready to buy
and then to actually buy the email and
then even after the buying process you
can still use email marketing to nurture
the relationship and make them buy again
in 12 months or make them introduce you
to their friends who may be interested
in buying

if you enjoy this video click the like

Subscribe button down below so let's get
into this email marketing email
marketing has been around for quite some
time email is one of the most popular
forms of communication billions of
emails are being sent around the world
every single day in the early days there
was no email marketing in the early days
I remember when there wasn't even an
attachment that you could do to an email
it was just a text-based message to your
colleagues and if you were lucky
somebody else had an email address that
you could send an email outside your
your company but things changed email
became a bit more advanced and people
started to use email to send emails to
bigger groups of people and in the early
days that was just done by copying every
email address in the email sent to lists
and what you had was the what we call
the BCC that was the blind carbon copy
and if you added 20 30 or 40 email
addresses in a blind carbon copy section
of your email then nobody would else
would see who that email would go to so
that was kind of the very first way of
sending emails in larger quantities to
groups of people and that soon became
email marketing of course the IT
department didn't like that
the IT department of companies they saw
unexpected email traffic to maybe
hundreds of people through the company's
email system which would clock the email
system which would slow things down and
which would sort of
um impact the productivity of other
people in the organization so they had
to do something about that and the very
first email marketing systems were
developed by it departments in-house
where you would then have to give your
email addresses and the email that you
would like to send to somebody in the IT
department and then they would look
after sending it but that was all still
very basic you didn't have a lot of
information about who received the email
who would open the email people not even
yeah you couldn't even know that where
people would click on an email
so there was a clear need for a service
that would deliver a much Fuller
scenario for email marketing and then
when the internet came along and
software as a service developed there
was obviously one of the first areas
that many software houses jumped onto
was to come out with an email marketing
service
MailChimp is an example of that yeah
there is
um constant context that was one of the
first ones that I used to work with and
there's a whole range of email Marketing
Systems but I have always kind of liked
MailChimp because of its Simplicity
because of it is simple interface and
it's
um and it's pricing as well yeah up to
500 emails MailChimp is free to use
now what started off as a simple email
Marketing System yes so you put in your
email addresses you create an email
campaign you link the campaign to the
email addresses yep and then you send it
out MailChimp will take care of that and
then MailChimp would also give you the
reporting now this melody this email
Marketing Systems they became more and
more and advanced they knew that digital
marketing is not only email marketing
there is no pay-per-click marketing
there is social media there is
um what's it influencer marketing there
is advertising you name it so they had
to enrich their services yep and you
will see that when we go into MailChimp
that there is now a whole range of
additional Services even down to
developing your own website that
MailChimp can offer you
but at the core of
MailChimp is its email system so let's
go and have a look into how to use
MailChimp and how to set up your first
email campaign so if you go to
mailchimp.com
yeah you can see here a little overview
of what it does yeah then again we're
going to go into automations I'm going
to show you some of the analytics I'm
going to show you how you can segment
with um with MailChimp and how you can
synchronize with other applications in
MailChimp as well so lots of stuff that
you can do here is a little promotional
video and here is the pricing so you can
see that a free version gives you
limited functionality but it does give
you all the functionality you need to
send emails to up to 500 contacts per
month
yep and then it goes up to 11.70 and
then the premium version gives you all
the Full Features 299 dollars but let's
focus on the free version again that's
what I kind of like often of MailChimp
so let's go into my account yeah so I go
on to
doctor
let's have a look I'm logged in yeah so
here is my
audience
so here you see the features that
MailChimp has to offer
so first of all there is create you can
create campaigns
yeah that is where you run your email
campaigns and where you create your
marketing campaigns a very important
part of your MailChimp is your contacts
or your audience
of course if you don't have any emails
in your database if it were then yeah
then there's not many people that you
can send stuff to so contacts are very
important that you get an email list
that you can connect with your campaigns
there are automations that you can do
which basically means you can send
emails automatically there is analytics
there is website you can create your own
website and modules of it there is
content so that is sort of your library
of assets and then there are different
Integrations that you can do here you
see kind of your dashboard of the
campaigns and this is your audience
dashboard
so the very first thing of course that
you need to do when you are starting on
MailChimp that is create an audience
yeah and that's where you go into your
contacts so there is your audience
dashboard as you see here you can have
all an overview of all your contacts you
can create signup forms that you can add
to your website to capture people's
email addresses there are tags that you
can set to content so you can group your
contents into segments and you can do
surveys and there is your inbox if
people send you messages
yeah so lots of functionality but your
first challenge will be
how to get your emails there's lots of
ways to do that first of all there may
be your existing customer database or
your existing customer list you probably
have them in a spreadsheet
yeah so what I'm going to show you in a
minute is how you can enter or
um import that spreadsheet into
MailChimp yeah so that is one way second
you can actually set up on your website
a form that people can fill in to sign
up for your newsletter for instance
or you can run a campaign where people
go to a landing page and if they
download a certain piece of
documentation then they need to give you
their their email address yeah so
there's lots of ways another really
effective way if you're at an exhibition
for instance have a little box on your
uh your counter where people can leave
their ear their
um their business cards
yeah and then you can take all of that
information and put them in your your
MailChimp so the question here then is
of course how do I bring contacts into
my
MailChimp audience so let's go to all
contacts
yep and then you see I already have two
contacts in my my co
that's the name of my audience
yeah so I'm going to add additional
contacts I can get an overview of my
contacts I can add contacts manually I
can add a subscriber
yeah and then I can just put in the name
yeah so that is Mark at
uh
simplylearn.com and then it's Mark
there is
simply learn don't have to put in a
dress I can get phone number I can get
birthday I can get company name that
would be simply learn
I can add a tag so that would be
training
add or create a tag
yeah that could be training
there's my tag now very important what
SIM what the MailChimp wants to know
that you people that you have in your
database
that you that they gave you permission
to email them yeah they're a very strict
requirements these days for people yet
that you need to respect your privacy
you need to have permission before you
send them an email
yeah but there's different ways that you
can ask that permission you can ask it
on the website before they fill in a
form you can ask it in your newsletter
yeah so make sure that you have those
permissions because if people get
unsolicited email through a commercial
email campaign yeah in principle that is
not allowed and you may be subject to a
fine the you may have heard of the gdprs
regulations in in Europe and there is
also regulations in the United States
there's regulations in Asia yeah there's
a real tightening of those privacy
regulations when it comes to email
marketing if this person for some reason
is already in my audience and I can
update it will update your profile so
let's click subscribe
let's see there's probably one
field I forgot
phone number that is 075
yeah so this phone number was a required
item as well yep and then I click
subscribe
so if I now go back to all contacts you
will see that Mark at simplylearn.com is
now has been added to my database so
that is one way to get emails in your
audience list
the next way is if you go to add
contacts you can import contacts
there are three ways how you can import
contacts you can import contacts from
another surface
there's a way you connect with another
piece of software you can upload a CSV
file or a text file and you can even
copy and paste
yeah so if I import from another service
you can see you can import for
Salesforce from Squarespace from Shopify
and there's probably a lot more
Integrations that you can have
if you want to upload a file it will
then basically ask you to upload your
file so what we need to do we need to
create a spreadsheet that we save as a
CSV file so if I go to
Google Drive
and I'm going to actually I already have
a file here
yeah so let's open this file
so you see
that I have these names in there I'm
going to take them out very important
that you add first name last name
company email and all the fields that
are relevant for you yeah so let's say
telephone as well so then we're going to
say the first name is Jacob
last name is Jones
company
is Biko
and email is Jacob jones.com
telephone number is oh one two three
four five six seven
yep then the second name is
um Anne-Marie
Carol
and that is Carol
dot com
and that is n
at Carol dot prom and that is 987654
telephone number okay let's take out
that dollar sign
right yes so now I have the file and
this name is MailChimp or whatever
MailChimp one
so the first thing I'm going to do of
course is to save this I am going to
download this file as a comma separated
values file which is a CSV file
and MailChimp wants me to upload this
CSV file into
this field yeah so that's how I can
upload my contacts so I'm going to my uh
YouTube
downloads here is my MailChimp CSV file
yep so there it is I'm going to continue
to organize now the first thing that
MailChimp is going to do now if I'm
wearing any
existing context they will be updated
the first thing I can add a tag yes so
I'm going to let's say a member and I'm
going to continue to match that is what
MailChimp is going to do now remember
the first line of our spreadsheet was
sort of the field names first name last
name company name and telephone
MailChimp is going to match those
MailChimp things that the first line was
first name the second name was last name
so these are correct company it has
picked up it doesn't know what to do
with telephone yeah so what I can do I
can edit this column yeah and I can look
at the fields that they have
yes so is telephone in here
I don't hear phone number yeah and I'm
going to link it with phone number
so now it is okay and I can now see here
five columns will be imported and I'm
going to say finalize Imports
yep so now it has added two contacts to
the list so I'm going to say complete
Imports
and if I now want to view my contacts
you will see that my contacts have been
added to my email list
yeah so now I have two additional
contacts in my list
I could also
add a subscriber actually have done a
copy and paste
go back
add contacts import contacts I could do
a copy and paste
so I'll show you how that works continue
yeah so but I go back to the spreadsheet
and I would copy these just copy it
command copy
going back to my MailChimp and I can now
just paste them here just like this and
now
MailChimp is going to analyze this yeah
and it says okay this is what I think it
is and it goes back into that same stage
that we saw in when we when we imported
the spreadsheet
yeah you see here first name last name
company name and then the telephone
yep now I'm not going to import this
again because we've already imported
these contacts but this is how you
import your contacts
okay
now a few tips on your database
yes very important
are you sure you want to access this
okay yes so you may build up a list of a
couple of hundred contacts in your in
your MailChimp and that is fantastic
yeah the bigger your list the more value
that you will get from it a very
important aspect of this is to make sure
that your database is clean
yeah people may ask to be removed from
your database people change businesses
yeah make sure your database is clean
when you run a campaign
and you use your email list and there
are a lot of emails that cannot be sent
because there are a lot of wrong emails
in your list
yeah you will have what we call a high
bounce rate
and if you have a continuous high bounce
rate
MailChimp may come back to you and say
hey why do you have such a high bound
rate
and if you can't explain why you have a
high bound rate MailChimp may actually
block your account
because MailChimp wants you to work with
a clean database that is also the risk
if you buy an email list that you don't
know the source from and if you import
it and then run your first campaign if
you get a whole lot of bounces on your
emails yeah then uh MailChimp May block
your account so be very careful make
sure that your emails are correct that
your bounce rate is low and never buy
email lists because you don't know what
the quality is of the list
make sure that you segment your mailing
list and then you can within one mailing
list you can send it to your different
segments could be customers could be
prospects could be
suppliers or what have you
yeah constantly work on growing your
database make sure you don't spam people
always get
um people's approval yeah that they are
happy for you to send them
um emails and of course honor
unsubscribes as well if people ask you
to unsubscribe them from the mailing
list make sure you do that
okay just a few tips when it comes to
managing your database
so now that you have your email audience
set up your contacts setup let's look at
a campaign
let's
when you go into the campaigns here you
have an overview of all the campaigns
that you've run now we haven't run any
campaigns here is a draft campaign yeah
but what you're gonna do you're going to
create a campaign
yes when you click here on the top right
on the create campaign button you have
then the different types of campaigns

two fields
yeah and then I click save
here is the from
so that is it's from me or you can edit
that have it from send from somebody
else you can add a subject now your
subject line of course is very important
in email marketing because in the
subject line people will when they read
the subject line people will decide
whether or not they will open the email
yes so the subject line always has to be
catchy so when it could be five reasons
why you shoot read our latest
email newsletter
newsletter
yeah or any other subject line but they
are they need to be short and sweet yeah
you could use emojis you need to in that
one line you need to give people the
reason why they shoot open this email
preview text appears in the inbox after
the subject line yeah so in today's
newsletter
we will talk
about
social media
and email marketing
for instance and you click save
so that is your subject that is your
content
yep and then here is part of your
contact you can send yourself a test
email
that is always useful to send it to
yourself and check it on your desktop
and check it on your mobile so I send
myself a test email send a test to any
email yeah so let me quickly check here
my Gmail

to me
that is tube for Mark
okay so I'm going to send that email to
tube for Mark okay I can send it to
multiple people and I'm going to click
send test
email has been sent
so let's check the email so here we see
the email test five reasons why you
should read our latest newsletter
and then here you see the email and then
you check it on typos you check it on
the links that are in there yeah make
sure that your social media buttons work
etc
and if you're then happy with your email
you can then publish it
yeah and there's two ways of publishing
it you can schedule it
when you schedule it you can set a
delivery date and a specific delivery
time but in order to use that feature
you need to upgrade to Premium
okay so you can send it directly
so when you click Send it will go
straight away
yep so very important or you can say
finish later if you don't want to share
your campaign you see here the link for
the campaign
yeah and you could change that
your default campaign URL yeah so
MailChimp generate randomly five reasons
why you should read our email if you
upgrade to premium you can turn this
MailChimp into your own URL
okay good and then you can track your
your campaign your email campaigns but
um we'll print they will usually we'll
cover that in a in the next video on on
MailChimp when we go into more advanced
features okay so I'm just gonna click
finish later
and if we're now having our list of
campaigns then here you see we have our
MailChimp demo as a draft ready to be
published
so that is the so that is the campaigns
how to create a campaign on MailChimp
right now let's have a look at a few
more things
so first of all a new feature in
MailChimp is the analytics when you send
out an email campaign you will get basic
analytics here in your
campaigns dashboard as well but
MailChimp now also has an analytics
dashboard
and here you see the type of data that
you will get in MailChimp and it is
using sample data so we can explore the
dashboard so here you see number of
emails sent whether it's up or down you
see the number of people or the
percentage of people that opened the
email
and very important the actual percentage
of people that clicked on the email or
clicked on the link in the email and
that is very important yeah so that's
where you can really follow through on
your email campaigns yeah on who opened
it who clicked it to the form
differences that needed to be filled in
so very useful information that you can
get out of your campaign and you can see
that from various periods yeah you can
even actually in the other reports you
can actually see who are the people in
my
mailing list in my audience who actually
clicked on the email and who are the
people who opened the clicked on the
link
and then you can approach them
separately
yeah so here you see engagements
email sent and the click rate
yep so here you see by email the number
of recipients the open rate The Click
rate the revenue that you made
if you have that set up so lots of data
that you can get on your email campaigns
open rates are very important and they
differ by industry yeah and general and
open rate
anywhere between up to 15 and higher are
usually good open rates
okay so that is the analytics that you
can get and then finally what I really
like in MailChimp is that you can use
MailChimp to create landing pages so if
I'm going back to my campaigns
and I'm going to click create campaign
then I can also decide to create a
landing page
name of the landing page is Myco
select an audience Michael and I'm going
to click begin
yeah and here you see
a number of templates that I can use for
my landing page
yeah so very simple templates so let's
take this template
except
I'm going into the editor
yeah so here is the editor for the
landing pages I can add text I can do
box text I can add dividers images I can
change the text
yeah you see here band mates that is the
logo I can change the logo
yeah so I can replace the logo and I can
edit a logo and what hit you I'm just
going to stick with this text for the
time being and here is my email address
form yeah and the beauty about it when
people fill in their email address in
this form it will automatically be added
to my mailing list
in MailChimp so that is a very powerful
feature I can also create this as a
separate form
Okay so
so here you see the available fields
that I have email I can add first name
if I want to yeah I can add last name
and I can add phone number as well
yep I can then go to the settings
I can do the style different styles that
I can have so this is my sign up form
yeah the button text is subscribe I can
then also send visitors to a
confirmation message
I can preview the confirmation message
success you've been added to the
audience
yeah exit preview
yep and that is my sign up form and
again it will automatically be added to
my campaign email list and I click save
and close
yep and here is the full campaign
yeah and when I'm happy with it
I can click save and close
so here is my landing page
and it's now
here I have the page title and site icon
here's the social share preview here is
the URL of mic and my landing page here
is the contents
and I can then get my
finish it later or I can publish it and
as soon as I publish it
this URL will be life
yeah so click publish
so this landing page is now live
so if I now go to this landing page
yeah so here you see email address I'm
saying uh
Sherry
oh
Cherry at henry.com
com and that is
cherry
and I'd say subscribe
so now let's check the litmus test if I
go to my contacts and I'm going to all
my contacts
and here we have cherry Henry the famous
Arsenal football player who has just
joined my mailing list so that is the
power of MailChimp and this is all I

here's how it's gonna work so if you
have any questions to these questions or
answers feel free to just comment right
below this video and we'll get back to
you as soon as possible we're going to
go through a series of questions and I'm
going to answer those questions for you
so email marketing traditional digital
marketing channel it's been around a
while and you're going to be asked some
questions that aren't going to
accomplish a lot of things related to
the delivery of emails we all check
emails on a daily basis we all receive
them sometimes receive emails
unsolicited sometimes we sign up for
receive emails sometimes receive emails
from friends sometimes we receive emails
where we're working or previously have
worked so most people have an
understanding of email however as a
marketer there's a little bit of a
Different Twist to it so we have to
understand the intricacies of how email
marketing works so you're going to be
asked some questions and really the
first question here is what's the
difference between a hard and a soft
bounce email so if you're a digital
marketer you're in charge of sending out
lots of emails let's just say thousands
or yeah I mean it could be in the
hundreds of thousands of emails you're
going to get some bounces and so you
really want to know the difference
between a hard and a soft bounce so a
soft bounce just means that the email
message reached the recipient's mail
server but bounce back isn't delivered
so think of it as delivering actual mail
to a post office so it actually reached
the post office but it bounced back back
because maybe the you know person's
email box was full maybe their account
was temporarily disabled or maybe the
email server wasn't necessarily able to
handle that email now hard balance is an
email that that is rejected because it's
an email when it happens when the email
has been permanently rejected so for
example maybe the the the account is no
longer valid and so let's look at some
reasons again as to why a soft bounce
would happen so for example the inbox is
full or the recipient servers down so
reach the post office but there was a
problem actually getting it into the
hands of the owner so to speak where the
hard balance a little bit different
let's just say that person is no longer
working their email has been deleted or
you the email has been blacklisted
somehow okay a Spam or something to that
effect so the email server is going to
identify that and it's not even going to
reach the recipient so a lot of
different ways in which an email may not
make its recipient so not the most
important thing to know here I just the
important thing to know is listen when
you send out an email you got to pay
attention to how many get bounced back
and so next question here what would you
do to improve the click-through rate of
your email so click the rate is simply
how many people have seen your email and
how many people actually clicked on a
link in the email so if a hundred people
saw your email but only one person
clicked then it would be a one percent
click-through rate so we want to be able
to make sure we have a high clicked
array so remember emails are going to
people who likely signed up to receive
your email and even if they are
expecting email or they're not expecting
an email you still want to follow some
of these best practices here one is to
create a compelling subject line so you
want to make the subject line something
that people are going to notice take
note have or take an interest in and say
hey what's this all about that's pretty
interesting and open the email so use
preview text effectively obviously you
want to make your email mobile friendly
because most people look at their emails
on their mobile phones you want to
create engaging content okay so the
content that's in the email obviously is
going to have some links so put some
strong call to action in there and
that's one of the bullet points down
below place a CTA where it's easily
visible so keep in mind mobile users
most people are going to check that
email on their phone so you want to make
sure you have compelling content with
good ctas in a visible location so
always check mobile as well as desktop
obviously in your emails you want to
make them as visual as possible don't
make them so text Heavy you can always
segment your emails meaning if you're
sending out an email let's just say to
100 people okay maybe you want to divide
it out boys or girls maybe older or
young maybe you know living in one part
of the country versus another part of
the country I mean those are examples of
segments so break up the email don't
send it to one mass email to everyone
that way you can personalize the email
if an email is personalized the chances
of somebody clicking on it are going to
be greater and then a B test your emails
and when we say A B test you know you
could send out the same email twice
except one segment is going to say get
one version of the email the other
segment is going to get another version
of email and what are the different
versions maybe the subject line so the
subject line is different on version a
versus version b or maybe the call to
action is different so you always want
to send out different versions of the
same email to a different segmented
audience that way you can actually see
which segment or which version got the
most clicks okay so next question here
is how to inform your customers about
company news and establish a
relationship with your target audience
okay so again how do you inform your
customers about what's going on in the
company and how are you going to
establish a relationship with that
audience who's receiving that email well
newsletters are always the best answer
here so somebody signs up for your email
let's just say they actually purchase a
product from you newsletters are a great
way to reach out to that audience to get
them to stay up to date with the latest
product or an improved version of the
product they purchased and then that way
they can come back and continue to
purchase the product so newsletters are
great way to reach out to your audience
and actually talk to your audience and
you're not talking verbally you're
talking to them via email so you send
out that email campaign maybe it's once
a month hey we noticed you bought this
product we have similar products just
like the one you bought or hey you know
if it's a software maybe hey we've we've
got upcoming updates to our software
make sure you go to the website and get
the updates or we have a new and
improved version so all these things you
want to communicate to your audience via
email that's going to get them to get to
the website and that's going to get them
to you know purchase more update upgrade
whatever so newsletters the way to go so
again some basic tips here you want to
create your newsletter with 90
educational and 10 promotional so
remember you're sending out a newsletter
to people who likely signed up so you're
educating them about your products
always create interesting subject lines
you want whether they know you or not
you want to create the subject line so
somebody's going to click on it so make
sure you design your emails
appropriately okay so if you know you're
sending let's just say baby products to
mothers or expected mothers in fact this
is a real life example because I used to
work at a gap and Baby Gap was you know
one of the emails groups I was
responsible for so we created an email
template with softer colors your yellows
your your light blue you know it wasn't
black or dark red or anything that's
going to be you know heavy we knew who
our audience was and we designed the
template accordingly and of course using
compelling images so for selling baby
products you're gonna put baby product
images in there I mean it's common sense
but you'd be surprised you gotta pick
and choose your images carefully
especially if you're sending to an
international audience because images
can be misconstrued and just like we
mentioned with the click-through rate
you always want to have a clear CTA
always make sure you have a CTA in a
visible position because most people are
going to look at that email in a mobile
phone okay and then always make sure you
include your contact information in the
newsletter so somebody knows where to
find you how to contact you where to go
maybe they have a product they want to
return okay so you always want to put
that contact information normally it's
at the bottom of the email but these are
all best practices so here's some
examples okay we've got you know check
out the latest Cosmetics from our new
actions notice the image and notice the
call to action so you can see trendy
collections you know we got some other
products you may want to buy okay five
important skin care products that
everyone should have view more so you
always want to have that call to action
in a very visible place so Define
following metrics open right
click-through rate and response rate and
forward rate so these are metrics
related to email marketing so you're
gonna have to know what these are so I
already mentioned click-through rate
before when we talked about best
practices from improving the click
through rate so for those of you that
remember what that is go ahead and put
that in the comment section below just a
little pop quiz for you if anybody
remembers click-through rate but let's
take a look at open right so open Raise
the percentage of the total number of
recipients who actually open the email
so if you send it to x amount of people
how many people opened it that would be
the open rate so how many people open it
but you're gonna take out the people who
balanced it whether it's a soft bounce
or hard bounce okay you're not going to
count those people so if you have let's
just say 20 people open the email and
you send it to a hundred people then and
you had nobody bounce then it would be a
20 open rate Okay click the rate again
Pop Quiz it's just how many people
actually click on any of the links in
your email and that's just divided by
the number of of emails you've sent out
the response rate okay so response rate
is the percentage of the total
recipients who clicked on the link of
your email campaign and actually
completed an action so what is that
action well it could be downloading
something watching something purchasing
something so that's the response rate
similar to conversion rate if you're
working in a digital marketing channel
and you're driving traffic to the site
you want that traffic to do something
well it's no different in email
marketing we want people to take action
we're just going to divide that by the
number of emails delivered and that
gives you your response rate so let's
just say you did send in 100 emails you
did get 20 open it and of this 20 let's
just say one person went on a purchase
well you'd have a one percent response
rate and then a forward rate is simply
the forward rate refers to the rate at
which your subscribers share your email
uh with others friends family Etc and
you may have that as a call to action in
your email in fact that's a best
practice so it's just the number of
clicks on a share divided by the total
number of delivered emails and you're
going to multiply that by 100 to get the
percentage and so most email marketing
platforms do measure forward rate okay
let's take a look at how do we capture
inactive customers what you want to do
here is re-engage subscribers with
gamification opt for subject lines like
we have been missing you or did we do
something wrong you want to run a poll
or competition and re-engage the
subscribers again trying to get people
involved these first three are all about
getting people involved so personalize
your emails talk to that person as if
hey look I haven't heard from you in a
while how about coming back and taking a
look at our new products just as you
would a friend so design always matters
especially knowing that you're talking
to customers who haven't been active
Okay this is a segmented audience
somebody who's inactive so you want to
have the right design the right message
the right subject line that fits with
that customers and activity so you want
to try and do everything you can to get
that customer back and then you want to
follow a consistent schedule okay so
ideally when you schedule an email you
want to schedule the best time so you
have to know your audience obviously and
then you can always ask for feedback why
are they inactive why haven't they
purchased in a while so the whole idea
here from gamification like trying to
you know make a game out of it so make
it competitive to adding polls to really
personalizing it these are all all
things that you can do to get your
customers back so what are the different
ways to segment by a Persona so again
when we talk about segmentation we're
talking about taking a smaller piece the
entire pie so what's one way to break up
that pie if you will by Geography okay
so with geography you could Target your
audience based on that area and it could
not necessarily have to be by a part of
the country it could be all the way down
to the province the state the actual
City the county okay if you live in a
small village okay all the way up to the
continent okay so think about how you
would break out the segment by geography
now obviously if you break it out let's
just say in the United States to the
southern part well the southern part you
know in the winter in the United States
the southern part is not going to be as
cool to say the northern part so that
should tell you hey if we're going to
send an email in the winter we're not
going to use snow in in blizzards as our
theme we're going to use probably a
little little bit of Sun so breaking it
out by geography helps you understand
where your audience lives you also have
demographic segmentation and this is
simply just age education income gender
you know where people work okay
nationality anything that's going to
identify that user so this is the best
way to segment if you know who your
audience is by income or gender I mean
you're talking to a group of like-minded
people if they're all the same age from
the same generation then you could talk
to them appropriately okay you're not
going to talk to an older person the
same way you would a younger person so
think about demographic segmentation
because it really helps you hone in on
your messaging and you have behavioral
segmentation so behavioral is based on
your audience's behavior have they
purchased before have they never
purchased were they searching for
something how long do they stay on the
site what products were they looking at
are they a lifetime customer so you can
look at Behavior here and decide how you
want to break out your emails by
behavior and this is a really good way
if you're not even sure who your
audience is or where they live and how
old they are you could certainly break
out your Audience by Behavior because
you know who these people are based on
what they've done previously because
you're going to track that information
with analytics so you know one way is
obviously if somebody's purchased that's
a good way to segment because you know
these people believe in you believe in
your business believe in your product so
the way you can message to somebody
who's purchased before is going to be
different than somebody you don't even
know who they are if they purchased or
not okay so behavioral segmentation to
me is one of the easiest things the
easiest ways to segment your email list
how would you drive repeat customers
through email marketing for the below
scenario okay so this is a pop quiz if
you will again for those of you that got
click-through rate correctly Kudos let's
see if you can go two for two here okay
so if you know the answer to this go
ahead and comment below but let's just
say give a few examples of subject lines
to drive engagement for audiences based
on the following so if I had an audience
between 20 and 30 years old that were
female and the product were sandals okay
what were some of your subject lines be
so I'm going to give you a minute to
think about that and put it in the
comments section below now remember this
is an interview based question so you're
gonna have to think on the spot I'm
going to give you a minute but if
somebody presented that to you in an
interview you need to be able to you
know react fairly quickly and come up
with some really attractive subject
lines here okay so here you go here's
another one uh so give a few examples of
subject lines to drive engagement for 20
to 30 females for Footwear so you got
Friday sale coming up buy branded
sandals at the lowest price okay so I
like this one because it's got a strong
call to action bye here you go this is
even better because 50 off on branded
sandals and free shipping I mean who
can't beat free anything including
shipping and if it's 50 off I mean these
are key things you're putting the
promotion and percentage off all in the
subject line so that's really going to
grab somebody's attention weekend sale
for women starts now okay with a little
emoji that never hurts so those are all
good subject lines they all tend to work
because they all have an element of a
best practice in there so here you got
you know the Friday sale coming up is
just giving people notice okay the
stronger call to action on the buy
you're putting the promotion in the
subject line and you know you're using
an emoji to really just drive home the
point so all these subject lines will
work and hey at the end of the day
remember you want to test your subject
lines okay moving on to the next
question speaking of testing what is a b
testing and give some examples of a b
testing okay so we talked a little bit
about a b testing with subject lines so
simply a B test when it comes to email
marketing it's just a method to analyze
which of the two email campaign
strategies is most effective all right
now you're going to do it based on open
right you can do it by saying click rate
you can do it based on response rate and
remember you're putting one version of
the email against another version
whether that be the subject line whether
it be the content call to action
whatever so that's ideally what you're
trying to do you're trying to figure out
what works for your audience that's the
end goal for email for a b testing and
email marketing what's going to work and
I would highly suggest you should always
do a b testing for subject lines always
so some of the variables that you can
test again subject lines okay you always
want to try if you got a promotion hey
Will the percentage off work likely it
will but let's test it up against
something else like you know a generic
word like discounts you can always test
the design you can always test the
personalization the preview text you
could try out images call to actions
exclusive use of offers what particular
offer is going to work okay so if you're
testing offers then obviously that's
going to be response rate for testing
ctas and that's going to be
click-through rate for testing subject
lines that's going to be open rates so
you want to be able to test different
elements of the email to figure out what
works and what doesn't work okay so how
to prevent email from getting into spam
so if you're an email marketer this is
your worst nightmare you don't want your
emails to get spammed so that doesn't
bode well for you so most email
marketing platforms like MailChimp or
Constant Contact measure spam so some of
the important ways to prevent this is
hey improve your open rate remember
going back to the first question second
question you want to have really good
subject lines here okay and you want to
segment your audience so if you're if
you know who you're talking to and you
have a cool subject line that's going to
get somebody to react and open and
that's going to prevent somebody from
spamming your email okay you can always
customize your from to make it look like
it's coming from in this case Rob
Sanders check if you have included an
unsubscribe link okay so give people the
option to unsubscribe they don't have
the option to unsubscribe they could
just report you a Spam make sure your
emails work on different devices okay
you want to optimize your images for
email make sure they're not big and they
don't fit on a mobile device okay prefer
more text and fewer images and then
avoid grammatical issues you want to
come across as professional you don't
want somebody looking at your email like
who sent this why are you sending this
to me I don't want to hear from you
again I'm going to spam you you want to
prevent that and that means a
professional looking email professional
content with a really good subject line
and some imagery to go along with that
hey you may just get somebody to open
that email and get them to convert
that's the idea behind it so these are
ways to prevent somebody from actually
spamming you and then what are the best
practices for email some subject line so
the subject lines of most probably the
most important element in email
marketing so we talked about that little
pop quiz with the sandals targeting 20
to 30 year old women you know to me I
like the subject line with the 50 off so
that was a number in the subject line so
people can actually see hey wow I get a
whole 50 that works better than just a
discount okay remember one of those
other subject lines had an emoji so
don't be afraid to include emojis in
there for example when I send out emails
using you know during the Spring you
might want to use flowers perhaps to
signify hey it's spring Winter's over so
personalize the subject lines remember
that goes with segmenting so if you know
who your audience is your subject lines
can be a little bit more personal okay
so opt for title case subject lines okay
so instead of making it grammatical for
example okay you want to keep your
subject lines short and to the point
remember you want to say something
that's going to draw somebody's
attention if you make it long and drawn
down and boring then people aren't going
to open it develop a sense of urgency
like hey we got 50 off through Friday so
that's a little sense of urgency so
people know hey if it's Thursday I
better open this email and check it out
and again grammatical mistakes that goes
without saying you always want to
preview your emails before you send them
out so if you preview your emails before
you send them out have somebody else
obviously receive the preview they can
be another set of eyes for you to
prevent any mistakes but also give you
feedback on the imagery the design
Etc okay so these are all best practices
for good subject lines okay so subject
line is the most important element for
email marketing so just keep these in
mind subject lines and having good
subject lines is the way to get people
to open it and from there that's half
the battle somebody can open the email
then you've just set yourself up for
better performance and this was all for
today's email
