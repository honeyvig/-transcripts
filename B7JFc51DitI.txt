[Music]

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,280
so hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,880
tutorial my name is tany Baki and this

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,359
time we're going to be going over how

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,359
you can actually self-host the parse

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
server that parse has released now uh if

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
you've seen my previous tutorials you

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,279
know that unfortunately parse is

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,359
shutting down and as of January 28th I

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,960
believe 2017 uh it's going to be

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,000
completely shutting down however they

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,879
are going to keep some Services up such

13
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:40,239
as the dashboard uh and so essentially

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,039
what they allow you to do uh is that

15
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,960
they have open source the par server

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,640
sort of uh the server side of pars uh

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,000
and so basically you can put that onto

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,039
your own machine uh and host your own

19
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,680
mongod DB database uh and have your own

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,800
little version of pars running uh and of

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,039
course uh have your own little uh what

22
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,239
do you call it basically you can tell

23
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,800
your application not to go to the par

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,960
servers by default but go but go to your

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,720
server and that's really neat so I'm

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,080
going to be showing you exactly how you

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
can do that uh let me just show you

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,840
something really quickly though uh

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
originally when pars announced it's

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,320
going to be shutting down uh there was

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,439
this there was your

32
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,520
application that was what that would run

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,320
on let's say some sort of

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,520
phone all

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,759
right all right so this is your

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,439
application running on a phone

37
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,759
however there was also a par

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,960
server uh and this was I don't exactly

39
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,680
know what the parse server logo is but

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,840
this is sort of like the par server over

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,320
here uh and so basically right now what

42
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,799
happens uh is by default your

43
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,399
application communicates with the par

44
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,479
server without you having to direct it

45
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,439
there it just automatic I mean the

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,520
framework is coded in to know where the

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,479
par servers are located however what par

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,840
said is hey we're going to open Source

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,320
this so we're going to open source

50
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,119
this we're going to open source this the

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,280
par server uh and so essentially what

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,840
this will allow you to do is have your

53
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,800
own sort of machine like uh let's say

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,000
some sort of Mac um let's just say this

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,280
is your uh machine uh this is your

56
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,440
server uh and essentially what you can

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,319
do with this uh is Host this par server

58
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,120
on here so you can say

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,080
parse is running on your

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
server all right and so what you what

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,239
they allow you to do is first of all

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,800
they say the step one of your migration

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,519
essentially they gave us exactly one

64
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,840
year to migrate uh and so in within that

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,599
one year uh you spend a little bit of

66
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,920
your time uh doing step one step one is

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
getting par server uh to run on your

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
server uh and once that's done really

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,120
simply all you need to do uh is connect

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,080
this iPhone end with this server and

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
tell it to stop communicating with the

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,959
par servers by default uh and then just

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,879
sort of release an update to your

74
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,040
application which uh will essentially

75
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,400
allow users to communicate uh with this

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,799
other server rather than this par server

77
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,959
that they host for you now there's just

78
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,239
a few disadvantages to this why well

79
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,400
first of all uh parse had a really good

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,440
free tier which is actually mainly why

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,400
lots of people used parse because the

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
free tier of parse was amazing it gave

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,080
you a lot of stuff however I mean that

84
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,519
won't be available now uh because now

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,159
you have to host it on your own server

86
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,519
so whatever specs you get with your

87
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,959
server let's say an AWS server uh maybe

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,280
you selfhosted it all depends on the

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,400
specs of your own server uh as to how

90
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,560
many your quests per second you can do

91
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,000
uh how how much you can store and stuff

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,640
which might be a bit more expensive but

93
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,280
then again uh I mean there's nothing we

94
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,799
can really do about that and if you can

95
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,040
find affordable hosting great uh then

96
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
you can run parse on pretty much

97
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,879
anything actually uh that also reminds

98
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,840
me bringing me to my next Point parse

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,400
will run on crossplatform Mac OSX or

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,760
Linux and now that bash runs on Windows

101
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,079
10 anniversary update you can even run

102
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,760
it on windows so now that concludes my

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,840
little uh Speech session I guess uh

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,600
let's move over right to the Mac part

105
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
now where I'm going to be showing you

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
exactly how you can host your par server

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,560
on a Macintosh machine even though the

108
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,560
steps are almost the exact same for a

109
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Linux and Windows machine Let's get to

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
it so welcome back to Mac part and now

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm going to be showing you how exactly

112
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
you can run par server on your Mac or

113
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,160
Linux machine or even Windows machine uh

114
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,039
so let's begin shall we so to begin uh

115
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,880
there's going to be a link in the

116
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,600
description uh to actually a website uh

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
that describes how you can run par

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,639
server uh on auntu

119
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,240
14.04 now first of all I'd like to say

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,840
that I'm running the new Mac OS uh 10.12

121
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,160
CR beta so some things may differ a

122
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,199
little bit but not really uh nothing

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,520
much has changed uh and so first of all

124
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,919
to begin why am I opening up an auntu

125
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,320
tutorial if we have mac running well aun

126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,000
2 uses bash Mac uses bash they're very

127
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,199
similar I guess and if you have the X

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,240
code command line tools installed uh

129
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,400
lots of things become much easier uh and

130
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,639
so you know you're going to need to

131
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,199
install the xcode commandline tools for

132
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,199
this you're going to need to install

133
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,319
Homebrew and after that everything is

134
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,120
pretty much the same as a bu to all

135
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,479
right so let's begin first of all I'm

136
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,400
going to open up a terminal window uh

137
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,160
and of course this little uh page over

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,960
here uh which describes how you can run

139
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,360
the par server on a buntu

140
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,400
14.04 then what you're going to want to

141
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,560
do uh is uh just going just go down and

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,080
first of all we going to use uh home

143
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,039
brew to say Brew install

144
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,880
nodejs uh I'm going to click enter

145
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,440
now uh now this is going to say hey

146
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,039
you're using a pre pre-release version

147
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,440
uh so you might encounter build failures

148
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,759
uh just ignore that uh and in just a

149
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,560
second this should be

150
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,759
done all right so this is going to take

151
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,160
around 5 to 10ish minutes uh so I'm

152
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,800
going to be pausing the recording now uh

153
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,160
and right as it is done installing or

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
almost done installing uh I will resume

155
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,880
the recording uh and then we can see the

156
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,080
result okay so I'm going to pause the

157
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,120
recording now all right so as you can

158
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,840
see it is now done installing nodejs

159
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,000
onto my machine uh and so now all we

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,120
need to do is basically you know in this

161
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,160
guide the entirety of step one you can

162
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,440
basically just skip all you need to do

163
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,199
is install no JS uh using uh home brew

164
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,039
uh now if you don't install the xcode

165
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
command line tools or not command line

166
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,720
tools the DX code developer tools then

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,400
uh you're going to need to install uh

168
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,919
Brew uh git using brew as well

169
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,800
however I do have xcode and the tools

170
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
installed and so I do not need to

171
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,319
install git as xcode already installs

172
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,039
that for me however next we can continue

173
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,599
okay so now as you can see this uh guide

174
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,240
gives us a get clone command which

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,000
clones the par server example uh so

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,560
essentially you can just uh copy and

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
paste

178
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,039
that and as you can see it clones the

179
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,120
repository uh and you can essentially

180
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,960
just CD into that change directory into

181
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,599
it uh and as you can see if I uh list uh

182
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,560
these sort of what all is available just

183
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,360
one second let me make this a better for

184
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,280
you um

185
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,840
no okay so now as you can see if I were

186
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,800
to list what's in this par server

187
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,919
example directory uh as you can see you

188
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,520
see a lot of uh folders and files now

189
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,120
this is a node.js uh application uh and

190
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
so

191
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,560
essentially if I were to yes so

192
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,120
basically all you need to do is run npm

193
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,440
install on this application on this

194
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,840
node.js application actually and

195
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,720
essentially this is going to uh sort of

196
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
get the

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
dependencies uh set up some of the

198
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,319
project stuff uh and stuff like that

199
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,520
till then what you're going to want to

200
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,120
do is go over to

201
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,840
parse.com

202
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,000
all right you need to log

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,080
in with your uh you know email and

204
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,240
stuff h

205
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,159
uh and my

206
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,640
[Applause]

207
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,240
password all right now that you're in

208
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,479
parse what you're going to want to do uh

209
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,599
is first of all it's just telling me

210
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,159
it's going to be shutting down and I'm

211
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,600
going to create a new application after

212
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,800
creating the new application just create

213
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,880
uh just put in a name for example

214
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,240
selfhosted parse app or I can't write

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
anything else or actually I can that was

216
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,760
just lag all right so selfhosted Parts

217
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,920
is what I'm going going for let's create

218
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,120
this

219
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,399
application uh and once that's done what

220
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,360
you want to do is go over to the uh the

221
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,320
um let's see if it's actually done

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,079
installing okay so it's done installing

223
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:13,680
so that means you're going to want to go

224
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,279
to the

225
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,640
core all right once you're in the core

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,519
go over to settings then go over to keys

227
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
and then what you want to do is copy

228
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,519
your application

229
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,120
ID once that's copied which might take a

230
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,360
second or actually I'm just going to

231
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,279
copy that manually uh then you're going

232
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,040
to go to your terminal uh and in that

233
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,680
par server example directory say Nano

234
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
index.js this will run the Nano editor

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,720
or you could use Vim or whatever you

236
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,839
like best uh and edit the index.js file

237
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,560
now I'm going to change

238
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,000
this so that uh the app ID over here

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,040
changes from my app

240
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
ID to whatever you paste p in then

241
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,560
you're going to copy your master

242
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,200
key over here uh and paste that into

243
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,040
your master key parameter in your

244
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,519
terminal once that's done that's

245
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,000
actually all you need to do uh so click

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,519
control X make sure you click on y to

247
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,839
save uh click enter uh and there we go

248
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,839
it should save the file now all you need

249
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,399
to do uh is actually I believe nope

250
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,720
that's it so now uh just run or actually

251
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,600
one more thing we need to do oh up a new

252
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,880
tab and write Brew install mongod

253
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,000
DB all right so now this is going to

254
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,680
install the database uh now let's

255
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,160
see if this can finish within the next

256
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,720
10 seconds I guess I'll keep it in the

257
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,959
video or else let's just uh pause the

258
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,639
video again uh and then we will continue

259
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,440
right after that so let's check it out

260
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,600
shall we so I'm going to give this round

261
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,839
six more

262
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,839
seconds all right so I will be back

263
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,639
right after this is done installing uh

264
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:00,760
and so yeah let's pause the recording so

265
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,560
now as you can see uh home brew is done

266
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,480
installing here uh I mean not home brew

267
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,440
itself sorry uh home brew is done

268
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,279
installing the mongod DB database uh to

269
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,800
our system now one thing I'd like to do

270
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,760
is just type in Brew

271
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,399
services start mongod DB what this will

272
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,519
do is it will start the mongod DB

273
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,600
Service uh and as you can see it runs

274
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,480
mongodb so now uh mongod DB is running

275
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,000
on our computer uh Parts is completely

276
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,560
installed onto our the pars server is

277
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,079
completely installed on onto the

278
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,200
computer uh now it's time to run the par

279
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,120
server uh then it's time to create and

280
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,120
test an a simple iOS application uh that

281
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,320
will be able to insert stuff into the

282
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,600
parse database uh and retrieve stuff

283
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,839
from the parse database let's do it all

284
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,160
right so let's begin uh and to be

285
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
actually in order to run the par server

286
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,079
all you need to do is say npm

287
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,920
start and as you can see the par server

288
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
runs uh and as you can see uh it says

289
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,160
database URI not specified fing back to

290
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,360
Local Host which is completely okay uh

291
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
and Par server example running on Port

292
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,959
1337 perfect so next what you're going

293
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:17,760
to want to do is say parse migration

294
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,500
[Music]

295
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,760
steps

296
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,839
there we go finally there we go so now

297
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,240
as you can see this is Swift Code now

298
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,040
I'm going to be writing this in Swift so

299
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,680
if you just copy this all right uh open

300
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,079
up your xcode I'm again running xcode 8

301
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,079
uh the first beta uh and so once xcode 8

302
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,040
starts up I'm going to paste in this

303
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,959
code or actually one more thing is you

304
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,639
actually have to go back to parse and go

305
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,720
to the the um documentation uh launch

306
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,880
the Quick Start and then from this

307
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,920
little space over here go to your um

308
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,920
self-hosted Parts application then go

309
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,519
data mobile iOS Swift uh

310
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,360
and let's go new project so now what

311
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
you're going to do is download this

312
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,560
blank xcode project as a template to

313
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,920
begin uh

314
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,160
then uh we're going to allow this to

315
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,199
connect to the par server right as it's

316
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:27,760
done

317
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,639
downloading so I'm just going

318
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,079
to open that up open go into the xcode

319
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,360
project right as that loads that is

320
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,760
click on

321
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,360
open and in just a second it should open

322
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,839
up an X

323
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,440
code now again this is xcode8 so I'm

324
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,839
going to allow this to convert to the

325
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,199
latest Swift syntax and I'm going to use

326
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,519
Swift

327
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,120
3 uh and right as it is done creating a

328
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,360
preview um then I'm just going to accept

329
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,320
it uh and hope for the best and see um

330
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,440
if part server can automatically be

331
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,040
migrated all right so again this is uh

332
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,519
not too small of a project so this might

333
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,600
take a second or two uh to actually

334
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,959
begin so just give it a second all right

335
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,040
so

336
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,680
now I'm going to click on

337
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,399
Save go over to this file manager here

338
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,959
go to to the source code uh now in the

339
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,720
app delegate first of all uh I'm

340
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,519
actually going to remove all of this

341
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,880
code every single line uh from here

342
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,360
except for the return true that's

343
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,759
something that has to stay from here as

344
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,480
well I'm just I'm actually going to

345
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,399
remove these three functions as

346
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,000
well all right you're going to move this

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,600
comment I mean I'm I'm just doing that

348
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,399
you don't need to but it's better to uh

349
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,279
and also remove this there we go so now

350
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,079
you're done cleaning up cleaning out the

351
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,759
app delegates next you want to paste in

352
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,399
the code that you

353
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,639
copied uh

354
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,720
from your

355
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,839
little from the parse documentation so

356
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,720
if I just copy this once more paste that

357
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,360
in there so now this is going into the

358
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,959
view did load function of the view

359
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,399
controller class now again uh basically

360
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,759
what this is saying is it's giving us

361
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,959
the configuration uh it's looking for an

362
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,560
application ID a client key and the

363
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,399
server to connect to which in this case

364
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,800
is correct we're connecting to Local

365
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,920
Host because I'm actually hosting the

366
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,399
parse application on Local Host with the

367
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,800
1337 uh P Port uh and then SL parse

368
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,399
which is default okay uh and then uh

369
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,440
we're just saying par. initialize with

370
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,399
configuration and then the configuration

371
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,800
that I just

372
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,880
created all right so now what I'm going

373
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,240
to do is I'm just going to quickly go

374
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,639
over to the settings of this uh

375
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,160
application

376
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,399
um and then go to the Keys copy the

377
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,360
application

378
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,399
ID then paste that in there copy the

379
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,279
master key or the client key

380
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,600
sorry all right no not this not

381
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,160
this copy this paste it into this little

382
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,240
client key box build and let's see all

383
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,040
right okay

384
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,720
so now uh it's actually been changed to

385
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,160
initialize with apparently all right so

386
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,759
now if I

387
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,560
build um oh never mind if I

388
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,319
build

389
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,880
um yeah our code should work in

390
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,440
theory all right so now uh that's done

391
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,079
building that means we have no errors

392
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,680
but now let's actually complete the part

393
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,199
of the application where to actually

394
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:58,199
upload something to the server so in

395
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,959
order to to do that all you need to do

396
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,759
is say uh VAR

397
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,919
object is equal to PF

398
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,880
object and we're going to give this a

399
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
class name

400
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,720
of

401
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,839
pars

402
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,000
hosted selfhosted

403
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,199
um and so I'm just going to say

404
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,400
object let's just

405
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
say

406
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,440
date uh the current date is

407
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,960
29th is equal

408
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,880
to 06 29

409
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,640
2016 all right so now in a string of

410
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,960
course I don't want to mess around with

411
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,200
uh NS data at this time uh then I'm just

412
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,160
going to say

413
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,919
object do save and I'm going to since I

414
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:56,120
know this is going to work you wouldn't

415
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,080
actually do this in an application uh

416
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,320
but I'm just going to uh forcefully try

417
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,080
this uh so now I'm just going to run

418
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,240
this on let's say an iPhone SE uh and so

419
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,440
now this should uh compile the

420
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,120
application and start running it okay so

421
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,919
now it's going to load up the simulator

422
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,480
and hopefully uh in iOS 8 and 9 I've

423
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,320
seen in the betas it takes a lot of time

424
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
to load the simulator let's see if they

425
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
fix that in iOS 10 if they have great or

426
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,080
else yeah I'm going to have to pause the

427
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,320
recording again uh let's

428
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,120
see

429
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
first of all the simulator okay there we

430
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,360
go I believe this should be much quicker

431
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,240
I believe I read that

432
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,919
somewhere so again one more thing uh is

433
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,280
that first of all uh this is going to be

434
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,039
uploading uh our simple string to the

435
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,720
cloud or to of course my mongod DB

436
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,360
database which the parse is connected to

437
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
uh once that's done uh it's going to uh

438
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,799
we're actually going to change the code

439
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,440
to retrieve something from parse uh and

440
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,520
see if it's able to do that if it is

441
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,000
great uh or else back to the drawing

442
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
board

443
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,559
um just give that a second more I'm

444
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,039
going to start speeding up the clip

445
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,839
[Music]

446
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,159
now all right so as you can see um the

447
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:24,760
simulator is done loading and it just

448
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,799
ran the application uh and so in just a

449
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,520
second we should see a warning from par

450
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,080
saying hey you're running a long uh

451
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,440
you're actually oh let's see

452
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,799
here okay so now I believe there is a

453
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,520
small problem um due to the fact that

454
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,360
um yeah so essentially what's happening

455
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,200
is I forgot to include one thing so if

456
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
we actually go to the internet right now

457
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,240
and search up NSA Transport

458
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,559
Security

459
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,400
then uh as you can see in the second app

460
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,799
Apple developer forums uh link uh you

461
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,039
can actually just copy this little code

462
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,360
snippet okay uh then paste it uh

463
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,840
actually go to your files go to um yeah

464
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,360
your right click on info.plist and look

465
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,559
at it as source code go to the very

466
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,440
bottom after this uh array tag just

467
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,159
paste that in uh and rerun the

468
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,400
application and essentially what this

469
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
will do is it will uh allow pars to

470
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,039
actually communicate uh with the server

471
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,400
that I have running because the thing is

472
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,880
it doesn't have a good SSL certificate

473
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
and stuff so iOS is really secure about

474
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,440
that uh however as you can see uh this

475
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,919
should in theory be able to

476
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,640
um upload to the server let's see here

477
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,960
it says uh get host name incorrect um

478
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,960
however I believe it was able to

479
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,400
finish so now let's just actually uh try

480
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,640
out and see if it was able to uh grab uh

481
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,279
the data by commenting this uh code

482
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,799
out uh and now let's type in or actually

483
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,880
we actually want to continue to

484
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,799
initialize so now we're just going to

485
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,840
say VAR query is equal to PF query uh

486
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,400
with a class name of

487
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,720
pars selfhosted

488
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,080
uh and essentially then just say um

489
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,360
[Applause]

490
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,960
query. find objects again I'm going to

491
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,919
forcefully try this uh and I'm going to

492
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,640
print it out as

493
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,000
