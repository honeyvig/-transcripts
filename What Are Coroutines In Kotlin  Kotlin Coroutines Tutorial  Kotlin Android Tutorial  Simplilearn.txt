hey guys welcome back to another video
tutorial by simply learn
in today's session we will be learning
about kotlin core routines
so let's go ahead and understand what's
in it for you
so in this tutorial first we will
understand
threads
then we will learn what is co routines
after that we will understand the
features of co-routine and also we'll
have a look at an example of it
and at last we will learn some of the
basics of co routines
so without further ado let's get started
but before we begin

so
what are threads
to understand core routines in detail
first we will have to understand the
threads
so let's understand it a little
so the programs are just a set of
instructions
when a program runs a process is created
which contains
memory process id etc
in that process there are threads
that are used to execute information
every process has at least one thread or
more than one thread
threads
help with the high performance
applications and they work in a
sequential order one after the other
whenever a thread gets stuck while
running an instruction then the other
thread executes the rest of the
instructions
so these were threads
now as we have understood about threads
so let's learn about core routines
coroutines stands for cooperating
functions
the word co stands for cooperation and
routine stands for functions
the core routines can not only do all
the things that a thread can
but is also very efficient
coroutines are lightweight threads that
help to write simplified asynchronous
code that keeps the application
responsive while maintaining heavy tasks
like network
calls core routines are executed inside
the thread
and are also suspendable
here the word suspendable means we can
execute some instructions and then stop
the core routine in between the
execution and continue when we wish to
and they can also switch between the
threads which gives core routines and
edge over threads
so as we have understood about core
routines so now let's learn about some
features of core routine
so these are the features of kotlin co
routines
first one is
core routines are lightweight
due to the support for the suspension
we can run many core routines on a
single thread
which doesn't block the thread where the
core routine is running
core routine has a collection of threads
that can be used when required
when the task is done the thread is kept
back to the collection and reused when
needed
so this was the first feature
now moving on to the second feature
which is less memory leaks
there are very less memory leaks in
kotlin
because of the structured concurrency
the kotlin coroutines follow the
structured concurrency
this structured concurrency means the
new quarantine can only be launched in a
particular coroutine scope which sets
the lifetime of the core routine
during the implementation a large number
of core routines are launched and the
structure concurrency take care of those
so that they are not lost or leaked
so as a second feature
next is built-in cancellation support
cancellation in coroutine is interactive
in order to be cancellable a co-routine
must be cooperative
but
if it is not cooperative then it will
wait for the core routine to finish
there are two ways to make a core
routine cancellable
one
through using suspending functions
through cortland dot co routines like
delay function yield function etc
these were cancellable
and second using coroutine scope dot is
active boolean flag
there can be many reasons to cancel a
co-routine and also a co-routine cannot
be cancelled if it is working in
computation
now moving on to the last feature that
is jet pack integration
there are many libraries of jetpack that
provide support for core routines for
example android ktx is a set of cortland
extensions that provide android platform
and other apis etc the jetpack is
basically a collection of android
development components that helps in
building android apps and making complex
things
simple and easy
these were some features of coroutine
now let's understand an example of core
routine
but before that we have to understand
some terms of core routines which are
launch delay and run blocking
first is launch
now launch is a co-routine builder
launches a new co routine concurrently
that is without blocking the current
thread
it is automatically cancelled when the
resulting job is cancelled
and it doesn't return any result
now next is delay
delay is a suspending function
which is used to suspend a function for
a particular time and resumes it after
that time
it doesn't really block the underlying
thread but allows the other co-routines
to run and use the underlying thread
also it is a cancelable function then
there is run blocking
run blocking is a coroutine builder
again
it basically runs a new core routine and
blocks the current thread until its
completion
or in other words the thread that runs
in it gets blocked for the given
duration until all the code blocks
inside the brackets of run block
complete their execution
now
as you can see in this example
here the run blocking refer to the
thread that runs it
that is the main thread
it is the scope of the core routine
launch
here launch will launch a new core
routine concurrently
then there is delay
delay will suspend the core routine for
a selected time
here that selected time is 2 seconds
by default the time is in milliseconds
now here the word sam will be printed
after
my name is
because of the time delay for 2 seconds
on printing it
it will display my name is sam
let's take this example on kotlin
playground
here it is here we have written that
example here we can see there is a delay
of
2000 l that is 2000 millisecond which is
equal to 2 seconds
so that is why my name is printed
earlier then sam is getting printed
let's run it and let's check the output
as you can see my name is sam is getting
printed because we have delayed this sam
for a like for like two seconds
and now we'll use delay here
okay
let's say
three seconds
three thousand milliseconds
which is equal to three seconds
so as you can see there's a delay of two
seconds here is the delay of three
seconds
now what will happen is
sam will print first after that my name
is printed
as you can see sam my name is
so
i want to show you that how this delay
function work
because here the delay is now three
seconds which is greater than two
seconds that is why my name is getting
printed later
now
moving on to the next topic which is
basics of core routine
so first is scope builder
the core routine scope is used to
declare your own scope
unlike run blocking it just suspends and
releases the threads underlined
it is used to set the scope for new core
routines
coroutine scope is responsible for
controlling the life cycle of a group of
core routines and their context
scopes wait for their associated core
routines to complete before completing
themselves
the core routine builder is an extension
of coroutine scope
now next is explicit job
a job object is returned by launch co
routine builder
whose task is to explicitly wait for the
child quality completion
jobs acts as a handle to the core
routine in the queue
for every co routine that is created it
returns a job instance which identifies
the core routine uniquely and manages
its life cycle
then there is suspending functions
suspending functions are those functions
that can be paused and then continued
later
they can be used inside the coroutines
and can use other suspending functions
as well
they are used for long-running
operations and wait for it to complete
without blocking
the syntax of suspending functions is
same as that of the normal function
but with the addition of suspended
keyword
so these were some basics of coroutine
and with that we have come to the end of
