00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,810
in fact this here's Tyrion joining us

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,390
our first guests on the a hi cafe series

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,539
I actually created a video with him and

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,869
one of my other mentors Tim Duncan

6
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,369
some time ago about artificial

7
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,579
intelligence even Watson that was really

8
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,899
really interesting but luckily he's back

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,430
in Toronto and rabl to make another

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,020
video about something really fundamental

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,730
with artificial intelligence which is

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,030
the fact that pattern detection that our

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,070
visual intelligence is not artificial

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,239
intelligence oh yes absolutely yes my

15
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,829
name is Jerry Dammers here with our

16
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,899
ecosystem and 10 million I've been

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,820
working for a little while together we

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,559
were having fun actually it was a

19
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,110
pattern detection and in fact and I

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,150
without pattern detection it's just that

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,710
I got exactly and we're gonna change

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,270
things down exactly what we're going to

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,760
talk about we're going to have one of

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,220
those conversations that doesn't involve

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,009
keyboard it's kind of human and we're

26
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,680
talking about neural networks patterning

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
detection and what it means and what not

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,970
and how useful is it but but

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,610
fundamentally you can understand that it

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,680
is the core isn't it exactly well now

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,210
what that pattern detection there's no

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,040
point to a guy on first place that's

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,290
right and it even goes deeper than that

34
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,939
and and this is what's gonna be fun

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,950
about this this new series cafe right

36
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,030
yes is that we can talk about it and we

37
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,549
Caffe belong in this case week we're

38
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,010
gonna turn this guy and and allow the

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,830
analog device to get all right like the

40
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,330
other analog device which is our brain

41
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,030
and so fundamental to pattern detection

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,869
is our ability to as humans or any any

43
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,690
cognitive organism for that matter to

44
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,640
detect patterns in patterns create

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,920
memories right exactly and then when the

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,500
pattern changes what happens well you

47
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,319
say what's happening exactly and that's

48
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,750
the biggest thing so I've got a pattern

49
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,420
that changes what's happening well isn't

50
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,070
that what people are trying to really

51
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,060
find out isn't that what makes us aware

52
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,989
it's a VAR environment exactly

53
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,310
so isn't it fun to think that actually

54
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,860
today we have technology was AI that is

55
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,500
based on that fundamental belief or that

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,090
fundamental principle I should say then

57
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,590
we have to believe in it right but it's

58
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,330
a fundamental principle yeah that in

59
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,110
fact a pattern when we absorb when we

60
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,360
move through life or when a system moves

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,810
through data right we observe pattern

62
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,190
and the beauty was there's no network

63
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,519
nai is that as we move through the data

64
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,329
or as we move through life we remember

65
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:55,579
right and we observe that there is that

66
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,380
there is a reoccurring pattern and

67
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,970
what's interesting about it is that if

68
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,380
it's recurring it's soothing and it

69
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,959
doesn't matter who you are and then you

70
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,030
but what happens when the pattern always

71
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,829
occurs it's always the same time in

72
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:14,000
order it's boring exactly what you

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,980
expected it's what you know exactly

74
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,620
right so so we can we can go talk about

75
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,450
this about

76
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,099
are you of it Howard I pleasant

77
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,470
technology if you want you know bring

78
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,030
the analogy around an or network around

79
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,769
the wonderful work that you do or some

80
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,239
of the project to work out the cognitive

81
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,170
projects but besides that project alone

82
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,069
you know yeah how do you say okay great

83
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,080
I'm doing who's that

84
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,510
how do you bring it in to a point where

85
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,130
people understand and how can you

86
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,170
express that's a no-no really what we're

87
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,880
doing here is pattern detection exactly

88
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:54,160
all right so one of the projects that of

89
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,450
course we're actually collaborating on

90
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,549
is called the cognitive story may have

91
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,799
heard of it before it's basically a

92
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,269
project where I first of all I mean

93
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,829
generally we're trying to use AI to

94
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:04,720
enhance people's lives but our first

95
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
goal is to actually help out a

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,230
quadriplegic girl so as I mentioned

97
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,790
she's spotted a jerk unfortunately

98
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,799
suffers from Rhett syndrome meaning she

99
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,720
cannot communicate whatsoever if she's

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,790
you know thirsty or hungry or wants go

101
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,590
to the washroom

102
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,889
her mom has to make good informed guess

103
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,370
as to what Boo is trying to lie so there

104
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,820
you go

105
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,530
so why does she can she make a guess

106
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,690
because she's able to recognize those

107
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,910
paths there you go exactly that's it and

108
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,240
so what works like to do that is see how

109
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,240
can we unlock more data to gather

110
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,229
pirates fun

111
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:43,000
well booze mom is looking at while she

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,020
was trying to understand what who's

113
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,120
talking about if she said okay how is

114
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,710
boom moving what's the time of the day

115
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,789
when it's the context so it's a

116
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,380
situation like she's looking at all

117
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,760
these different variables which might

118
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,260
indicate towards what we was trying to

119
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,000
mention and these are the different

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,229
types of patterns that she's working at

121
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,720
recognizing but there are lots of more

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,060
patterns that she is a human cannot

123
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,740
recognize because us humans are

124
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,050
sometimes bias towards symbol repeatable

125
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,789
patterns correct we can't look through

126
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:07,879
vast amounts of

127
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,039
flex noise and noise data and say hey

128
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,319
this is a pattern correct but artificial

129
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,990
neural networks okay and so that's why

130
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,629
we're actually trying to use

131
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:19,369
electroencephalogram handsets and deep

132
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:21,080
learning algorithms to actually

133
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,080
recognize patterns in lose EEG brain

134
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,879
waves when she's trying to answer a

135
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,860
question and see if we can convert those

136
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,589
brain waves to actual intent or what she

137
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:32,300
wants to do and that's a perfect example

138
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,219
of how we're actually detecting quite

139
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,929
literally patterns in her brain waves

140
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:38,479
even though it's so noisy these neural

141
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,490
networks have relatively easy time

142
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,889
finding patterns in such a noisy and

143
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,629
fast amounts of data because they're

144
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,849
able to see repeatable yet changing

145
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,919
patterns throughout all the data it's

146
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,169
exactly right and what's fascinating but

147
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,269
when you bring in in that context they

148
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,729
say okay so the technology is reading

149
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,219
the signal that mean us as human we're

150
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:00,259
not capable of reading exactly so you're

151
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,029
complimenting and what I love about what

152
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,469
you said is that you're complimenting

153
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:06,679
what we call me if you won't be the

154
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,809
person who the intimate interpreter is

155
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:10,879
what we call bird on research right so

156
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,499
the mom is the intimate interpreter you

157
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:16,430
say today if it's daytime depending on

158
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,110
the weather

159
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,149
bunch of vectors exact hole that she's

160
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,309
observed she's able to correlate them

161
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,709
and says oh observing your child it's

162
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,180
based on the patterns of knowing how she

163
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,189
behaves if she Krantz is she looks a

164
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,809
certain way she knows that what's

165
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:32,539
beautiful but but the project is that

166
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,569
now we're saying patterns we don't see

167
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,269
the computer can see inside and then it

168
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,009
brings them in and it adds a new

169
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,769
dimension right and then when the

170
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,300
pattern is different but a pattern

171
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,360
changes let's say in conjunction was her

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,959
wanting to eat her being you know

173
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,579
nothing comfortable or wanting to watch

174
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,929
your teeth and somebody's in the way

175
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:54,740
like it happened

176
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,200
yeah I was there he said she there was a

177
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,890
reaction that in conjunction with the

178
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,920
data gives us the ability to take that

179
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,080
cognitive component that we all take for

180
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,840
granted and put it in assistant that can

181
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,450
assist her that's the augmentation right

182
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:25,190
there right we're limited by the amount

183
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,440
of data that we can take in and how we

184
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,050
can take in that data we humans are only

185
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,790
good taking in data with you know the

186
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:42,920
senses that we have listed numbers you

187
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,330
would never understand I mean you know

188
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,730
we'll try our best and visualize in your

189
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,340
head you would understand it but it's so

190
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,380
much easier for me to show you a graph

191
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,600
and you will immediately understand what

192
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,630
we're doing with something as complex as

193
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,700
EEG brain waves we cannot do that we

194
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,530
cannot have you just look at a graph of

195
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,450
the EEG brain waves and say okay do see

196
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,310
a pattern in these is the fact that

197
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,950
they're so complex they are literally

198
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,720
dependent on each other all the

199
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,390
individual data points to find out and

200
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,370
that's exactly correct and this is the

201
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,710
correlation that gives it sense it's

202
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,420
alright because I can look at a pattern

203
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,310
I kid I'm gonna be able to recognize it

204
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,050
but what I see a change if I cannot

205
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,820
correlate it with something else it's

206
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,130
meaningless and so on so you take this

207
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,990
in the context of business and market

208
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,970
fluctuation and whatnot and when we use

209
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,620
all these wonderful techniques to do

210
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,400
pattern detection we're looking at the

211
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,810
single streams of data

212
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,479
factors right and we're saying one of

213
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
the patterns so the system can learn the

214
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,620
pattern right and in its creat what it

215
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,750
creates in aggregate it creates a

216
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,600
collective I would say set of neural

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,150
pathways right all right and patterns

218
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,920
and then we're looking at this and say

219
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,230
ok with something changes changes what

220
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,089
happens next and that's what people in

221
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,130
business usually look for into business

222
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,290
intelligence and competitors for

223
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,180
instance a pattern like hey look

224
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,860
everybody and Twitter of my competitors

225
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,779
competitor

226
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,420
yeah well that's meaningful but if I

227
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,000
didn't understand the actual pattern how

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,350
would I have been awarded to what I

229
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,480
don't know exactly right and that's

230
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,010
where it's beautiful that's that's the

231
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,430
trigger

232
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,500
exactly so now we can do it this more

233
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,900
thing than just the limitation of your

234
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,150
physicality and my physicality in the

235
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,040
same room exactly right the burden would

236
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,630
show up over here it would be this

237
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,279
person to the pattern with very thick

238
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
even if you were standing over there

239
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,720
exactly so the system's unified that

240
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,170
improves decision dramatically in fact

241
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,400
artificial intelligence because the fact

242
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,290
that is running on technology has some

243
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,030
advantages that we humans can never have

244
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,820
mm-hmm good or drunk okay

245
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,410
this is basically a huge paddock

246
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:10,650
elimination problem if we do if we want

247
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,660
to do it actually but the thing is

248
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,160
driving me sometimes distracting person

249
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,740
why because the thing is our birth

250
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,260
family focus on so many things at once

251
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,070
yes our brains can't focus on 50 things

252
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,500
at once we can look you know in front of

253
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,000
us we can rearview mirror we can see

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,130
other nears we can see what speed we're

255
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,230
going to look at the GPS so many things

256
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,850
to look at so many things to cordoned

257
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,360
okay a pretty good job but this is our

258
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,960
machine is coming machines

259
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,420
cars so much better than us because they

260
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,860
can take a look at all the data points

261
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,830
make meaningful pattern recognition

262
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,710
alpha yes and then from there take

263
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,210
everything that it's seeing in

264
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,860
conjunction and then make a decision

265
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,210
because their full attention

266
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,620
exactly they have full attention

267
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,360
everywhere because they are capable of

268
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,640
making full attention every single data

269
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,500
point in your honor to go to your

270
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,970
example and somebody drives a car they

271
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,010
are used to seeing traffic around them

272
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,840
they were used to seeing people so it's

273
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,300
actually it becomes subconscious in a

274
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,910
way so their attention is only related

275
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,890
to the immediate decision after mating

276
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,110
and if something interferes exactly

277
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,620
right and systems are much more open to

278
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,840
the very largest right this is

279
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,700
interesting but you see this this is

280
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,260
where I think that the competition on

281
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,490
the pattern detection is very meaningful

282
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,710
because when people people talk about AI

283
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,210
who talk about natural language

284
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,240
processing oh no that's bad well it's

285
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,050
arbitrary

286
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,730
I mean think of it this way the world

287
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,710
around us yeah the world the natural

288
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,740
world shows patterns Laurens

289
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,400
demonstrated it was the strange

290
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,380
attractor where you know in a closed

291
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,240
environment that is highly dynamic we're

292
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,430
able to observe patterns exactly oh it's

293
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,940
no different this is one of the things i

294
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,010
postulate at all there was no difference

295
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,110
between the closed environment of nature

296
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,030
and the closed environment of human

297
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,390
cognitive right so the information or

298
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,280
the elements in that chaotic environment

299
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,380
of these feel patters yes right and

300
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,120
their computers now because we capture

301
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,160
so much of our firm ation is what is our

302
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,329
information when we

303
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,059
it's an intent exactly and we have an

304
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,649
intent in order to those because we

305
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:16,759
observe something and yeah and

306
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,649
communicated or we have an intent to

307
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,329
achieve something it's better that's why

308
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,089
we put it in the digital format

309
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,019
especially with unstructured data oh

310
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,709
yeah what more wonderful thing to do

311
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,709
then capture the intents of human

312
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,649
expression and analyze the pattern how

313
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,019
concepts evolve in the company in

314
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,569
collective memories these actually I

315
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:40,429
mean how cool is that and this is the

316
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:43,069
work we love to do I'm going to take all

317
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:44,660
the information you have I'm going to

318
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,689
slice it and correlate it and show the

319
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,730
patterns of your content show the story

320
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,009
you collect a story when you said about

321
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:55,100
the car examples it's exactly the same

322
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,019
because we're saying I'm not aware of

323
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,699
everything I'm not dismissing anything

324
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,589
and the thing is what I'm saying

325
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,569
okay we were trained by this one drivers

326
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:05,389
this is now my driving style what am i

327
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:07,069
able to do is it able to take say a

328
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,769
hundred drivers of its loading or maybe

329
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:12,709
200 300 drivers yes and each one before

330
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,299
I see how hundreds of hours of driving

331
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,730
data we're not telling machine ok

332
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,259
because the roads curving and these

333
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,970
would be the reason right this is how

334
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,779
you're gonna turn the steering wheel no

335
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:25,459
we're not able to do we're teaching it

336
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,379
we're giving all the data from these

337
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,089
drivers and saying learn how to drive

338
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:31,129
and it's implicit or lies all those

339
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,470
patterns it's not learning one specific

340
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,850
driving style look for example if you're

341
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,439
a human you're taught how to drive you

342
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,929
will learn a specific driving style with

343
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:41,239
AI we can look at all these data points

344
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,519
and find patterns among all of them and

345
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,529
say okay this is the average way to

346
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,619
drive the proper way to drive at least

347
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,049
this is how most units which are thank

348
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,970
you if you have any right and this is

349
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,619
why pattern detection is fundamental

350
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,230
when we talk about

351
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,940
because I mean one thing people look at

352
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,709
our special intelligence with respect to

353
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,870
human interface right now if you can't

354
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,300
fool me you know to think that a

355
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,910
computer can reason and I can say a lot

356
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,290
of this computer can reason therefore

357
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,790
it's artificial intelligence this is

358
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,730
where people are fiction their reality

359
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,740
is it's much wrong simple so what I'm

360
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,339
talking about this to me we demystified

361
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,029
for people

362
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,880
what a I really is because we're telling

363
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,009
this is fundamental this is a more

364
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,829
organic property of any company that

365
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:29,500
organism and we can do the same thing

366
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,899
with technology when you take it from

367
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,220
there I mean doesn't that simplify a

368
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,399
conversation in fact you could just say

369
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,620
artificial intelligence it's basically

370
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,300
just a huge pattern recognition problem

371
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,279
in general we're trying to give an

372
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,589
abstract and huge amounts of data and

373
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,779
see how can we find a specific patterns

374
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:54,149
that allow us to achieve this end result

375
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:11,260
there's also things like okay let's take

376
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,180
a look at the entire history here and

377
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,220
see when this similar type of pattern

378
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,500
has happened what usually happens after

379
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,060
this no longer a linear regression right

380
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,130
sorry it's a lot more interesting a lot

381
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,930
more organic exactly because you say

382
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,970
hello that the stock market is a human

383
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,980
invention so human extraction exactly

384
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,319
like for example with artificial

385
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,089
intelligence we're trying to emulate

386
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:40,889
things like empathy in humans computers

387
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:46,920
we cannot emulate things like

388
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,770
I should understand things like your

389
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,570
personality we can understand it's a

390
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,240
sentiment with which you're talking for

391
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,370
example let's just say that you're you

392
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,660
know tweeting about something that's

393
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,130
just saying that your entire company is

394
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,420
receiving millions or hundreds of

395
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,940
thousands of tweets we're filters here

396
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,040
whenever you say okay well this specific

397
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,650
keyword what sentiment attached this

398
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:25,010
keyword okay what types of catters allow

399
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,140
us to say okay the sentiment would this

400
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,240
is positive or negative or people are

401
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,340
angry or fearful and you're right and

402
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,170
this is complex any of you you've seen

403
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,580
this before you've seen people who do

404
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,950
like sentiment analysis on Twitter all

405
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,720
the time say hey what do they do they

406
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,760
simply use terms yeah then they said

407
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,650
this is positive this is negative this

408
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,740
is not this is so deterministic it has

409
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,990
no flexibility and you know people will

410
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,570
use certain language if in a positive

411
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,000
context when we for most of the people

412
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,130
that language is unacceptable in seen as

413
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,560
negative Zack how do you learn you know

414
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,320
so you have to inject disability in the

415
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,540
system so to learn and to give you

416
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,480
insight and then from there it's not

417
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,700
just that one time learning it is you

418
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,400
learn once you have base knowledge now

419
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,990
you're working on top of that building

420
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,570
more and more and more knowledge as you

421
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,670
go as you want inference or training

422
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:25,760
more and more as you drop okay you're

423
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,590
about to get into an accident learn from

424
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,150
that you learn that okay I shouldn't do

425
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,680
this one I should do this are you

426
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,720
telling me that companies will invest in

427
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,190
a

428
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,740
have to embrace the idea that it is good

429
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,850
to observe mistakes absolutely go you

430
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,090
guys got that this is true right you

431
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,210
have it's a learning system it is such a

432
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,550
beauty I mean think about it the

433
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,500
projects are on a college in health care

434
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,840
you know helping Diagnostics I mean it's

435
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,850
all pattern detection and validation by

436
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,800
professional if somebody asked me this

437
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,100
what is it we throw all of this data

438
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,590
into into the bucket into Watson and we

439
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,480
wanted to answer a completely arbitrary

440
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,970
question without proper training right

441
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,120
so that interaction to just is it it's

442
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,980
at home does it take for a human being

443
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,260
to learn to be a doctor

444
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,820
why would you expect a bunch of trial

445
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,960
and error okay when you put that into a

446
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,910
system you expect the system to do a

447
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,670
better job than a human being but number

448
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,040
two you gotta look and say well what is

449
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,470
the value of having trained assistants

450
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,910
spend perhaps billions of dollars

451
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,140
training your system exactly morning now

452
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,110
I can bring that knowledge into areas in

453
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,060
the world where thousands of

454
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,700
professionals can benefit from it you

455
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,150
tell me all valuable about this right

456
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,390
now

457
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,230
Oh cancer specialists sort of diagnosis

458
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,530
or you know treatment of cancer okay

459
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,750
they're all getting their own experience

460
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,240
they're all gaining their own individual

461
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,130
knowledge with every single diagnosis

462
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,770
and treatment I know where you're going

463
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,250
what happens we can have one single

464
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,830
cloud that has all the experience all

465
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,470
the knowledge so every time saying

466
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,510
someone's diagnosed in Canada

467
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,780
someone in Dubai can benefit from that

468
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,910
knowledge yes an entirely different

469
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,470
doctor entirely different Hospital

470
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,300
entirely different method but still

471
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,980
they're benefitting from the fact that

472
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,740
someone in Canada was treated by are you

473
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,670
telling me here that we can build

474
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,500
collective knowledge and benefit from it

475
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,900
quite literally yes there you go and

476
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,910
that's beautiful because as humans right

477
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,560
we can you talk about

478
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,100
right our organism our system is unified

479
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,260
in order to be stronger I mean build

480
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,140
city to be stronger we build Network and

481
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,010
you know it's beautiful

482
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,990
just like you all network just like that

483
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,440
all right it's funny how every time two

484
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,350
entities can communicate the sum of the

485
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,770
value is higher can you imagine I mean

486
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,020
the whole reality as well is that call

487
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,300
connected devices the fact that they're

488
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,640
connected give them their own governance

489
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,730
that only a cognitive awareness that we

490
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,230
don't need to comprehend as a difficult

491
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,580
like to simulate other cells in your

492
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,680
body little 10 is 10 what you're

493
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,270
thinking but they're participating in

494
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:24,100
the equation exactly every more official

495
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,450
cognitive system because it's it's but

496
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,700
it's negative so now we're unifying this

497
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,930
is what I always just said this

498
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,480
knowledge is converging we're gonna find

499
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
in technologies enabler exactly if you

500
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,980
take a look at this why are you in so

501
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,200
great it's because we can communicate

502
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
with each other in such a natural way

503
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,380
and we can actually transfer knowledge

504
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,470
of one person to other really quickly

505
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,670
but it's a common trail right that's why

506
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,620
the user so great

507
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,030
preserving knowledge for literally years

508
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,010
and you know gaining experience but this

509
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,080
meeting is not some limited mmm all

510
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
right as I mentioned going back to the

511
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,560
example can undo if you can't talk to

512
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,000
learn something in camera but it teaches

513
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,440
a few other doctors limit

514
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,200
those doctors go everything to each but

515
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,690
with AI that's not limited at all what

516
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,460
if we could take the fact that humans

517
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,509
can communicate with each other and

518
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:20,159
share their knowledge to the next level

519
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,200
what if we can make it set behind this

520
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,320
need to share knowledge gets just one

521
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,419
individual AI that does cancer treatment

522
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,669
diagnosis right Enix for it is the sum

523
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:31,379
of all the knowledge all the knowledge

524
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:35,370
every single honesty I mean everybody's

525
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,899
got to realize this is when we talk

526
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:38,639
about pattern detection looking L arche

527
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:40,440
I said defective the system can remember

528
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,210
oh the fact that the system can

529
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,250
aggregate defected the loop feedback

530
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,740
that the learning mechanism improves I

531
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,460
mean and I want to be metaphysical my

532
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,639
buddy but we are capturing the the in in

533
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:56,039
a very sustainable and long-term way the

534
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,889
essence of human cognitive and capacity

535
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:01,110
exactly for the service of humans oh

536
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,090
yeah you know and this is what's

537
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,269
fantastic so back to the beginning here

538
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:09,330
right yes parent detection fundamental

539
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,360
we do it organically technology enables

540
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,230
us to actually go act on it and

541
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,179
convergent when the pattern changes when

542
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,179
something is different if we can act on

543
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,360
it

544
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,580
[Laughter]

545
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,480
[Laughter]

546
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,760
over many years they've gathered

547
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,080
experience these are the stocks made to

548
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,230
buy sell they've learned how to

549
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,830
recognize patterns yes but the thing is

550
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,260
the only problem is it's limited to that

551
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,120
individual

552
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,419
they cannot completely distill all of

553
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,100
that knowledge that they have and give

554
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,309
it to another person true exactly so

555
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,679
what if we would have used AI to do

556
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,780
automatics in fact in the u.s. I believe

557
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,020
over 70% of stock trading done on us

558
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,190
bought in 2014 was all done by boss yeah

559
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,600
yeah so what if one central AI that

560
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,850
eventually learns all these patterns

561
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,500
it doesn't need to share any knowledge

562
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,840
or otherwise it's just one AI that

563
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,540
continuously learns and that's the AI

564
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,190
want to keep in a box in a basement

565
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,490
right and I throw some voltage at it and

566
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,220
because that's the distinction

567
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,440
unfortunately you know are we still

568
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,770
operate around a model of failures and

569
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,929
success to solve and necessity is a

570
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,179
necessity right I mean otherwise we will

571
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,010
be doing what we're told today but the

572
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,179
point is what you say you're absolutely

573
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,220
right if this was knowledge what I think

574
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,160
that think the expert in your case yeah

575
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,650
and then you bring the insight and you

576
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,809
reveal the patterns of data you reveal

577
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,860
the anomalies and you turn that into

578
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,970
something that they can use to make

579
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,919
better decision to give them a

580
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,540
competitive

581
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,910
now the same way that we talk about

582
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,670
normalizing patterns and not can you

583
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,380
imagine if everybody had the same tool

584
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,420
to market who no longer be a market oh

585
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,979
[Music]

586
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,180
yeah in the seats of purpose but the

587
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,230
example is absolutely right because

588
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,210
eventually this is what can happen

589
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,620
because of so this is fun so we have we

590
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,940
have a lot of example we could be

591
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,260
talking about the time he was talk

592
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,580
marketer talking about healthcare

593
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,580
talking about driving cars talking about

594
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,440
collective knowledge of looking at the

595
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,360
movement of memories in the organization

596
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,890
you know a thank you a great example

597
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,020
when you talk about as convergence its

598
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,360
two entities mergers and acquisition one

599
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,400
company has all this data all this

600
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,380
knowledge and can abstract it to make it

601
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,650
useful and find it inaccessible and then

602
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,920
you have another company who's got like

603
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,810
they just acquired it and something over

604
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,900
here happens that is unusual and guess

605
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,520
what it matches with something over here

606
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,190
that happened ten years ago you can drop

607
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,380
just like your memories yeah I can draw

608
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,610
from that knowledge check when I see

609
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,530
this it reminds me when my mom used to

610
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:49,080
make eggs five-minute eggs like this I

611
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,360
mean that's my was done right so my

612
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,890
correlation was this is most probably

613
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:58,050
different than yours so so the fact is

614
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,000
that uncorrelated that same thing was

615
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,650
Enterprise easy they acquire this

616
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,780
knowledge is collective and they can

617
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,130
bring it out and say well this is

618
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,540
meaningful for me right now I do a

619
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,340
virtual an acquisition gosh I didn't

620
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,510
know that you did stuff stem-cell

621
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,580
research 20 years ago the government

622
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,390
rules change

623
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,340
that's an emerging pattern exactly to

624
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,070
change well can we match that change as

625
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,590
a memory has a trigger to see what we

626
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,430
did in the past

627
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,590
and elevate all the entities associated

628
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,630
with it that's what we do every day

629
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,110
one can organs

630
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,870
it was actually the data the store in

631
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,519
your archives which to me you know what

632
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,370
it is is a graveyard of knowledge

633
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:39,370
graveyard it's silly look it was the

634
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,250
reality of things you know no it changes

635
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,559
haven't changed Diebold was technology

636
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,510
c'est moi maybe there's something I can

637
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,880
really do with say exactly its values in

638
00:26:48,880 --> 00:27:03,029
there first of all cancer yes there is

639
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:14,950
humans cannot keep physically impossible

640
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,570
for us to read through all of that and

641
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,519
not just read through it but understand

642
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:20,080
all of it and apply it to make you

643
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,730
exactly yeah but technology it can only

644
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,500
store all that information but with AI

645
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,159
not only do we store that info we make

646
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,539
sense of it and use it can take all the

647
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:36,610
important stuff that we're going through

648
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,309
all the important stuff that we create

649
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,529
and then understand it and make use of

650
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:43,899
atoms interact with is very natural

651
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:45,669
exactly and that's bird can go ahead and

652
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:47,559
ask a question and it'll get done in

653
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,000
semesters based on the analysis it's

654
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,480
brilliant it is really and also another

655
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,940
great example which relates to this it's

656
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,190
actually

657
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,480
put a link to that in the description

658
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,769
about I believe with mining or password

659
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,179
and so what they were thinking doing is

660
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,730
collaborating with IBM and actually

661
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,500
taking most of their knowledge bases

662
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,539
most the knowledge sense you know

663
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,250
feeding it to Watson and they're placing

664
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,809
a good fraction of their workforce just

665
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:18,269
just like that okay mm-hmm but what they

666
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:21,360
found out was that related to the

667
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,090
equation the movie workers they added

668
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,299
war because they realize exactly what

669
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,370
they realize is that we don't need to

670
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,679
mess trick that with IRA people because

671
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,809
not all of our workers knowledge

672
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,000
knowledge an easy way hey I will take

673
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,529
all that knowledge and distill it down

674
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,820
make it so easy for us humans to access

675
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,559
them in fact especially the oil industry

676
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,700
I think you're talking about the example

677
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,500
and the oil rig and the deep-sea

678
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,690
exploration is that the one beliefs they

679
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,429
might be right but the beautiful part

680
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:55,080
about this and the oil industry is is

681
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,429
one company that used a lot of

682
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:58,980
contractors want you know depending on

683
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,269
the market and depending on other

684
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,669
resource allocations and they often lose

685
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:04,200
them and there's been a huge knowledge

686
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,970
attrition in this industry especially in

687
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,139
Louisiana Texas

688
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:08,909
you know it's a different move different

689
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:11,490
the different movement in the in the in

690
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,230
the price and the resources availability

691
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,179
and all that so these guys come in and

692
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,370
out you know and feel as it was a

693
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,019
knowledge denotes that they take off

694
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:21,570
notice so so knowledge knowledge

695
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,110
acquisition exploitation usage you know

696
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,269
in a way to remedy against now if you

697
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,710
Tricia is great but but here's the thing

698
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,429
that's fun

699
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:33,330
yes you know you used email how many

700
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,880
people say oh my gosh

701
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:45,200
place jobs we heard this but I'm fully

702
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,450
up to that in the description as well

703
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,250
but you know artificial intelligence is

704
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,770
one of the reasons that it's so hard to

705
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,440
develop with is because before I even

706
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:13,330
existed everyone expected exactly okay

707
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,100
[Laughter]

708
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,140
it doesn't mean that we will lose it

709
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,630
people we augment people we make them

710
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,640
more knowledgeable so they can make

711
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,130
better decisions that and it's true I

712
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,310
mean automation in the has taken a lot

713
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,750
of jobs with people I don't you know

714
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,640
what I think really is fine what it's

715
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,610
the people today and the fear about so

716
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,860
so before came a decision that affected

717
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,870
people who weren't into factories now

718
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,210
the making decision around the holiday

719
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,030
on their job somehow they feel that oh

720
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:54,650
my gosh so it's it's I think it's it's

721
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,460
it's it's humorous in some way but

722
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,570
fundamental back to what we're saying

723
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,030
yes and I think we're about to wrap up

724
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,730
this wonderful conversation this skeptic

725
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,730
I think we're about there

726
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,870
and I think we have about about just

727
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,230
this particular time so I think it's

728
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,760
important just for people to really

729
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,389
understand it is wonderful when an

730
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,720
organic model like pattern detection

731
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,419
like cognitive science is actually the

732
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,389
foundation of a technological

733
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:29,820
representation in abstraction and that

734
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,519
makes it intimate between us and the

735
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,289
technologies is the technology can start

736
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:36,840
to do things we expect ourselves to be

737
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,789
able to Jennifer what a wonderful

738
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:41,159
connection that represents oh yeah so

739
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,870
think of a I'm just but we were talking

740
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,000
about just stuffing a I'm without

741
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,519
pattern detection is not a I and embrace

742
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,010
it because what I'm truly believe that

743
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,460
it is a true transposition of something

744
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,830
that is innate in every one of us and it

745
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:01,799
only makes sense so that was the first

746
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,720
