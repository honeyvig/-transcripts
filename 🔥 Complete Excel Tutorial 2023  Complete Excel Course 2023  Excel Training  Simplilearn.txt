Interest so Microsoft Excel is a
software product designed and developed
by Microsoft is storing data in an
organized way that is rows and columns
and Microsoft Excel is also capable to
manipulate data through some
mathematical
operations followed by that Microsoft
Excel is also used to extract the
insights from the data and represent it
in the form of visually appealing graphs
and charts now we have a basic
understanding or an overview of what a
Microsoft Excel software product is now
moving ahead we will understand the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel so
following are some fundamentals that you
need to know before getting started with
Microsoft Excel so basically when you
install the Microsoft Office in your
computer you will have various Microsoft
products out of which Microsoft Excel is
one of the products so we will be
dealing exactly with that particular
product that is Microsoft Excel so when
you get started with Microsoft Excel
this is what you will see in the first
page so this particular page is called
as Microsoft Excel homepage where you
will be having various varieties of
sheets Microsoft Excel will give you
some suggestions based on the type of
sheet you want to work with we will see
this in a better way through the
Practical session so once you get
started with the sheet you will have
some more options so this particular
option is called as the toolbar menu you
will have the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so these are the tools that you
will be using using to work on your data
using Microsoft Excel furthermore we
have a toolbar ribbon so when you select
some or the other option from the file
home insert draw page layout formulas
data review View and help buttons you
will have a ribbon so for example you
can see that I have selected the Home
Tool here so when I press on the Home
Tool this is the ribbon which Microsoft
Excel gives me so this ribbon has some
options in it which can perform various
operations now in a further more
detailed way we will have toolbar groups
so when you see in the previous slide we
have a complete toolbar ribbon so this
particular ribbon is segmented into
groups so you can see the first group as
paste Cut Copy format painter etc etc
and the second group is the font the
size of the font and to increase the
size of the font to decrease the size of
the font bold italic underline etc etc
and here you can see the text alignment
so each and every group has separate
functions so each set is called as a
group and I think you can see a small
Arrow option over here so this Arrow
option is used into the toolbar groups
when the group is not able to fit all
the operations or all the
functionalities in one single provided
section so when you click on this
particular Arrow Mark you will have
another dialogue box so this is called
toolbar more options so you can see that
when I clicked on this icon you can see
a new dialogue box which opens me a new
set of operations which are not able to
be fit in this particular group so we
will also see more about this in a
better way in the Practical session now
moving forward we have cell and address
so when you open a Microsoft Excel sheet
you can find boxes so each and every box
is named as a cell and each cell has its
own address for example the highlighted
cell over here has an address B3 so B is
the column name and three is the rule
name and apart from that you can have
the sheet tracker in the bottom left
corner of the Excel sheet where you can
navigate through different sheets and in
the bottom right corner you have an
option of increasing or decreasing the
sheet size so these are the basic
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel that you
need to keep in mind before getting
started so we will have more on this in
the Practical session if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scale up by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
now we enter the demo inventory in
Microsoft Excel so we will be using
Microsoft Excel to create a sheet of the
employees in a company so basically an
employee in a company has employee ID
name and designation salary etc etc so
we will be trying to create the same
table using Microsoft Excel but before
that let us understand the fundamentals
of Microsoft Excel through the Practical
demo first so I have started my
Microsoft Excel ex and this is how the
homepage of Microsoft Excel looks like
so you have a blank workbook over here
if you want to create a new workbook you
can select new Option so Excel will
provide you with various variety of
sheets you can see money in Excel
adjustable meeting agenda streaming
showers small business cash flow and
many more if you're not able to find
what you're looking for then you always
have an option of selecting the
particular type of sheet what you're
looking for so you have various options
if it's business if it's personal it's
planners and trackers list budgets
charts etc etc so let's imagine that you
wanted something from business so just
by clicking at business option the Excel
will load a variety of sheets related to
business options so this might take a
while so you can see that the Excel is
loading few types of
sheets so you can see that Excel has
provided us with some online varieties
of sheets for example any calendar
business expenses Channel marketing
budget budget summary report blue
product list etc etc you can see
Construction proposal invoice your name
it Excel has CED so Excel will provide
you with some variety of options based
on your requirement now for this session
let's get started with a blank workbook
which looks something like this since
this tutorial is based on the
fundamentals we'll go with the blank
workbook now over here you can see the
toolbar that we discussed earlier that
has the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so this is the toolbar and under
the toolbar have selected home and you
can see this is the particular ribbon
what we discussed about this particular
ribbon belongs to homepage and when you
select file option you'll get back to
home and if you select insert option
you'll have another different ribbon
with different groups etc etc so every
particular tool has different ribbons in
them and remember the extra options that
we discussed when you press over this
Arrow key this is it so when you press
the arrow key you'll have few more
settings which cannot be fit in this
particular section of groups so you can
have some Vari of options over here of
changing the font changing some effects
to the text font size and font style etc
etc apart from this we have also
discussed about the cells in every sheet
so this particular cell has an address
so you can see the address over here
which is B3 so B happens to be the
column name and three happens to be the
row name now we also had a discussion
about the sheet tracker right now we
just have one sheet if you want multiple
sheets you can just feel free to select
on the plus option which will always
create you some extra sheets and you can
navigate through sheets just by pressing
on the sheet
name and when you get back to the bottom
right corner you have an option of
increasing and decreasing the cell size
or the sheet size now let's keep it
default with 100% now these are the few
fundamentals that you need to keep in
mind before getting started with
Microsoft Excel now that we know the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel let's
get started with a practical session
which is about the employe details in a
company
now let's select this particular cell
and let's type in employee
details yeah we have the cell now an
employee details table will have the
information related to employees so the
information will be about name it will
be about employee number
it will be the
designation and maybe
salary and maybe blood group as
well and uh let's take another one which
is phone
number
yeah so so far so good and uh you can
see that we have some problem with this
particular column the designation the
name uh the the name of the designation
is practically good but it is not
visible so when you uh when you're not
on that particular cell you can see that
the name is incomplete over here so you
can always fix that you can just you
know manually change the size of the row
or cell or you can also feel free to you
know double click on that cell which
will automatically you know set the size
of that particular cell and same goes to
the blood group just let's try to double
click on that and same goes to phone
number
great so you can see that the employees
details are just confined to the first
two cells it's supposed to be somewhere
in the middle right so no problem we can
do that as well we can select all the
cells and we have an option of merging
them you can just select this one which
will help with merging and centering
that particular data to the center part
so that's how we do it now let's get
started by adding the names of the
employees uh let's add the names
Joe
John uh Mary
Mark
Susan and
then
Jennifer let's type in
mic let's Ty in
them
Chef
Jeffrey yeah we have a couple of
employees now let's type in the employee
numbers
yeah we have the employee numbers now
let's type in the designation okay let's
shoot CH uh Joe to be the CEO of the
company and John as the software
developer and Mar as
tester Mark in
finance Susan also in
finance and Jennifer in
testing
and Mike in uh
marketing same goes for
Tim and again Jeffrey into software
development
and
uh Morgan into testing
again now let's click on C so that it
gets you know resized according to the
length of the text now it's done so
let's get into
salary uh
$10,000 and and
$115,000
and
$119,000 let's increase the salary of a
CEO so let's keep it $1
lakh and finance again
20,000
so yeah the salaries are allocated again
the blood
group
here we have the blood groups now let's
type in the mobile
numbers
[Music]
yeah now we have typed in some random
mobile numbers as well so uh yeah this
is how you can add in some data into
your table and now let us imagine that
you forgot to add or remove a column so
let's imagine that we wanted to add a
serial number as well but somehow we
forgot to add it now you can always add
a new row or column for example here we
wanted to add a new column so we just
have to right click on a select the
insert option here we have a new row now
now let's type in serial
number and let's type
one now can you see the small box option
over here if you just drag it you can
you know copy paste all those over here
and now let's right
click and fill series now we have the
employee number starting from 1 to 10
that's that's how you do it and apart
from this you you can also uh you know
change the font of the entire row you
can change the font to say uh aroni and
you can always also change the font and
same goes to the employ table you can
select it bold it and you can also
increase the size and again select a
color for the text maybe a different
color green would be
better and uh you can also select the
entire cells
and align them to the center looks more
good and you can select or double click
the row names so you'll have the proper
spacing between all the rows and columns
so we have double click on the column
right yeah so basically that's how you
make things happen now let's save this
so I'd like to go to the save option and
uh
data
let me save this in my local location
and just save it's done so that's how
you work on your Excel file with some
basic data and to learn more don't
forget to get subscribed to Simply
learns YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to stay updated so
you are the first person to get an
update on any technology not just Excel
now let's get back to the Practical mode
and now we are on our Excel spreadsheet
so here we have some text boxes on the
column A and on column V we have lower
and upper okay so um we have a mix of uh
uppercase and lower case in our text so
first we'll try to convert them to lower
case and then we'll try to convert the
entire text into upper case so for that
you need to press on equal symbol and
select the lower formula tap and you
selected the function and now click on
the cell A3 that's your cell address and
press on okay now all the letters are
converted to low case so we had J in the
uppercase which is converted to lower
case now all you can do is drag the
formula to all the cells and it will be
applied to all the cells right now let's
similarly try to convert into uppercase
and tab space and there you go you have
selected the formula now the cell
address press
enter and drag the same address I mean
drag the same formula to all the cell
addresses and the echo all the cells are
converted to uppercase now that's how
you convert the cells or data in Excel
to uppercase or lowercase in Excel now
we are on the Excel
spreadsheet now here we have some sales
data based on a store now what we're
going to do is we going to add some
multiple rows or a single Row in this
particular data so here you can see the
region wise category Wise statewise
subcategory Wise and their sales and
quantities right now let us imagine that
you must have to add a sale data here
right so let us imagine that on the row
7th you were supposed to add some detail
for example some technology related sale
happened on that day and you missed out
to add it right so how do you create a
new rule now so for example if multiple
sales happened on the same day like 3 to
four and you missed out them so how do I
add three to four rows in between the
existing data right so don't worry about
it it's completely simp simp all you
have to do is select the row and right
click and press on the option insert now
this will insert one single row if you
wanted to add one single U row or you
know toule and if you wanted to add
multiple rows for example you wanted to
add three rows Al together then it's
also simple all you have to do is select
three
rows and WR click and press on insert
and then you have three rows so there
you go go so that's how you add multiple
rows in a Excel spreadsheet or that's
how you add one single Row in an Excel
spreadsheet now we have started our
Excel worksheet and here you can see we
have employ details on our worksheet now
all of a sudden uh you wanted to add
employee second name as well or a last
name right so you are a beginner and you
don't know how to add a column or you
know you might be a little ambiguous
right so instead of using this simple
step you might end up creating a whole
new sheet or maybe other approaches as
well which are time consuming so let me
give you this simple step all you have
to do is select the column so here you
wanted to add a last name right so B is
your column with the first name and here
you wanted to add a second name or the
last name which is in between the
columns B and C so remember that Excel
adds a column always towards the left
side of a column so here if I if you
wanted to add a column next to V then
you you want to select the column C and
right click and select the insert option
so that it can be added in between B and
C which is adjacent to B so let's look
at it right so you have added the next
uh column or a new column right next to
the column V and it's in between the
designation and employee name now you
can add your in a second name so that's
how you create a new column in Excel now
in case is if you wanted to you know
create multiple columns Al together so
uh here we have or here we needed a
second name also here you have a
designation and you wanted to add
another column which you know assigns
manages to the employees right so let's
delete it uh Delete the second column
and let me explain you how what I want
to do so here you wanted to add the
second name of the employee and also the
manager of these employees right so here
you wanted to add add two columns Al
together right uh and now you might be
wondering could I add two columns
together or will it work only for the
one column thing right no it works for
two columns and also more than two
columns altoe so you wanted to add two
columns here right so select the two
columns you can you can select or you
can click on the column C and hold that
left key and drag it along the right
side okay so here I've have selected two
columns and here let's three right so
you can see here uh it's 1 4856 76r
cross 3C that means you have selected
three columns if I navigate on the four
you can see we have selected four
columns right now right click and select
on insert and you'll have four columns
in between employee name and designation
now you might have to add your second
name manager's name manager employee ID
you know and the department everything
or you can add anything or any number of
columns in between the existing columns
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet now
you might want to you know add uh some
extension to your data since we have
sales here you might want to add the
dollar logo right so if you have like
five to 10 rows then it's easy but if
you have multiple rows then it might be
a little time consuming in such
scenarios you might want to select the
entire column right so how do you do
that in shortest method so there are
multiple methods to do it so the easiest
one the first and the easiest one is
clicking on the column number or column
name so here we have the column name
that is e and if you click on it the
entire column is selected and here we
have numbers so let us imagine that you
wanted to select the row number two
click on number two and you have all the
rows I mean the entire row selected all
the cells are
selected right so this is one way and
again
there is another way where you can just
you know uh click on the first table
header and press control spacebar so the
combination key is control space bar for
columns and if you want to select the
entire row it is shift space bar so this
is the method two and another method so
you might have a doubt here right so
when you click on the column name or
when you click on the row number the
entire row or entire column gets
selected right and you wanted to select
only the cells which have data so we
have another way for that so you can
select the cell now hold the control and
shift key and press the lower Arrow key
to select the entire column with cells
having data so there you go you have
selected all the cells in one single
column with only data and all the cells
which do not have data are not selected
same applies to rows as well control
shift right arrow key key or left Arrow
key based on your rows and all the rows
with data will be selected I mean all
the cells in a row are selected not the
entire row and U coming back to the
first question that is adding the dollar
symbol so here we have General so go to
the data type and add
currency so you have rupees here so
currently we are in India so we have
rupees now what is the advantage of
selecting the entire row when you don't
have any data in the 57th row or the
next cell
right I'll show you now let us add the
number 100 and press enter there you go
let us add another number like thousand
and press enter so the data formatting
is automatically applied to all the
cells so most of the time your cells or
the data sheet will be varying you might
have to add or remove elements or
numbers right so in such scenarios this
will be helpful now comparing two
different columns or multiple columns
happens to be an important job when
you're working in data anal analytics as
you have to come up with some decisive
decisions based on the data now if you
had to do it manually then you might end
up taking hours or even days based on
the data set you're working with but if
I say that you can do it within minutes
then it would be interesting to work
with right now we'll be doing the same
now we'll work on a sample data set
right on my screen so here we have
column 1 and column two now our job is
to compare the column 1 and column two
and come up with the result now the
first and the simplest way to do it is
use the built-in conditional formatting
which comes with Excel by default now
all you have to do is select all the
data and navigate to home and in the
home go to Styles group and select
conditional formatting and in
conditional formatting you can see
highlight cells so in that you can use
duplicate values when you click on
duplicate values a small pop-up window
will come on your screen and here you
have an option of choosing whether
duplicate or unique so duplicate means
you're comparing the cells and you can
see there are some duplicate cells which
are present in column one are also
present in column two now you can also
check how to uh you know find out the
unique values which are only present in
column 1 but not in column two so you
can just press unique and there you go
you can find it now you can also try to
you know change the color by filling
with green for the unique color and
duplicate cells with color red now this
was the first method and you can also
work out some different ones like uh you
can just directly uh press equal to and
select the cell and equals to and the
Excel press enter and if there is a
match it will give you true if there is
no match then it will give you false now
you can drag it down and see which all
are matching and which all are not now
you can also make make some minute
modifications to this so uh if in case
you didn't find the data then you can
say not found so for that uh you can try
if and inside brackets and then you can
give the value as not found if true it's
found first you have to give the True
Values so for true you can write it as
found and in case if it's not found then
you can write it down as not
found
there you go close the bracket press
enter and there you go if there is a
perfect match you will have found and if
there is no match then you'll get not
found now so far we have discussed uh
comparing two cells using conditional
formatting and also by using equals to
operator and trying to uh add some
tweaks to the equals to Operator by
involving with if operator and apart
from those we also have another way to
compare to columns in Excel so another
way is using the lookup functions so
we'll use a simple V lookup function to
compare both the cells so for that let's
type in equals to we
lookup space and um select the cell you
want to check for and then the range of
elements you want to uh compare and then
I'll press F4 to log them
now uh you want the data from column
one and now you want the exact match so
zero press enter so there you go so the
elements which are present in column 1
and column 2 are been displayed here so
but in case if the elements are not
found you'll get an error so let's look
at that simply drag the formula to all
the cells and there you go so the
Elements which are matching will give
you the proper result but the ones which
are not matching will give you not
applicable or error message this can be
fixed we can make some minor tweaks to
the same
formula so uh we can add if
error
comma simply write an as not
found
and close the bracket so that should do
so we have closed the bracket and press
enter there you go now simply drag this
and soon you can see the data which is
having no match is shown as not
found now uh there is another
possibility okay let's get back to
another different sheet so this should
work so so uh we we already have the
formula so let's erase that first I'll
erase the whole
data and even this
one yeah now we have the clear column
for so here you can see we have Ford
India and here you can see we have just
Ford and similarly here you have
Mahendra and Mahendra and here you have
Mahendra right so in some situations you
might have to compare two different
columns but the names might be a little
different right so for example uh if
you're working with Oracle and if you're
working with Oracle America and you have
in the first case is Oracle and in the
second column is Oracle America then
those are one and same but you have some
minor text changes right just like here
you have Fort India and here you have
Fort so what if you had such kind of
issues so you can also make some minor
tweaks to it so using the same lookup
formula you can add equals to we
lookup and also the comparison cell
which is this one and you're not you're
not stopping them you're trying to add
the wild card here so the wild card is
HRI which means if there is anything
like uh if you get the comparison
between the first cell and the second
cell which matches and if there is
anything extra rather than the actual
cell please try to consider it so that's
what we're going to do so after entering
entering the wild card symbol you'll
select the range of columns which you
have to uh you know fetch the data from
and then try to fix them using function
key
F4 you're looking from the column number
one and then you're finding the exact
match now we can close it and
enter now let's try to drag
it there you go so you have the data
Mahindra and Mahindra hindai India Honda
India so that's how you try to use uh
comparing cells in Excel now you can see
I'm on my Excel worksheet and I have one
table on my worksheet right now so you
can you know transposing or you know
converting rows to columns is a very
simple task I'll explain you in two
different ways so the first way select
all the sales that you have on your
sheet and press on contrl C so it will
give you the copy option and then you
can also paste in the same sheet or if
you want you can go to a whole new sheet
and select the paste option over here
but before selecting the actual paste
option you can see a small drop- down
icon click on that and navigate to paste
special and in this you can see
transpose option click on that or you
know make sure that it's checked and
press okay now you can see all your
columns have been converted into rows
and all your rows are converted into
columns so this was the first way and uh
what is the second way you ask me so
it's really simple select one cell
somewhere and you know you can or let's
create a new sheet as well so here you
can you know write down the formula as
transpose
and select the array which you want to
transpose so this is the array so
transpose is basically an array function
in Excel so once you are done with you
know selecting your data press enter
there you go so all your rows are now
columns and all your columns are now the
rows now on my spreadsheet you can see
some data which is the sales data of
quarterly basis and the four different
zones that is northwest southeast so you
can you know make things look better by
hiding these columns and if you hide
these columns it's critical for the end
user to identify which columns are
exactly hidden right to make things a
little easier for your end user you can
select the columns and then go to the
data option and in the data option click
on the group option so this will group
these columns and you will have the
symbol of minimization which will help
you hide these columns automatically and
un hiide these columns automatically now
let's also try to group GH J
columns and there you go now similarly
let's also try to group the rows of
North and rows of
West then you have the row of
South and rows of
East right now all these rows and
columns are been grouped now all you can
do is just click on the minimize button
and those will be minimized similarly
the rules right and to unhide them all
you can do is click on the plus icon and
they will be
unhidden you can also try to ungroup the
columns and rows all you have to do is
select the columns and click on the
ungroup option similarly the rows as
well
and that's how you can group and ungroup
rows and columns in Excel now we are on
our spreadsheet and you can see I have
some sample data on my spreadsheet and
it does have some blank rows now how do
I eliminate these blank rows so one step
is you can you know select the entire
row and try to right click and delete
it again this sort of method might take
hours to get rid of all the blank rows
and most of the the time you might end
up even selecting the rows with data in
it right so if I want to select multiple
rows then I'll be selecting some rows
with data as well which might be a
little Troublesome in the future now
let's try to use the easier way now for
that go to the find and select option
select the go to special option and in
that select the blanks option and press
okay now hold control key and press
minus key
and you will have an option of deleting
the cells now select the entire row now
we are selecting the entire rows with
blank data and press okay and the cells
will be shifted now this was simple but
let me show you another example so even
here we have some blank rows but in
between those blank rows for example
take cell 17 or cell D7 or row 17 we
have some data testing and here in the
employee ID we have some data in
a26 and again in b39 we have some data
that is first
name right in such scenarios how do I
eliminate data so we have a simple Logic
for it so all we need to do is add
another row which is to count the number
of cells in the row now that can be
count now here equals to the function is
Count
a let's
Tab and the cells will be from A2 to
G2 press enter now you have seven so now
we are basically calculating the number
of cells so if you apply the same to the
entire um data set let's drag
it
and there you go so there are certain
places where you find zero which are
basically the empty columns right now
let's do some formatting if you
need let's try to add
filters crl a contrl d and now table
will have it filters and
headers now here you can see the drop-
down icon click on that now instead of
select all what you can do is Select
zero now you will be highlighted with
all the rows which do not have any data
select all those and press on delete or
what you can do is the same way controll
minus there you go now
clear the
filter now all you have is the data
without any kind of blank rows so all
the rows that had some amount of data
are retrained and all the data or all
the cells or all the rowes which do not
have any data which are completely blank
they have been eliminated so here you
can see columns and rows so especially
the fourth row and the column C right so
uh currently we have data on our uh
spreadsheet and it is exceeding the
number of rows currently visible on our
screen right so when you scroll down you
can see that the header or the headers
of all the columns are getting vanished
or scrolled up along with the data right
and you might want to keep that so that
you'll have reference to every single
aspect of or every single cell data that
you're referring to right so for that
reason you might want to freeze this and
also you might have a doubt what if uh
even even I had this data in the column
section right and what if I had to
freeze that and you know when when you
scroll this and keep that data uh set on
the column as it is right so we can also
do that let's look at both of them so
there is a simple process to do that all
you have to do is select the cell uh for
which you want to uh you know the or
freeze the column adjacent to it or the
row adjacent to it right so currently I
want to let me expand it so currently I
want to freeze this particular row right
and this particular column so the cell I
would be selecting is the first cell
here that is
D5 right so when I select this
particular cell I can be able to freeze
this particular row and this particular
column so now you need to navigate to
the toolbar and then select The View
menu and inside view option you can see
there is an option of freeze pains right
so click on the drop- down so you can
see three different options as we
discussed earlier we can either choose
to freeze an entire row that is the
second option or you can freeze the
entire column that is the third option
or you can freeze both that is the first
option right freezing rows and columns
so let's select this one and see if our
rows and columns are frozen or not right
so now let's scroll down and you can see
our row is successfully Frozen there
right and similarly scroll towards right
and you can see our column has been
successfully Frozen right so this is how
you freeze rows and columns or you can
freeze panes in Excel now here on my
sheet you can see we have some numbers
that is $10 or
$10.20 $22 $50 $ 3.12 $12 and $110 now
the task is to convert these numbers
into word format that is representing
the numbers alphabetically right this
might be a little curious and we also
might end up searching for a predefined
method which is not readily available in
Excel but there is a way where you can
create a function using Excel VBA or
macros now again creating a macro is
completely complex now identifying the
trouble Microsoft has already come up
with a readily available macro code on
their official website which will
support the various versions of
Microsoft Excel starting from Microsoft
Excel 365 to all the way up to the older
Excel version that is 2010 now you can
scroll down and use this particular
macro function which Microsoft has
readily made us available and use this
to create our own macro in Excel VBA now
let's get back to Excel and you you can
create a macro using the developer
option now developer options will not be
readily available in Microsoft Excel to
activate developer option go to home and
go to the options menu in the
last and here go to customize ribbon and
here in the second drop- down menu you
can see developer option by default it
will not be checked click on the check
option to activate developer options and
press okay now you have your developer
option ready click on developer options
click on Visual Basic and here to insert
a new macro click on the insert button
click on module and a new mro window is
readily available for you now control V
to paste your code and your function is
with the name number to text right now
close the
mro and here your function will be
readily
available equals to and the function
name was number to text press tab to
select the function and select the cell
where you have the data close the
function press enter now drag the same
formula across all the cells and here
you have the text converted from numbers
so here we have $102 and you have $102
$22 and no cents
$532 $12 and no cense and $110 with no
sense now that's how you can convert
numbers to words using the macro which
is predefined for excel in the Microsoft
website so for example uh let us imagine
that you wanted to create one single
cell for all the employees in your
company which stores the first name
second name or last name including the
email IDs at one place right if you want
to do so like let us let us let me show
you how it looks like so let me copy
this here
then that's the first name now it's your
second
name along with the email ID now let us
imagine that you wanted to store all the
employees in the same way right so you
can do this by using combine operation
in Excel now all it takes is just a
simple formula that is equals to and the
first cell
address that is
A2 and you can use an enter
sign now you can use the next cell
reference that as
B2 and then colon and the last C address
that is E2 now press
enter so when you press enter or tab you
will get this particular answer but this
data is completely uh in a state where
you can't understand it right the first
name last name and the email ID has got
combined all together so you want to use
some spaces right so all you need to do
is just make a little modification to
this particular existing data so you can
press another ENT and include
spaces and then you can separate the
email ID and the name with some
colon so now we have separated the first
two cells that is the first name and the
last name with a space using the ense
and then again we have used an ENT to
include the colon and see that we have
also included a space between the colon
marks that it gets separated cleanly and
now let's try to press Tab and see the
result so there you go the first name
and the second name is separated by
space and the email ID and the complete
name is separated by a colon now you can
use this to all the
cells and there you go all the the first
name last name and the email IDs have
been printed here so that's how you use
the combine operation in Excel and you
can see on my screen we have the sales
data of one single employee in the month
of January okay so this is the sales
data of John in January sales now let us
imagine that we have the same person's
or same John's data of sales of all the
three months okay so here we have the
sales data of John for January February
and March and you wanted to Club all
these three months and write it down as
quarter 1 right so let us try doing
it now you can see that uh only January
is replaced as quarter 1 and February
and March are still uh remaining the
same so let us try to delete them so we
have deleted them and I think now it
looks like uh this is a sales data of
one single quarter that is quarter one
but again quter one is under column B
and anyone who looks at it feels like
this data is of January February and
March and all the quarter one details
are only present in V column but C and D
are completely you know different from
this one right so you don't want that
kind of an impression on your uh you
know the one presenting to you so in
those situations you want to merge all
these three columns and make sure that
the quarter one is present somewhere in
between the cells so that all the data
looks relevant and uh it it defines that
these data elements belong to photo one
right so there is an option in Excel to
do that so select all the cells that you
AO merge and going to home button and in
home button get into the alignment group
and select merch and Center so they can
do it directly also you have a couple of
more options that is merge and center
merge across merge sales and unmerge so
we'll go through it one by one so first
we'll go through merge and center so
there you go the cells called merged and
it has been aligned into center now
again if your manager or anyone Superior
to you wants this to be you know
independent like they want it to be in
terms of January February and March so
that they can have access to it and
month-wise so you want to unmerge it
back right how to do that now so the
same menu and select unmar and there you
go you have your data back in the
original form again all you have to do
is you know rename a few
cells there you go and you have it back
right so in a few situations okay you
can also add the PS so that it looks
more relevant now um you know now let's
try to Merch this again and merch in
Center yeah now again uh let us imagine
that you are going through an appraisal
cycle and you also wanted to add some
comments about the sales happening in
your company uh regarding uh all the
employees right so also we have that
here now let me expand a little
bit Yeah there so again let's margin
center
now uh you wanted to you know uh you
wanted to take a review of your level
one level two and level three managers
so you have all the three um rows here
but you can see the cells are not merged
and uh you wanted to merge every single
row so merging and centering everything
rowwise would be a little time consuming
I mean three columns is okay but what if
you had like uh you had to take a review
from a couple of more managers like five
to 10 right uh or imagine a
you wanted to write some random comments
apart from review you wanted to write
some random comments based on month-wise
uh sales or something like that so it
would be timec consuming right so apart
from that you have another option where
you you know select all the sales and
come over here and select the option of
merge
across and all the sales will be merged
all together at once and you will be
having those individual rows where you
can write down your reviews like review
one and and so on
review two right so this is how the
option of merch across works and we
already have been through the merge and
center and merge is completely similar
to merge and center so this is how merge
and center merge cells and uh merge
across and unmerge cells in Excel work
now there are multiple ways to add dat
to Excel spreadsheet for example equals
to today this is a shortcut method and
you can enter
done you will have today's state but
again there is some problem with this
kind of approach so today's state is 4th
of September 2022 now if you open the
same spreadsheet after today that is
tomorrow or day after tomorrow then you
will have a concurrent date that is 5th
of September or 6th of September right
the date will always vary or get updated
according to time now you don't want to
change that or you don't want that to be
happening with emplo state of joining
right it should be stagnant it should
not vary right so there is another
shortcut way apart from using the
datetime functions there is a keyboard
shortcut where you can add date to excel
that is control semicolon so this is the
shortcut way to add date to your Excel
spreadsheet and this particular date
will not change this will remain the
same constant date throughout the time
now there is a chance where you might
also have have to add time to your
spreadsheet that is date of joining and
time of joining right so there is
another simple shortcut where you can
add time by just pressing three keys
that is holding control holding shift
and pressing semicolon then you'll have
the time so this is how you can add date
to your Excel spreadsheet and add time
to your Excel spreadsheet and this date
and time will remain constant it will
not vary like the 3D function that we
have used here so you can see on my
screen we are on the Excel spreadsheet
and on my spreadsheet you can see dates
in column A and different formats in
column CDE E and F respectively Now by
default the data type or the data
present in the a column will be
considered as general and there are a
few situations where even if you try to
format the date in your format like you
know the customized format you may not
be able to do it because it's still
under the general data type so with that
for being on the safer side what we will
do is select the data and navigate to
the data toolbar and in that you have
the text to columns option press that
and remember to have the delimited icon
you know you might be having the dash as
your icon or slash as your icon for the
delimited thing and select that and next
next and here you can see right it's in
general mode so you can press on date
and DMI will be a date format that is
date month and year now click on finish
so it's been formatted now now let's
copy the same data and paste it in all
the four formats so that we'll see the
different formats that we can change to
or customize to right so there you go
let's expand the columns a little bit
now we have day month and year so now
you might want to change a couple of
things right for example you wanted to
change okay let's see the menu so the
way is to select the sales and right
click and select the format sales option
and in here you can see the date
function and in here you can see
different types of modifications that
you can do to your data right
so you might want to also change your
dates based on the location so right now
we are in India and imagine if you
wanted to you know change something
based on us or if you have if you're
having your client in us and he wants
the dates in US format you can also
change that so here you can see English
United States and press on that press
okay and you can see it's been changed
to us format where you have years in the
first place months in the second place
and dates in the last place right and
now let us imagine that uh your client
does not want the dates all he needs is
just months right you can also do that
get back to the format sales option go
to custom and here instead of uh you
know uh month date and year all you can
do is just write down month and year and
select okay so you'll have only month
and year not the dates now your client
is being a little more you know he wants
a little more detail and he wants you to
add a lot of granularity to your data
which includes day time Etc everything
right so you can also do that so the
same way go to format sales custom and
here I think it's in date itself so
let's navigate a little yeah here so you
have the day date month and year press
okay so there you go right so that's how
you can do it and now let's try a little
bit more if we have a few more options
pending so go to format
sales and
custom and you also have
timings so here you have date month year
and the timings press okay and there you
have all the timings as well so since
these dates are you know I created them
just a few moments ago to keep it simple
so I did not have to add the timings
here so if you are Keen about adding the
timings you can also do that for example
if you wanted to add the timings of the
employees logged in and logged out you
can also do that using the same format
and you can see now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and you can see we have a
column of dates and on the column B we
have age now how do you calculate the
age using the date of birth so this is
completely simple all you have to use is
the dated IF function or if you also
call it as date diff function based on
your choice we also have a specific
entire tutorial based on date diff and
Excel for further information that video
will be linked in the description box
below you can go through it or you can
use the end screens and I cards link to
this video to get back to the tutorial
based on date diff in Excel now let's
calculate the age of these dates or
these people with these date of births
so all you have to do is type equals to
and type dated
F and open a bracket we need three
parameters here that is the date of
birth that is the first parameter now
the second one is the today function
because you're calculating the age of
these people as per today right so we
have a today function in Excel press on
Tab to select
and give a close bracket now comma and
if you wanted to calculate the age in
terms of days you have to um you know
give d as the
input yeah here it should be D as the
input and don't forget to use the double
codes here and if you use the single
codes there might be an error so use
double codes if you want it in the Days
part you can give days and if you want
it in months mon you can give months for
now we want an ear so we will be giving
y as the third parameter and press enter
there you go you have the AG here in 26
years you can drag the same function and
you have the ages here as you wanted
right so this is how you calculate age
in Excel and on my Excel spreadsheet let
me expand
it we have two different timings that is
in and out so here we are considering a
scenario where we are calculating the
total number of hours worked by an
employee in an organization ation so the
in time will be the time where the
employee logged in and the out time will
be the time when the employee logged out
so here we have made some minor cell
formatting so when you right click on
any of the cell you can get back to the
formatting sales option and in that
option we have selected the am p.m so
there is also another option of choosing
the 24-hour timing that is 13 20 uh 1330
so this represents the 24-hour format
but since we are you know working on
Office timings let's keep it as Am
Pm okay so there you go so we have our
uh timings of in and out now to
calculate the time difference between
the in time and out time so this
particular calculation is completely
simple all you have to do is press
equals to select out time minus select
in time so there you go press enter and
you have the total number of RS the
employee has been working in your
organization so here also we have made
some minor cell formatting so usually it
comes out as a PM right but instead of
that we have made a minor cell
formatting we have navigated into time
and we have selected the 24-hour
formatting so that we have just RS in
our output however if you are looking to
get certified then herey there we are
here with an amazing course through
which you can catch the eyes of top
Recruiters in the industry allow me to
introduce both postgraduate program in
data analytics by simply learn so what
are you waiting for hurry up and enroll
Now find the cost Link in the
description box so you can see that I've
got some data which is first name of the
employee last name of the employee and
phone number and let us assume that uh
your manager has given you a task to
identify all those uh employees which
did not give an phone number so you
wanted to identify them using a check
box right like you will be providing a
check for all the employees that we have
received the phone numbers and you will
not be checking the employees which did
not give the phone number right so let's
try to do that so to include a check box
you might want to get into the developer
option but for few reasons Microsoft has
disabled developer option by default to
enable developer option all you have to
do is just navigate anywhere on the
ribbon here
and right click and then you can see
customize the ribbon option when you
click into it you will be redirected
into the ribbon option and here you can
see the developer option on the right
side right this one so by default you
can see that your developer option is
not enabled to enable it you have to
check in it and there you go you have it
now so press okay and you'll have the
developer option now go to the developer
option and select the insert option and
there you can see the check box now draw
the checkbox
anywhere I'll draw it over here and
there you go you have the first check
box right now if you want you can even
customize
this so carefully click
it
you can edit the
text and write it
as
done
okay now you can even copy this to all
the
celles just select and drag and there
you go now you can go ahead and check
all the employees which you have
received the phone numbers and you can
eliminate the ones which did not provide
you with the phone
numbers that's how you can do it and
there's also another option where you
can use this to include it in a formula
since this data is only of 25 rows you
can manage check in the data and you can
leave the data which is you have not
received but what if you had 2500 right
then you might need formula so in such
scenarios you can use a formula so how
do you use that so for example uh if
this particular box is checked then you
will get a True Value here and if it's
not checked you will have a false value
then you can use that Boolean value to
include in your formula right sounds
interesting now let's try to imp that
you can right click the cell and you can
find format
control then you can see here you have
an option called cell link here select
the cell
link and press okay so here you can see
if you have checked this the value is
true and if you uncheck
this you can see the value turned false
now you can use this particular cell
reference for including this in a
formula now let us also check how to
include checkboxes on Google Sheets in
Google sheet it's really simple all you
have to do is get into the insert option
and you can see a readily available
check boox you don't have to use any
developer options over here and there
you go you can just check now let us
assume that you're giving an important
presentation and you're also requested
by your manager to add the Excel
document that you have used to create
that particular report which would be
something like this when you click on it
it will open a new Excel document or
Excel Window with all the data in it
right so how do we do that let's look at
the demo now let's have a blank slide
and let's get back to the source where
our Excel file is located that is in my
documents so we are currently in my
documents and we have the Excel file
which we used for creating that
particular report now if we copy and try
to paste it on our Excel document it
would look something like
this and clearly it's not visible and
it's not accessible right so instead of
this there is another way where you can
directly add the Excel document in the
form of logo which is a rather simple
idea all you have to do is just click on
the insert option in the toolbar then
navigate to the text group and here you
will find the option called object click
on the object and it will give you a new
window where you can identify which type
of document or object you want to add
either create or create from file so we
have the file in our local system so
we'll choose create from file browse and
from browse we will go into the
documents section where we have our
Excel file click on the Excel file and
click on okay now if you want the data
or Excel file to be displayed in the
form of an icon then click on the
display as icon section and here you can
can change the icon so you can choose
any one of the given options let's
choose this particular one and click on
okay another okay and there you go the
icon will be now displayed on your
Microsoft PowerPoint PPD which is
completely clickable as the previous one
whenever you click on this the Excel
document will be opened so that's how
you add Excel document into Microsoft
PowerPoint now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and here I'm trying to
insert some images on on to my
spreadsheet so here we have company
logos and Company brand names so since
we already have the brand names what we
need to add here is the brand logos okay
so how do I add such kind of an image
into an Excel spreadsheet that you might
be thinking that Excel spreadsheets are
just for data not multimedia image or
files right so no it's not it's
completely wrong you can also add your
images onto your Excel spreadsheets it's
completely simple so click anywhere on
the Excel spreadsheet navigate to the
insert button select the illustrations
option from the addin group click on
that and you know in the drop down you
can see the pictures icon or the
pictures uh button click on
that and select from this device or if
you have an online stock image you can
take that or you can also check out from
online pictures for now I'll select the
device this
device and here I have some images the
images for f simply learn and simply
code logos press okay or insert so here
you have
them now you can also adjust the size of
the image using the small buttons
here press it over
here and
done so you might be wondering is it all
done is there anything more to do uh or
just adding an image is done no most of
the times when you create or you work
with Excel spreadsheet you will not just
you know add some data and add a
relevant image to it most of the time
you add some graphs or you most of the
time you'll add some charts uh to
showcase the data dashboard right so it
will be something like this so this is
how you add the image or graph onto your
uh uh dashboard and sometimes you might
not have enough place to uh display your
entire dashboard during those situations
what you do is you try to hide the row
or column so now let's try to hide this
particular room let us imagine that you
wanted to show only uh two uh charts and
there is no space for your third chart
in such scenarios you might want to hide
or remove that third chart okay so let's
try to hide it and see if gets if it
gets hidden or not when you try to hide
it you can see the column A has no data
and the row number four is been hidden
so we have three and five but what about
the image it is still present right so
if you want to make sure that the row
also hides the image then you might have
to do a little formatting with it so
select the image go to picture
format or you can also right click and
directly navigate to picture format this
opens up a set of options and here you
might want to go to the U third uh one
which is picture format third and select
the properties and here select the
option of move and size with cells so
when you select this when you try to
hide this it will also I mean the graph
of the image will also hide along with
the R so that's how you do it so how to
insert PDF in Excel now there are
multiple ways to insert a PDF into Excel
so we will go through a couple of ways
first is here let us imagine that we
wanted to insert some PowerPoint
presentation in PDF format into our
Excel sheet so that it belongs to excel
Basics now click on the cell where you
want to add the PDF or just click any
cell in the Excel spreadsheet then go to
the option of insert in the toolbar then
navigate to text option click on it and
select object
and here you can select create from file
and then you can browse and here you
have your Excel Basics PDF in my
documents click on that select insert so
here you can just press okay and the PDF
will be inserted now you can minimize
the size of PDF to fit the
cell there you go the PDF code
successfully inserted into your Excel
spreadsheet now let's discuss about the
second way now the second way is
completely same the only difference is
you can add some logo to your PDF so you
can see it has been added in direct form
of a PDF like what's the first slide of
the PPD but instead of that if you want
it to highlight it as an icon then you
can select the display as icon button
here and press okay now you don't have
to reformat the size of your PPD or PDF
all you have to do is add the logo to
your PDF and it will also include the
title so this is another way of adding
uh you know PDF to your Excel sheet now
another way so a few times you don't
want the first page of the uh PDF to be
visible or any kind of logo of that PDF
reader to be visible on your spreadsheet
sometimes all you want is some dedicated
image or a dedicated logo right so this
time let's try to add a dedicated image
to our PDF so go to insert again again
here you can see the illustrations
option click on picture and from this
device so I will select the simply lar
logo and now you have to resize the logo
a little bit to fit the
cell there you
go you can uh you know click on the
right click button and and select the
option of Link now um select the
existing file or web page option so if
you are interested to learn more on
hyperlink in Excel we have dedicated
tutorial on that please go through
hyperlinks in Excel by simply learn
which will explain you everything about
hyperlinks in Excel how to insert them
different types of documents to be
inserted and how it works in real time
for now let's try to insert the existing
web page and go to documents navigate to
documents and inside this you have the
the Excel basic PDF click on okay and it
has been added to your image so when you
click on it it will open the PDF
document attached to it so when you
hover over to the cell you can see it
will ask you a permission do you want to
continue or not just click on this
ignore the warning so you can see the
PDF has been successfully open convert
PDF into
Excel now to do this let's get back to
the Practical mode and try to convert
some p PDF data into Excel now you can
see the PDF document which I'm looking
to convert from PDF to excel so this
particular PDF document has a table so
this is the statewise GST collections
that happened during March of 2020 now
we need to convert this tabula data from
PDF format to excel format now we are on
the Microsoft Excel now to initiate the
process we might want to choose a blank
workbook for this so now we are on the
blank workbook and the complete sheet is
empty now let's go into the data option
in the
toolbar and in the data option of the
toolbar we
have the ribbon of get and transform
data in this ribbon you can see get data
option select that and you can see
various options here from file from
database from ezure from other sources
Etc now we need the first options that
is from file and in that we have a drop
down and in that dropdown you might want
to select the PDF if you have a Json
file you can also choose fromjson and if
you have the data from XML you can
choose that and even you can extract the
data from text or CSV as well now we
need the PDF option so select the PDF
Now navigate where your file is existing
so my file is on the desktop and now let
me select the PDF document select import
now Excel will automatically analyze the
tab data in the PDF format and give you
the results now according to excel there
are multiple tabular formats table one
table two so basically this table is one
and the same so all the 29 states are
fixed in one table itself but since the
PDF is divided in sheets this particular
document is considering the first table
as a separate table and the table which
is present in the third page as a
separate table so we have table one
table two and there are a few more
tables which Excel is assuming that it
might be table but it's not and another
table which is page number 002 it is a
table and another one is right here now
there is an option of selecting all the
tables all together at once or you can
select only one table which you want to
select so if you select multiple items
Excel will automatically give you an
option of choosing your tables you can
just take and select the tables you want
or you can directly select the table you
want on your Excel
sheet so right now let's try to select
multiple tables so I'll be selecting 1 2
4 and five and this particular one is
not a table so I'm eliminating that now
you might want to choose the load option
so Excel is now loading the
data now all the data is has been
successfully
loaded
now yeah it is giving us a notification
that all the data has been successfully
loaded and now just right click on it
and here choose the option load to and
here select table option and if you want
the data to be uh you know loaded to a
new worksheet you can choose that and
select
okay now you can see all the data is
been successfully fully loaded in the
form of tabular format in the new Excel
sheet similarly let's try to load
another
page in the table
format new
worksheet select
okay and the third
sheet
now get ready to impress your boss by
converting all the PDF data into Excel
sheet just in a matter of few seconds
with few steps and there you go all the
four tables have been loaded
successfully in the form of excel in
just a few steps now this is how you
convert PDF to excel that is how to add
tick mark in Excel now on my spreadsheet
you can see some employee data so
they've been assigned a task and they
want to update the task status as done
and not done using symbolic statements
that is tick mark and into marks now how
to do that it is really simple we'll
discuss two different ways the first way
is to do it by conditional formatting so
click a cell on the task status go to
conditional formatting click on the new
rule yes of course we can use the icon
settings but we want to automate it so
click on the new rule right so here
instead of two colors scare select icon
sets now go to the settings here we
don't want the third symbol so select no
cell icon and here instead of percentage
number formula let's add just a simple
number and the second one as well just a
simple number now in the icon settings
select Tech Mark you have various types
of them you know the circular Tech Mark
and let's select the generic Tech Mark
without any outer circles and into here
generate x mark and now let's set the
values when the value is greater than Z
it will be green and when the value is
less than or equal to Z it will be X and
the reference value is 0 and here also
the reference value is zero everything
is okay click on okay and
done and here you cannot see the logos
yet we need to add some formula here
which is equals to if click on Tab to
select the symbol and if Cell address C2
is equals to
done then the value should be one
else the value should be zero close the
bracket
enter right now you can see this
particular logo here now drag the same
formula it's done now you can see we do
have numbers you can eliminate those
numbers as well just edit the
rules and here you can see show icon
only click okay and the numbers will be
removed also addit the second one and
there you go the numbers are gone and
only the symbols remain now what is the
second technique the second technique is
available in the developer options you
can activate it by you know uh going
into the options here go to file and
here go to options and here go to
Advanced customize ribbon and in here on
the right hand side you will get
developer options click on the tick box
and it will be enabled now go into
developer options and click into insert
menu click on the form controls or
active X controls select the checkbox
and now just place it over here you know
you can edit this particular checkbox
delete everything drag it as checkbox as
well now you can drag the same cell
across all the functions and you will
have the checkbox as well now you can
click on it and say if it's done or not
whereas how to add Watermark to excel
now on my sheet you can see some data so
here we we wanted to add some Watermark
logo to your uh Excel spreadsheet so
that it looks genuine and work by you
right so that's the overall idea of
adding a watermark now go to the insert
window and in the insert window go to
the text option click on that select
header and footer once you select header
and footer you can see something on your
screen like this so in this box which is
highlighted by a cursor is where you're
going to add the picture on my top in
the menu bar you can see header and
footer elements in this select the
picture element and it will navigate to
you to a different option window since
we are adding the image from our local
system select from file or if you are
adding from your Bing or any search
window you can also add that or one
drive as well but now let's go with from
file it will directly navigate you to
the pictures folder in your local system
so here is my simply lears logo click on
it and select insert now you can see the
images added in this format which is ENT
and picture and you might wonder where
is the picture it is actually present to
view it click on any cell in the
spreadsheet and there you go you can see
it now you might be wondering the image
is a little towards top and abnormally
placed right so no worries you can
always you know format your picture just
press enter and use enter to move your
picture towards the center of your data
spreadsheet and also there is another
option of format picture altogether here
you can adjust the height and width of
your image by you know increasing and
decreasing width or increasing and
decreasing height using the arrow marks
also works and apart from this there is
another option of picture formatting
where you can choose your image to be
washing out black and white gray scale
or anything so currently I'm going with
automatic which will automatically
adjust the brightness and you know
everything for your image it looks
perfectly fine so click on on okay and
there you go right so now this should be
fine right now everything is done and
everything is automatically saved if you
are having that auto save option on your
spreadsheet and let's go back to the
normal view from the header and footer
view click on The View and go to
normal you might be confused right where
is the logo it vanish did I had to save
it no it's already saved everything is
fine even the image is there but you
cannot see it in normal view to see it
click on on file click on print then you
can see the logo it will be present only
on the printed Pages not on the normal
view okay so that's how you work with
watermarks in Excel and that's how you
can add and customize your watermarks
using Excel how to modify or increase
cell size in Excel now most of you might
probably want to increase just the cell
size you know just to increase the
visibility of the text so one of the
easiest way is just to press on the plus
icon on the bottom right corner of your
Excel spreadsheet so this will
automatically increase the text size and
you can see the text more clearly now
apart from that if it's just not that
what you want to do you can also modify
by hovering over to the line between two
columns and right click which will give
you the option of format cells or column
width so either of these options will
help you to maximize or minimize your
column width similarly you can apply the
same idea for your rows as well so you
can either format the cells or modify
the row height of yourself and this is
another way and another simple way is to
just hold that line and drag it so it
improves your width of the column and
another way is to just over onto that
line and hold it and drag it to
improvise or increase your width of the
cell and same applies to your row so so
this is another way so apart from that
there is another way that is format
sales from this particular option in the
home button you can select this and here
you have the row height autoit row
height column width autoit column width
for example let us imagine that you
wanted to you know just by mistake you
uh you increase the cell size and you
wanted to restore it back to the
original thing right so you can just
click on the autoit height and click on
the autoit column width there you go it
happens in that way and now coming back
to another simplest way let us imagine
that you are given a lot of data and you
are told to autoit all the rows and
columns now we have already seen the
format cell option where will autoit all
the columns and width of the column and
also the height of the rows Etc right
but there is also a keyboard shortcut to
do this so all you have to do is select
a cell and press CR a to select all the
cells in the spreadsheet and once all
the cells are selected all you have to
do is press and hold ALT key and then
release it then the combination of keys
that is h o i so your column width has
been now adjusted now the same formula
or the same shortcut key with a small
modification press and hold and release
ALT key now h o and a to adjust the row
height so this is the way where you can
increase or decrease or modify or autoit
all the cells in Excel now you can see
that we have the First Column that is a
column and the first set of that is text
and all the other cells are numbers but
as a whole Excel considers the whole
column as a general data format so why
are we discussing about this so to
create a barcode in Excel you have to
make sure that all the elements in the
column are of Text data type so the
first step is to convert this General
data type to Text data type so you can
do that by going into the data type and
selecting text and now all the elements
in your first column A are type
text now the next step is to convert
these elements into barcode now for that
let's create a new column called
barcode now our new column that is
barcode has been created now the next
step would be is to check for the
barcode font so the barcode font looks
something like this but let me remind
you the barcode font in Excel is not
available by
default don't worry if it's not
available we can download it from open
source so let's go back to Google
so on the Google you want to search uh
for barode font for Excel so the one
that I would recommend is three of9
barcode
font now you can download this font by
just clicking on the download button
over here now I've already downloaded
this font on my local system let's now
try to install that now the three of9
barcode folder will come in the form of
zip folder you have to unzip that and
after unzipping you'll get the setup
file which looks something like this
which is three of9 new select that and
you'll be having the installer file over
here you can install by selecting the
install button over here so I have
already installed it in my local system
so it is readily available for me on my
Microsoft Excel now we might want to
create the barcode for this particular
cell in A2 so let's create that so to
create a barcode we need to write in a
formula that is equals to double codes
star double codes and ampers symbol
address of the cell that is A2 another
ENT symbol again double codes star
symbol and double codes so you can
either use this or instead of star you
can use brackets as
well so let's try brackets now select
enter now this will generate another
type of code in your resultant cell now
we will change the font for this
particular resultant cell and we will
get our barcode now you can just drag
all the cells so that you can apply the
formula to all the codes now I got all
the codes over here now select all the
cells get into the fonts and here select
the barcode font and there you go you
have the barcode for all the numbers you
have in your column A so that's how you
create barcode in Excel Excel flashfill
is a feature of Microsoft Excel where
Excel can sense a pattern in a cell and
apply the same logic to extract the
similar resultant pattern out of the
remaining cells in a table might be a
little confusing right so let us
simplify it so let us imagine that you
have a text in one of the cells in the
Excel sheet and you wanted to trim a
part of that text for example let us
imagine that there is an assembly an
assembly where the car parts are
assembled together to finish a car so
each and every part has a code the
serial number the product code and the
assembly code Etc right and you wanted
to separate all those three if you
wanted to do that you might want to use
the trim function which might be a
little treates to apply to all the cells
but what if if I say there is a simple
key format using which you can fill all
the columns in the Excel sheet within a
fraction of second sounds interesting
right so that's exactly the flashfill
function in Excel
does now before we get started let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple Technologies if you're a
tech gek in a continuous hunt for latest
technological Trends then consider
getting subscribed to our YouTube
channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to never miss an update from
Simply now without further Ado let's get
started with the Flash in Excel for that
we might want to start the Excel to get
in the Practical mode now we are on the
Microsoft Excel and remember the example
we discussed so this is a similar
example now the first column in the
sheet is the product detail so this
product detail consist of the product
code that is 112 next we have the
product serial number that is 1 025 637
and lastly the assembly code that is a
SN X now we want to separate this
product detail into three columns where
we have the First Column to be storing
the product code second one to be
storing the product serial number and
the last one to be storing the assembly
code so now if you want to do that using
trim function function you might want to
apply the trim function here and trim
out the left part and again for the
product serial number you might want to
use the trim function again which might
go into a little complicated pattern So
to avoid the complications and and
decrease the time spent we might want to
use the flashfill in Excel now let us
help Excel about the pattern that we
might want to generate so the pattern is
112 and the next one is
322 so now you can see that the text was
highlighted that was the intimate from
the Excel that it understood the pattern
now going into the next Cel and holding
the control key and pressing the E
button will help us to fill the
remaining cells in the column B so
that's how it is done and similarly
let's try out for the serial
number for that the serial number is 1
02
5637 now in the next cell we have
13
6582 now we can go to the third cell and
press CR e for Windows and if you're
using a Mac operating system then you
have to press command e and all these
serial numbers will be filled so this
will reduce the time in separating the
pattern and filling the
columns now let's try the last column
that is as SX which happens to the
assembly code next we have FG and V
now the shortcut method that is CR e and
there you go now you might be wondering
will it work only for numbers etc etc or
the text which is properly aligned or
separated using a hyphen no it can also
be used for some random text which is
like this so let us imagine that we have
a text which is of length like 20 or 30
and you wanted to print only a part of
it so here I'm going to print the
alphabets from position fourth to
position eth so I've already tried the
first one that is taking out the
alphabets from fourth location to the
eighth location or the pattern of the
text that is i f e r from Jennifer Lopez
and in the next cell we have the numbers
starting from the location 4 to 8 so
that is
7767 and similarly we have the other
cells consisting of the names of few
cars that is Alpha Romeo Bugatti Veron
and next we have Superman Returns text
so now let's press the shortcut key that
is CR e and make sure that all the
remaining cells are filled so that's how
the Flash Fill works so the Flash Fill
in Excel will reduce the time consumed
to fill all the columns by separating
the text in your main cell that is the
column A which we have here in this
example and it also reduces the
complexity of using a trim function in
Excel is hyperlinks in
Excel now hyperlink is something which
is clickable and when you click on it it
will redirect you to a different web
page to a different worksheet or a
different location in your local system
so there are a variety of options and we
will explore all of them using Excel now
creating a hyperlink is really simple we
have multiple ways now let's write some
text on the Excel
worksheet I'll write simply
long now creating a hyperlink is really
simple you have multiple ways the first
simplest shortcut is clicking on the
cell where you want to place the
hyperlink and holding control key and
pressing K now this will enable the
hyperlink menu box or the dialog box
this is the first way and let me close
it now again we have selected the cell
there is another option where you have
to click on the insert menu on the
toolbar and navigate to Links group
click on the link option and you will
again have the dialog box of the hyperli
and Excel and the Third Way is right
click on the cell and you can see the
link option in the last and this will
enable the hyperlink option in Excel now
let's create a hyperlink the simplest
way again control K now we have a
variety of options that is existing file
or web page place in this document
create a new document and an email
address so we will address all of these
one at each time so first one existing
file or a web page now you can select an
existing PDF file or any file in your
local system and hyperlink or create a
hyperlink to the text or you can select
a website link and place it over here
and create it as a hyperlink Let's uh
explore both the options first let's try
to explore the web page option so since
I've have written as simply learn let's
use the website link of Simply learn and
create a
hyperlink let me open Google
new tab and let me type simply
learn.com let me copy the hyperlink and
now let's get back to the Excel workbook
now here let's place the hyperlink now
you can press okay and there you go the
hyperlink has been successfully created
now this link is clickable when you
click on it it will redirect you to a
new simply learns home web page right so
this is how you create a hyperlink to a
website now we should explore another
option that is using an existing file
right let's create a new text box here
let's name it as
existing file and okay existing file
should be good again the same you can
either click uh you know right click and
select hyperlink or control ke now let's
select existing file or web page option
now here you can see navigate key press
on that and let's navigate our files
let's select all files here remember to
select all files okay by default it
shows as office files now let's explore
our file
option so let's select uh fundamentals
of computer programming option which is
a PDF file press okay and there you go
we have created a hyperlink so when I
click on this you can directly navigate
to an existing PDF file in your local
system and it will be open as a web page
click on it and you can see the PDF file
now close now another thing when you
navigate onto this you'll see the lenier
HTTP uh address and same happens here
right so if you're a little
uncomfortable watching this lenier link
you can also edit it you can choose the
option of edit
hyperlink and
see the screen dip option click on
it and here you can change the text
display
option and write it as click here to
know
more press
okay again press okay and now if you
navigate onto it instead of seeing a
lenia hyperlink what you can see is
click here to know more okay I think I
made a spelling mistake so I think I
forgot an e somewhere over here yes
click here to know more and press okay
right so here you can see click here to
know more let's try this again over
here so
edit edit hyperlink screen tap option
and instead of the ler text box or
hyperlink you can write as click to open
notes or
PDF click okay and click another okay
and you are done so instead of seeing
that lengthier hyperlink you can see
click here to open PDF right so so far
we have explored two options that is
existing file and existing web page
right now let's try to explore another
option again uh hyperlink right click
hyperlink and here you have seen plac
this in document all right so which is
like uh okay let me show this to you
instead of telling you so here what it
is doing is you have the cell A5 and you
wanted to refer to A1 or any other cell
in the same worksheet so you can do that
right so now for your reference let me
cancel it and let me create a new sheet
and here navigate me to here right let
me write it as navigate me to here okay
so now what we will do is so here we
will create that navigate link from
using the hyperlink option place this in
this document he can see the sheet to
option and the cell reference is E1
where we have written now navigate me to
here so when I click this A5 cell okay
let me also rename
it write it as navigate cell navigating
cell right
now create
that control
K let me select sheet two and the cell
address is A1 press okay now what did uh
what What's the change right when you
click on this you will be redirected to
sheet to cell A1 navigate me to here
right so this can be like a shortcut
when you have multiple sheets like 100
sheets then you can uh you know have a
different column over here and uh add
the navigation address to all those cell
links you can just click on that cell
and go into the different sheet and to
the specific cell which you have given
the address in our case I have given
sheet to address cell A1 right so this
is another trick now let's get back to
the hyperlink thing again uh control K
and another option is create new
document so you might have been through
you know option of uh having let's say
some cheat sheets or uh clip on clip
boats right so uh let us imagine that
you're working through uh a huge
worksheet and uh you wanted to you know
uh have a a track of everything and keep
notes updating right so it might be a
little complicated to understand so let
me show it practically so let me write
it down as clipboard or sticky
note
right okay I think this has a hyper let
us okay this can be used no
worries back
to uh hyperlink option
again create new document now here you
can create create a variety of uh
documents right so it can be a text
document it can be an Excel document it
can be a PDF document right for now
we'll create a text document okay uh
we'll name it as uh
tracker. txt so this should create as a
text
document and the location can be
anything so you can you know uh take it
as a desktop documents download so let
me me take documents here and select
okay so I'll be having the tracker. txt
located in the documents
folder and uh you can also choose to
edit the document later or edit the
document now let us select edit the
document now press okay and there you go
so you have your text tracker here so
let us imagine that we have worked on
the Excel sheet and we wanted to write
on us a sticky note uh so that we can
remember what we have done on the Excel
sheet so update
one and update two now you can close it
so it'll ask for a save option save and
done and let us imagine that you did
something else and you also updated
something else on the sticky note I mean
Excel sheet and you wanted to update
that on your sticky note so click on it
and you'll see a minor notice over here
from Microsoft Excel based on potential
security concerns you can select yes and
you'll be having access to your text
document again and and write down your
update again here update three what you
have written right the latest update
what you
have and you can save it and
close so that's how you keep track of
your sticky note and you'll have all
your updates right now getting back to
the hyperlinks
again uh the last one is email address
so you can also try to add uh okay let
us imagine that you're working with a
colleague and every time you make an
update in your Excel sheet or anything
and you wanted to send him out an email
right so it would be a little timec
consuming that you open your email and
uh compost something and send it over
here but what if you had uh one single
click and access to the email compose
option right that can be done so let us
write down
email
B me with the spelling so again the
control K and hyperlink select email
option and you can write down your
email which can be anything so you can
write down your friend's email address
so I'm just writing down some random
email here friend
gmail.com
and can write the sub check about
update and press okay this will navigate
you to the Gmail option or the mailing
address
options click on it and you'll have a
variety of mailing options Outlook
Office 365 Yahoo iCloud Google Etc so
you can select any one of those since we
have written as gmail.com we'll navigate
to Gmail and all you have to do is login
you know all the formalities and you're
good to go with email
in so let's SK this for now so you you
know how to do the rest parts so so far
we have uh you know covered all the
hyperlink options in Excel that is
existing file or a web page plac this in
the current executive worksheet or
document creating a new document for
your update thing and uh also including
the email right so so far we have
covered everything around hyperlink in
Excel and if you have anything to know
more about or if you feel that we have
missed out anything important regarding
hyperlink in Excel you can feel free to
let us
know so first we will understand what
exactly is standard deviation so
standard deviation is a calculated
square of variance now what is variance
okay nothing to worry let us also
understand what is
variance now the next part variance so
what is variance variance is a measure
of variability it is calculated by
taking the average of of squared
deviations from the mean now what are
deviations so slowly you can understand
that we're getting into the topic of
statistics and graphs so uh before
getting deep into it let's understand
what is deviation so the deviation is a
measure that is used to find the
difference between the observed value
and the expected value of a variable in
simple terms deviation is the distance
from the center point so for example
when you are going through a graph so
you will be expecting some value right
and if you get some difference that is
above or below the expected point that
is called the deviation what is the
difference between the expected point
and the obtained point so that is the
deviation now next is the observed value
so the observed value is the value that
you get in real time unlike the
predicted value so now you might be
thinking to calculate standard deviation
we might need a few more parameters and
you're exactly right so to calculate
standard deviation in Excel you need
variance and then you need deviation and
then you need mean right so all these
parameters are supposed to be calculated
first and then you will be having the
final formula to calculate standard Devi
now that we understood the theoretical
and formula based explanation about
standard deviation it's time we
calculate the standard deviation using
one of the most popular business
intelligence tool that is Microsoft
Excel so let's let's get back to the
Practical
mode so now we are on the Practical mode
and we have some sample data on my
screen right now let me expand it a
little
bit yeah there you go so as discussed
before to calculate standard deviation
we might require the mean variance
deviation and deviation squared and then
we can calculate the standard deviation
so let's go step by step so the first
one is calc calculating sum right so to
calculate average we might need sum of
all the scores so we have the index
values that is 1 to 10 and scores of
each index value that is 1 to 10 right
now let's calculate the sum of all
values here press tab to select the
function select and drag these cells
press enter and then you have the scores
now you want number of indexes so
clearly you can see we have 10 but still
let's count them c n tabs P to select
and select the number of cells press
enter and you have count now what's the
mean so mean is simply the average of
all the numbers right so you can either
divide the sum by count or you can
simply use the average function so let's
try to use the average function so that
we also have an idea of how the average
function Works press tab to select it
and select all the cells press enter now
you have the average or mean value now
we have the mean value and now after
finding the mean value we are supposed
to find out the deviation so remember
the deviation that is the difference
between the obtained value and the
predicted value right so the obtained
value is this one which is here in C2
and the predicted value is this one that
is 82.6 that's our mean right according
to formula we supposed to eliminate the
value of obtained minus the mean right
so select uh the cell equals to
C2 minus the obtained value that is mean
now press F4 to freeze the value and now
press enter so that you can freeze the
value and drag the formula across all
the cells now you have the
deviation
right now the next step is to find the
sum of all the deviation numbers so
either you can apply the sum formula to
all these numbers or you can just drag
this cell over here and the formula will
be automatically copied now similarly
the count function to count all the
values that us drag it and you'll have
it over here right now the next step is
to find out the square deviations or the
square of the deviations which is really
simple all you have to do is equals to
select the cell and uh see that small
hat kind of logo on the number six use
that now into two press
enter you have the square similarly drag
the same formula across all the cells
and you'll have your square numbers
similarly drag this summation function
over here so you'll have the sum of this
and the count number as
well now comes the final
formula now we have the mean value that
is over here let's color
it and we have the the variation
Square now that is which is this one
let's color it in a different shape and
we have deviation as well let's color it
in a different
shape now we need to find the variance
and after we find the variance the last
step is to count the standard deviation
or calculate the standard deviation so
what is the formula to calculate the
variance so for variance you need the
sum of deviation
Square divided by total number of
values minus
one press enter and that's your variance
now the standard deviation so the
standard deviation is really simple you
need to
calculate the variance to the power
of
0.5 and that's your standard deviation
so that's how you calculate standard
deviation in Excel I hope all the
formulas and the explanation was clear
so you can see that we have got started
with Microsoft Excel and on the left
hand side we have a simple table with
all the teams in an IT industry starting
from it admin testing development to
client consultant support we have got
everything in this particular
table now our main idea is to find out
the index of these particular elements
for example if you wanted to find the
index of the element marketing then how
could you do it so here let's try to use
the match function in Excel for that we
want look up value and position so on
the right hand side you can see that
I've created two separate columns as
lookup value and positions so in the
lookup value column we will be inserting
the value of which you want to find the
index now for example let us let us
consider that we want to find the index
value of Team
marketing so I'll be writing Marketing
in this particular lookup
value now how to find the index value of
the element marketing for that we will
be using the match function in
Excel now after writing the match
function you can see that it is asking
for three three different parameters so
the first one is the lookup value second
is the lookup array and lastly we have
match type so lookup value is the value
of which you are trying to find the
index that is marketing this particular
cell so we have selected the lookup
value which is the first one next we
have to select the lookup array that is
from which set of elements you want to
find the index so the set of elements
are this it admin testing the column
which we have created the a column now
we have selected the lookup array and
lastly the match type is it you're
looking for less than or is it you're
looking for exact match or is it greater
than match so for now I want exact match
so I will be selecting the exact match
that is
zero now there you go you have the exact
index of the element that is five now we
have selected all the 10 teams starting
from it1 admin 2 testing three
development 4 marketing five so that's
how you find the index of a selected
element in
Excel now we just have like 10 elements
so we have got the uh writing of the
elements or you know uh choosing the
elements in a easy way but what if if
you had like 100 elements right could be
a little different okay so let me put it
simple now you wanted to find the index
value of Finance so right now we have
marketing and you wanted to type in
finance and you missed out a letter
A okay now you're not finding the right
index to avoid such problems you can
always take the help of data validation
in Excel that is using the list in data
validation in Excel you can see a small
drop- down icon here right you can
choose that and here you can see all the
themes that we have created in the left
column right so here I can scroll down
and choose the finance and there you go
I have the index value okay again we
need to copy paste the same match
function in Excel over
here equals to
match look up
value look up
array and exact
match so there you go that's how you
make use of data validation in Excel and
using the list you can comprehend all
the list elements in this particular
column into the list of data validation
and you can choose the team whichever
you want to find the index for so this
is how you can make use of match
function in Excel or index match
function in Excel to sort data in Excel
so on my spreadsheet you can see some
employee data and on the column f and g
you can see employee date of birth and
employee date of joining for example you
wanted to sort the employee data in the
form of earliest joining employee and
the latest joining employ right that is
who is the employee who joined first to
this company and who is the employee who
joined last to this company so for that
you just need to select the column of
date so let's select both the columns
and go to home and check or verify if
the data type is date or not so
generally the data type will be set to
General by default by Excel so we need
to make sure that we have the proper
data type which is State now that we
have the proper data type select the
entire column and go to the data option
and here select the sort option and in
the sort option select the expand
selection click on sort and here sort by
employ date of joining and oldest to
newest that's what we wanted the oldest
employee or the you can also set it to
the newest employee to oldest according
to your requirement but we'll go to
oldest to newest according to the case
study right now just click on okay and
that should be done so Emily who's a
manager is the oldest employee who
joined the company and Chris who's a
trainee in it support is the latest
employee who joined the company now
that's how you sort date in now on my
screen you can see the sales of four
quarters from different regions that is
east west south north and Central now
you might want to calculate the sum of
sales happened from all the regions in
q1 or you might want to calculate the
sum of sales happened in one region of
all the four quarters that is either you
want to calculate the sum of all the
regions from quarter 1 or you might want
to calculate the sum of all the quarters
in one region right so to do this you
have some simple functions in Excel so
you might say me you have some function
Etc right for that you might want to go
into the you know equals to mode and
fetch some option and subtotal or Su of
you have to select the function from
here but what if I tell you that there
is one simple easy shortcut where you
just have to make one single click and
you'll have all the sum right so that
seems interesting so on the top in the
home select home and in on the top right
corner you have the editing group in
editing group you have aggregation
function that is summation so you have
different aggregations here some average
count numbers maximum minimum more
functions here you might want to select
the sum and you can get all the
sumission numbers here so I'll select
one cell so the second query where we
wanted to calculate the sum of all the
sales happened in east region with all
the quarters included that is this one
C2 to F2 right so let us select G2 and
select the auto sum option and here it
will automatically select the range for
you that is C2 to F2 if you want to
change it you can also you know change
it like minimize the number if you just
wanted to calculate the sum of three
quarters you can do that so now we want
four quarter so select enter and there
you go you have all the sales of all all
the four quarters of east region now if
you simply drag it you will have the sum
of all the four quarters of all
different
regions now let us calculate the
summation of q1 of all the regions that
is this one Select Auto sum and it will
automatically select all the cells for
you that is from C2 to C6 right press
enter and you'll have the summation
similarly you can you know drag it and
you have the numbers here of all the Q2
sales of all the regions Q3 sales of all
region and Q for sales of all region now
let us try to change the color so you
can have a reference that is it's
different it's it's a total sum or right
you just have a reference to identify
it now similarly to this one as
well
so that's how you implement Auto sum in
Excel now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet so you can see that I have
five different sheets of the same data
so why do we have that so I'll be
explaining you how to sort data for
multiple parameters so firstly we will
try to sort data in the form of numbers
right so let us imagine that this data
is being shared with you by your manager
and he wants you to sort this data based
on the salary numbers so he wants you to
arrange the data in the form of
ascending order or descending order
maybe which will help him find the
employee with the highest salary right
so how could you do that so it's really
simple you could sort the entire data
just within a few clicks so how would
you do that so since you're focusing on
salary select any sell from the salary
column only right select this particular
column and select any sell in the salary
column get into the sort and filter
options and here select this sort of
arrangement you need that is largest to
smallest or the smallest to largest
since the problem statement was to find
the highest salary click on largest to
smallest and there you go so you have
Tony and the designation is senior and
he works in it support and he draws the
highest salary of
80,000 right and there's also another
one which is Peppa and she works for the
analytics team and now the next sheet
let's get into the sheet two and this
time let us imagine that you wanted to
you know uh arrange or sort the data
based on the employee date of joining or
date of birth right again if you wanted
to arrange the data in which you find
the youngest employee or the oldest
employee of the organization you can do
that click on any cell in the date of
birth column and go back to the sort and
filter and here you will be seeing the
options sort oldest to the newest or the
sort the data from newest to the oldest
so since we want the oldest employee
select oldest to newest and the EO so
the oldest employee is Alfred who is an
associate designation employee and he
works in the admin department and he's
drawing the salary of
25,000 so that's how you can sort the
data when you are trying to sort the
data based on date wise so first we try
to sort the data on the number wise so
you can apply the same for your employee
ID salary and if there is any
possibility you can do that as well and
if you want to apply the same sorting
based on dates you can do that as well
using the Sorting function in the same
way now let's get back onto the third
sheet and here now uh single column wise
is perfectly fine there is no issues
with that now you wanted to you know uh
let us imagine that you have two columns
okay let's eliminate a few columns here
maybe we can eliminate the employee ID
and uh okay let's keep a few columns so
we'll just keep employ name and employee
salary okay so here we are trying to
demonstrate if you are uh trying to sort
the data using one cell in the column B
will it maintain its relationship with
the cell a okay uh that's our query
right so let's see I'll go a little
detail so let us imagine that you wanted
to sort this data based on highest
salary okay so when you do that will it
also impact the cells in the column A so
it will basically impact but just uh
it's a query right any of you viewers
might have that query will I uh if in
case if I try to sort the data based on
this will it affect the cells on the
rest of the data set okay so in
basically it will impact so I'll try to
you know sort the data based on
ascending
order so this is the smallest to largest
and you can see uh the Tony and pepper
so since I selected the cell in the
column B it also impacted the change on
the cells of column A so that's how the
Sorting works now we'll get to a little
Advanced um sorting techniques so here
we try to I mean already we try to sort
the data based on numbers based on
alphabets based on U you know uh date
date of birth right so I think we forgot
the uh ascending or you know sorting
based on alphabets let's do that as well
select any um cell in the column A and
go to S and filter try selecting a to z
or okay let's try to Z to A okay so here
you can see the U names have been sorted
based on the descending order from Zed
to a right so so far we tried on
alphabets so far we tried on numbers
date of birth and a couple of more than
so let's dig a little deeper and try to
sort based on colors right so for that
you don't uh you know find that uh extra
setting here in the regular sortant
filter so you might want to get into the
data option and here you'll find another
sort function which is a little Advanced
so that's how you do it so since we have
colored in the cell or column of salary
select that salary and we're going with
cell value so in the cell values section
select the cell color and here on the
cell color options you'll have green
blue and yellow that's what we have used
in our um cells so let's keep Green in
the first position which is on top and
press okay now you'll see green has been
sorted to the first position now yellow
and blue are left out so why is that so
because you didn't provide it right so
you can do what that as well um me you
can always add uh the setting to
it right select any cell go to sort and
add a level and then again select the
salary and sell values to sell colors
and now the cell color in the second
position would be blue and that will be
on bottom and I can add another level
the same
salary the cell values will be cell
color and uh cell yellow will be
somewhere in between or bottom okay so
based on hierarchy uh it will be
selecting press
okay and there you go so you have cell
yellow and blue at the bottom and green
at the top position as for your
suggestions now we are on the last sheet
so here in this last sheet we are going
to you know um dig a little deeper into
the advanced sorting methods so
previously we tried to apply the advanc
Sorting method for colors now we'll try
to apply the advanced sorting methods
based on the data set we have here I
mean the data we have in our data set
right so select the sort option and
let's add a few details right so firstly
let's sort the column employee ID okay
so let's have the smallest to largest or
yeah now that would be good now let's
add another level where we will
sort okay uh I think we will sort based
on employee name that would be a little
better so let's try to uh sort it on
employee name here and here will be
employee salary okay now the cell values
and this would be from a to zed and the
salaries will be from smallest to
largest so basically what we are trying
to do is we are trying to sort the
employee list based on employee names
from a to zed so the employe name
starting from a to zed will be ordered
first and another subset of the Sorting
will be done based on highest salaries
that is smallest to highest so let us
imagine that we have three employees
with Nam starting from a and their
salaries are 10,000 20,000 and 30,000 so
how would it sort so it will sort
basically uh in the alphabetical order
first so first three names will be
sorted and then it will also have
another condition to sort the data with
keeping the lowest salary on top and
highest salary in the last right so uh
this is how the algorithm works for
sorting now let's press okay and see the
output so there you go the names are
Alfred and you have the highest salary
here smallest to highest so this is
25,000 next we have Banner Barnes and
Ben so here you might be seeing why we
have Ben in the third position despite
he has the low salary and name starts
with B right so here it is trying to
work based on on the alphabets in the
order right so B A and B E it's not just
comparing the first letter it's also
comparing the following letters as well
right so n comes first R comes later so
B is pushed to the second position a
comes first and E comes later so B A
letters are pushed to the first position
and Ben is pushed to the third position
so that's how it works right so
accordingly the set for BA is created
here 3540 next Ben 12 and next you have
Bobby Brian Brock Chris Clark right so
that's how the data has been organized
and sorted based on multiple levels of
parameters you provide for sorting so
that's how you use sorting in Excel
slicers and filters in Excel so slices
in Excel are software filters used along
with Excel tables or Excel pivot tables
over a large amount of data not just
filtering out data but slices also help
you with an easy understanding of the
information being extracted and
displayed on the screen now Microsoft
Excel slices are compatible with Windows
and Mac and Tosh operating systems now
let us understand how to implement
slicers in Excel so for that we might
want to get back to the Practical mode
that is starting our Microsoft
Excel now we are on our Excel sheet and
as you can see on my screen there is
some data available on the Excel
spreadsheet and this table is not just
any table this table from Microsoft
Excel is been converted into an actual
table as you know by default Excel
considers all the data which has been
inserted into the spreadsheet as a
database and to implement this slices in
Excel we might want to create or convert
the format of database into a normal
table for that you can select all your
data and just press contr T and that
will allow you an option called convert
the data into table
now since this table is already
converted as a table we can directly
start implementing or inserting slices
into the
spreadsheet now for that select all your
data then going to the insert
option and in the insert ribbon you can
see the filters group and in the filters
group select the option called slicer
now you will be provided with multiple
op options since we have the columns
employee ID employee name Zone
designation Department salary employees
date of birth and employees state of
joining so we can choose any of the
options available according to our
columns and create the slices now let me
select the first one that is Zone next
designation department and let's also
select employee
name now press okay and there you go we
have our slices now let us try to
rearrange these slices all you can do is
just select and drag them
up and done now let us imagine that we
want to see or take a look at the
employees who are working in the EAS
Zone then we have all the information
displayed on the screen who are working
in the East Zone they are Jack Tony bner
Fred Etc and their Department
designation etc etc all on one single
screen so this really helps you while
you're presenting your data in a
presentation now for a change let's try
to select the department now if your
client wants to select the data from
only analytics Department then you might
want to select on the analytics key on
the department slicer and there you go
you have an employee called Luke hops
who works in the East Zone and his
department is analytics and his
designation is contract based and the
salary he is getting is
65,000 now
similarly uh you can see that we have
only selected analytics and your client
also wants data from it support now you
can see that analytics is gone but what
if you want both analytics and it
support then you have an option called
select multiple then you can select
analytics and it support and if you want
HR you can also do that and in the zone
if you want West along with East then
you can do the same east and west and
you have all the employee details and in
the designation let's try to select U
senior
traine okay select multiple senior
traine and manager so that's how you do
it so that's how it's done and that's
how you Implement slicers in Excel to
simplify the filtering options using
slicers during a presentation it is
really simple to add filters in Excel so
we are on a practical mod right now so
on my screen you can see an Excel
spreadsheet of sales data so here you
have various columns regions category
state subcategory sales quantity and
much more right so now let us imagine
that we want to add filters on the
region part so we have south west east
Etc right so we want to you know let us
imagine that you want to extract the
data of only vest region and you wanted
a filter so doing it manually could take
a lot of time so using filters will be
helpful now select one cell on the
headers part and select the filter
option in the data toolbar you can see
the data option on the toolbar right so
click on the data option and navigate to
sort and filter uh group and in that
select the option of filter now you can
see the filters are been added to all
the column headers region category state
subcategory sales quantity right now we
wanted the West category so when you see
or when you click on the drop down icon
you can see all the options are selected
right the central east west south every
everything right but now we just want
West one so click on West and select
okay there you go so you have everything
from the west region now let's imagine
that you wanted to look into uh office
supplies only or technology only right
you can do the same with the technology
and press okay and now you'll have all
the technology related sales in the west
region right so that's how you use
filters in Excel however if you are
looking to get certified then hey there
we are here with an amazing course

so what is data validation in Excel so
it is a feature by Microsoft Excel where
it can restrict data entry into certain
cells by using data validation and it
will prompt the users to enter valid
data in the cells based on the rules and
restrictions provided by the creator of
that particular sheet now this would be
a little confusing to understand so to
understand it in a much better way let's
get back to the practical way where we
will start entering some data validation
rules to our Excel sheet and try to
enter data into it now we are on the
Microsoft Excel and this particular
sheet is based on employee ID employee
name employee Department employee salary
fiscal year and work timings of the
employees now we will be applying some
data validation rules to each and every
column and try to enter data based on
the rules we have entered now for the
first one which is the employee ID we'll
enter rules based on the employe ID
number so to apply the data validation
you need to go into the data tab on the
toolbar and inside the ribbon you can
see data tools group and in the data
tools group you have the option of data
validation now select the entire column
go to the data tools group select data
validation option and you will have this
particular popup menu and here you can
see different types of options so since
we are entering employe ID it would be a
whole number so let us select whole
number option and now here you can see
the option of between not equal to equal
to not between greater than less than
Etc so let us select between and let us
assume that your employee ID has five
numbers and uh it should be between
10,000 to
11,000 so let us provide
10,000 and
11,000 now select okay and now the new
rule has been
applied so now the minimum value of each
and every employee ID should be equal to
or more than 10,000 and less than 11,000
and it should have five digits now let's
try to enter a wrong employee ID that is
just one
there you go you can see that Microsoft
Excel is not allowing you to include a
wrong number it says this value does not
match the data validation restrictions
defined for this cell so now you can
press retry and try to enter some number
which is in between 10,000 to
11,000 now it is
10,901 and this will take the
entry now let us assume that because I'm
the creator of this sheet I know what
should be entered here but what if I
give this sheet to you and you're the
person who's trying to enter the number
and it shows the error and you don't
know what was the error right to avoid
this kind of confusion what you can do
is you can do some uh ways where you can
provide the message to the user so that
can be done by okay let's select the
sheet again and go to the data
validation and here you have the same
settings now here you have another
option saying input message so before
input message let us go to error alert
now
here the error title would be data
entered is not
valid please enter this is the error
message please
enter EMP
ID
between
10,000 to
11,000 press okay now when you try to
enter the wrong number it will show that
particular error alert
message see data entered is not valid
please enter employee ID between 10,000
to 11,000 now this is fine but how long
this will be you know what if there is
an option where you just hover over to
this cell and it automatically tells you
to enter the value between 10,000 to
11,000 without having to face the error
yeah even that can be done so you can
select the entire column go to data
validation and here this is the input
message this is where you can do that so
here you can write the message name
valid
data please please
enter data
between 10,000 to 11,000 now when you
hover over to any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
show you this message where you can
avoid all the errors just select okay
see when you select any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
tell you please enter data between
10,000 to 11,000 so here you don't have
to face any errors right now let us try
to enter the valid
data
109
02 and it will take it as the correct
value and again 1
903 now in case if you try to provide
the wrong number it will show the
error
see so that's how it is now we have
finished the whole number part now let's
get into the employee name where we have
to
provide uh the second type that is text
length now let us imagine that uh in
your company you're trying to provide ID
cards to your employees and you know
that ID card is really small and inside
that ID card you need to include the
employee photograph and your company
name employee ID blood group phone
number address everything and also you
need to include the name of the employee
so what if there is an employee with
very lengthy name like 30 characters 40
characters yeah in India it is really
possible that you might have a lengthy
name so what you can do is you can
provide the text length where the text
is limited to like 15 or 20 uh um
characters so you can include that name
in the ID card so you can do that by
allowing the data validation criteria
with text length uh minimum can be
anything so minimum can be one and
maximum here you can provide 15 and
press okay okay minimum will change it
to at least uh
two and yeah let it be one so minimum is
one and maximum is 15 characters and
press okay and uh let us also provide
the input
message
enter character type character
data
please enter valid
name and error
[Music]
alert invalid
data please enter valid
data okay please enter
characters less than 50
press
okay now let us try to enter a random
name okay uh we'll enter characters more
than 15 here
qu
z uh yeah it's like 1 2 3 4 5
11 okay now this is more than
15 okay I think it's not more than 15
let's try to enter a little bit more
characters
yeah now we have entered more than 15
characters and it is showing please
enter characters less than 15 so now we
can retry and try to enter some valid
name
um now we have characters less than 50
so it will take as the proper name now
let us try to enter another
name
I'm just entering some random
data so another name
maybe great now the next type of data
validation is also done now let us get
into employee Department employee
department is something really superb so
I'll tell you about it it's actually a
list now let us finish the
other ones first that is employee salary
physical year and work timings after
that we'll learn about uh the list
one now let's come into employee salary
so salary is something where you have to
include decimal points so now let us go
to uh data validation and inside the
values we have already dealt with whole
number uh text
length yeah now we'll deal with employee
salary that is decimal now minimum is
okay what is the uh minimum can be
1. 0 and maximum can
be 1
lakh or let us put that as 10
lakhs press okay okay not not just then
uh enter
valid
salary okay now let's change it to
minimum is
10,000 so the employee minimum salary
will be 10,000 and input enter valid
salary
enter
salary
between 10,000
to 10
lakhs let us include a comma here
too now error
alert invalid
salary please
enter
between
10,000 to 10
lakhs press okay now the message and the
data validation conditions are apply to
this column now let us try to enter some
invalid data first it will show the
error now we need to enter the valid
data yeah now it is taking the valid
data let us provide
20,000 and this has
35,000 now the next one is fiscally let
us imagine that we wanted to you know
work on the employees for current
working year that is 2020 to
2021 and or you can consider 2021 to
2022 not more than 2021 and not less
than 2021 for that you can provide the
year option as well
so for that you need to select the
entire column go to data validation
settings and inside here you have an
option of date so uh let us provide the
date option as between and start date is
01/01 SL
2021 and end date is
01/01
SL
2022 and input message
let us provide data as
current fiscal
year Current financial
year enter
date
between 20121 to
2022 let us copy this and go into error
alert error message will be S
invalid date
select okay now the error message and uh
the data input message and the data
validation rule has been applied for
this column so let's try to enter some
date here you can enter uh 02 of
February
2021 it will take as the correct data
now let's try to enter some wrong data
which is apart from 2022 02
02 20
22 it will not take this it will throw
error so that's how it works now let us
try to enter uh is
2021 and this is March it will take it
now another
data 04 this time and
2021 so that's how your uh date data
validation will work now coming into the
next type of data validation that is
time so we have time here let us imagine
that you are providing some work timings
to your employees that should be from
9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. not more than
that so you want to keep your work life
balanc for all your employees so you
just want them to work between 9 to 5
and that should be fine and anything
apart from that time should be invalid
so you can do that by selecting uh time
option between it should be in between
and the start time will be
09 0 0 and this should
be
uh
17 that is 5:00 p.m. in the
evening and input
message please
enter time
between 9
a.m. to
okay 5
p.m this should be the input
message
now error
alert invalid
time error message okay
now okay work timings now this should be
okay we can do this as two columns
actually let us
cancel let us copy this and paste it
here you can do it as
login login timing and this should be
okay this should be a log
out so this should
be okay so this will be considered as
login and log out times now let us Pro
provide the login time this should be
the right time and uh let's try to
provide wrong timings 08 now it will not
take it it will throw as error so it's
working fine let us provide 10 now let
us provide the log out time it should be
below 5:00 p.m. so let us provide 5 it
will take
it
okay let's try to provide some something
just 1 minute less than
5 that is
59 okay there is some problem in this
let's check
it okay it is taking uh three that is
including
seconds okay let's provide seconds as
well
well 05 0 0 0
0 okay still there is some
problem okay we have entered 4 we should
we are supposed to enter 24hour timing
right
14 okay uh it should be 17 I think this
will work yeah now we are following
24-hour timing here so let's provide
another timing that is
16 30 0 0 this will be valid and
1530 yes this is also valid now we have
finished almost all types of uh data
data validation things that is we have
finished with any value whole number
decimal date timing test length and the
last one is list so this is where things
get interesting now let's cancel this
now select the employee column now if
you're running a company then definitely
you'll not have only one Department in
it you might have multiple departments
right so let us consider that you have a
software development company so in that
the basic departments will be software
development team and software testing
team so what you can do is you can
provide a list so using that list you
can just uh H over to that cell select
the drop down menu and inside that you
can select the option so we will try to
work something like that if we have
selected the entire
colum selection
okay yeah let us select the entire
column again go to data validation the
selection contains some cells without
data validation settings do you want to
extend data validation to the sales
yes now let us provide the list
option
[Music]
and here Source you can provide
as
developer and
tester press okay
okay now input message
select
one select
one error
alert
invalid
data select from
dropdown
only press okay now when you select the
cell you can see small drop down icon
right so when you press it you will have
developer and tester option so you can
select developer for first one and for
second one you can select uh tester
right okay this is good for uh one or
two options maybe three or even maybe
like five but what if you have more
departments okay let's go to this uh
second sheet where we have the
department data so here we have like 14
departments no 15 departments or 15
employ type names so the first one is
CEO second is developer tester quality
analyst system analyst Finance human
resource so so many options are there so
you cannot keep on typing all of them
right so here it is 15 what if you have
like 25 like 50 departments right it
will be tough so for this you have
another option so let me select all this
data and copy this from this sheet to
our employ
sheet let us paste it
somewhere here
let's expand
this okay now we have our uh list over
here now let us remove the data
validation from this
column clear all okay now everything is
cleared let's select okay now let us
arase this data as
well now let us apply the list data
validation again from scratch go to list
now here we can select the
source select this particular
cell and drag it until here and it has
been
loaded now go to input
message data
options select one from the menu or the
drop
down copy error
alert select only from the drop down
menu invalid entry yeah now let's select
okay fine now you have the icon here you
have all the Prov Ed
options you can scroll down and select
any one out of these you can select
knowledge transfer for the first one and
second one would be system
analyist and the last one would
be human
resources now in the list everything is
fine okay this is showing you the menu
options and everything so but what if
you provide this sheet to your new joiny
or new employe in your company and by
mistake he messes up something like
delete in this okay so we have deleted
systems analyst and when you click on
the options here you don't have systems
analyst in that place you have blank
space right so there is a way where all
your uh you know data can be messed up
so to avoid this what you can do is you
can actually um save this data in a
different sheet like I did here like
Department data you can hide this sheet
or you can protect this sheet with
password or something so that nobody can
mess this up so now let us get back to
the employee data and select this column
and uh clear everything press okay and
let us also clear
this and this as well this one too now
let us eliminate the rows or
cells the employee yeah
everything
okay now we have basically removed this
data from here now let us try to apply
the data validation once
again now here let us select as
list and
uh here let us provide the option let us
go to next sheet let us select all these
options and press okay okay let's
provide input
message data
options or Department
options
yeah now let's select
okay now let's hide this sheet now the
sheet has been hidden and you still have
the
options
developer or let us provide cu
then we have
developer then we
have
test so that's how you can protect your
how to protect and lock cells in Excel
now why do we need to log our protect
cells in Excel let us imagine that there
is an Excel sheet with really
confidential data and you need to pass
that data to your subordinate or your
colleague to make some minor edits now
let us imagine that the edit are
supposed to be done to only one or two
columns and rest of the columns should
be left as they are now there is a huge
possibility that sometimes unknowingly
or unwillingly there might be some edits
done by your colleague or your
subordinate So to avoid such kind of
unexpected mistakes you might want to
protect and lock yourselves that you
don't want your subordinate or your
colleague to edit so before we begin be
kind enough to get subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to stay updated on the
latest it Trends and Tech
content now without further Ado let's
get started with our onepoint agenda
that is lock or protect cells in Excel
now let's get back into the Practical
mode and start our Microsoft Excel now
we are on the Microsoft Excel and this
particular spreadsheet is related to
employee
details yeah now the screen is visible a
bit better now let us imagine that this
is our confidential data and you wanton
to edit only two columns that is the
designation column and phone number
column now let us imagine that the
company has finished one annual year and
now there are some promotions happening
in the company and let us also imagine
that the phone numbers of the employees
provided by the company have undergone
some changes so now the minor edits that
you want to make are related to the
designation column and phone number
column now you can see that all the
columns that is the blood group new
salary salary hike current salary and
name of the employee serial number
employee number everything is editable
so in such kind of scenarios when you
pass on this data there might be a
possibility where your colleague or
subordinate might end up making some
mistakes right so you want to avoid that
so you can do that by locking the CES
now let us rename the
sheet now the sheet has been renamed
successfully so now you can log the
cells by the following
process so in this process you have two
major steps first one is to log the
cells and the next one is to protect the
cells by a password now when you select
all the cells in this particular sheet
you can just click on this edge here and
you have all the cells selected and now
right click somewhere on the sheet and
you can see an option called format
CS so in this particular option you have
some options provided which is number
alignment font and you want to go into
the protection part so you can see by
default Excel keeps all the cells locked
now we want the phone number and
designation to be unlocked okay so let's
cancel it for now and get back to the
sheet and select the columns D and I and
now let's right click and go into format
Cs and in the protection option make
sure that you uncheck the loged icon now
select okay and
now okay so you cannot include the
merged cell fine we have a cell here
which is merged okay let's remove
that okay now again select the entire
column right click get into format cells
and uncheck the lock option select
okay now we have finished the first part
that is locking all the cells which you
don't want to get edit and unlocking the
cells where you want to make some edits
now the second stage is protecting the
sheet now right click on the sheet name
and you can see an option called protect
sheet click that and now here you can
see select lck cells and also select
unlock cells so let us provide a
password here so let us use some simple
password so that we don't forget that so
I'll be selecting 1 2 3 and now select
okay re-enter the password to proceed
now let us type 1 2 3 again now select
okay and now the sheet is
protected now we have successfully loged
and protected all the cells in Excel now
let us verify that the cells you wanted
to protect are really protected and
locked or not so we have unlocked phone
number and designation
and everything else is locked now let me
try and edit the blood group so when I
double click or try to edit this
particular sheet then I'll be receiving
a warning from Excel it says the cell or
chart you're trying to change is on a
protected sheet to make a change
unprotect the sheet you might be
requested to enter a
password so it says that this particular
cell is locked and you cannot edit it
now let us try to edit the phone numbers
which we kept as unlocked
so you can see I can really edit the
unlocked cell here now let me try to
change this phone number let me enter
some random phone
number so you can see the cell is
editable now let us go through the
designation column and try to edit this
particular column now since I said that
there's a promotion happening in the
company so the deputy CEO is now the
current CEO of the company and soft Ware
developer happens to become the senior
software developer and the tester as
well let us imagine that he will become
the
senior and so on okay so this proves
that this particular sheet is editable
not the entire sheet but only the Cs
that we kept in the unlock
mode
okay now this is how you lck and protect
your sales in ex now you can see that I
have sales data on my worksheet so uh
let us imagine that your manager asked
you to find the average of sales
happening in your company right so let's
navigate to the bottommost cell and you
know write it down as average
here okay average
sales
so here this is a cell where you want to
keep your average right so here we'll be
writing a small formula that is
average and tab to select it now you
must select the array of data
right so this is my array since average
is an array function and now press enter
so there you go you have the average
sales data that happened in your
company so to understand stand the page
setup in msxl we will go through a demo
inventory in Excel where we'll be
considering some restaurant data now
without any delay let's get started with
the Practical demo now we are on the
Excel sheet and this is the data I was
talking about the restaurant data where
we have the First Column that is Rank
and next we have the restaurant name
followed by that we have the sales
happening through that restaurant and
then we have the segment category that
is what kind of service does that
particular restaurant office now this is
the list what we made and uh what if we
wanted to represent this data in the
form of a printed paper right so I guess
you can see all the columns and rows
here so you can see that we have almost
like 250 rows so there is no chance or
there is no way to print all those 250
rows in one page of course it is
practically possible but when you try to
read the content it will be so tough to
read Because all the rows will be clued
together so closely so that you cannot
read it so uh you need to print them
Page by page so and you need to also
take care of the data is aligned
properly according to the page size
everything and even you need to take
care of the margins of your page right
so that's what page set up basically
means so we had a detailed overview of
our data and what actually we're trying
to make now let us see how page setup is
possible ible in msxl so to go to the
page setup menu or go to the page setup
options we have three methods let's
start with the simplest method so the
simplest method is by just clicking on
file and go to print
option and you'll see all the page setup
options right over here and you can also
go to print menu by pressing a shortcut
method that is control V so you'll
directly end up on the page set of
options now let's look at the second
method so the second method is you can
see the toolbar over here right which
has file home insert draw page layout
formulas data review View and help so
the second method we can use page layout
option from the toolbar and you can see
when you click on the page option from
the toolbar you have a new ribbon over
here so this ribbon is all about page
setup options so it will offer you
margins it will offer you orientation
size print area brakes background print
tiles etc etc right so all these options
or menus in this ribbon belong to page
setup now let us look at the third
method so the third method is something
similar you have view option on the
toolbar so just select View and you can
see we have few page setup options over
here as well the normal page break page
layout custom views and we have grid
lines formula bar heading zoom in zoom
out select to zoom free certain panes
right so all these are also the page
setup options so we have the three
methods to enter the page setup options
now we are familiar with those now let's
get started with the Practical mode on
page setup for that let me use the
simplest method that is holding the
control key and pressing P which
navigates me to the print
option now we have various set of
options here we have no scaling normal
margins letter portrait orientation
collated print active sheets and note
one for Windows you can see this option
is the printers option for example if
you're connected to a printer which is
the hardware printer then your msxl will
show the printer's name here
so other than printer you can also make
some other arrangements where you can
just directly print your complete data
in the form of PDF and then you can
export your PDF to your recipent that's
also possible okay now let's get started
with the first option that is print
active pages okay to understand this
better we need to create a new sheet not
a problem so you can see that we just
have one sheet over
here so let us kind of Select all the
items and create a new sheet and try to
paste it over here or let's try to paste
it over
here okay now let's try to extend
these yeah this should be fine now let's
rename the sheet sheet uh or let's
rename it as restant
FR sheet
2 for our reference now let us get back
to the print sheet option so I'll use
the shortest method that is holding the
control key and press P now you can see
that here we have six pages in total
from the active sheets so the current
active sheet is the top 250 sheet so
this particular sheet is the current
active sheet so if you print the entire
data in this particular sheet then we
will end up printing six pages now let
us select the other option where you
have to print the entire workbook right
so now you can see that there's a change
in the number that is 12 pages so what
is a workbook so basically workbook is
the collection of entire sheets in your
Excel homepage so in this particular
Excel homepage you have the first sheet
that is top 250 and the second sheet
that is the resturant sheet two right so
the combination of these two sheets make
up a
workbook so when you select the entire
workbook option you'll have 12 pages so
that's how we use this setting where you
select the active sheets the entire
workbook and there is another option
where you can only print a selected item
so if you want to do this then let's get
back here now what if your customer or
what if your client wanted the top 10
restaurants only so so you can select
the top 10
restaurants by doing
this now you have the top 10 restaurants
let's go to
print so you can see Excel has
automatically selected the selection
only print the selected content only so
you can see we have only the top 10
restaurants or top 11 restaurants that
we have selected in our sheet and it is
ready to get printed so this is how we
use the first option now let's get back
let's not select that and let's make the
pages normal now get back to the print
option again now you can see the next
option that is
cated right so in cated you have
different different options that is 1 2
3 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 and the next one which
is uncollated 1 1 1 222 333 so why are
these numbers present here and what does
collected mean anyway so this is your
question right now the answer for this
question will be a little similar to
your examination Hall okay let us
imagine that you are an examination Hall
and you are the invigilator and you have
10 students in your room so you wanted
to provide question papers to all the 10
students okay so you have your question
question paper distributed into three
sheets that is you have marked questions
and your questions are fit into three
papers right in this scenario we have
250 rows and all the data is split into
six sheets that is sheet one or page one
page two page three page four right now
if we wanted to print 10 copies then the
arrangement of papers will be page 1
page two page three page 4 page five
page six in continuous order right that
is cated if you wanted 10 copies of
different different ways where you
wanted to print the first sheet first
then you wanted to print the second
sheet second and the third sheet third
that is you'll have 10 copies of first
page 10 copies of second page 10 copies
of third page and so on that particular
approach is called uncollated approach
and if you're printing the pages in
continuous order for 10 times then that
that particular approach is called as
collated approach so this is what we had
to learn about collated and uncollated
now let's get back to the third option
now let's press again print now we have
our data over
here there's something
wrong select all the elements control P
yeah now we have our data back now we
have the third option that is the
portrait
orientation okay so when we click that
we have two options that is portrait and
landscape so you might be having a good
idea like when you try to click a
picture in your phone we have two modes
as well that is portrait mode and the
landscape mode so when you click on the
portrait mode this is how your data will
be looking now to understand the
difference let's click the landscape
mode so when you click the landscape
mode this is how your data
representation will change you'll have a
wider page to print so this is why we
use use the page orientation for now
let's get the page orientation as
portrait
orientation and we have now the fourth
option so what is the fourth option we
have various sets of options in here
that is letter and A4 size there are
also some more page options over here
where you can select the page types you
want to
print so basically you'll be having few
more options that is A4 A5 A3 Etc but
here we just have two that is A4 and
letter so basically you'll get those
options and followed by that next we
have margins so here you can see we
don't have any margins for our data okay
so now we can add some margins by
setting up this one as an option like
last custom setting or we can also
choose normal wide narrow right so your
page will be changed according to your
margin
size right so this is how you can change
the margins now let's keep it as default
let's set the normal
one now we have the next option that is
scaling
option so here you can see we are trying
to fit the page so when you're trying to
print these sheets you using no scaling
then the actual size of the page will be
printed now you can also modify that you
can fit and print these sizes so you can
remember the first option that I said of
printing all the 250 rows in one single
sheet this is how you can fit it so fit
the sheet on one page where you can see
all the 250 rows are fit into one page
but the data is not readable so but we
don't want this type of an approach
right so let's keep keep it as the
default one which is no scaling so these
are the variety of options in print now
if you wanted to print the all the six
pages into the PDF format and mail it to
your client you can also do that I think
I have explained it in the first place
so you can see we can do it by just
selecting this option where you can
print all the six pages and into PDF
format and then you can mail them to
your
client and you can also select the
number of copies you want you can
increase the copies to two three and any
number of uh copies you want for now
I'll keep it as one
[Music]
copy now let's print
this now let us select
the
location
rename it and
publish now let's get back to documents
and see if the page is printed or
not here we go here we have the restant
data in the form of
PDF so we have our entire six pages of
data in the PDF
format
now we are back on the homepage now we
had some limited functions in the print
function over here we had tried to
export the data so you can also export
the data or try to print it from the
print option over here you can just
select that as
well
file
PDF yes the pages are printed
now there you go we have the restaurant
2 PDF
[Music]
data so that's how you can print all
your data you can either
choose the export option or you can
either choose print option now when you
see into the print option we have
limited number of page setup options
over here now let's check out what we
missed so we are in the page layout here
so we had gone through the margins we
had set all the margins and then we have
also gone through the portrait and
landscape now you can see this size when
we were in the print menu option we had
only A4 and letter but here you can see
there are a wide variety of options that
is other than letter we have tabloid
legal statement executive
A3 right we have A5 and many more other
options and if you want some more paper
options you can go to more and you can
always select a few more options that's
how you do it and yeah we didn't had the
break option so remember when we had
been through the print option we did not
have the break option there let's select
this to nor A4 so you cannot see the
break option over here right so here we
have the break option so what does break
option does right you can actually break
the page uh remember we spoke about the
top 10 things or the top 10 rows you can
always do that so you can just keep the
top 10 restaurants in your first page
and then break the remaining and to set
page breaks you can select the cell now
I need the top 10 so I'll select this
particular cell which is in the 11th
position and now I'll try to implement
the page break insert a page break and
now you can see on my sheet there is a
thin line which is separating the two
pages that's how you can see the
indication of a page break implemented
onto your page now how do you see it you
can see it by selecting control P where
you can see the first top 10 restaurants
being printed on your sheet so there you
go we have the first first top 10
restaurants printed on our sheets so
that's how you use the page
break now let's try to eliminate all the
page breaks so you can select braks and
reset all page braks so the page break
has been
eliminated now you can always choose a
background for your data as well you
just uh if you want you can add a
picture to your background I think
that's not available for
now okay you can work offline as well
let us select this
one so you can see that we have added a
background to our
data we can select all the text files
and then we can change the color so that
the text becomes a little visible yeah
that's how you do it now if you don't
want the image to be added on your file
you can also remove that delete page
background and there you go all the
images are gone now the next important
part that is the print
titles now why do we need print titles
for that let's try to print this so now
you can see the first page in the first
page we have the title rank restaurant
sales segment category but if you go to
the second page you don't have that
title right you don't have the title
rank name of the restaurant sales and
their service category so if we want
that then we need to add titles
now for that let's select the print
titles option now let's select the row
to repeat on top now for that we need
the first row select the first row and
this particular row will be repeating
into all the pages now let's try to
print it so yeah now you can see the
titles are being added to all the sheets
you can see the page two page three page
four page five and page six so you can
see the titles added to all the sheets
now we are on the spreadsheet so here
what exactly are page breaks so page
breakes are something which help you
during your trying to print your data or
present your data in the form of a web
page right in those times you cannot fit
your entire Excel data in one
spreadsheet or one paper or one web page
right so in those scenarios Excel will
try to eliminate a few parts of your
spreadsheet or it will try to split the
spreadsheet so how exactly it looks like
so go to the The View option and click
on The View and click on page break
preview here you can see the dotted
lines right so these are the things
which separate your data in form of
pages so that it can be printable on one
single page so some of the times the
user or the xuser manually inserts a
page break right so how do you insert it
just go to the page layout and here you
can see the page breaks insert a page
break and you have success inserted a
page break again go to the view go to
page break View and here you can see the
solid line so these solid ones are the
ones which are inserted by the users or
anyone who had the access to the data
now how do we eliminate them right so we
can eliminate them and we can try to you
know get the sheet back to the normal
way so all you have to do is click on
the cell which has the page break which
is right under the page break go to the
insert page break yeah page layout menu
go to the brakes option click on remove
page break and there you go you have
successfully eliminated the page break
and page break preview to make sure that
the page break has been successfully
removed so you cannot see that anymore
so that's how you try to insert or
eliminate a page break in Excel so
conditional formatting is a method to
visualize your worksheet we already have
the charts in Excel to visualize our
Excel sheets in in graphical form but
what if you had to see or visualize the
data in your worksheet as it is so that
is where the conditional formatting
comes handy now let's get back to the
Microsoft Excel and try to implement
some conditional formatting now we are
on the Excel work sheeet this particular
data set is based on a store now we have
various columns in this particular data
set we have row ID order ID customer
name Etc and finally we have quantity
discount and profits
now let's go to profits uh let us
imagine that we have provided this
particular store with a target of
minimum 15% profits now let us find out
the stores that have hit the 15% Target
and the ones which did not so for that
let us select the entire column now you
can find the conditional formatting
option in the home toolbar and in that
ribbon the ribbon with Styles has the
conditional formatting option click on
that and you have have various options
over here highlighting the cells top
bottom rules datab bars data scales and
icons so data bars are actually the bar
graphs which highlight themselves on
each and every cell if you implement
them and these are the color scales if
you want to implement some colors you
can go through that and if you want to
represent your CS with icons you can
also do that for now let's highlight the
cells so select that and inside this
select the greater than option and here
you can provide the percentage that is
15% and the sales or the stores which
hit the target should be highlighted
with green color and select okay and
there you go you have your stores that
hit the 15% Target and the ones which
did not hit the 15% Target now if we
want to highlight the ones which did not
hit the 15% Target you can highlight
them with the color
red so conditional formatting highlight
the Cs less than
15% with color red and text dark and
there you go it's done now let us
consider another example so this
particular example is based on train
data set and here we have the passenger
ID survived passenger class name Etc now
we have a train accident incident over
here now one is indicated that they are
alive and zero is indicated that they
are not alive now let us use this column
and conditional formatting highlight the
cells containing the text as one with
color
green
okay
and highlight the
cells that contain text zero as red that
indicates they are not
alive and let us select the icons
now we have the icons over here the X
indicates that they're not alive and the
Green Tech Mark indicates that they are
alive now that is how you use
conditional formatting in Excel Excel
now here on my spreadsheet you can see
some data so this particular data has
some color markings so we have used
color codes to Mark the designations of
all the employees with different colors
so for example blue for manager purple
for senior and so on right now our duty
is to count the total number of
employees present in a company based on
the color code this can be done using
filters but let's try with color codes
now we don't have a readily available
function in Excel to count cells based
on the colors but we can make use of
macro now to make use of macro you might
want to enable the developer options so
by default these will be disabled in
Excel to enable them right click on the
toolbar and you can see this particular
option click on the customize ribbon
option and you will be provided with
various set of options now on the right
side you can see developer options so
make sure the checkbox is clicked to
enable developer options and press on
okay to completely enable developer
window right now when you click on
developer options you can see various
options here visual Basics macro Etc now
click on the macro to create a macro now
just give a name to the macro function
so I'll give simply
long and press on create to create that
particular macro function so we have
already created a macro that is Count
colored cells which we will be using in
our current spreadsheet for counting the
colored cells now let us erase the newly
created function now getting back to the
original code so how does this
particular count colored cells works so
let us understand the function first
then we will try to make use of it in
the spreadsheet so the function name is
Count colored cells as you can see and
this particular function will have two
parameters current cell and spreadsheet
area so the current cell will be the
cell address where the color you want to
count is present and then the
spreadsheet area so what is the range of
cells where you want to locate that
particular color and count the number of
repetition that is the spreadsheet area
and then comes the variables used
colored cell range color code and color
cell count so the colored cell which
particular cell is having that
particular color and what color code is
involved in that colored cell and
colored cell count so what is the total
count what is the total number of
colored cells you have in that
particular range that is colored cell
count now let us consider color code is
equals to current cell interior color
that is current cell do interior do
color so this is the function which will
identify the interior color of a
selected cell let us imagine that
initially color code is equals to the
current cell's color code okay now we
will have the for Loop and that for Loop
will include colored cell which is the
current cell in the spreadsheet area and
if the colored cell the currently
selected colored cell do interior do
color is equals to the color code that
we have selected then colored cell count
the variable which is used to count the
number number of colored cells is equals
to + one initially by default it will be
zero in case if this particular if
condition is true that is the current
cell color and the color code given is
equals to same then the value of colored
cell will increase by one and this
particular if Loop will run as many
number of times the condition is true so
let us imagine that the condition will
remain true for five times then we have
obtained five similarly colored cells in
the given range of cells in a
spreadsheet and once the condition fails
then the latest value present in color
cell count variable will be displayed
which will be a final result so this is
how the macro function works now let's
close the macro window and get back to
our spreadsheet now let us try to make
use of the macro function that we just
created so that is equals to count
colored cells press tab to select the
macro function and the first one is the
current cell so the this is the current
cell where the current color is being
provided comma this cell range so our
cell range will be from C2 to
c31 right so this is the range where we
want to count the similarly colored
cells that is sky blue colored cells
close the function and press enter now
you can see the function has identified
six repetition of sky blue color in this
particular range of cells now you can
drag the same formula across all the
cells and and it will be providing the
results of the same so six senior colors
that is pink or purple color then two
reputations of this particular color two
reputations of trainy color five for
dark blue and six for green right so
this is how the macro function works and
the key point to remember here is this
particular macro will work only for
manually colored cells so there are
situations where we have used
conditional formatting to color a single
cell let us imagine that we have used
conditional formatting to recognize the
employees with salary above 30,000 as
green color and if you try to use that
particular green color to be counted by
the color count cells function no it
will not happen it will not consider
that color as a feedback or an input now
in future we will also try to design a
macro which can recognize the colors
made by conditional formatting as well
but this particular function will be
exclusively used for manually colored
cells only dated IF function is Major
used to find the differences between two
individual dates so it is also called as
dated if by a few people and a few
people also reference it to date diff
that is date difference so anything is
good now to find the difference between
any two dates let's select a few dates
so the first date would be uh let us
imagine that you're an employee and you
wanted to find out how many years that
you've been working with an organization
so for that you might want to need today
and the date where you join the company
right so it might be date of joining and
today so what's the difference right so
let us imagine that you join the
organization somewhere around
2010 0
1
05
2010
and today so for today can you can give
any particular date
let us imagine that uh today is 1st of
January 2021 or
2022 now we have a both the dates that
is the joining date and the current date
which can be the current date so the
Daye can be anything so you might be
watching this on a different date as
well so the date of that day for today
would be a little different so we'll
imagine the today's State as an
imaginary date now we might want to find
the difference that is in terms of ears
so you wanted to find the difference in
terms of ear so here you can find the
difference in terms of ear days and
months as well so currently let's try to
find out the difference in terms of
years so for years you might want to
specify the third parameter in the data
function as why if you wanted months you
have to give the M as the third
parameter and if you wanted to find the
days you might want to give d as the
third parameter uh so we have discussed
the third parameter so what are the
first two parameters right so the first
two parameters are the first date and
the last date so the first date in this
situation is your date of joining and
the last date or the final date which
you want here as your today so let's
find the difference so for that equals
to so it can be dated if or date
diff so date if and the first dat which
is the A2 and comma the last date that
is B2 and your parameter third parameter
in terms of a status why close the
bracket and press enter so there you go
you have your date here so it's been
like 11 years that you're working with
your organization so that's how you find
out the differences so we have 11 years
because uh we did not finish the 12th
year completely so if we we had given
the month as uh maybe six where we have
finished our total years then it will
automatically change to 12 years
so now for this particular task we will
be considering the student database now
let's get into practical mode and start
our Excel so on my screen you can see
some data related to students now let us
try to duplicate some of the rows here
so we have selected the rows 8 9 10 and
11 now we shall copy them and paste them
so now these are the duplicate elements
right now there might be possibilities
about the duplication of class because
all the students all the 10 students are
in same class so there might be a
duplication but we are not looking for
such kind of duplications right we are
looking for the duplication of the
entire row for example we have the
details of mik over here in the eighth
row which has the role number or serial
number as seven name as mic role number
class blood group and subject scores
percentage round of percentage and total
marks so the entire eighth row is been
copied here and it is in the row number
12 we have the exact same details so
what if you have the exact same rows
duplicated so that's what we're going to
deal with we're going to eliminate the
duplicate rows all completely together
now to carry over this task we have to
select the data from toolbar so you have
various options file home insert Etc so
you need to select the data and inside
data toolbar we have the ribbon and
inside ribbon you have got the duplicate
values or remove duplicates uh option in
the ribbon so select all the data select
remove duplicates and now you can see
that we have all our uh column names
over here and make sure that you have
selected my data has headers and then
select okay and now you can see that
Excel has automatically removed four
duplicate values so four duplicate
values are found and removed 10 unique
values remain now another type type of
uh remove duplicates can also be done so
you can see that here we have another
data set which has phone numbers or
phone names that is phone makers that is
Samsung Huawei VI Oppo Etc so there are
some duplicate values in this I've have
copy pasted them so now you can also do
that so just select all the
data and now go into home and select
conditional formatting and here select
highlight cell rules and inside that you
have duplicate values selecting this
option will help you identify the
duplicate values in your data set but
not to remove them so you can select
that and you can see the duplicate
values are highlighted over here in the
red color now again you can get back to
data and uh select the option of remove
duplicates and select okay and the
duplicate values will be automatically
eliminated
so that's how you delete or eliminate
duplicate values in uh data set and you
can also see that we have another
duplicate in this particular row and if
you wanted to select a particular row
and eliminate the duplicates you can
also do that now for that you need to go
to the same process remove duplicates
and here Microsoft Excel is asking you
if you had to expand the selection to
the entire data set or you want to
continue with the selected data set
itself or selected column itself so for
that you need to select the continue
with the current selection and remove
duplicates and press okay and you can
see one duplicate value was found and it
has been removed and six unique values
remain so that's how you use the
function of removing duplicates in Excel
so what is sumers in Excel now you might
want to calculate uh the total sum of
sales right so let us assume that this
is your entire stores sales data and you
wanted to calculate the entire sum of
sales so there is a sum function in
Excel where you just have to you know
select all the sales and apply some
function onto it and you'll get the sum
of all the sales right so what something
like this you'll select all the cells
and then you'll apply a sums function
and you'll get the sum here and average
everything right so this is fine but
what if you just wanted to find the
sales that are happening in only vest
region as you can see our column f is
based on region so we have four regions
South West East and Central so your
manager asks you to find the sales
happening in suppose say west region so
how do you calculate it what you
manually go into each cell and check if
it's West and calc that will be timec
consuming right so what if you had a
method which could do it for you just in
a matter of few steps or few clicks
right so that's exactly some so it will
basically add a condition calculate the
sum of sales where the region is equals
to West simple to like or similar to
seal query right so that is exactly what
we're going to do in Excel today that is
using summs now let me add here Sales of
West Region now in the next cell let's
add uh sumus function remember there are
multiple sum functions in Excel so when
you type in s u m you can see so many
options based on sum right you just have
some followed by that you have some if
it is just some if not some FS today we
are concentrating on some FS so not just
some if we'll go to some ifs so we'll be
having an option of placing multiple if
conditions there so let's also try that
more on that later now let's press tab
to select our Su ifs function now okay
we forgot another important step so
before we apply sufs we need to convert
our table into a table format yes it
looks table but right now it's not in
tabula format it is in the format of
database we know that Microsoft Excel
considers its data as a database by
default so to convert the database into
table just click anywhere on the data
and press control T so that you'll have
a new dialogue box and it will ask if
your table has headers just make sure
that you have Ted in it our table does
have headers so select okay now our
database has been converted into a
perfect table and it's ready for
applying sus function so now you can see
our database has been successfully
converted into our table now let's begin
with our sum ifs now again remember we
are using Su ifs here not Su if or sum
so select Su ifs and press Tab Key and
we have our sums function now the first
step which column are we looking at what
are we finding out right which is a sum
range what sum do you want for now we
need Su of sales so select the sales
column and we have a simple key function
here let's hold control again press
shift and hold shift together so we're
holding control and shift key together
and now we're pressing lower Arrow key
once yes the entire sales column has
been selected comma Now where do you
want to look so we want to look I mean
which part of the table you want to
fetch right so this is the region part
we want to fetch right now so again hold
control and shift together lower Arrow
key the entire column is selected now
the next last part so we want to look
into the both of the columns that is
sales column and region column now which
type of data you want so for now we want
Western type of data that is the sales
data which is happening only in West
right so we'll select this cell with the
data as first or you can also manually
enter it for now let's select the data
so I'm selecting the cell F7 which has
uh data as West right now let's close
the parenthesis and press enter so there
you go you have the sales happening in
the western region now you can also try
to format it in the form of currency so
let's use uh dollars since it is based
on American states so let's use dollars
so there you go now we are having the
sales data of West now let's try to copy
the same to all the for Cs and and uh
for now here let's type in
East and this can be South right and
this can be your
central there you
go right now you can also copy the same
formula and make minor edits to it so
here instead of f8 you can select uh
East so where is East here and press
enter so you have the sales related to
East now let's try to edit F9 with South
select South Region enter so you have
South sales and what remaining is
Central so let's edit Central as well
and press enter so there you go right
now you have all the separate sales data
from west east south and Central now
again uh you might want a bit more Gra
ularity in data right or in your reports
right like you wanted to find the sales
data happening in West and you wanted to
find out the category based on only
Furnitures so your manager will ask you
okay a fantastic job so now just give me
another minute detail on the data I want
to calculate the sales happening on West
based on category Furniture right so he
wants furniture or he wants office
supplies only right you can also do that
it's not an issue at all now let's try
to C Cy the cell and paste it here and
sales invest let's add another input
here on
furniture right now you wanted to
calculate the sales happening in west
region only on furniture so you can also
do that now we can use the same formula
as well just copy paste the formula here
right and you can add few things here
when you try to add a comma it will
automatically generate the next criteria
as so it is expecting that you are
looking for adding another criteria
right now which column you want you want
category so let's select category you
want to select all the cells same trick
control shift lower key and again press
comma and you wanted to select only uh
Furniture so select on furniture cell
there you go now press enter so there
you go we successfully have the sales
data from west region based on category
Only Furniture so that's how you do su
in Excel you can also add a few more
details to it like in Furniture you can
also look only for tables so here you
can see in west region we have furniture
sales data and we have sales data of
West Region based on furniture which
includes only tables you can also do
that using sums function in the same way
all you have to do is select the
subcategory column and select the cell
which has the data as tables so this is
how you use Su in Excel now creating a
pivot table is just away from a few
clicks trust me it's just a couple of
clicks and you'll have your pivot table
ready to operate now click any cell or
select any cell on your spreadsheet
which has the data and navigate to
insert menu on the toolbar and select
pivot table and that's how simple it is
now automatically Excel will choose your
data you can see the lines over here
dotted lines that means the Excel has
already selected the range of data that
you want to put into your pivot table
and you can either select the existing
worksheet or a new worksheet I'll select
a new worksheet over here and just press
on okay and there you go you have your
pivot table ready now here you can see
your pivot table is a little empty all
you need to do is drag and drop the data
elements that you want on your pivot
table so here you can see on our
spreadsheet we have some business data
related to a store which has fiture and
states and subcategories of the
furniture and all the you know in in
category you have furniture office
supplies technology Etc right so those
have some subcategories as well and
different states and the regions as well
and the quantity total sales happen
right so using this business data we can
find out some key insights of this
particular data using our pivot table
right so here we'll add the data now let
me drag the region into rows click and
drag and let me drag uh categories into
columns which are the different
categories which are involved in the
sales data and values what are the sales
happened right and there you go you have
Furnitures office supplies technology as
the three different categories and those
are the sales happened in central is
South and West regions and this is the
grand total and instead of regions you
know you have all the regions over here
right so Central East Southwest or
instead of uh all the regions or instead
of all the the categories you can you
know place a specific category in your
pivot table for example let me push the
category into the filters and here you
can see the total sales happened in
those particular regions now what if
someone asks you to find the sales of
Only Furniture right so your manager
comes to you and he'll ask you getting
the sales of only Furnitures you can
select that and there you go you have
the furniture sales in all the regions
right or can also do the vice versa he
can also drag uh regions into the
filters and if you wanted to find out
the region wise sales of furniture you
can also do that
right so here we have furniture and here
you have all the regions and let us try
to find the sales of furniture in the
central region and there you go right so
this is how um the pivot table works and
you can also remove the regions for
example if you wanted to remove a
certain element from filters or anywhere
if it is columns rows anything you can
just drag and drop it right so that's
how it works and also you can increase
the level of detail or improve the
granularity right so here we have U
categories on our uh you know columns so
you can also include subcategories into
the
columns right
and and you have the region wise
sales so in the region filter select
all press okay and in the category
select
all press okay and you have the
furniture here office supplies here and
Technology here and also if you want to
include the quantity how much or how
many number of um you know things got
sold in those particular categories and
subcategories you can also do that so
here in the furniture section books
these are the sales and these are the
number of quantity or elements sold in
the in those particular you know sectors
so you can you can also improve the
level of granularity you can also
improve the level of detail using pivot
tables
in now AutoFill in Excel is a feature
where you can add some series
automatically using Excel for example
let us imagine that you wanted to add
index numbers right so starting from 1
to 10 so manually you will be typing in
the numbers and you'll be doing it right
so instead of this what if I said you
there was a simple way where Excel will
fill all the data for you right so just
start with one two and select these two
cells and you can see the flash logo
over here right so that's the indication
that Excel has understood your pattern
and it is ready to fill the remaining
numbers so as as long as you drag this
logo or that ending part where you have
a small square box that will fill all
the numbers until where you have draged
it so that's how autofill works and you
might be wondering will it work only for
numbers no it will also work on some
Logics as well okay this was the first
part let us also look at some other
tricks with autofill now most of the
time you might be just adding one number
and try to drag that cell and the result
is it'll copy the same number all the
time right so you can change it by
clicking on this menu you can click on
fill series and it will change to series
and this was one more trick with numbers
now getting back to the next type so let
us imagine now the next type of series
you want to add as weeks in a day right
so you'll be having
Monday Tuesday Wednesday right so you
can also do the series of weekdays using
AutoFill in Excel as well so drag that
cell and it will give you all the days
or week days in a week now let's try
January and this will give you the
months in a
year in the shortcut TOA right since you
just added the first three letters of
the month it will recognize the pattern
and it will do the same for you now let
us try the full names of
months right and now let's try to drag
it it'll fill all the full names of all
the
months now let's try the dates so let us
imagine that this is the first day of
the current
year right it will now give you all the
dates of that current month or until the
end of the year as
well there you
go now let us imagine that your manager
tells you to add the dates of working
days in the month of January
so how can you do that it's simple all
you need to do is select the cell go to
the fill option select series and here
select column wise since you want the
dates and columns and here in the type
select date date unit should be weekday
and the stop value should be the next
month right since your manager asked for
the week days of January so your stop
value will be the 1st of February press
okay and there you go so since the 1st
of January is is Friday it's selected
over here and the rest two Saturday and
Sunday are eliminated similarly we have
all the dates here of working days only
so that's how you use AutoFill in Exel
so on my screen you can see a simple
spreadsheet with student names and their
marks on my sheet so we will be
calculating what are the total marks
obtained by the students in overall
subjects and calculate what is the
percentage now we will carry forward a
few simple inbuilt functions in Excel to
calculate that first we will be
calculating the sum of marks so here
equals to sum
function and select the range of
cells close the bracket press enter so
you have the sum
now so we have to calculate it repeat so
by clicking on the same formula now we
have the total of all the subjects for
individual students and now let's
calculate percentage so usually we use
the you know divide by option that is
divide the total number of marks
obtained by the total number of marks
available that is we will be dividing 47
by 500 and then we will be multiplying
that into 100 so that's how we calculate
the percentage
so cell G2 ided by cell H2 press enter
and you will end up with you know uh the
decimal format that's perfectly all
right now we have also extended the same
formula for all our cells now select
this overall column or select the
highlighted cells right and get into the
data type here you have General so
that's why we have got that uh decimal
format but when you press percentage
you'll have the actual percentage of all
the students according to their marks
achieved now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and spreadsheet has some
values of employees that is their
employee ID name designation Department
salary date of birth and date of joining
now our concern is to highlight some
cells which are duplicate in this or
some rules which are duplicate so for
example here you can see on rule number
seven we have the details of Mara and
you can see the same details of Mara in
the row number 14 as well right so you
need to eliminate those cells or you
need to eliminate minate those rowes now
you can say there is a quick way just
few clicks and those will be eliminated
that is conditional formatting yes that
is also one way but I'll show you what's
the problem with that okay so let us
select the entire table and get into
conditional formatting and here you have
duplicate values highlight cell rules
where duplicate values and there you go
the problem so here we have designation
which is duplicated in certain ways
department and salaries state of joining
right so there are certain conditions or
scenarios where you cannot directly
identify which is the duplicate row
again you can use the same for this
right so you can select the
entire uh column of employee ID and you
can uh identify the duplicate cells here
since the employee IDs are unique for
everyone so this is a way but let's dig
a little deeper and understand the way
of highlighting duplicates with an
advanced technique so let me cancel this
and for that let's create a new um
column and let's name this as
duplicate
flag e
flag
so the new column has been created which
is T flag so here we'll be using a
simple formula that is Count F and here
press tab to select the formula and here
we will be adding our uh range that is
which range are you considering so the
range will be the employee ID since EMP
employee IDs are unique for every
employee
and and let's press function F4 to fix
it and now uh again the criteria and the
criteria will be the same cell that is
A2 and now close the bracket and press
enter now let's track the same formula
to all the
rows okay now here we have now what you
can do is uh sort it in an advanced way
go to sort and filter and custom sort
and here you'll be sorting by the D flag
and it will be smallest to
largest so now uh you can apply the
conditional formatting to highlight it
you can select the column H or the D
flag go to conditional formatting
highlight cell rules and here you can
get into greater than and give the value
as one
okay so all the cells which are you know
repeated multiple times will be selected
here and they will be highlighted with a
selected color what you have given so
I've given Red so now you can select
these cells and highlight them or delete
them from your
spreadsheet and now all your data in the
spreadsheet is unique and clean now
let's quickly get onto the Practical
mode where we will have some data sets
over which we will be trying to apply
the charts now there are various types
of charts in table and those are the pie
chart the column chart the bar chart
column versus line pavier chart and
Spark line charts so we will discuss one
after the other first let us discuss
about the pie chart so as you can see we
have a small data set on my screen which
I have personally created and uh this
deals with the companies and this deals
with the shares of the automobile
industry so now for this let's create
create a pie
chart select all the data and then get
into the toolbar and inside the toolbar
you can see various options and inside
that we going to use the insert option
and when you select the insert option
you will have a ribbon here and inside
the ribbon you can see groups tables
illustrations addin and here you go
these are the charts so now we needed a
pie chart so select on that icon and you
have various types of pie charts you
have to dimensional pie charts three
dimensional pie charts donut type of
charts Etc right so I would like to go
with the threedimensional p chart as it
looks a little more appealing and easy
to understand and now there you go this
is the title of the chart and these are
the legends of the chart and this is the
chart area and these are the values now
we can uh you know kind of add the data
labels as well so you can just have to
press the plus icon over here and you'll
have the options you can add the data
labels which will give you a lot more
interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this will be a a great
way of presenting your data to your
clients
right yeah and there is another option
where you can directly explode this like
you can pick it out you can see this
right Point explosion where you can
split it out and you can show that that
especially like you can highlight it and
show it so that's the you know a great
way of presenting your data so that's
how you can work with pie charts in
Excel now let's quickly move to the next
one that is the column chart and in the
column chart we have the data related to
some company and uh the profits of that
company based on a so you can see that
the year has started from 2008 and it
has gone until
2021 and these are the profits of that
company year after year so since we are
dealing with column chart I'll tell you
the simplest way to create a column
chart there is a shortcut key for that
which is alt F1 and there you go you
have the chart right on your
screen now you can uh expand the chart
just by dragging it like that and you
can see that there is some problem with
this chart that is we have numbers here
instead of es right you can see that the
First Column is the es which is 2008 to
2021 but here you can see we have 1 2 3
4 which is not proper right so to change
the axis that is you can see the axis
which is 1 2 3 let me expand my screen a
little bit
Yeah so if you look at my screen we have
two different columns one column is
about the ears and the second column is
about the revenue now what we want to do
is we want to create a line graph where
we have year on the x-axis and revenue
on the y- axis and we will be generating
a line graph based on the data we have
now for that we have to select the
entire data what we have then we need to
go into the insert option in the toolbar
and then you can see a lot of chart
options in the insert ribbon now here
you can see that we have a line chart or
area chart option select that and here
you can see 2D line graphs now let's
select the first one and there you go
you have the line chart here now let's
rename the
title and there is one problem with the
chart here you can see that the x-axis
is not actually pointing the ears you
can make a change to that no
worries just right click and then you
can see the select data option and there
you go you have the edit option here
just edit it and now select the
range I am selecting the ears now let's
select okay and there you go you have
the ears here you can just try to expand
it a little
more
yeah so now you have the revenue on the
y axis and here on the x-axis and this
shows the growth of Revenue in your
company so this is how you create a line
graph in Exel
playar now let us imagine that you are
the CEO of an IT company and you have
taken up multiple projects let us
imagine that you wish to keep track of
all the projects so what if there was a
tool which could keep track of all the
projects in the form of a detailed
visualization with the percentage in the
form of a graph or a bar chart
interesting right that's exactly what we
going to design today using Microsoft
Excel so without further Ado let's get
started with our onepoint agenda that is
progress tracker in Excel now to design
a progress tracker in Excel let us get
back to the Practical mode where we
might have to use our Microsoft
Excel now we are on the Microsoft Excel
and we have taken some sample data to
make things look simple so here we're
considering a set of students and their
attendance percentage so we will be
using this particular data and design a
progress
tracker now let us try to increase the
size of the
celles now select all the cells in the
attendance
column now we have selected all the
cells in the attendance column and in
the toolbar select the Home tab and
inside the Home tab you have styles
group inside the Styles group select
conditional formatting and inside the
conditional formatting option select new
rule so in the new rule we want to
select the first option that is format
all cells based on the values
now here you can see format style since
we trying to create a databas we need to
select the option of datab bars
here and under the datab bar options we
have some more options on the drop- down
menu so here in the type select
number and the minimum number is zero it
is automatic ically stored here and the
maximum value is again a number and let
us provide it as one now here you can
select the color for your pass now since
we have already chosen green for all the
column headers let's choose
blue
and select
okay now here you can see that the
values are being indicated using bar
graphs right and you can also see the
percentage values but we can make it
look a little more better by shifting
them to the left side and text could be
given as white so that it's more uh
vibrant to look at and now we can also
apply some conditional formatting onto
these attendance columns so let us try
to highlight the students having
attendance less than
65% so highlight cell her less than
65%
attendance with red color select okay
and there you go you have the progress
tracker right on your screen and using
the same principles you can track the
attendance for all the students and also
you can apply some conditional
formatting onto all your cells and
highlight the ones which are not on the
track now this is how you can Implement
progress trackers using
Excel now for this particular example we
going to use the employees
data now let's quickly get back to the
Practical mode and enter into
Excel now you can see that we are on
Excel sheet right now so let me expand
my screen a little bit
so that the data is a little more
visible yeah so here on my screen you
can see that we have employees data so
the First Column is the name of the
employees and the second column is the
start dates of the employees that when
have they started working with the
organization and when they have ended or
resigned to their position in that
particular organization and the duration
gives us the number of days they have
worked in that particular organization
so to create a g chart is really simple
you just have to select the data and
then go to the insert option and in
there you can see the charts icon and
select all charts and in that select the
bar chart and here you can see the
Stacked bar chart select that and press
okay and there you go you have the
Stacked bar chart right on your screen
let's expand this a little more so that
we have the clear visualization of the
dates as well now you can if you want
you can change the title as org data or
employe
data and now we are partially done with
our chart now the next thing we have to
do is select the bar chart right click
on it select data and here select the
add icon now you need to select the
series name so the series name is
duration for our Gant chart and series
values are let's select this and select
let's move a
little yeah so these are the data series
let's select okay and you can see the
Gant chat on my screen right here select
okay and it's done and still now it's
not complete yet so to finish it you
need to select the blue colored bars
here and right click on them and select
format data series
go to the fill icon and select no
fill and it's done for now and you can
see that there is a difference in this
particular arrangement we had Joe at the
first place and Susan at the last place
but here you can see Joe is in the last
place and Susan is in the first place so
we need to make some arrangements here
for that right click select format
access and then here you can see
categorize in reverse order
and there you go it should be done and
there you go you have your Gant chart
right on your screen however if you are
looking to get certified then hey there
we are here with an amazing course
through which you can catch the eyes of
top Recruiters in the industry allow me
to introduce postgraduate program in
data analytics by simply learn so what
are you waiting for hurry up and enroll
Now find the cost Link in the
description box we have started the
Microsoft Excel on my screen you can see
a small data set the data set is about
students and their marks in the six
semesters right now we should be
creating a new heat map to describe
their rankings Now to create a heat map
the procedure is really simple just
contr a select the entire data go to the
Home tab and there you can see the
Styles group and in the Styles group
click on the conditional formatting now
out of all the options go to the color
scales and when you open the color
scales you can see some types of maps
select the green yellow red Scale map
which should show Green for highest
yellow for mediate and red for low right
this is how you create a heat map just
select the first option and there you go
the heat map has been successfully
generated the green colored cells
indicate the highest marks orange and
yellow color indicate the intermediate
marks or the average marks and the red
color indicates the lowest marks that's
how you create heat maps in Excel we
have reached the end of this session on
how to create heat maps in Excel but
before we end the video let's take a
minute to hear it from our Learners
about their success story after
graduating from the business analyst
postgraduate program by simply learn
from per University in collaboration
with Amazon Google and Microsoft Excel
is a really powerful tool for data
analytics and Reporting and pivot tables
are one of the features that Excel
offers for creating tabular reports to
summarize our data let's begin by
understanding what is a pivot
table a pivot table is a tool that
summarizes and reorganizes selected
columns and rows of data in a
spreadsheet to obtain a desired
report it does not actually change the
spreadsheet data it simply pivots or
turns the data to view it in different
perspectives P tables are espcially
useful with large amounts of data that
would be timec consuming to calculate
manually now let's understand the
different components of a pivot table so
there are four main components first we
have rows when a field is chosen for the
row area it populates as the first
column in the pivot table similar to The
Columns all row labels are unique values
and duplicates are removed columns is
the second component when a field is
chosen for the column area only the
unique values of the field are listed
across the top then we have values each
value is kept in a pivot table cell and
displays the summarized information the
most common values are sum average
minimum and maximum finally we have
filters filters apply a calculation or
restriction to the entire table so let's
jump over to Microsoft Excel and let me
show you the data set that we will use
in this demo so with India being ready
for its 16th census in
2021 that is next year it is a good time
for us to analyze India's last sensus
data from 2011 and see where different
states and cities across India stood in
terms of population literacy and other
socioeconomic factors we will analyze
this data by creating different pivot
tables in Excel and explore some of its
features so let's begin first I'll show
you one of the features that Excel
offers us so suppose I click on any cell
and hit control+ Q you can see our
entire table is selected and at the
right bottom there's an option of quick
analysis now you can see by default
Excel has prompted certain features such
as formatting we have charts totals and
there's one more called tables now Excel
by default has created some P tables for
us now the first one you say sum of
district code by state names next we
have sum of sex ratio by state name then
we have some of child sex ratio some of
male graduates and some of female
graduates by state name and there are
others before creating our pivote table
so let's have a final look at our data
set so First Column you see is the city
column so there are different cities
from different parts of India then we
have the state code we have the state
name district code we have the total
population followed by male and female
population next you can see we have the
total literates from each City then we
have the male and female literates next
we have the sex ratio then we have the
child sex ratio next we have total
number of graduates and finally you can
see we have male and female graduates so
using this table we'll create several
peot
tables now first of all let's create a
peot table to find the total population
for each state and sort it in descending
order so you can see here we have the
problem statement so our first P table
will have the total population for each
of the states in descending order so to
create a peot table you can click any
cell in your data go to the insert Tab
and here left you can see we have the
option to create a pivote table so let
me select pivote table now my range is
already selected the entire table and
here I'll choose existing worksheet
because I want to place my pivote table
in the same worksheet and I'll give my
location I'll point to cell Q5 now let
me click
okay you can see the P table Fields
appears here on the right now since we
want to find the total population for
each state so what I'll do is I'll drag
my state name onto rows so here in our P
table you can see we have the different
state names listed now we want the total
population for each of these states so
in the field list I'll search for total
population which is the
and drag it under
values you can see we have a sum of
total population for each of these
states by default Excel will sum any
numeric column you can always change it
to average minimum maximum anything you
want now we want to sort this column in
descending order so I right click go to
sort option and choose Z to A that is
largest to
smallest you can see here here in 2011
Maharashtra had the highest number of
population or the total population in
Maharashtra was the highest then it was
utar Pradesh we had Andhra Pradesh and
if I come down we have nagaland and
Andaman and nicobar Islands towards the
end so this is a simple pivot table that
we created now the next problem we have
is we want to find the total sum of
literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so let's see how to do it
I'll click on any cell go to insert and
here I can click on pivot table my range
is selected I'll choose existing
worksheet and give my location which is
Q5 I click on
okay now here we want to find the total
sum of literates so what I'll do is
first let me drag total literates column
to values you have the total sum of
literates from all the
states next I want to see the sum of
total literates based on states and
cities so let me first drag state name
onto rows and then we'll drag City onto
rows you can see here we have our pivot
table
ready to the left of the pivote table
you can see we have the state names and
the cities per state and on the right
you can see the total am number of
literates from each City if I scroll
down we have Assam then you can see we
have
Bihar and if I keep scrolling we have
all the states harana Himachal Pradesh
that's Jammu and Kashmir which has now
become a union territory we have jarand
Karnataka and other states as well
moving
on okay so the next thing we want to see
is what is the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state with that
we also want want to find the states
that had the highest and lowest sex
ratio in
2011 so let's create a pivote table for
this I'll click on any cell go to insert
choose P table click on existing
worksheet I'll select cell Q5 and click
on
okay now since we want the average sex
ratio and the child sex ratio so first
I'll drag those columns either you can
manually scroll and drag it or here you
have the option to search for it so if I
look for child you can see we
have the same column listed can just
drag it from there let me delete this
and I also want the sex ratio so I'll
place it on top of child sex ratio next
we want to see it based on different
states so what I'll do is I'll take
state name name and put it under rows so
here you can see we have our pivote
table ready on the left you can see we
have the different state names listed
and on the right we have the values now
we want to find the average Now by
default Excel will sum the numeric
columns you can see it tells you sum of
sex ratio and child sex ratio so what
you can do can click on this drop down
and go to value field
settings and here summarize values by
you can choose average you can see the
custom name it says average of Sixx
ratio click on
okay our entire column is now giving us
the average sex ratio similarly for this
column let me convert it into average
I'll again click on the drop- down go to
Value field settings click on average
and click
okay and you can see here we have the
average of child sex ratio for each of
the states now the next question says
which states had the highest and lowest
sex ratio so we'll consider this column
so we'll sort it in any order you want
you can do it either ascending or
descending let me short it in descending
order you can see we have our column
sorted
now so in 2011
Kerala had the highest sex ratio and if
I scroll down to the bottom you can see
himanchal Pradesh had the lowest which
is around
[Music]
818 up next let's explore one more
feature of P table so suppose you want
to see the top or bottom few rows of a
pivote table you can do that as well so
here we have a question at hand we want
to find the top three cities with the
highest number of female graduates so
let's see from the entire peot table how
we can filter the top three cities so
I'll go to insert click on the P table
option go to existing worksheet click on
Q5 and hit
okay now since we want to find the top
three cities I'll drag City column onto
rows and then we want the female
graduates so in the search bar I'll look
for
female and I'll choose this column that
is female graduates and drag it here
onto values so I have the sum of female
graduates for each of the Cities now
since we want to find the highest number
of female graduates in the top three
cities so let me first sort this
column I'll sort it in descending order
now we have it sorted now from this you
can say that Delhi greater Mumbai and
bangaluru are the top three cities
but it's displaying all the cities for
us so let's filter only the top three so
what you can do is right click and go to
filter under filter you have the option
of top 10 I'll select this here I only
want the top three so either you
can go down like this or you can
directly type
three your column is already selected
let we just click on okay there you go
we have the required pivote table ready
and it only displays us the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates now the next thing we want to
see is how to use a Slicer in a peot
table so we have a question here What's
the total population for all the cities
in Rajasthan and Karnataka so let's
create a pivot table for this and see
how you can use a slicer to filter the
table click on existing I'll click on a
location this time
q6 click
okay now since I want the total
population so I'll drag total population
onto values and then I'll select the
city on two rows and then the state name
also I'll place it on top of City so you
have in the pivot table all the states
and their
cities and on the right you can see the
total population for each of these
cities but our question is we want to
find only for Rajasthan and Karnataka
now for that what you can do is go to
insert and create a slicer either you
can create from this option or you can
go to pivote table analyze option and
here you have the option to create or
insert a slicer I click on this and
since we want to slice the table based
on state that is Rajasthan and Karnataka
I'll choose state name as my slicer
field you can see this is my slicer here
now you only want the data for Rajasthan
and Karnataka so I'll search for these
two so here we have Karnataka so let me
select Karnataka
first
and I also want for
Rajasthan so let me select Rajasthan
also you can see in our P table we only
have data for Rajasthan and
Karnataka so this poo table shows you
different cities from Karnataka and the
total sum of population from each of the
cities and similarly we also have for
Rajasthan moving ahead now we will see
another very interesting feature of of
pivot that is how you
can create percentage contribution of a
table for example we have a question
here what's the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state now we want to see in terms of
percentage and not as sum or average
let's do that I'll create my pivote
table click on
existing and I'll select an empty cell
okay now here since we want to find the
percentage contribution of male and
female literates so first I'll
drag male literates onto values followed
by female literates on two values by
default it has summed up the male lit
and female lit value and also I want to
drag State
column to rows so here you can see the
sum of male literates and female
literates per state I want to convert
this as percentage contribution so what
we can do is I'll select any cell and
I'll write click and I'll go to so value
as and here I have the option to select
percentage of grand total so I'll select
this you can see we have the percentage
contribution of male lates through the
total now if I sort this you will get to
know which state contributed or has the
highest percentage
contribution so we have Maharashtra for
male
literates then we had utar prades in
2011 if I come
down we had migala nagaland and Andaman
and nicobar
Islands as two states which had little
or minimal contribution to male
literates similarly let's do it for
female literates I'll go to so value as
and select percentage of grand
total so you can see here also
Maharashtra utar Pradesh then Gujarat
and all had the highest percentage
contribution to female
literates so this is another good
feature to convert your data and seat
and terms of
percentage now moving ahead let's say we
want to find the bottom three cities
from each state that had the lowest
female graduates we can do that as well
I'll go to insert click on
pivot go to existing worksheet select an
empty worksheet and click on
okay now since I want to see based on
States as well as cities so let me drag
the state name first onto row and let's
drag the city column onto
rows next we want female graduates so
let me look for female graduates in the
field list I'll drag it onto
values now we have the list of states
and the respective cities and to the
right of the P table you can see the sum
of female graduates from each
City now first I'll sort this column
I'll right click go to sort and click on
sort test to largest now we have sorted
our female graduates
from shortest or smallest to largest now
since I want to find the bottom three
cities from each state I'll come to the
cell right click go to filter and select
top 10 now
I'll replace top 10 with bottom and I
want the bottom three cities from each
state
I have my column selected that is some
of female graduates if I click on okay
you can see here some of the states
don't have three cities so you can see
andman and nicobar islands has only one
city that is Port player while the
remaining you can find the bottom three
cities with the lowest number of female
graduates so Andra Pradesh had these
three in Assam we had Naga then there
was dier and ccha similarly if I come
down in we have palwal kathal and
zind if I come further here you can see
for Karnataka there's gangawati this
Rani benur and this scholar similarly
you can see for Kerala as
well now moving
ahead now in the next example I'll tell
you how you can create a calculated
field or a calculated column in Excel
with the help of a peot table so in a
pivote table you can create or use
custom formulas to create calculated
fields or items calculated fields are
formulas that can refer to other fields
in the pivote table calculated Fields
appear with other value fields in the
pivote table like other value Fields a
calculated Fields name May proceed with
some of followed by the field name so
here we have a sales table that has
columns like the items which has
different fruits and
vegetables and those have been
categorized as fruits and vegetables we
have the price per ke and this is in
terms of
rupees and we have the quantity that was
sold now let's see if you want to find
the sales for each item in the table you
can create a calculated field so your
sales column is going to be the product
of price per kg and quantity so let me
show you how you can do that with the
help of a p table I'll create a peot
table
first click on an empty cell
hit okay now if you see on the top under
pivot table analyze and under
calculations we have the option Fields
items and sets if I click on this drop
down I get the option to create a
calculated field or insert a calculated
field and click on this I'll give my
field name as
sales and I'll select my
formula I'll first click on price per kg
and hit insert field I'll give a space
hit shift 8 to give the product symbol
and then I'll double click on quantity
now this is my formula for sales that is
price per kg multiplied by quantity I'll
click on ADD and I click on okay if you
see here there's a calculated field that
is present in the pivote table fields
which is seals but it did not add it to
our original table or original table is
the same but here we have added a
calculated field which is present only
in the pivote table list now we can use
this it has already taken it under
values now let's say I want to find the
sum of sales for each item under each
category you can see it here we have our
category fruit and we have our category
vegetable and under that we have
different items like apple and apricot
banana similarly in vegetables we have
broccoli the carrots corn eggplant and
others so this is how you can create a
calculated field in a pivote table now
this's one more good feature that Excel
offers us in pivote table is to create a
pivote chart so you can use your pivote
table and create different charts I'll
show you how to do that if I go to
insert here I have the option of
recommended charts I click on this Excel
gives me some default charts which you
can use let's say I'll select
this let me drag it a bit to the right
here you can see I'll close this pivote
field list this is a nice bar chart that
Excel has created this is called a PBO
chart now here you can see the category
fruits and vegetables and the different
fruits and veget tables or the
items in the y axis you can see the
total sales if you see from the graph
guava me the highest amount of Sals now
if I sort this let's sort this
first you can see it here fruit guava
meet the highest amount of sales now
since I sorted and changed my P table
the P chart also automatically gets
updated similarly there are other charts
also so that you can create let's go to
the insert Tab and let's click on
recommended charts again let's look for
a pie chart so this is a p chart that
you can create let me click on okay so
here is our PI chart and each Pi
represents a certain item and the P that
has the highest area represents it had
the highest amount of sales in this case
you can see it is guava and similarly we
have other it M as well this is fruit
banana that's
corn and we have spinach and
others let's explore a few other charts
so first I'll click on my pivot table go
to insert and under recommended charts
let's now select a line chart if I hit
okay move it to the right so this is a
line chart you can see it starts from
guava which had the highest amount of SE
SS then it
drops and in the x-axis you can see the
different items similarly when it starts
with the vegetables broli made the
highest amount of sales with 2,800
rupees and our lowest was eggplant at
900 rupees for fruits papaya sold the
least at 700 rupees let's take another
chart I'll go to insert under
recommended charts let's
see this time we'll see a bar chart now
this is
a horizontal bar chart and not a
vertical one we just saw a vertical
column chart like this this is an
horizontal bar chart now you can always
increase and decrease the size of these
charts let's explore a last chart let's
take the area chart for now so this is
an area chart again it looks similar to
the line L chart it starts with guava
which had the highest amount of seals
similarly papaya under fruits had the
lowest amount of sales under vegetables
it was broccoli and finally eggplant
made the lowest amount of sales under
vegetable now let's go to our first
sheet and summarize what we have done in
this demo for pivot tables in Excel so
we had our
data this is a 2011 Census Data from
India we had the cities the state names
and we had the total population total
literates female literates male
literates we had the sex ratio total
graduates and other
information so we began by understanding
how to create a simple pivote table
where we calculated the total population
for each state and sorted it in
descending order we found that
Maharashtra utar Pradesh had the total
population in
2011 then then we saw another preot
table where we calculated the total sum
of literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so you can see we had the
different state names and the cities
under each
state then we saw another feature where
you could calculate the average of a
certain numerical column so here we
calculated the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state and found
out which one had the highest and lowest
sex ratio
after that we saw how you could find or
filter
tables we saw how to find the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates we found out that Delhi
greater Mumbai and bangaluru were the
top cities with highest number of female
graduates next we saw how to use Slicer
in a poo table so we sliced our table
based on Rajasthan and Karnataka State
and saw the total population for all the
cities in Rajasthan and Karnataka
in the next
sheet we explored another feature that
was to find the percentage contribution
of male and female lates from each
state then here we saw how to find out
the bottom three cities for each state
having lowest female graduates one thing
marked that some of the states did not
have three cities for example Andaman
had only one city that was Port player
but the others we found about the bottom
three cities that had the lowest female
graduates finally we looked at how to
create a calculated field in a pivote
table so we saw how to create a
calculated field called sales and then
we explored how to create different
charts and graphs so this was an area
chart that we saw there a column chart
we also saw or looked at a bar chart
that was a horizontal bar chart
similarly we saw how to create a pie
chart as well so how to create a p chart
you ask it is really simple all you need
to do is just follow few steps and you
have your PIV chart ready which is
completely interactive now all you have
to do is select any cell in the data set
you have and rush into the insert
toolbar then in the group of charts you
have an option called pivot chart select
on it now you'll be asked to select the
range and you can see Excel has
automatically select all the range that
you want to include in your P chart then
you have another option which is asking
you to either create the P chart in the
current worksheet or a new worksheet for
now let's select a new worksheet and
there you go voila the pivot chart is
completely ready you might ask me this
is completely empty yes the default
pivot chart what you get from Excel will
be completely empty but you can add the
legends and all the data that you want
to add onto your PIV chart just by
dragging and dropping the data from the
right hand side of your Excel sheet that
is from the P chart Fields so you can
see we have various options region
category state subcategory sales
quantity Etc now I'll add
region I'll add region to
access and comparatively we will see the
sales that are happening in those
particular ular regions by dragging
sales into values now you have all the
data in the form of pivot chart which is
completely interactive which represents
the sales happening in those regions now
you can also select a particular region
right by default all the regions are
selected but if you want to select only
Central then you can do that by
deselecting everything and select only
Central and select okay and there you go
you have all the data related to the
sales happening in the central region
now if you want to you know kind of see
all the uh categories of sales happening
in all the regions you can drag the
category into values again and uh in the
region part okay I think we have to add
category into Legends yes now select uh
regions that that is old regions and
select okay and you can see the category
wise sales in all regions at one single
go and I hope you did not observe it
clearly uh the Xcel also gives you the
completely prepared pivot table as well
right which is also interactive you can
also get to choose the data from here as
well and select okay and you'll see that
being reflected on the pivot chart so
here you can see both pivot table and
pivot charts are completely
interactive now here we have four
different sheets of the sales so the
first sheet is the West Zone next is
South Zone East Zone and central zone so
all this data belongs to one single
sheet that is Superstore data set so I
have categorized or I have taken a part
of the data which belongs to central
region South Region west region and east
region now we are going to use all these
four sheets and create one single sheet
which is the pivot table of all the four
sheets now without further Ado let's
start the process now for that we might
want to use the shortcut key that is alt
D now press P now this starts the pivot
chart
wizard now here we have to choose the
option multiple consolidation
ranges then click on
next and here you can see the pivot
table is clicked by default now we'll go
to next now here click I will create
page fields or the pivot chart wizard
will automatically create if you want
that to create for youu now click on
next now here let's select the
range now I'll be selecting the
range add
it now next we'll Select
East
it followed by that we have
South and finally we have
bestest
now we will name these according to the
regions so the first one will be
West next one will be
South next one will be
East and the last one will be Central
click on next and here select new
worksheet and finish and there you go
you have the pivot table here now you
might want to change the submission
value so click anywhere on the pivot
table and change it from count to
sum so that you have the summation of
the total number of sales subcategory
sales and grand total of sales Etc now
here you can see all option now let's
select Central and you'll get the
details of the central region the grand
total and the sales happening quantity
of sales Etc now here can you can see
the furniture office supplies technology
and the grand total all in one single
sheet now let's get back to the original
sheet so as you can see this is the
original sheet and in the original sheet
you can can see various more
categories which is the which is the
shipment mode customer customer segment
country City State uh and you also have
uh product name subcategory Etc so if
you had added all these into this sheet
you can also create a separate option of
adding minu details to your pivot table
so that is how the pivot table is
created using multiple sheets mail March
in Excel is a simple yet spectacular
method to write similar emails to
hundreds and thousands of recipients
without a hassle or even a single error
let us imagine that you are supposed to
write an interview call letter to
multiple recipients so what if you had
like five recipes you could do five
different emails and you could send them
but what if you had 50 or even
500 right that would seem a little
Troublesome and you might even feel that
you might want a whole team to do that
right but what if I say that you can do
the same with one single mail within a
matter of minutes you send all the
emails to all the 50 or 500
recipients sounds interesting right so
now in this particular tutorial we are
going to do the same now without further
Ado let's directly get onto the
Practical mode and start our Excel and
try to do some mail merch in
Excel now we are on practical mode and
we have started our Microsoft Excel so
regarding the example we discussed
earlier that is sending an interview
call letter to multiple people that's
what exactly this Excel sheet does so
here we have about 25 members or 25
candidates with their first name last
name and email and their address written
over now where is our call letter now
this happens to be our call letter so
the call letter is been sent from an
imaginary company that is smart
Solutions private limited India and and
followed by that we are having one
recipient here who happens to be Mia and
the subject and everything all the text
related to the interview call now we are
trying to send this one single interview
call letter to all the 25 people now the
only change that is going to happen is
the recipient's name and address is
going to change and the addressing for
example here you can see de Mia so
instead of dear Mia we're going to greet
the recipient with their particular name
so that's what we're going to try to do
now so to do that you have to go into
the toolbar and select mail links option
in the mail links option you can see the
start mail merch select recipients edit
recipient and all other options so here
you might want to select the second
group and inside the second group you
have an option called select recipients
click on that and now it will show you
some options the first one is Type in
new list so if you are having some list
then you can type in or if you already
have an existing list like what we did
creating an Excel sheet and storing all
the email and address and all the
recipients complete details you can use
that as well so here we're going to use
the existing list so click on
that now it will show you a new dialogue
box using which you have to navigate to
the the existing list so our existing
list is named as mail much so click on
that and select
open now press
okay now the next part is to address all
the details so here you can see that two
address and after that you can see the
addressing of the recipient now we have
to encode this mail in such a way that
to all the recipient
automatically Excel will replace the
addresses names and the greetings right
now let's try
that now let's try to encode the address
part so highlight the address part and
in the same mail links option you can
find the address blog in WR and insert
Fields
ribbon so let's select that and now you
can see the address of everyone
right so this is the preview of the
recipient's address now you can see that
the recipients full name and state is
only available here not the street and
house number Etc now you can fix that by
selecting the match Fields option and
here you can include the address so
which might be the house apartment and
the second one would be Street and um
postal code you can match it with PIN
code and that's all yeah remaining we
have everything else let's look at the
preview and this is how it looks like
perfect now let's select
okay now that's
fine and uh similarly we will also try
to match
the just a moment yeah similarly we'll
try to encode the recipient's name now
for that let's go into the greetings
line here you can see you can select the
option de sir or dear m' or to whomever
may may concern and uh here you have
another option to or just deer so we'll
go with deer and this is how the preview
looks like and if you're happy with that
it's okay and if you want to Pary check
for other things I mean other recipients
you can also do that for example the
next recipient is Santo shastri and
followed by him we have prakar Redi
Rajesh sahu right you can also check
everything and here you can also see the
address changing on the mail so we can
check for jagadish charari his address
and his name right so it looks like it's
working perfectly now select okay and
that's
done now we are in the final stage and
in the mailings option you can see the
last two options that is the preview
results and finish so before merging and
finishing the mail merge we shall go
through a quick preview to check if
everything is fine or not so here you
can see we have the address block this
is how the encoding looks like and uh if
you replace the encoding with the actual
address and name this is how the actual
address and name look like and you can
check all the letters you can just click
on the Arrow key here and you can check
all the recipients address and their uh
names right so if you can find any
errors you can replace them and if not
if everything is fine then you can just
quickly press on the finish and merge
option when you finish merge option or
finish and merge option you get three
different options that is edit
individual documents print documents and
send all these to the recipients now if
you had any queries or if you had any
doubts about or if you find any errors
on the emails then you can go to that
particular individual document and edit
it with the first option and in the
second option you can print all the
documents like if you want to send a
hard copy then you can print it so you
can see here all and select okay and
then you can you know kind of save it as
a PDF or you can send the location of
your print ENT and then just press
okay right you can just save them in the
form of
PDF or you can directly send the emails
right now I'm not connected to any
printer so I'm not going to print any
documents now let us try the last one
this should be
interesting now when you select the mail
option then it automatically selects the
email column from your Excel sheet
remember we had an email column from
Excel sheet right this particular column
word automatically selects that column
from Excel and you can just select okay
and all the mails will be sent to all
these imaginary mailing
addresses so that's how it's done what
is Excel
vlookup vlookup stands for vertical
lookup vlookup lets you search for
specific information in your spreadsheet
it allows you to search for a particular
value in a column and returns another
value from a different column but of the
same Row V lookup takes advantage of
vertically aligned tables to quickly
find data associated with the value the
user enters now let's look at the syntax
to write a vlookup function so vlookup
takes four parameters or arguments you
can see it here there are four arguments
in the vup
function so the first argument is called
the look of value the look of value
represents the value that you searching
for next is the table array the table
array represents two or more Columns of
information the third argument is called
the column index number now this
represents the column number in the
table from which the value must be
returned the First Column is one the
second column is two and so on and then
we have the fourth parameter which is
called the range lookup now this
parameter is optional now range lookup
is used to find an exact match so if you
want to find an exact match you you need
to enter false or zero meanwhile if you
want an approximate match you need to
enter true or one if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know
more now let me give you a brief
overview on what's going to be in our
demo so for our demonstration we'll use
a sales data set you can see the data
set on the left you using this data set
we'll understand how V lookup performs
an exact and approximate match we'll see
how V lookup is case insensitive then
we'll perform a wild card character
search we'll understand how to handle
errors when a match is not found and
finally you will look at two-way
lookups now here is a small example of
how we look of works so we want to find
the unit sold by Morgan using the data
set on the left so here you can see I
have the data set it has some rows and
columns so these are the columns which
are order date region there's a
representative column item units there's
unit cost and total and from this table
I want to find the units that were sold
by Morgan if you look at the table at
the bottom you can see the
representative name Morgan and Morgan
has sold 30 units now I want to find
this value using the V function so here
on the right you can see I have my
lookup value which is Morgan and this is
my V lookup formula and using this
formula I'm getting the result as 30 now
let's go to our Excel workbook and
perform all the demos one by one so this
is my Excel workbook that we are going
to use for our demo and here is the data
set we'll be using now this is the same
data set that you saw a while ago so
this data set has seven columns you you
have the order date the region
Representatives name item there's units
unit cost and total which is basically
the total or the amount of sales that
was
generated we are going to use a chunk of
this data set and perform our vlookup
analysis so let's see our first example
and the problem we have at hand let me
go to the exact match tab all right so
here I'm going to use this chunk of data
which is actually taken from the
original data set so we have taken the
first 11 rows from the data set you can
see from row
two till row 12 is going to be our data
set that we'll use so we have a question
here we want to find the items sold by
Thompson so here Thomson is my lookup
value which means looking at Thompson I
want to find the item that is sold so if
you consider our table here you can see
we have the representatives name
Thompson right here and from the table
you can see Thompson sold pencil and I
want to get this value which is pencil
using my V lookup function so let's go
ahead and write our vlookup
function I'll consider this as my lookup
value and here under item I'm going to
write my vooka formula to write the V
formula I'll write first equal to and
I'll write V lookup if I hit tab it will
autoc complete all right now let's give
the parameters so first is going to be
the lookup value which is nothing but
Thompson so I'll just select this cell
which is
j17 comma now it's asking to give the
table array so the table array is the
table from which you want to retrieve a
value one thing to keep in mind is that
the value you are looking for should be
the the First Column of a table and you
can select the table array till the end
of the data set or till the column which
has the value you want to find so here
I'll select my table array starting from
the representatives column till the end
of the item column which is going to be
my table array then I'll select the
column index number so the column index
number is based on the table array you
have selected in this case my column
index number is going to be two because
we have selected just two columns and
the value which I'm going to find is in
the second column so I'll give two comma
Now the range lookup I'm going to give
is false because I want to find an exact
match so either you can hit tab or you
can write zero which means
false if I close the bracket and hit
enter it will return me the item that
Thompson had sold which is pencil you
can verify from the table that Thompson
had sold pencil pencil all right now
let's try to change the table array and
see what result are we getting so this
time I'll slightly change the table
array so again we are trying to find the
item that Thompson had sold so I'll
write my formula equal to V lookup I'll
hit tab to autoc complete I'll give my
look of value as Thompson comma this
time I'm choosing my table array
starting from the representatives column
till the end of the data set which is
till p12 again my column index number is
going to be two because if you consider
this table array the item column is the
second column in the selected table
array so I'm going to write it as two
comma the range lookup I won't to give
as false because I want to find the
exact match if I close this and hit
enter you can see it has return return
me the same result that we saw earlier
now suppose let's say this time I want
to start my table table array from the
region column which is this column so I
want to select my table array starting
from the region column now this is going
to show me an error because your table
array should always start from the look
of value column so if you consider
Thompson as the look of value my table
array should always start from the
representatives column so let's just try
this example so I'll write V lookup my
lookup value I'm going to give it as
Thompson comma the table array as as I
mentioned earlier I'm going to choose
from the region column and let's say
I'll select till the item column give
another comma and this time my column
index number is going to be three
because since the table array has three
columns and my item column is the last
column so I'm going to give my column
index number is three comma I want to
get the exact match so I'll give zero if
I close the bracket and hit enter you
can see it has given me an error okay
now let me just show you another method
to use V lookup in Excel so here on the
top you can see there's a formulas Tab
and under formulas tab under function
Library you see we have an option to
select look up and reference if I click
on this and if I scroll down below you
can see there's an
option called V lookup let's choose this
all right now here you can give your
lookup value your table array column
index number and the range lookup under
this function arguments dialog box so
here I want to select my lookup value as
Thompson my table array is going to be
from the representatives column till
let's say the end of the data set my
column index number is going to be
two I'll write two and range lookup I'll
write as false because I I want the
exact match if I hit okay you can see it
has given us the exact same result so
this is one of the other ways to use V
lookup in Excel now let's move to the
next sheet which is regarding
approximate match okay so sometimes you
might have cases where you don't have
the lookup value present in the table in
those cases you can tell V lookup to
return an approximate match now one
thing to keep in mind is that your
lookup value column should always be
sorted in ascending order while trying
to get an approximate match so here we
are going to use this table and my
lookup value column which is going to be
the representatives column is already
sorted in ascending
order and let's see the question we have
here so I want to find the item sold and
the unit cost for Matt so my lookup
value is going to be Matt now if you see
this table I don't have the
representatives name Matt anywhere in
the the table now using an approximate
match I want to find the item and the
unit cost so let's do it so here under
item I'll write my vlookup formula so
I'll type vlookup I'll hit tab to
complete it and this time my look of
value is going to be mat so I'll select
this cell comma my table array I'll
select from the representatives column
till the end of item column because I
want to find the item value for for mat
I'll give a comma my column index number
as per the table array is going to be
two comma my range lookup this time I'm
going to give us true or one so I'll
write one close the bracket hit enter
all right it has written me binder was
the item sold by Matt now let's try to
figure out why we look up returned
binder as the
item now let's see you were asked to
insert the name Matt to the
representative column in alphabetical
order so where would you place it
ideally you should Place between KL and
Morgan since this column is already
sorted Matt should appear before Morgan
and after Kel so in an approximate match
we lookup will consider the previous
highest value in this case the previous
highest value before Matt is ql and
hence we lookup returned the
corresponding item purchased by Kel
which is binder now
similarly if you wanted to find the unit
cost for
Matt again V lookup will return the unit
cost of KL which is
125 let's just try it out so I'll write
bookup my lookup value is mat comma my
table array for this time is going to be
from Representatives column till the
unit cost column I'll consider I'll give
a comma Now the column index number as
per the table array is going to be four
I'll give another comma and this time
I'll double click true because I want an
approximate match if I close the bracket
hit enter you can see it has returned me
125 which is actually kl's unit cost
okay we have another question and this
time I want to find the units sold by
Rob now Rob is going to be my look of
value if you see the representatives
column we don't have Rob now let's see
what we look up is going to return as
the item for Rob so I'll write V lookup
I'll give my lookup value as Rob comma
my table array is going to start from
the representatives column I'll select
till here I'll give a comma the column
index number is two give another comma
I'll double click on
true I close the bracket hit enter you
can see V lookup has written me pen now
let's understand why vup returned pen
for Rob now if you are asked to insert
the representatives name Rob into this
column so ideally Rob would appear
somewhere between Morgan and sorino
because since this is sorted in
ascending order Rob is actually greater
than Morgan and is less than sorino so
as you know
we look up in an approximate match
Returns the previous highest value which
is Morgan here and the corresponding
item for Morgan is pen and hence we look
up returned pen for Rob all right now
moving to the next
sheet which is another property of
vlookup which tells V lookup always
looks to the right this means that your
lookup value must always be on the left
and the value you are going to find out
should always be to the right of the
table
now consider this scenario where your
lookup value is on the left in this case
it is the representatives value and I
have taken svino for an example and we
want to find the order date for svino
now if you consider this table your
lookup value which is svino is actually
this column the representatives column
and we are going to find out the order
date so your representatives name is on
the right of the table and the value we
are going to find out is on the left of
the table now as per the property we
look up only looks to the right so if I
use the vlookup function for this
example here I'll write vlookup I'll
give my lookup value as S V know comma
my table array I'll consider from the
order date because I want the order date
till the representatives column I'll
give a comma and this time my column
index number is actually the first
column if I consider my table array as
the first three columns
selected and my range lookup is going to
be false if I close the bracket hit
enter it returns me an error the reason
is we look up always looks to the right
and this time the value we were trying
to find out was to the left of the
table now if you consider the opposite
case suppose you have the order date and
you want to find the representatives
name you can do that easily because your
lookup value which is the order date is
on the left and your representatives
column is on the right so let's just try
this I'll write V lookup my lookup value
is going to be S Vino's order date so
I'll select it from the table I'll give
a comma my table array will start from
the G column let's say I'll select the
entire table comma and my column index
number which will be three if you
consider these as my table
array comma my range lookup is zero if I
close this hit enter you can see we have
got svino corresponding to the order
date all right now let's move to the
next
tab now this tab says we look up returns
only the first match so we have a
question at hand the question is find
the units sold by Jardine if you see
this table we have the representatives
name Jardin twice you see here and if
you look down we have Jardin here as
well but the item sold by jardan at the
first instance is pencil and at the
second instance it's desk now as per the
property we lookup always returns the
first match now ideally when we write
the V lookup function and look for the
units sold by Jardine you will see V
lookup will return on 36 instead of 3
Let's just write
out I'll write the vooka
function my lookup value is Jardine
comma my table array I'll select from
the representatives column till the end
of units column I'll give a comma my
column index number based on the table
array is three I'll give another comma
Now I want the exact match so I'll
select zero close the bracket and hit
enter now as you can see it returns me
the first match of Jardine which is 36
so we lookup did not consider the second
match
similarly if you consider this table we
have Jones repeated Thrice so you have
Jones here you have Jones here for the
second time and also we have Jones for
the third time and let's say you want
want to find the unit cost for Jones so
if I write the vooka
function I'll consider my look of value
as Jones comma my table
array I'll select from the
representatives column till the end of
unit cost column I'll give a comma based
on the table array my unit cost column
is at the fourth index so I'll write
four comma the range look up is zero if
I click on this
and hit enter you can see it here V
lookup has returned the first instance
of Jones and it did not consider the
second and the third instance so our
unit cost for Jones is
1.99 because we lookup only Returns the
first
match okay moving ahead to the next
example we have here is V lookup is case
insensitive if you consider this table
I've added another row in green so if
you see here I have a representative
name called Gil which is in proper case
or popularly known as sentence Keys here
I have added Gil's name
in capital letters are all in uppercase
so I want to find the total revenue
generated by Gil the total revenue is
basically the total column let's do it
I'll write V
lookup my lookup value is Gil which is
is actually in upper case I'll consider
my table array from the representatives
column till the end of total column or
the seals
column based on this selection my column
index number is
five comma the range lookup is false so
I'll just double click on
false if I close the bracket hit enter
you can see it here our vlookup function
has returned the total as
53973 which is actually the value for
this row so clearly V lookup did not
consider Gil which was present at the
bottom of the table in upper case so
this shows that V lookup is clearly case
insensitive all right now moving to the
next example the VCA function supports
wild cards which makes it possible to
perform a partial match on a lookup
value for instance you can use V lookup
to retrieve values from a table after
after typing only part of a lookup value
to use wild cards with vlookup you must
specify the exact match by giving false
or zero for the last argument that is
range lookup now we have a question here
I want to know how much sales did the
representative whose name starts with Ki
make now here sales represents the total
column
actually so I want to find out the
person whose name starts with
Ki so if if you consider the
representative column I have one
representative whose name starts with Ki
that is KL so using Ki as my lookup
value I want to find the total so let me
show you how to use wildcard characters
and find the value using V lookup so
I'll write my function V
lookup okay now in lookup value I'll
give
Ki after that I'm going to write am perc
followed
by double inverted commas then I'm going
to write a star and close the inverted
comma this means the value starts with
Ki Amber sent actually represents
concatenation and star represents
anything followed by Ki so this is going
to be my lookup value in total I'll give
a
comma next I'll select my table array
starting from the representatives column
till the end of total column because I
want to find the
Sals give another
comma my column index number based on
the table array we have selected is five
comma the range lookup is zero because I
want to find an exact match it close the
bracket hit enter you can see it here V
lookup has returned me
999.50 which is actually qals
total now there's another way to do
it instead of selecting the cell in
which we have the lookup value I can
directly write it in the vooka function
so I'll write the vooka function
something like this so my lookup
value I'll pass Ki within double
inverted commas because Ki is a
character value So within double
inverted commas I'm writing Ki followed
by amberon which is for concatenation
followed by a
star within double inverted commas so
this is going to be my look of values
this in total means anything that
appears after Ki will be considered as
the look of
value again the table array I'll select
as these rows and columns comma my
column index number would be five comma
the range lookup is zero if I close the
bracket hit enter you see we have the
same value so this is another method or
another way of using
vlookups okay now moving ahead let's
explore another feature of vlookup so if
the vlookup function cannot find a match
it returns a hash na error now if you
want you can use the if na function to
replace the has na error with a friendly
message so suppose you want to find the
region in which an order was placed on
10th of May 2018
now if the order datee is not found I
want to return a message that is invalid
date
so if you look at the order date column
we don't have any value for 10th of May
2015 you can see these values we don't
have any value corresponding to this
date so if my V lookup function cannot
find this lookup value I'll return
invalid date so let me show you how to
write this
I'll type my V lookup function I'll give
my order date as 10th of May
2015 as my lookup value and then I'll
consider my table array starting from
the order date column till the end of
region
column I'll give another comma my column
index number would be two this time
based on the table aray we have selected
comma I want an exact
match so I'll give zero close the
bracket and hit enter there you go it
has returned me an error now I want to
convert this error to a friendly message
saying invalid date so let me show you
how to do it I'll do it here so to
return a valid
message I'll use the ifna function and
within ifna function I'll give my V
lookup function so let me type if
na I'll hit
tab now for the value parameter I'll use
my lookup function so my lookup value is
going to be the order date comma my
table array I'll select from the order
date column till the end of region
column comma my column index number is
going to be two comma my range lookup is
zero I'll close the bracket give another
comma Now if this expression results in
an error I want to display a message
that is invalid date so I'll put invalid
date within double codes say since it is
a text
message I close the bracket hit enter
you can see the result which is invalid
date now moving on to the final section
of the demo we have two way
lookup now in the v lookup function the
column index parameter is normally
hardcoded as a static number however you
can also create a dynamic column index
by using using the match function to
locate the right
column and this technique allows you to
create a dynamic two-way lookup matching
on both rows and columns now let me
first show you how a match function
works so
suppose I want to find the index where
unit cost column is present so here I'll
use the match function I'll give my
lookup value as the unit cost column
name comma suppose
I'll choose my lookup array starting
from Representatives column till the
unit cost column comma I'll give my
match type as zero for exact match if I
close the bracket hit enter it returns
me four because my array was selected
from the representatives column till the
unit cost column and in this array unit
cost is at the fourth
index all right now using this idea
let's solve the following problem I want
to find the cost of each item sold by
Morgan so let's write our V lookup
formula write
bookup my lookup value is J5 which has
the representatives name as Morgan comma
my table array I'll select from C2 till
F12 I'll give a comma and this time I
know that my column index number is at 4
but I'll be using the match function to
find the
same so I'll write
match my lookup value is unit cost comma
my lookup array is from C1 till
fub1 comma my match type is zero I close
this bracket give another comma and I'll
give my range look up as zero close the
bracket hit enter you can see for Morgan
the unit cost is 19.99 you can verify
from the table for Morgan the unit cost
is
19.99 all right now we have another
question
here I want to find how much sales did
Andrew make in the central region so
here I have two lookup values one is
Central one is Andrews now looking at
these two Val values I want to find the
total to solve such
problems let me first create another
table I'll place the table somewhere
here okay so let me just paste the table
here all right now I'll create another
column where I'll merge the values of
region and representatives so here let
me create another column okay I'll just
name this column as
region
rep all right now this
column I'll use the concatenation
operator so I'll Select East use Amber
Cent and then select Jones I'll hit
enter now the same thing I'll just
duplicate it for the other rows as well
so I have my new column created Now
using this table I can easily solve the
problem now to find the total I'll write
my V lookup
formula so my lookup value will be a
combination of
j11 ERS
Cent k11 comma while table array will
start from the region rep which has the
values of region and rep combined
till the last
column and from this table array my
column is index number is five and my
range lookup is zero if I close the
bracket hit enter you can see for
central region which is this one and for
Andrew's representative the total is
149.
25 all right now we are done with our
demo let's have a quick glance at what
all we did in this demo okay so first of
all we saw our data set which was a
sales data set that we used then we
started with our first example to see
how V looker performs an exact match we
also saw how using the formulas Tab and
lookup and reference you
can write V lookup in another way so you
can use the function arguments to give
your V lookup parameters next we saw how
V lookup performs an approximate match
so we had Matt and raw which were not
present in the representatives column
after that we saw an important property
of V lookup that is V lookup only looks
to the right followed by V lookup only
Returns the first match following which
we saw that V lookup is case insensitive
so here we had added a new row where Gil
was present in upper case but still we
look up found the total revenue for Gil
which was in sentence case or proper
case next we saw how we can use Wild
Card characters to use V lookups and
here we saw how to use an if any
function along with v lookup and finally
we saw how to use two V lookups choose

learn click on the link in the
description to know more now we are on
the sheet of Microsoft Excel and here
you can see some data on my
sheet that is employee name employee ID
and salary so here we are going to
perform our horizontal lookup but before
that let me show you that this
particular drop- down menu so this
particular drop down menu has all the
names of the employees in this
particular table and we have created
this using data validation in Excel if
you want to create the drop- down menus
just like this then feel free to check
out our data validation in Excel
tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement hookup in Excel so here we
have employee name but we want to find
out the employee ID so for that let's
create the H lookup now for that equals
to H
lookup now the first one is a lookup
value so this one is the cell which is
the employee name now after that the
table array we have to select all the
table arrays
here
now the row index number so the employee
ID is in row index number two according
to the table so for that provide two and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false and close the bracket press enter
and there you go and if you select Jack
then you'll find the employee ID of Jack
and if you select Jerry you'll find the
employee ID of cherry reflecting here
now similarly let's find out the salary
of all the employees using using hookup
so equals H
lookup and lookup value that happens to
be the name of the employee now the
table
array and next we have uh row index
number that is salary happens to be the
third R in the table so three
and exact match close the bracket and
enter so now if you change the values in
this particular drop down menu you'll
find the employee ID and the particular
salary so Jack happens to be carrying
the employee ID as 10001 and his salary
is 10,000 so similarly let's try to find
out Peter's employee ID and salary so
there you go one5 and 50,000 as salary
so that's how you use H lookup in Excel
here you can see the first chart so this
particular data is converted into a
table format to avoid confusion while
you're fixing the data so here you can
see the name of the employee employee ID
Department salary and date of joining
and here you can see the salary column
and the bonus percentage of each and
every employee based on their salaries
now coming to the new data table and
here on the table two which is an
updated table here you can find we're
going to find out the department of the
employee and the current Department of
employee and the bonus percentage based
on his or her salary so why are we
finding current Department again so here
you can see that we have an intern Emily
who has joined in the year 2020 but
recently she got promoted as a developer
so her department has been changed from
Department in turn to Department
developer in 2021 so that's what we're
going to find out here in the current
Department using X lookup now let's
start to implement X lookup so for that
equals to X lookup and for lookup you
can see if you need to find out the
lookup value lookup array return array
and all the other two are not important
right now but you can use them to get
some exact matches in the future we'll
also use that in the future for now
let's try to use the first three
parameters that is lookup value lookup
array and written array so the lookup
value is the name of the employee Mary
and lookup array is right here which is
this one now we are going to select the
lookup array then comma and uh we're
going to look up the department so this
is the department lookup
array and that's all we need
close the bracket and press enter okay I
think we missed out the lookup value so
the employee uh or the lookup value
which we required was missed so I've
added it here so that is the lookup
value the first one which is Mary and
there you go press enter and you have
the department here now let's add it to
all the rows and here you have all the
rowes and all the data related to all
the employees now we will find out the
current Department as you can see here
you have Emily as intern which is the
older data but what if you needed the
latest data that is the developer in the
year 2021 right for that you might want
to to the X lookup formula a little bit
so let's try that X look up look up
value which is the same and comma Now
where you have to look for the array
that is lookup array this one and the
return array which happens to be this
one and
next you can find the exact match for
this one so that's all right exact match
and here comes the important part where
you have to search last to first by
default xlookup searches for first to
last that is like this in the starting
place to the last place so that's the
reason why we had Emily as in turn so
now if we give last to first then it
retrieves the latest data where Emily
will be shown as developer now select
that and now you can close the brackets
and press enter so let's add that to all
the rows there you go now you can see
Emily Clark Peter and James all they
have got their updated job profiles as
you can see in the original data Emily
is a developer now so is Clark who was
originally a tester and he got promoted
to development team in 2021
similarly Peter became a senior Finance
executive in 2021 and James the manager
of sales now let's try to find out the
bonus for all these employees based on
their salary so this one is quite simple
so X
lookup now the lookup value is their
existing salary comma and the bonus part
so the lookup array is the salary range
then here is another important point so
here you might want to find the exact
match but finding the exact match will
not help you here you might want to
declare another type of value where you
can get exact match or next smaller item
so you'll understand it why I'm
selecting that so now let's close the
bracket and enter
so so now we have the bonus values now
let's add the bonus value to all the
factors all the rows I mean so you can
see we have different variety of
salaries that is 38,000 22 , 39 Etc but
here in the ranges we have provided 10
20 30 40 and 50 so what if the value is
between 30 and 20 that's when you want
the less number right that's when you
want the number which is equalent to 30
or less than 30 which happens to be 15%
so that's how it has worked here that is
0.15% bonus to the actual salary now we
are on our Excel sheet here you can see
the employee names and employee IDs of
different employees from different zones
let us imagine that the blue one is from
East Green one is from West and the
black one is from or the purple one is
from South and the orange one is from
North so this data is a little small but
what if we had a data with hundreds or
thousands of rows including all the
employee names employee IDs or another
relevant data type like sales of an
employee and his employee ID
and you were supposed to combine all the
data from all the four different zones
into one single sheet it would consume a
lot of time right so recently Microsoft
has released some latest updates based
on Aries and datas so one of those is
vstack function in Excel so how to use
it since it is a latest function I
recommend you to go to the file menu and
in the file menu you can navigate to
account and in the account you can see
the option of update options then you
can select update now and your Microsoft
Office will be updated to the latest
version and you'll get access to the
latest functions in Excel and all the
other office related things like B
presentation Etc now we going to
implement the vack function in Excel it
is completely simple all you need to do
is equals to stack and then select the
data remember to select the data from
column A and cell two or the row two we
are not selecting the employee name and
employee ID we are just selecting the
data now separate them by comma then
again this one here this set and again
this
one and again lastly this particular law
set now close the bracket and press
enter and there you go you have all the
employee names and their respective
employee IDs all together together in
one data set so this is how you use W
stack function in Excel and there are
also a few more new updates from
Microsoft Excel and we will discuss on
them sooner so the name itself conveys
that it is something like a reference
function right so it refers to a cell
which is present in a particular sheet
or the current sheet or it refers to a
particular range in the current sheet or
it can also refer to an entire workbook
in a current window
right so you can stay here on the sheet
number one and you can refer something
which is present on the sheet number 10
or 11 you can stay in this current
workbook and refer to something which is
around in a different workbook altoe so
that's exactly how the indirect function
in Excel works okay so I guess the
definition was a little uh difficult to
get let me show you a simple demo here
so that it becomes a little easier for
you so currently I'm in the cell number
A2 right now here here I will implement
the indirect function press tab to
select it and now I'll refer to the cell
C2 and let's enter and there you go let
me properly close the window it's there
so let me implement the indirect
function here so equals to indirect and
press tab to select now I'll be
selecting the cell C2 and inside C2 we
have E2 address now the formula is fine
I have implemented the indirect function
and selected the cell E2 and now if I
press enter see the magic there you go
so in the cell E2 we have the text hello
world so when I use the indirect
function to refer which is something in
C2 it is indirectly referring to another
cell address that is E2 which has the
text hello world now this one was a
little pretty simpler now let's check
some complicated ones and we'll move to
sheet number one here we have some
student names and their uh you know uh
marks on the individual subjects that is
math science English computer science
and here and here you can see I'm
selecting the student names and
accordingly I'm getting their average
score and the total marks obtained right
seems interesting how did I do this so
this is done exactly using the indirect
function so let's do it again so this is
how you do it now here I will be using
okay before we get into this uh we need
to do some fundamentals before we do it
right so the fundamentals are you need
to name your individual columns so here
I have Brian and his marks so I'll
select entire marks of Bri ranging from
B2 to B4 right click and here you can
see Define name and I'll be naming it as
Brian it's already name we we might get
an error so it's already named okay
let's add another one
maybe uh Jennifer let's cancel this so
let's uh add
Jenny and her marks will be
96 87 I'm selecting some random numbers
here so
87 so we have the new column here now we
need to name this column Define a name
and it's Jenny so Excel has
automatically selected the name for this
column so let's press okay now we have
our columns ready now here if you see
the drop down we have Amy bana Brian
Brock Emily Jenny John everyone over
here right so the columns are named the
individual columns are named so now the
student name so here you can use some
simple trick called Data validation here
select the data option in the toolbar
navigate to data tools here select data
validation and uh in this instead of any
value select list and here give the
source as this particular
set press okay so that you get the drop
down menu over here you can also type
the individual names again when you type
the individual names you might go wrong
with the case or spelling right so it's
better always to use this kind of list
options which will make things easier
for you now getting into the average
calculation so here the average will be
uh equals to average press tab to select
now the indirect function indirect
of the cell address and close the
bracket first you might get an error
because currently it is empty so select
some name and you'll get your average
score now same thing applies to uh you
know total uh you can press the sum
function select the sum function and uh
type in the indirect function and uh the
cell V1 close the brackets and press
enter so that's how you do it however if
you are looking to get certified then
hey there we are here with an amazing
course through which you can catch the
eyes of top Recruiters in the industry
allow me to introduce postgraduate
program in data analytics by simply
learn so what are you waiting for hurry
up and enroll Now find the cost Link in
the description box now at times you
might working on a really important
spreadsheet on your Excel or you might
have the sales data of your company or
some confidential data of your
organization and you might have shared
the file with your junior or you might
face some paret issue and you forgot to
save or you missed to save your data and
what to do if you cannot save your data
and how can you recover it right so this
might be a really big hassle today we
are exactly going to discuss the same
and see how to do it in multiple ways so
Excel comes up with an option option to
automatically save the data also it will
try to warn you that your data is not
being saved would you like me to save it
or not right so we'll do the first one
so here you have the autosave option you
can either say okay to it or you can
ignore it in case if you ignore it if
you choose to ignore it or if you choose
to manually save it and then if you want
to close the file remember we haven't
saved the file if you wish to close it
Excel will automatically come up with a
dialogue box asking you want to save
your changes to your data.
xlsx that means it is asking you if I
have to save it or not let's try to
ignore this and forcefully let's try to
close it you can go to task manager
option here we are trying to simulate
the option of par issues so we are
forcefully closing Excel without saving
any
data so we have closed it now here you
can see we do not have Excel running in
the background now when you directly
open or try to start Excel when you get
the power backup again and if you want
to open that same data file it will ask
you the document recovery option it says
you have closed the file without saving
the changes and you can choose to you
know come back from the same place where
we left last time okay now that was the
paret issue and now let's see uh another
way okay let's imagine that somebody uh
eliminated few important data files from
your organization's confidential data
employee ID employee name Etc and again
uh let's simulate the force uh close of
the
Excel now we are closing it again
without saving no data has been
saved now it will also ask the same uh
data it has another version here the
original one which wasn't saved so here
you can recover the same file again how
however it was initially so you can save
it and it will get back to the original
place so this was one way also we have
another few multiple ways just we have
to navigate to file and here you can
open and in the open menu you have a
button called recover unsaved workbooks
not just the current workbook it will
also have all the remaining files which
are related to excel that are not saved
so here you have a few workbooks which
was not saved this is one option and we
also have another option we can just
navigate to info and there you have
another option called manage workbook
and in the manage workbook you have
another option called recover unsaved
workbooks which will also redirect you
to the same file that is Microsoft
Office unsaved files and you'll have all
the unsaved workbooks which are related
to excel so this is how you can recover
the unsaved data in Excel using multiple
ways first thing Excel will
automatically ask you if you have to
save the file or not and in case if you
forget to save it you can directly
recover it by default by Excel it will
automatically show that some folder was
not saved on the left side of your Excel
spreadsheet by default and in case if
you missed out on that one you can
manually go to file and you can either
choose open option or info option to
recover the unsaved folders from your
default file location from your PC that
is Microsoft Office unsaved file
Etc which will have all the list of all
unsaved workbooks related to excel let's
see what is a project plan project plan
is a basic thing that is needed to
execute a project according to project
management book of knowledge a project
can be defined as an approved
elaborative document that guides the
team during project execution and
project control when we are making a
project plan a project plan must answer
several questions for us these questions
are like what are we expecting our
project to deliver how are we expecting
to get our deliverables within the
desired time who all will be a part of a
project and what tasks they will have in
the project when will the project start
and when it is expected to end that is
the deadlines of the project now let us
learn about project management in Excel
Microsoft Excel is one of the most
common application these days it is used
in both offices and at homes Microsoft
Excel is an easy project management tool
that allows the team members to easily
see the tasks in a project develop a
plan and track its progress before we
learn more about project management in
Excel let's first have a look why do we
use Excel Microsoft Excel is an easy
tool to plan a project so it can be used
by people who are beginners in terms of
project management in Excel one can find
several analytical tools like
concatenate Len and counter so this
makes data analysis easy and effective
as the entry of data is easy same is
tracking and controlling of project
status then there are several project
management templates in Excel that help
us to have an effective distribution of
project data we will be checking several
project management templates towards the
end of this video now let's have a look
at the process of making a Gant chart in
Excel before we begin this it's
important we know what is a gan chart a
gan chart is like an horizontal bar
chart that is used for project
management with the help of a gan chart
we can check the status of the task the
date they start the date they end and
the dependencies on each other Gan chart
helps in coordinating and monitoring
different tasks in a project now let's
have a look at the steps that will help
us in making a Gant chart first step we
have is make a project table we have
several rows and columns like here we
have three columns in the First Column
we have the tasks in the second we have
our start date and in the third column
we have the duration or tenure of the
task the second step is to make a bar
chart in Excel for this we will select
the entire second column then we will go
on the insert Tab and click on the bar
graph chart there we can select staged
bar graph in 2D bar charts as a result
we will have the entitled bar graph on
the screen in the third step we will add
the duration to the bar graph we will
right click on the chart and in the menu
that appears we will select select data
option a window that appears on the
screen in that window we will select add
option as shown we can also see the
start date is already in the entry
section then in the dialog box that
appears type tenure in the series name
and click on the Range selection icon
that's shown in the figure now select
the relevant data from the tenure column
and click on okay now we can see a bar
graph that has two colors on the screen
this bar graph now has the duration of
the tasks the fourth step we have is
adding description to the Gant chart now
we will open the box again and in that
box we will select the edit option as
shown in the figure then we will select
the tasks as we had selected the
duration of the task before and click on
okay we can now see the tasks have
appeared towards the left side of the
Gand chart the fifth and the remarkable
step will help us convert this bar graph
into a Gant chart we will now click on
the bars and select the format data
series option from the menu that appears
then in the format data series dialog
box we will select no fill option we can
find our Gant chart on the screen now in
accordance with the data that we had
entered now we can see the tasks on the
left side are in the reverse order so
what we will do next is we will click on
the task panel then go to the format
xess dialog box and select the
categories in reverse order option now
we can find our tasks in the right order
one more thing we can notice is Gan
chart is starting with some other date
and not with the dates that we had
entered so for this we will copy the
first date in some other cell then
clicking on the copied cell we will go
to the home menu to select the dialogue
box as shown in the figure then in that
drop- down menu we will select the
number option we can now find a value
displayed in the copied cell we will
copy that value click on the dates on
the chart and as the format access
dialogue box opens we will paste that
value in the box that says minimum shown
in the figure as a result we will have
our final Gan chart on the screen in the
last step we can give several designs to
a Gand chart change colors and make it
more presentable for us now when we know
the basic steps of making a Gant chart I
will show that practically to you in
Microsoft Excel our first step is to
open Microsoft Excel and in Microsoft
Excel we will make a project table in a
project table we will have three columns
the First Column will be task the second
column will have the start date the
third column will have tenure or the
duration of the task so beginning with
tasks we have task one in task one we
have 1.1 1.2 1.3 then comes task two in
task two we have 2.1 2.2 2.3 and 2.4
then we have task three in task 3 we
will have two subsections 3.1 and 3.2
then we will start with the starting
dates in starting dates we'll put 1st
January the Task 1 1.1 will be 1st of
January then this will be 4th January
let's say this is 5th January then we
will put this as 11th of January and
this this will be again 11th January
only this will be 15th January let's put
this as 17th January let this be 19th
January task 3 begins on 23rd January
and it the 3.2 section begins at 26th of
January now let's put the tenure or the
duration of the task we will begin with
task one it takes 12 days then 1.1 takes
7 days we say this takes 4 days and this
takes 8 days then for task two it again
takes 12 days it takes 5 days 5 days and
let's say this takes 6 days and this
takes 4 days then we come to task three
this takes 8 days and let's say this
takes 6 days and the 3.2 section takes 5
days so this is how our project table is
ready in the second step we will select
the entire second column after we have
selected this column we will go to the
insert tab in the insert tab we'll go to
the bar columns and in this we will
select 2D staged bar charts now we have
the entitled bar chart in accordance to
our data on the screen then comes the
third step we will add the duration of
the tasks to the bar graph we will click
on the chart and after we click on the
chart we will select select data option
in the select data source dialog box we
find the start date is already there now
we will click on ADD and after we click
on add in the series name section we
will put tenure then in the series value
we will click on this icon and select
the entire tenure series and click on
okay so this is the bar graph that we
have now this is now in two colors the
orange color and the blue color this bar
graph now has the duration of all the
tasks in our project table now in the
fourth step now it's time for us to add
description to our Gand chart instead of
this one 2 3 4 5 we will put task one
task two and the subtasks so what we
will do is we will again go to that box
we will left click on the Gant chart
select the select data option and then
we'll go to the start date here we'll
select the edit option in the edit
option we will select all the tasks and
click on okay now we can see all the
tasks are aligned towards the left of
the bar chart as we can see this is a
bar chart or a bar graph and not a gan
chart the next step we have is
converting this bar graph into a Gant
chart so we will click on the bars and
select the format data series option
from the menu that appears here we have
this format data series option now we
can see the dialog box on the screen
here we'll go into the color section
fill section and then we will select no
fill now we can see the blue lines have
disappeared so this looks like a gan
chart so now when we have a gan chart on
the screen we can notice that the task
here are in the reverse order so what we
will do is we will click on these tasks
and select the format X as option here
we'll select categories in reverse order
we can see our Gan chart is now in order
like we have a task one on the top and
task three at the bottom the dates are
starting from 11th of December but the
dates we have provided are from 1st of
January now we will copy this cell then
go on the dates box here we'll go to
format access in the format access we
can see minimum in this minimum we will
paste this value and press enter as we
press enter we can see our Gant chart
starting from the date that we wanted to
start and that to in the correct order
starting from task one to task three now
as a result we have our final Gand chart
on the screen in the last step what we
can do is make our Gand chart more
representable we can change the color of
These Bars we can give them shapes and
we can do many other things to make it
more presentable we will first select
the bars like what we will do is we will
select task one and let's say we give it
the color blue then task two we will
give it color green and in task three
we'll give it give it the color black so
here the subsections will give different
colors to the subsections as well then
we come to task 2.1 this is how we can
change the color of these cells or apart
from changing colors we can select a bar
graph and do the gradient fill so this
is how we can make a gan chart more
presentable after changing the colors or
changing the shapes we have our final
Gand chart on the screen finally let's
have a look at some Microsoft Excel
templates for project management
Microsoft Excel templates help in
collecting data putting them into order
and check their dependencies with each
other with the help of these templates
we can monitor the status of the tasks
and we can also check the progress our
project has made moving forth we will
check some important Microsoft Excel
templates the first template we have is
Excel project review template this
template helps us have an overview of
the project we can have a clear
understanding of all the tasks that are
planned and that are completed this
helps project managers to measure the
progress of the project and take further
steps accordingly second template we
will check is Excel budget template in
this template we can monitor all the
expenditures of our project it helps us
in managing the budget of a project and
also helps in comparing the budget of a
project at different phases let's have a
look at the budget template in Excel on
we can download this template from
Office timeline.com the G chart towards
the right is in accordance with the
dates towards the left if we fluctuate
the date we can see the template working
the start date for task one could be
changed to 10th June if we change this
date to 10 June we can see the
fluctuation in the Gant chart so this is
how we can use this template directly
let's have a look at the third template
now third template we will see is Excel
Sprint Project tracker template this
template is used majorly in agile
projects where the project is made in
several Sprints or sessions this
template includes the start date the end
date and the duration of each task we
can also see the percentage completed of
each task let's have a look at this
Sprint Project tracker template as well
we can see the Gan chart towards the
right and the data towards the left so
if we change any data we can see the
Gant chart changing for example we can
change the data in Sprint 2 feature 3
let's change the start date to July 2nd
we can see the Gan chart changing this
is how we can use this template directly
to track our sessions let's have a look
at the fourth Excel template this
template is Excel project tracker in
this template we have the data of all
the tasks with the status and owners we
can track the percentage of task
completed and also compare the planed
duration of the task to the actual
duration of the task after the critical
part tracker let's check the Excel
project schedule template this template
helps in effective management of the
project as it helps in monitoring the
time that each task of the project takes
it provides a clear view of all the work
associated with the project let's have a
look at this template in Excel ones we
can see the Gan chart in accordance to
the data if we change the estimated as
at two places let's say at the design
review we make it 15 hours instead of 5
hours and at the create Staffing plan we
make it 2 hours instead of 20 hours we
can see the Gant chart fluctuating this
is how we can use this template to
manage the schedule in a project moving
forward the next template we will see is
Excel project status report template
this template helps us having a list of
project deliverable and the risks
associated with that project this
template helps the project managers
about different crucial activities
involved in a project after this we have
Excel Milestone tracker the Milestone
tracker helps us in tracking or
monitoring different tasks in a project
project managers use this template to
monitor the project performance with
respect to the timelines the last
template we will see is Excel project
planner Excel project planner includes a
list of task with the respected owners
along with the start date and the end
date of that task the this helps in
monitoring each task and comparing the
estimated task date with the actual ones
let's have a look at this template in
Excel we can see the Gant chart with
respect to the data entered let's make
changes at several places in the data we
can make this 22 to 24 we will make this
23 go to two and we can make this 5th
September go to 15th September and when
we make the changes we can realize the
Gand chart is fluctuating so this is how
we can use this template to plan a
project effectively and efficiently so
first let's understand what exactly is
Mis report in
Excel so Mis stands for management
information system Mis reports provide
data on different categories for
accurate decision making so Mis in Excel
is a procedure to create interactive
report using Microsoft Excel so Mis
reports help management to access the
performance of organization and allow
fast F decision making so if you know to
create the Mis reports using various
business intelligence tools such as
Excel then you might find a very good
job opportunity in a well established
company now let us try to learn how to
create Mis report using Excel in a
practical mode so let's get back to the
Microsoft Excel IF getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so here you can
see that got some sales data of various
car manufacturing companies and I've
also got some slices so using these slic
I can get the realtime information from
the dashboard so I'll select an ER from
the first slicer and I'll go into the
second slicer and I'll select a company
now I'll select BMW and SUV type so we
have the data of all the SUV types cars
manufactured by BMW car manufacturing
company in the year 2018 now let's start
and create something similar to this
one so how did I create this mis report
let's go through this in a step-by-step
way so on my screen you can see that we
have created a completely new Excel
workbook and we have some sample data
with five rows and 20 columns so this
particular data is based on the
manufacturer year and the car
manufacturing company and the type of
the car manufactured and number of cars
manufactured in that particular year and
also the price of that particular car
now to create Mis reports we need to
play around fav tables so we also have
tutorials on PV tables and you can go
through that in our simply learn YouTube
channel and also we will try to link
those in the description box below now
let's select the entire data and go into
the insert ribbon and there you can see
the first option that is pivot
table so after selecting the pivot table
option it will show this particular
dialogue box where it will ask you for
the range of cells you need to select
and the next one is to create the P
table in the same sheet or a new sheet
so we'll take a new sheet here now
select okay and there you go you have
the pivot table here so first you have
an empty pivot table and on the right
side you can see we have pivot table
Fields now you can either drag these
options into the rows and columns or you
can also click it so now let's drag and
drop these first we will select
year and
guard followed by that we will take type
quantity and price to
columns so there you go we have our
pivot table now let's select all the
data in the pivot table and again let's
get back to the insert
option and here you can see an option
called pivot chart so select that and
you will have various pivot chart
options here now you can select any one
which you can prefer or which you like
or whichever you think can represent
your data in a best way possible so now
let's go with column chart first let's
select okay and we have our column chart
over
here now this happens to be our first
chart now let's create a few more charts
so to create few more charts we'll go
back to the same original data so select
again insert and pivot
table now again a new
worksheet so here we have another Mt
pivot table in the similar way let's
drag the same data into rows and
columns there you go and again we will
select all the data and create a pivot
chart go to insert option pivot chat and
now let's try to select pie
chat select okay and we have our pie
chart over here now let's try to create
one more same procedure select table
select pivot table then create new
worksheet for the new pivot table and
now drag and drop the
data now let's go to insert
again let's select all the data go to
insert option and pivot chart now let's
try to select the bar chart select okay
and there we have our bar chart now
remember the first chart we created that
is in sheet two this one so we will try
to move all the charts to this
particular table or this particular
worksheet so let's get back to the sheet
number three right click and you can see
an option called pivot chart analyze so
from here you can move the chart select
the option of moving the chart and don't
select the first one select the object
in option and select the sheet number to
which you want to move this chart for
now we want to move this chart to sheet
number two select that press okay now we
have the chart moved to the sheet number
two and in the same way let's go to the
sheet number four and let's move this
particular chart to sheet number
two there you go the chart got moved to
sheet number two
now you can insert the slices so we have
selected the third sheet or third chart
and inside the pivot chart analyze
option we have an option of inserting
the slicer now we will insert the slices
for ear car
and
type now select open okay and you will
have all the three slices onto your
sheet now let's rearrange
them so I'm just organizing them in a
neat
way there you
go and you can also customize your
design designs for all the
charts so that they look a little more
better now if you see if I make some
changes only one chart will be
interacting for this right so if I
select Ferrari and year 2020 and option
as Sports you can see only one chart is
interacting to these particular slices
why because all these slices are
connected to just one chart here so you
need to make sure that all these slices
are connected to all the three charts
what we created so let's erase all the
filters and select one slicer at a time
right click and you will see an option
of report connections select that and
you see that the connections are only
connected to the pivot table 3 so select
the remaining PV tables as well select
okay and in the same way select the
second slice
select the report connection option
connect pivot table 1 and two and select
okay and in the same way the third
one so now all the slices are connected
to all the pivot charts now if you make
some changes here they will respond
automatically in the same way now let's
select the for company the year 2019 and
hashack option and you have all the cars
which were made in the year 2019 from
Ford Company in the segment of
hashack so this was the sample data set
that we worked on now you can also work
on some complex data set such as this
Superstar data
set now one thing you need to make sure
that when you're working with Excel Mis
you need to make sure that all the
macros are disabled on your data set and
you convert the entire data into the
regular table format of excel right now
Excel is considering this particular
data as a database so for that that you
need to select all the datar Press contr
T and then convert the entire data in
the form of tabular data and also don't
forget to click this icon which reads my
table has headers so the first row is
the headers now let's select okay and
your entire data will be converted into
tabular form now let's reset this to the
normal type which has the clear color
not all the fancy colors now the entire
data is converted from the dbms to the
Tet form and now he can start
implementing the Mis reports and PIV
tables and uh so why exactly do we need
to do time serious analysis typically we
would like to predict something in the
future and uh it could be stock prices
it could be the sales or um anything
that needs to be predicted into the
future that is when we use time series
analysis so it is uh um as the name
suggests it is forecasting and typically
when we say predict it need not be into
the future in machine learning in data
analysis when we talk about predicting
we are not necessarily talking about the
future but in Time series analysis we
typically predict the future so we have
some past data and we want to predict
the future that is when we perform time
series analysis so what are some of the
examples uh it could be daily stock
price the shares as we talk about or
could be the interest rates weekly
interest rates or sales figures of a
company so these are some of the
examples where we use time series data
we have historical data which is
dependent on time and then based on that
we create a model to predict the future
so what exactly is uh time series so
time series data has time as one of the
components as the name suggests so in
this example let's say this is the stock
price data and uh one of the components
so there are two columns here column B
is the price and column A is basically
the time information in this case the
time is a day so that primarily the
closing price of a particular stock has
been recorded on a daily basis so this
is a Time series data and the time
interval is obviously a day time series
or time intervals can be daily weekly
hourly or even sometimes uh there is
something like a sensor data it could be
every few milliseconds or micros as well
so the size of the time intervals can
vary but they are fixed so if I'm saying
that the it is daily data then the
interval is fixed as daily if I'm saying
this data is an hourly data then it is
the data is captured every hour and so
on so the time intervals are fixed the
interval itself you can decide based on
what kind of data we are capturing so
this is a graphical representation the
previous one here we are the table
representation and this is how to plot
the data so on the Y AIS is let's say
the price or the the stock price and
x-axis is the time so against time if
you plot it this is how a Time series
graph would look so as the name suggests
what is time series data time series
data is basically a sequence of data
that is recorded over a specific
intervals of time and based on the past
Valu so if we want to do an analysis of
Time series F data we try to for cast a
future and uh again as the name suggests
it is time series data which means that
it is time dependent so time is one of
the components of this data time series
data consists of primarily four
components one is the trend then we have
the seasonality then cyclicity and then
last but not least irregularity or the
random component sometimes is also
referred to as a random component so
let's see what each of these components
are so what is strength trend is overall
change or the pattern of the data which
means that the data may be let me just
uh pull up the pen and uh show you so
let's say you have a data set somewhat
like this a Time series data set
somewhat like this all
right so what is the overall trend there
is an overall trend which is upward
Trend as we call it here right so it is
not like it is continuously increasing
there are times when it is dipping then
there are times when it is increasing
then it is decreasing and so on but
overall over a period of time from the
time we start recording to the time we
end there is a trend right there is an
upward Trend in this case so the trend
need not always be upwards there could
be a downward Trend as well so for
example here there is a downward Trend
right so this is basically what is uh a
trend overall whether the data is
increasing or decreasing all right then
we have the next component which is
seasonality what is seasonality
seasonality as the name suggest once
again changes over a period of time and
periodic changes right so there is a
certain pattern um let's take the sales
of warm clothes for example so if we
plot it along the months so let's say
January February March April May June
July and then let's say it goes up to
December December okay so this is our
December a d I will just mark it as D
and then you again have gen F March and
then you get another December okay and
just for Simplicity let's mark these as
December as the end of the year and then
one more December okay so what will
happen when if you're talking about warm
clothes what happens the sales of warm
clothes will increase probably around
December when it is cold and then they
will come down and then again around
December again they will increase and
then the sales will come down and then
there will be again an increase and then
they will come down and then again an
increase and then they will come down
let's say this is the sales pattern so
you see here there is a trend as well
there is an upward Trend right the sales
are increasing over let's say these are
multiple years this is for year 1 this
is for year two this is for year three
and so on so for multiple years overall
the trend there is an upward Trend the
sales are increasing but it is not a
continuous increase right so there is a
certain pattern so what is happening
what is the pattern every December the
sales are increasing or they are peing
for that particular year right then
there is a new year again when December
approaches the sales are increasing
again when December approaches the sales
are increasing and so on and so forth so
this is known as seasonality so there is
a certain fluctuation which is uh which
is periodic in nature so this is known
as seasonality then cyclicity what is
cyclicity now Cy city is somewhat
similar to seasonality but here the
duration between two cycles is much
longer so seasonality typically is
referred to as an annual kind of a
sequence like for example we saw here so
it is pretty much like every year in the
month of December the sales are
increasing however cyclicity what
happens is first of all the duration is
pretty much not fixed and the duration
or the Gap length of time between two
Cycles can be much longer so recession
is an example so we had let's say
recession in 2001 or 2002 perhaps and
then we had one in
2008 and then we had probably in 200
2012 and so on and so forth so it is not
like every year this happens probably so
there is usually when we say recession
there is a slump and then it recovers
and then there is a slump and then it
recovers and probably there is another
bigger slump and so on right so you see
here this is similar to seasonality but
first of all this length is much more
than a year right that is number one and
it is not fixed as well it is not like
every four years or every six years that
duration is not fixed so the the
duration can vary at the same time the
gap between two cycles is much longer
compared to seasonality all right so
then what is irregularity irregular it
is like the random component of the time
series data so there is like you have
part which is the trend which tells
whether the overall it is increasing or
decreasing then you have cyclicity and
seasonality which is like kind of a
specific pattern right uh then there is
a cyclicity which is again a pattern but
at much longer intervals plus there is a
random component so which is not really
which cannot be accounted for very
easily right so there will be a random
component which can be really random as
the name suggest right so that is the
irregularity component so these are the
various components of Time series data
yes there are conditions where we cannot
use time series analysis right so is it
can we do time series analysis with any
kind of data no not really so what are
the situations where we are uh we cannot
do time series analysis so there will be
some data which is collected over a
period of time but it's really not
changing so it will not really not make
sense to perform any time series
analysis over it right for example like
this one so if we take X as the time and
Y as the value of whatever the output we
talking about and if the Y value is
constant there is really no analysis
that you can do uh leave alone time
series analysis right so that is one
another possibility is yes there is a
change but it is changing as per a very
fixed function like a sine wave or a c
wave again time series analysis will not
make sense in this kind of a situation
because there is a definite pattern here
there is a definite function that the
data is following so it will not make
sense to do a Time series analysis now
before performing any time series
analysis uh the data has to be
stationary and uh typically time series
data is not stationary so in which case
you need to make the data stationary
before we apply any model like ARA model
or any of these right so what exactly is
stationary data and what is meant by
stationary data let us take a look first
of all what is non-stationary data time
series data if you recall from one of my
earlier slides we said that time series
data has the following four components
the trend seasonality cyclicity and
random random component or irregularity
right so if these components are present
in Time series data it is non-stationary
which means that typically these
components will be present therefore
most of the time A Time series data that
is collected raw data is nonstationary
data so it has to be changed to
stationary Data before we apply any of
these algorithms all right so a
nonstationary Time series data would
look like this which means like for
example here there is an upward Trend
the seasonality component is there and U
also the random component and so on so
if the data is not not stationary then
the time series forecasting will be
affected so you cannot really perform a
Time series forecasting on a
non-stationary data so how do we
differentiate between a stationary and a
non-stationary Time series data
typically or technically one is of
course you can do it visually in
non-stationary data the the data will be
more flattish the seasonality will of
course be there but the trend will not
be there so the data May if we pl plot
that it may appear somewhat like this
right it's a horizontal line along the
horizontal line you will see compared to
the original data which was there was an
upward Trend so it was changing somewhat
like this right so this is
non-stationary data and this is our
stationary data would look visually what
does this mean technically this means
that stationarity of the data depends on
a few things what the mean the variance
and the co-variance so these are the
three components on which the
stationerity of the dat depends so let's
take a look at what each of these are
for stationary data the mean should not
be a function of time which means that
the mean should pretty much remain
constant over a period of time right so
there is there shouldn't be any change
uh so this is how the stationary data
Outlook and this is a a nonstationary
data Outlook I've shown in the previous
slide as well so here the mean is
increasing that means there is an upward
Trend okay so that is one part of it and
then the variance of the series should
not be also a function of time so the
variance also should be pretty much
common or should be constant rather uh
so this is a if we visually we take a
look this is how time series stationary
data would look where the variance is
not changing here the variance is
changing therefore this is
non-stationary and we cannot apply time
series forecasting on this kind of data
similarly the co-variance which is
basically of the ith term and the i+
term should not be a function of time as
well so co-variance is nothing but not
only the variance at the ath term but
the relation between the variance of the
ith term and the I plus MTH or the I
plus neth term so as again once again
visually this is how it would look if
the co-variance is also changing with
respect to time so these are the three
all three components should be pretty
much constant and that is when you have
stationary data and in order to perform
time series analysis the data should be
stationary okay so let's take a look at
uh the concept of moving average or the
method of moving average and let's see
how it works we'll do simple
calculations so let's say this is our
sample data we have the data for 3
months January February March the sales
in hundreds of in thousands rather not
hundreds thousands of dollars is given
here and uh now we want to find the
moving average so how do we find the
moving average we call it as moving
average three so moving average three is
nothing but you take three of the values
or the readings add them up and uh
divide by three vly the way we take a
mean or average of the three values so
that is as simple as that so that's the
average first of all so what is moving
average moving average is if you now
have a series of data you keep taking
the three values the next three values
and then you take the average of that
and then the next three values and so on
and so forth so that is how you take the
moving average so let's take a little
more detailed example example of car
sales so this is how we have the car
sales data for the entire year let's say
so rather for four years so year one we
have for each quarter quarter 1 2 3 4
and then year two quarter 1 2 3 4 and so
on and so forth so this is how we have
sales data of a particular car let's say
or a showroom and uh we want to forecast
for year five so we have the data for
four years we now want to forast for the
fifth year let's see how it works first
of all if we plot the data as it is uh
taken the raw data this is how it would
look and uh what do you think it is is
it stationary no right because there is
a trend upward Trend so this is not a
stationary data so we um we need to
later we will see how to make it
stationary but to start with just an
example we will not worry about it for
now we will just go ahead and uh
manually do the forecasting using what
is known as moving average method okay
so we are not applying any algorithm or
anything like that in the next video we
will see how to apply an algorithm how
to make it stationary and so on all
right so um here we see that all the
three or four components that we talked
about um are there there is a trend
there is a seasonality and then of
course there is some random component as
well cyclicity may not be is possible
that cyclicity is not applicable in all
the situations for sales especially
there may not be or unless you're taking
a sales for maybe 20 30 years cyclicity
may not come into play so we will just
consider uh primarily the trend
seasonality and irregularity right so
Random it is also known as random
irregularity right so we were calling
the random or irregularity component so
these are the three main components
typically in this case we will talk
about so this is the trend component and
um we will see how to do these uh
calculations so let's take a look redraw
the table
including the time code we will add
another column which is the time code
and uh this the column and we'll just
number it like 1 2 3 4 up to 16 the rest
of the data Remains the Same okay so we
will do the calculations now now let us
do the moving average calculations um or
ma4 as we call it for each year so we
take all the four quarters and we take
an average of that so if we add up these
four values and divide by four you get
the moving average of 3.4 so we start by
putting the value here so that will be
for the third quarter let's say 1 2 3
the third quarter then we will go on to
the next one so we take the next four
values as you see here and take the
average of that which is the moving
average for the next quarter and so on
and so forth now if we just do the
moving average uh it is not centered so
what we do is we basically add add one
more column and we calculate the
centered moving average as shown here so
here what we do is we take the average
of two values and then just adding these
values here so for example the first
value for the third quarter is actually
the average of the third and the fourth
quarter so we have 3.5 now it gets
centered so similarly the next value
would be 3.6 plus 3.9 ided by 2 so which
is 3.7 and so on and so forth okay so
that is the centered moving average this
is done primarily to smooth the data so
that there are not too many rough edges
so that is what we do here so if we
visualize this data now uh this is how
it looks right so if we take the
centered moving average as you can see
there is a gradual increase if this was
not the case if we had not centered it
the changes would have been much sharper
so that is the basically the smoothening
that we are talking about now let's go
go and or do the forecast for the fifth
year so in order to do the forecast what
we will do is we will take the centered
moving average as our Baseline and then
start doing a few more calculations that
are required in order to come up with
the prediction so what we are going to
do is we are going to use this
multiplicity or multiplicative model in
this case and this is how it it looks so
we take the product of seasonality and
uh the trend and the irregularity
components and we just multiply that and
in order to get that this product of
these two We have basically the actual
value divided by CMA YT value divided by
CMA will give you the predicted value of
YT is equal to the product of all three
components therefore St into YT is equal
to YT by CMA so this is like this is
equal to YT right so therefore if we
want St into YT the product of
seasonality and irregularity is equal to
YT by CMA so that is how we will work it
out I also have an Excel sheet of the
actual data so let me just pull that up
all right so this is how the data looks
in Excel as you can see here year one
quarter 1 2 3 4 year to quarter 1 2 3 4
and so on and this is the sales data and
then this is the moving average as I
mentioned this is how we calculate and
this is the centered moving average so
this is the primary component that we
will start working with and then we will
calculate since we want the product of
St into YT that is equal to YT by CMA so
if you see this values are nothing but
the YT value divided by CMA so in this
case it is 4 by 3.5 which is 1.14
similarly 4.5 by 3.7 1.22 and so on and
so forth so we take we have the product
s into it and uh then the next step is
to uh calculate the average of um
respective quarters so that is what we
are doing here average of respective
quarters and then we need to calculate
the deseasonalized values so in order to
get deseasonalized value we need to
divide YT by St that was calculated so
for example here it is 2.8 by .9 so we
got the decaled value here and uh then
we get the trend and then we get the
predicted uh values so in order to get
the predicted value which is basically
we predict the values for known values
as well like for example year one
quarter 1 we know the value but now that
we have our model we predict ourselves
and see how close it is so we predicted
as 2.89 whereas the actual value is 2.8
then we have 2.59 the actual value is
2.1 and so on just to see how our model
works and then continue that into the
fifth year because for fifth year we
don't have a reference value okay and if
we plot this we will come to know how
well our calculations are how well our
manual model in this case we did not
really use a model but we did on our own
manually so it will tell us the trend so
for example the predicted value is this
gray color here and you can see that it
is actually pretty much following the
actual value which is the blue color
right and the gray color is the
predicted value so the wherever we know
the values up to year four we can see
that our predicted values are following
or pretty much very close to the actual
values and then from here onwards when
the year five starts the blue color line
is not there because we don't have the
actual values only the predicted values
so we can see that since it was
following the trend pretty much for the
last four years we can safely assume
that it has understood the pattern and
it is predicting correctly for the next
one year the next four quarters right so
that is what we are doing here so these
four quarters we did not have actual
data but we have the predicted values so
let's go back and see how this is
working in this using the slides so this
is we already saw this part and um I
think it was easier to see in the Excel
sheet so we calculated the St it the
product of St and it using the formula
like here y by YT by CMA we got that and
then we got ST which is basically YT so
this is the average of the first
quarters for all the four years and uh
similarly this is the average of the
second quarter for all the four years
and so on so these values are repeating
there they are calculated only once they
get repeated as you can see here and uh
then we get the
deseasonalized data and that is
basically YT by St so we calculated St
here and we have YT so YT by St will
give you the desaly data and uh we have
got rid of the seasonal and The
Irregular component so far now what we
are left with is the trend and uh before
we start the time series forecasting or
time series analysis as I mentioned
earlier we need to completely get rid of
the non-stationary components so we are
still left with the trend component so
now let us also remove the trend
component in order to do that we have to
find the or we have to calculate the
intercept and slope of the data because
that is required to calculate the trend
and uh how are we going to do that we
will actually use um what is known as a
regression tool or Analytics tool that
is available in Excel so you remember we
have our data in Excel so let me take
you to the Excel and uh here we need to
calculate the intercept and the slope in
order to do that we have to use the
regression mechanism and in order to use
the regression mechanism we have to use
the Analytics tool that comes with Excel
so how do you activate this tool so this
is how you would need to activate the
Tool uh from Excel you need to go to
options and uh in options there will be
addin and in addin you will have um
analysis tool back and you select this
and um you just say go it will open up a
box like this you say analysis tool pack
and you say Okay And now when you come
back in to the regular view of excel in
the data tab you will see data analysis
activated so you need to go to file
options and addins and then analysis
tool pack typically since I've already
added it it is coming at the top but it
would come under inactive application
addin so when you're doing it for the
first time so don't use VBA you just say
analysis tool pack there are two options
one with VBA like this one and one
without VBA so just use the one without
VBA and then instead of just saying okay
just take care that you click on this go
and not just okay so you say go then it
will give you these options only then
you select just the analysis tool pack
and then you say okay all right so and
then when you come back to the main view
you click on data okay so this is your
normal home view perhaps so you need to
come to data and here is where you will
see data analysis available to you and
then if you click on that there are a
bunch of possibilities what kind of data
analysis you want to do if there are
options are given right now we just want
to do regression because we want to find
the slope and The Intercept so so select
regression and you say
okay and you will get these options for
input y range and input X range input y
range is the value YT so you just select
this and you can select up to here and
press enter and input X range you can
for now you start with uh the baseline
or you can also start with the D
seasoned values so you can just click on
these and say
okay I have already calculated it so
these are the intercept and the
coefficients that we are getting for
these values and we will actually use
that to calculate our Trend here right
so which is in the J column so trend is
equal to intercept plus slope into the
time code so The Intercept is uh out
here as we can see in our slide as well
so if you see here this is our intercept
and the lower value is the slope we have
calculated here and it's shown in the
slides as well so intercept the formula
is shown here so our trend is equal to
intercept plus slope into time code time
code is nothing but this one t column A
1 2 3 4 okay so that's how you calculate
the trend and that's how you use the
data analysis tool from Excel using
these two we calculate the predicted
values and using the formula which is
basically trend is equal to intercept
plus slope into time code and then we
can go and plot it see how it is looking
and therefore so we see here that the
predicted values are pretty close to the
actual values and um therefore we can
safely assume that our uh calculations
which are like our manual model is
working and hence we we go ahead and
predict for the fifth year so till four
years we know that actual value as well
so we can compare our our model is
performing and for the fifth year we
don't have reference values so we can
use our equations to calculate the
values or predict the values for the
fifth year and we can go ahead and
safely calculate those values and when
we plot for the fifth year as well the
predicted values we see that they are
pretty much they captured the pattern
and we can safely assume that the
predictions are fairly accurate as we
can also see from the graph in the Excel
sheet that we have already seen okay so
let's go and plot it so this is how the
plot looks this is the CMA or the
centered moving average the green color
and then the blue color is the actual
data red color is the predicted value
predicted by our handcrafted model okay
so remember we did not use any regular
forecasting model or any tool we have
done this manually and uh the actual
tool will be used in the next video this
is just to give you an idea about about
how behind the scenes or under the hood
how fusting Works a Time series analysis
how it is performed okay so it looks
like it has captured the trend properly
so up to here is the known reference we
have reference and from here onwards
it's purely predicted and uh as I
mentioned earlier we can safely assume
that the values are accurate and
predicted properly for the fifth year so
let's go ahead and Implement a Time
series forecast in r first of all all we
will be using the arima model to do the
forecast of uh this time series data so
let us try to understand what is ARA
model so ARA is actually an acronym it
stands for auto regressive integrated
moving average so that is what is ARA
model and it is specified by three
parameters which is p d and q p stands
for auto regressive so let me just mark
this so there are three components here
Auto regressive integrated moving
average okay so these three parameters
correspond to those three components so
the P stands for auto regressive D for
integrated and Q for moving average so
let us see what exactly this is so these
three factors are p is the number of
autor regressive terms or ar we will see
that in a little bit and D is how many
levels of different that we need to do
or differentiation we need to do and Q
is the number of lagged forecast error
so we'll see what exactly each of these
are so a r is the number of autor
regressive terms and which is basically
denoted by the p and then we have D
which is for the number of times it has
to be
differentiated and then we have q which
is for the moving average so what
exactly AR terms so in terms of the
regression model autor regressive
components refer to the prior values of
the current value what we mean by that
is here when we talk about time series
data focus on the fact that there is
regression so what exactly happens in
regression we try to do something like
if it a simple linear regression we do
some equation like y isal to mx + C
where there are actually there are two
variables one is the dependent variable
and then there is independent variable
let me just complete this equation as
well MX plus C right so this is a normal
regression curve or a simple regression
curve now here we are talking about Auto
regression or Auto regressive so Auto
regressive as the name suggests is
regression of itself so which means that
here you have only one variable which is
your maybe the cost of the flights or
whatever it is right and the other
variable is basically time dependent and
therefore the value at any given time
and that we will denote as YT for
example so there is no X here there is
only one variable and which is y and we
say YT which is basically the predicted
value at a time interval T for example
is dependent on the previous value so
for example there may be A1 and then YT
minus1 and then there will be like plus
A2 and right plus A2 and and YT minus 2
and uh all right and then plus A3 into y
tus 3 all right so basically here what
we are saying is there's only one
variable here but there is a regression
component so we are doing a regression
on itself so that's how the term Auto
regression comes into play so only thing
is that it is dependent on the previous
time values so there is a lag let's say
this is the first lag second lag third
lag and so on so the current value which
is YT is dependent on the previous time
lag values so that is what is auto
regression component so this is what is
shown here for example in this case
instead of Y we are calling it as X so
that's the same and this is represented
by some equation of that sort depending
on how many lags we take so that is the
AR component and the term p is basically
determines how many lags we are
considering so that's the term e for now
what is d d is the degree of
differencing so here differencing is
like to for the nonseasonal differences
right so for example if you take the
values like this which are given for
five 4 6 and so on and so forth if you
take the differencing of one after
another like for example 5 - 4 or 4 - 5
the next value with the previous value
so 4 - 5 so this is known as the first
order differencing so the result is min
-1 similarly 6 - 4 is 2 7 - 6 is 1 so
this is first order differencing and uh
here we call it as D is equal to 1 okay
and same way we can have second order
third order and so on then the last one
is q q is the actually why we call it
moving average but in reality it is
actually the error of the model so we
also sometimes represent as ET all right
so now ARA model works on the assumption
that the data is stationary which means
that the Trend and seasonality of the
data has been removed that is correct
okay so this we have discussed in the
first part how what exactly is
stationary data and how do we remove the
non-stationary part of it now in order
to test whether the data is stationary
or not there are two important
components that are considered one is
the autocorrelation function and other
is the partial autocorrelation function
so this is referred to as ACF and pacf
all right so what is autocorrelation and
what is the definition correlation is
basically the similarity between values
of a same variable across observations
as the name suggests now how do we
actually find the aut corelation
function the value right so this is
basically done by plotting and
autocorrelation function also tells you
how correlated points are with each
other based on how many time steps they
are separated by and so on that is
basically the time lag that we were
talking about and it is also used to
determine how past and future data
points are related and the value of the
autocorrelation function can vary from
minus1 to 1 so if we plot this is how it
would look autocorrelation function
would look somewhat like this and there
is actually a readily available function
in R so we will see that and you can use
that to plot your aut correlation
function okay so that is ACF and we will
see that in our R studio in a little bit
and similarly you have partial
autocorrelation function so partial
autocorrelation function is the degree
of Association between two variables
while adjusting the effect of one or
more additional variables so this again
can be measured and it can also be
plotted and its value once again can go
from minus1 to one and it gives the
partial correlation of Time series with
its own lagged values so lag again we
have discussed in the previous uh couple
of slides this is how a psf plot would
look in R Studio we will see that as
well and once we get into the r studio
and with that let's get into our studio
and take a look at our use case before
we go into the code let's just quickly
understand what exactly is the objective
of this use case so we are going to
predict some values or forecast some
values and we have the data of the
airline ticket sales of the previous
years and now we will try to find the or
predict the or forecast the values for
the future years all right so we will
basically identify the time series
components like Trend seasonality and uh
random Behavior we will actually
visualize this in our studio and then we
will actually forecast the values based
on the past values or history data
historical data so these are the steps
that we follow we will see in our studio
in a little bit just quickly let's go
through what are the steps we load the
data and it is a Time series data if we
try to find out what class it belongs to
the data is actually air passengers data
that is already comes preloaded with the
R studio so we will be using that and we
can take a look at the data and then
what is the starting point what is the
end point so these are all functions
that are really available we'll be using
and then what is the frequency it's
basically frequency is 12 which is like
yearly data right so every month the
data has been collected so for each year
it is 12 and then we can check for many
missing values if there are any and then
we can take a look at the summary of the
data this is what we do in exploratory
data analysis and then we can plot the
data visualize the data how it is
looking and we will see how the data has
some Trend seasonality and so on and so
forth all right then we can take a look
at the cycle of the data using the cycle
function and we can see that it is every
month that's the cycle end of every 12
months the new cycle begins so each
month of the year is uh the data is
available then we can do box plots to
see for each month how the data is
varying over the various 10 or 12 years
that we will be looking at this data
and uh from exploratory data analysis we
can identify that there is a trend there
is a seasonality component and how the
seasonality component varies also we can
see from the box plots and we can
decompose the data we can use the
decomposed function rather to see the
various components like the seasonality
trend and the irregularity part okay so
we will see all of this in our studio
this is how they will look this is is
the Once you decompose and this is how
you will actually you can visualize the
data this is the actual data and this is
the trend as you can see it's going
upwards this is the seasonal component
and this is your random or irregularity
right so we call it irregularity or we
can also call it random as you can see
here yes so the data must have a
constant variance and mean which means
that it is stationary before we start
any analysis time series analysis and
without so basically yeah if it is
stationary only then it is easy to model
the data perform time series analysis so
we can then go ahead and fit the model
as uh we discussed earlier we'll be
using ARA model there are some
techniques to find out what should be
the parameter so we will see that when
we go into our studio so the auto ARA
function basically tells us what should
be the parameters right so these
parameters are the p d and q that we
talked about that's what is being shown
here here so if you use autoa it will
basically take all possible values of
this PDQ these parameters and it will
find out what is the best value and then
it will recommend so that is the
advantage of using Auto ARA all right so
like in uh this case it will tell us
what if we use this parameter Trace we
set the parameter Trace is equal to true
then it will basically tell us what is
the value of this AIC which has to be
minimum so the lower the value the
better so for each of these combinations
of p d and q it will give us the values
here and then it will recommend to us
which is the best model okay because
whichever has the lowest value of this
AIC it will recommend that as your best
uh PDQ values so once we have that we
can see that we will basically we can
potentially get a model or the equation
model is nothing but the equation and
based on the parameters that we get and
we can do some Diagnostics we can do
some plotting to see how whether there
is a plot for the residuals so which
shows the stationarity and then we can
also take a look at the ACF and PF we
can plot the ACF and PF and then we can
do some forecasting for the future year
so in this case we have up to 1960 and
then we can see how we can forecast for
the next 10 years which is 1970 up to
1970 now and once we have done this can
we validate this model yes definitely we
can validate this model and uh to
validate the findings we use uh junkbox
test and this is how you just call box.
test and then you pass these parameters
and you will get the values that will be
returned which will tell us whether this
how accurate this model is how accurate
the predictions are so the values of P
are quite insignificant in this case we
will see that and that also indicates
that our model is free of of
autocorrelation and that will basically
be it so let's go back and into our R
studio and uh go through these steps in
uh real time so we have to import this
Library forecast package is not
installed you have to go here and
install the forecast package okay so
that's the easy way to install rather
than to click on this install I will not
do it now because I've already installed
so the first time that's only one time
then after that you just have to load it
to memory and then keep going so we will
load this data called air passengers so
by calling this data method and if you
see the the data air passengers is
loaded here and if we check for the
class it is a Time series data TS data
so we can check for the dates we can
also view the data in a little bit and
start date is 1949 and
January and our end date is 1960
December and the frequency is 12 which
is
like collected monthly so that is the
frequency which is 12 here and then we
check if there are any um missing values
there are no missing values and then we
take a look at the summary of the data
this is all exploratory data analysis
and then if you just display the data
this is how it
looks and then we need to decompose this
data so we will kind of uh store this in
an object TS data and then use that to
decompose and store the new values let
me just clear this for now and uh if we
decompose basically as we have seen in
the slides decomposing is breaking it
into the trend seasonality and irregular
or random components then you can go
ahead and plot it so when you plot it
you can see here let me Zoom this this
is our original plot or observed value
as it is known as then we have
decomposed the three parts which is
basically the trend as you you can see
there is a upward Trend then the
seasonal component so this is some
regularly occurring pattern and then
there is a random value which is
basically you cannot really give any
equation or function or anything like
that so that's what this plotting has
done and then you can actually plot them
individually as well so these are the
individual plots for the trend for the
seasonal component and the random
component all right so now let's take a
look at the original data and see how
the trend is in a way so if we do this
linear regression line it will show that
there it is going upwards and we can
also take a look at the cycle that are
there which is nothing but we have a
frequency of 12 right so the Cycles will
display that it is January February to
December and then back to January
February and so on and so forth and if
we do box plots for the monthly data you
will see that for each of the months
right and over the 10 years that the
data that we have we will see that there
is a certain pattern right this is also
in a way to find the seasonality
component so while January February
sales are relatively low around July
August the sales pick up so especially
in July I think the sales are the
highest and this seems to be happening
pretty much every year right so this is
every year in July there seems to be a
peak in the sales and then it goes down
and slightly higher in December and so
on so that is again part of our
exploratory data analysis and once again
let's just plot the data now as I said
in order to fit into an ARA model we
need the values of PD and Q now one way
of doing it is there are multiple ways
actually of doing it the earlier method
of doing it was you draw the
autocorrelation function plot and then
partial autocorrelation function plot
and then observe that and where does
this change and then identify what
should be the values of P p and Q and so
on now R really has a very beautiful
method which we can use to avoid all
that manual process that we used to do
earlier so what R will do is there is a
method called Auto ARA and if we just
call this Auto ARA method and it will
basically go and test the ARA model for
all possible values of this parameters
PDQ and then it will suggest to you what
should be the best model and it will
return that best model with the right
values of PD and Q so you we as data
scientists don't have to do any manual
you know trial and error kind of uh
stuff okay so we got the model now and
uh this is the model it it has PDQ
values are 211 PDQ and this is the
seasonal part of it so we can ignore it
for now and so if we want to actually
understand how this has returned these
values 211 as the best one there is
another functionality or feature where
we can use this Trace function or Trace
parameter so if you pass to Auto ARA the
trace parameter what it will do is it
will show you how it is doing this
calculation what is the value of the AIC
basically ASC is what you know defines
the accuracy of the model the lower the
better okay so for each combination of
PDQ it will show us the value of AIC so
let's run it before instead of me
talking so much let let's run this if we
run auto ARA with Trace you see here
there is a red mark here that means it
is performing it's executing this and
here we see the display right so it
starts with certain values of PDQ and
then it finds that value is too high so
it starts with a again with some 0 1 1
0er and so on and so forth and
ultimately it tells us okay this is our
best model you see here it says this is
our best model 211 let's go back and see
did we get the same one yes we got the
same one when we ran without Trace as
well right now why is 211 let us see
where is 211 here is our 211 and if you
compare the values you see that 10 17 is
pretty much the lowest value and uh
therefore it is saying this is our best
model all other values are higher so
that's how you kind of U get your model
and now that you have your model what
you have to do you need to predict the
Val values right so before that let us
just do some test of these values so for
that you install T Series again if you
are doing it for the first time you
would rather use this package and
install and say T Series and install it
and then you just use this Library
function to load it into your memory all
right so now that we got our model using
Auto ARA let us go ahead and forecast
and also test the model and also plot
the ACF and and psf remember we talked
about this but we did not really use it
we don't have to use that but at least
we will visualize it and uh for some of
the stuff we may need this T Series
Library so if you are doing this for the
first time you may have to install it
and my recommendation is don't use it in
the code you go here and install tseries
and I will not do it now because I
already install it but this is a
preferred method and once you install it
you just load it using this liaries
function and then you can plot your
residuals and this is how the residuals
look and you can plot your ACF and PF
okay so this is how your PF looks and
this is how your ACF looks for now there
is really nothing else we need to do
with ACF and pacf this just to visualize
how that how it looks but as I mentioned
earlier we were actually using the these
visualizations or these graphs to
identify the values of p d and q and how
that was done it's uh out of scope of
this video so we will leave it at that
and uh then we will forecast for the
next 10 years how do we forecast that so
we call forecast and we pass the model
and we pass what is the level of
accuracy that you need which is 95% and
for how many periods right so basically
we want for 10 years which is like 10
into 12 time periods so that's what we
are doing here and now we can plot the
forecast value so you see this is the
original value up to I think 62 or
whatever and then it goes up to 72 this
blue color is the predicted value let's
go and zoom it up so that we can see it
better so from here onwards we focusing
and you can see that it looks like our
model has kind of learned the pattern
and this pattern looks very similar to
what we see in the actual data now how
do we test our model so we can do what
is known as a box test and we pass our
model here residuals basically with
different lags and from those values
here the P values here we find that they
are reasonably low the P values which
means our model is fairly accurate we'll
be creating two dashboards using a
sample sales data set so if you want to
get the data and the dashboard file that
we'll be creating in this demo then
please put your email IDs in the comment
section of the video our team will share
the files via
email now let's begin by understanding
what is a dashboard in
Excel a dashboard is a visual interface
that provides an overview of key
measures relevant to a particular
objective with the help of charts and
graphs dashboard reports allow managers
to get a high level overview of the
business and help them make quick
decisions there are different types of
dashboards such as strategic dashboards
analytical dashboards and operational
dashboards an advantage of dashboards is
the quick detection of outliers and
correlations with Comprehensive data
visualization it is time-saving as
compared to running multiple
reports with this understanding let's
jump into our demo for creating our
dashboards we'll be using a sample sales
data set let me show you the data set
first so here is the sales data set that
that we'll be using for our demo so this
data set was actually generated using a
simulator and is completely random it
was not validated though we have applied
certain transformations to the data
using power query features so this data
as you can see has thousand rows so
using the simulator we had generated
thousand rows of
data similarly if I go on top you can
see this data set has 17 columns now let
me give you a brief about each of the
columns so first we have the region
column so we have Middle East and North
Africa this North America Asia
subsaharan Africa and others similarly
we have the country names from which the
item was ordered the third column is the
item type so we have different items
Cosmetics vegetables there's baby food
cereal fruits Etc then we have the
representatives name or you can see this
as the customer name who ordered the
product then we have a sales Channel
column so there are basically two
channels whether the item was sold
offline or online next we have the order
priority column now here C stands for
critical then we have H which is for
high priority orders then we have M for
medium priority orders and finally we
have L which is for low priority orders
you can see the order date column then
we have the order ID the ship date next
we have unit sold which is basically the
total number of units sold for each item
then we have the unit price column this
is the price at which each product was
sold then we have the unit cost column
which is basically the production cost
for each of the items next we have the
total revenue the total revenue is
actually the product of unit sold and
unit price
then we have the total cost column now
the total cost column is actually the
product of unit sold and the unit cost
similarly we have the total profit
column so total profit is the difference
between total revenue and the total cost
and finally we have created two more
columns that is order year and then we
have order month now these two columns
were actually generated using the power
query features so we use the order date
column which is this column and
extracted order year and Order
month so first we are going to create a
revenue dashboard where we'll focus on
generating reports for Revenue by order
year Revenue by year and region Revenue
by order priority and much more we'll
create separate P tables and po charts
and format them to make them look more
interesting and presentable We'll add
slices and timeline to our dashboards in
order to filter it based on specific
Fields now let's create our first report
to see the total revenue generated each
year so we need to create a peot table
for this I'll click on a sell in my data
set and then I'll go to the insert tab
here we have the option to select the
pivote table I click on this you can
see my table range is
selected next I want to place my pivote
table in a new worksheet and let's just
click on okay there you go so we have a
new sheet where I can place my PO
table so first I need to find the total
revenue generated by each year so what
I'll do is I'll drag my order ear column
under rows and then I'll select the
total revenue column under
values you can see I have my P chart
ready now if you want you can sort this
so from the data you can see we have
order Year from 2010 to
2017 now based on this data let's create
our pivote chart so I'll click on any
cell go to insert and here you have the
option to select recommended charts I
click on this now actually I want a line
chart so I'll click on line here and
select
okay there you go so we have
successfully created our first pivot
chart
now let me show you how you can format
this chart to make it more readable so
first let me delete these so I'll right
click and select hide all field buttons
on the chart so this will delete the
buttons present on the chart now let me
go ahead and edit the chart title so the
title I want is total revenue I'll type
it
down by
Year all right next let's do a few more
Transformations so if I click on this
plus sign which is actually for chart
elements we have some options like to
add access access titles chart title
data labels this grid lines Legend and
others okay so let's remove the legend
now you can see the total Legend is is
gone now let me add access titles so
we'll label our xaxis and y axis so here
under
x-axis I can write it
as ear similarly on the y axis I'll put
Revenue okay now you can move a bit all
right
now let me select this charts style
option and go to Colors
first here I'll select yellow color okay
and then let me go back to style let's
select a new style from this
list I
want this style okay now you can also
add data labels so I'll just click on
data labels you can see we have
the revenue for each of the years now
this is not readable at all so we'll
format this a
bit if I click on this Arrow here I have
more
options if I scroll down you can see we
have something called as number here
I'll expand this and under category I'll
select
custom now here we'll give a format code
which is a bit
different so this is actually a kind of
a formula so I'll write if my Revenue
value is greater than let's say 9 lakh
99,000 let me make sure there are six
9es here so 1 2 3 4 5 and six okay we
are good to go I'll close the bracket
I'll give a
hash give two
commas so if the revenue is greater than
9 lakh
99,000 I'll put it in the format of
millions So within double codes I'll
write
M I'll give a
semicolon followed by another
hash and if the value is less than the
desired
number
it should be 0 million let me click on
add all right you can see how nicely we
have formatted our data and you see here
we
have added the new format which is in
millions all right now if you want you
can go ahead and adjust
the boxes let me move this a bit up I'll
delete this now if you notice this line
chart you can make a few conclusions for
example if you see here in
2010 the total revenue generated was
nearly 175 million now this came down to
150 million in
2011 then the revenue constantly grew
from 2011 till
2014 it reached 195 million and after
2014 it again came down to 180 million
and the revenue dropped significantly ly
between 2016 and
2017 in 2017 the revenue was just 96
million now before moving ahead to my
next chart let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write it as
Revenue by Year all
right
now let's analyze the revenue generated
each year in different regions so for
this we'll create another peot table let
me close this I'll click on any cell go
to insert and select pivote table I'll
just click okay so that my pivote table
is placed on a new sheet all right now
this time we want the revenue by each
year and region so first of all let's
drag region to
columns
then let's drag the order ear column
under rul and then I'll select total
revenue onto values so here you can see
we have the poot table ready so for 2010
you can see in Asia this was the revenue
generated similarly if you see for
2013 this was the total revenue
generated in Europe and we have for
other years as well now let's create a
line chart based on this pivote table so
I'll select any cell in the pivote table
I'll go to insert and I'll click on
recommended charts from this list I'll
select my line chart and click on okay
there you go so we have our next pivote
chart
ready so on the right you see the
different regions that are present in
different colors let me just expand it
so that you can see all the regions we
have so in total we have
seven
regions and each of the regions have
been represented in different
colors so if you notice this
graph for the subsaharan African region
in
2012 subsaharan Africa met the highest
amount of
sales now from the sample data you can
also tell that the revenue for North
America has been significantly low
compared to other regions similarly if
you
see for
Europe This was the revenue Trend
between 2010 and
2017 so if you see here in 2011 the
sales were at this level then it
significantly dropped in
2012 then in
2013 there was a huge Spike and then in
again came down in 20 15 and so on so
you can make your own conclusions by
looking at these line charts now let's
format this chart so first of all let's
delete the field buttons present on the
chart and we'll
also delete the Legend all right now let
me just reduce the size of the
chart next we'll add a chart title
so we'll will give the title as
Revenue by year and
region
okay you can also format the Y AIS in
terms of
millions so I'll right click on this
axis and I'll select format
axis I'll scroll down and here we have
the number drop down down let me scroll
again under category I'll select custom
and will use this format that we created
for our previous chart there you go you
can see our access labels have been
changed in terms of millions now so
let's close this and let me save it now
you can reduce the font size or increase
the font size let me just show you
suppose you want to increase the font
size of the chart title so you just
select it and from here you can either
reduce or you can increase you can see
now it's 12 if you want you can make it
16 similarly you can also edit the
access labels also by selecting the
chart title you can also move it to left
or right or you can place it in the
center as well for the time being let me
just keep it to the left all right now
we'll see the revenue and total cost by
each region and create a combo chart for
this so let me show you how to do it
I'll go to my data sheet I have my cell
selected go to insert and click on
pivote table let me just click on okay
all right so for this I'll select my
region onto
rows and
then I'll
have two columns under values the first
one is going to be total revenue and the
next column will be the total cost
column all right so here we have the
pivote table ready now based on this
pivote table let's create our pivote
chart so I'll go to recommended charts
and if you see below at the bottom we
have combo chart so this is the preview
of the combo
chart all right now let me just click on
okay there you go so we have a nice
combo chart ready here now the way to
look at it is the bars represent the
total revenue which is this
column now the line
represents the total cost so let me go
ahead and edit this chart a bit so first
of all let's delete the field buttons
all right and let's also remove the
legend from
here next we'll add add data labels so
I'll click on data labels here okay so
these are the data labels
for the bars or the revenue column now
let's format the data labels in terms of
millions so I'll click on this Arrow go
to more options if I scroll down I have
number from here I'll select custom
and I'll choose
my type that is in millions all right so
you can see we have formatted our data
next thing we'll add a chart title so
here I'll write as
Revenue
by
region it's actually revenue and total
cost by
region
before moving ahead let me rename the
sheets as well I'll write revenue
and total
cost
similarly sheet three also I'm going to
rename it as
Revenue
by year and
region so this makes your street
readable all right now moving
ahead next we are interested to get the
revenue generated by order priority and
for this we are going to create a pie
chart so let's go to the data sheet and
create our P table first I click on okay
now I'll select order priority under
rows and under values I'll select total
revenue
so this is a very simple pivote table so
you have your order priority so C is for
critical H is for high L is for low and
M is for medium now based on this let's
create a p chart so I'll go to
recommended charts and here you have pie
chart I want to select this 3D type of
pie chart and I'll click on okay all
right so we have our pie chart ready let
me just resize it
and from here I'll remove the field
buttons and I also don't need the legend
so I'll delete this as well all right
now let's give a chart title so this is
going to be Revenue
by order
priority now let's add our data labels
I'll check this
option okay now let's again format this
in terms of
Millions so
here I'll click on the last option I'll
go to numbers under category I'll select
custom and my type is going to be in
terms of millions there you go let me
close
this I will just move this to the
center all
right now if you want you can change the
color of the text as well so let's have
it in white color and see how it looks
okay so this looks pretty deed
cool
now moving to our next report so this
time we are going to find the total
revenue by countries so we have multiple
countries present in our data set we
want to visualize the revenue generated
in each country so for this we we are
going to create a horizontal bar chart
so let me show you how to do it but
before moving ahead let me just rename
this sheet so I'll write
Revenue
by I'll just put op which stands for
order priority all right now let's
create our horizontal bar chart I'll go
to insert click on pivote table and
select
okay so I want my Revenue based on
different countries so I'll select
country and put it under Rose and then
I'll choose total revenue and place it
under values so here you have the
different country names we have
Afghanistan this Albania let me scroll
down you have
Bangladesh there
are a number of countries you have Czech
Republic there's Estonia France Gabon
similarly if you scroll down we have
India there Jamaica Italy and all the
way to the bottom if you go we have New
Zealand the Netherlands Philippines
Portugal we also
have
Singapore lots and lots of
countries we have the UAE United States
of America Zimbabwe and
others all right let me go up so based
on this pivote table let's create our
pivote chart so I'll go to insert and
select recommended charts from here I'm
going to select the column chart you can
see the preview here and let me click on
okay all right so here you can
see the different country names at the
bottom and the revenue for each of the
countries let's go ahead and edit this
chart so first of all I'll
delete the field buttons okay and let me
also remove the
legend here I'll write Revenue
by
countries this going to be my chart
title
okay let's format this chart a little
more so I'll click on this option and
we'll select a new style let's
say I'll
select style six
okay and let me now go under colors and
we'll select the color of the bars so
let's choose this color okay so you have
a horizontal column chart
ready and at the bottom you can see the
different country names and we have
the
revenue
cool now let me go ahead and and rename
this sheet so I'll write Revenue
by
countries and hit enter
okay and finally we'll create another
report which is going to be part of our
Revenue dashboard and this is revenue by
items so we'll visualize our revenue for
different items present in the table so
if you see this we have Cosmetics
vegetables cereal fruits the cloths
snacks households and other products as
well so let's check the revenue for each
of these
items so we'll continue the same drill
I'll create my poot table on a new
worksheet and this time I'm going to
drag item type under row and we'll have
the total revenue under values so here
on the left left of the table you can
see we have the different item names and
then we have the total revenue so let me
just short this total
revenue from largest to smallest so you
can see here office supplies meet the
highest amount of Revenue followed by
household then cosmetics and fruits meet
the lowest amount of
Revenue I'll click on this go to ins ERT
and select recommended charts this time
I'm going to create a bar chart so this
is how my bar chart is going to look
like I'll select okay all right now
let's format this chart a
bit I'll delete the field buttons and
I'll delete the legend as
well
and let's edit the chart title so this
is going to
be red Revenue by items
cool we also want to change
the color of the bars so I've have
selected all the bars I'll go to my home
Tab and here let's say I want to select
green color all
right I've edited my chart a bit
now
let's
make
it
14 and I'll remove the
Bold okay here if you want you can
change the font Also let's keep it in
blue color all
right finally let's rename this sheet so
I'll write Revenue by
items
cool finally now it's time for us to
merge all the charts that we have
created to our dashboard so let me show
you how you can create the dashboard
I'll create a new sheet and first thing
I'm going to do is I'll click on The
View Tab and uncheck grid lines so this
will remove the grid lines present in
the worksheet
next I'm going to insert an image so
we'll have a background image on our
dashboard
so the way to do is I'll go to the
insert Tab and under illustrations I
have the option to select pictures or
insert pictures so I'm going to insert
picture present on the device that is my
computer I'll go to desktop and here I
have a folder called Excel dashboard
files and I'll select this dashboard
background and hit insert
so this is going to insert an image now
let me just drag this image so it covers
a feren of
portion so I'll hit shift and I'll drag
it all
right so you can see I have successfully
added a background image if you want you
can
still expand this background image a bit
to the right
cool now the next
thing is going to be the title of the
dashboard so I'll click on insert and
here I have the option to select a text
box so I'll click on a text box
and I'm going to place a text box in the
middle and I'm going to name this text
box as
Excel Revenue
dashboard on
sales
I'll centrer line
it let's do some more formatting so I'll
select this text box on the top you can
see shape
format here here I'm going to expand
this shape fill and I'll select no fill
so my text box is transparent now and
I'll also remove the outline all right
now let me just double click on the
title of my dashboard and I'm going to
select a font you can select whichever
font you
want let me stick to britanica board old
and I'll increase the size to let's say
30 all right I'll just drag the text
box I'll make the text as white instead
of black all right so we have
our title of the dashboard ready now if
you want you can also insert some icons
to this dashboard so I'll go to insert
and I'll click on illustrations again
and select
pictures I'm going to
add this two pictures which is of a
store and a
cart to make it
look visually appealing so I'll place
the
icons here and similarly let me just
copy
it and I'll place
the cart and the store
to the right as
well all
right
next the idea is
to bring in all the charts that we have
created and place it on the
dashboard so let me
copy each of the charts and place it on
the dashboard so I'll hit
control V to paste
it and we'll resize this as
well all
right similarly let me bring in all the
other charts as
well all right so now you can see I have
added all my charts and graphs to this
dashboard so you can see here we have
our line charts our column charts the
combo chart charts the Spy chart and
others now let me go ahead and format
these charts a little more so you can
see this looks a bit cluttered so let's
adjust the labels let me bring this
down similarly I'll bring 190 million a
little
below all right this looks fine
now one more thing we are going to do is
we'll remove the white background from
each of the charts and make it
transparent so let me show you how to do
it so I'll select this chart then I'll
right click and go to format chart
area here on the right you see we have
an option called No fill so if I select
no fill you can see the white background
is gone now similarly let me also remove
the grid lines so I'll select the grid
lines and hit delete so you have also
removed the grid lines from here now
let's also remove the white outline that
we have so I'll select this chart go to
format and here I'll go to shape outline
and I'll select no outline you see this
so we have our total revenue by year
which is a line chart and this is
completely transparent now now what I'm
going to do is I'll place this chart
over a box so I'll go to insert and in
insert we have the option to create a
shape so I'll click on illustrations and
here I'll choose a shape and let me
select a rectangle so I'll just create a
rectangle
here all right and now what I'll do is
I'll select this and bring this to front
I'll right click and choose bring to
front and I I place this
shape below it all right now the next
thing is to edit the shape so first I'll
change the color of this box so let me
select this blue color and and let me
increase the transparency so I'll right
click and go to format shape here I'll
increase the transparency let's keep it
to
25% or let's say 20% all right next
thing we'll just convert all the font to
white
color including the access labels the
chart
title we'll
also convert all
the access labels to white color so it
looks better now we'll just adjust our
chart over here next thing let's just
remove the outline so I'll go to save
outline and I'll select no outline you
see we have now formatted our chart
let's just pull this a little
up all right now we'll add this blue
background to all the other charts so
we'll first add the background make it
transparent and then we'll convert the
font text to White color to make it more
readable and visible so for the time
being I'll just pause the video and come
back
again all right so now you can see on
your screens we have nicely formatted
our dashboard so I have added a few
logos for each of the charts you can see
the logos here so for Revenue by
countries we have a globe then if you
see here this is kind of a map or a
location
similarly we have all formatted
the color of the bars then we have also
formatted the labels in terms of
millions if you look on the Y AIS even
the revenue for year and region are all
formatted in terms of
millions if you want this you can also
format the total year by Revenue in
terms of millions so the way to do is
you can select this graft
right click and go to format
access here if I scroll down you have
numbers and under category I'll select
custom then I'll select my type as this
format which is in
millions and you see here we have
successfully formatted our y AIS
labels all right so the next thing is to
add add slicers and timelines to a
dashboard now slicers are used to format
your data based on a particular column
suppose if you want to see Revenue by
certain items you can add item as a
slicer and you can view the
entire dashboard similarly for timelines
you can add date columns so if you want
to see what was the amount of sales or
revenue generated on a particular year
or a particular month you can do that
using a timeline so I'll select one of
the charts and then either you can go to
the insert Tab and here you can see
under filters we have slices and
timeline or if you go to the pivote
Chart analyze tab here also you have
insert slicer and timeline option so I
select insert slicer here first now it's
giving me the list of fields present in
the data set so I'll select country
region and let's say we want to know by
item type and sales channel so these are
going to be my four slicers I'll click
on
okay you can see it here we have our
four slicers here and these are the list
of values under region we have Asia this
Europe North America and others
similarly we have the different country
names for for Country slices and then
for item type also we have all the items
that were present in our data set
now moving ahead we need to connect all
the slicers to a dashboard so what I'll
do is I'll right
click on this option and I'll go to
report
connections okay so under report
connections you have all the pivote
tables that we created
you currently see only one of the P
table is selected so we need to select
all the P tables so let me check all the
P tables present in this workbook and
click on okay all right now that we have
connected one of our slicers we'll now
connect the other remaining slicers so
I'll right click on this go to report
connections and I'll check all the
pivote tables present in this worksheet
click on okay okay similarly let's do it
for the country slicer I'll go to report
connections and let me
select all the pivote
tables and finally we have the item type
so I'll right click go to report
connections and then I'll select all my
P
tables and let's hit okay all right now
let me just organize this a bit so I'll
place my pivot
tables to the
right I'll just reduce the
size let me scroll
down I'll
add my region slicer
here
similarly I'll add my final slicer that
is sales Channel now in our next
dashboard which is going to be the
profit dashboard I'll show you how to
add a
timeline all right now I have arranged
all my
slicers so let's see you want to find
the revenue that was generated for an
item type let's say beverages so you can
just select beverages here and all your
charts so the respective revenues so you
have the total revenue by year for
beverages
only similarly here you can see the
revenue by year and region only for
beverages item type if I scroll
down now this chart represents the
revenue that was generated in each of
the countries only for item type
beverages let me just uncheck
it all
right let's say you want to
see the revenue generated for a country
like India so I have selected India here
and now you can
see my graph has changed only for
country
India you can see here it is showing
only for India
now now similarly you can also filter
your revenues based on the different
regions let's say you want to know the
revenue generated based on sales channel
so we have two sales channel that is
offline and online suppose you want to
know the revenue generated offline so
I'll just select offline you can see the
values have changed so these were the
revenues generated for each of the items
only for
offline if you see here now these were
all the offline sales for the different
regions
so this is our entire Excel Revenue
dashboard on sales we created multiple
charts and graphs then we applied
different formatting we added different
icons then we formatted the labels also
next we added slicers and finally we saw
how we could filter our data based on
these slicers
likewise now we are going to create a
profit dashboard based on the same data
so before moving ahead let me rename
this sheet as Revenue dashboard I'll
write
R dashboard
okay now we'll move to our data sheet
and start creating our P tables and po
charts for the profit
dashboard all right so let me go ahead
and create my first pivot table
so I'll create a new
worksheet this time I'm going to create
a line chart to visualize the profit for
each year so I'll drag my total profit
column to values and my order year to
rows so here you can see we have
our privot table ready now you can sort
this data to get a an idea as to
which year had the highest profit and
which year had the lowest profit so from
this P table you can see since I've
sorted this data in descending order so
2014 had the maximum amount of profit
and 2017 had the least amount of profit
I'll just do controll Z to undo it all
right now based on this P table let me
go ahead and create my P chart so I'll
go to recommended charts and click on a
line chart so this is the preview of the
chart I'll click on okay let me close
this
similarly we are going
to edit this chart now so first I'll
hide all the field buttons present on
the chart and I'll rename the chart
title as
total
profit by
year next I'm going to remove the legend
so I'll delete this
let's do some more
formatting so I'll go to
style
and this
time I'm going to
select my style type okay and if you
want you can choose the colors as well
for the time being let's have this
yellow color next let me add the data
labels so again if you see here this is
not formatted properly so let's go ahead
and format
the data labels so I'll click on
number and I'll select custom
here and the type I'm going to select is
in millions and I'll click on close so
here you can see we have
our line chart ready which SS total
profit by year let's rename this sheet
as
profit
by Year all right now let's move back to
our data sheet
again next we are going to show the
total profit by countries for this I'm
going to create a map so let me first
create my pivote table so I'll go to
insert and I'll click on pivote
table let me click on
okay since I want the country names so
I'll select country under rowes and then
I
have my total profit under
values the next thing I'm going to do is
I'll just rename the row labels as
countries and
then I'm going to delete the grand total
which you can see at the bottom so here
we have the grand total let me just
delete the grand total so I'm going to
select this P table go to the design tab
here we have sub totals and Grand totals
I'll switch off the grand total let me
just verify it again I'll scroll down
you see the grand totle has gone now all
right now we want to create a map out of
this the way to do is I'm going to
select my
data copy it I'll go on top and I'll
paste it here using this data I can
create my field map now so I'll go to
insert here we have the option to create
a field map there you go you can see we
have our map ready I can expand this now
as you can see our map has a color scale
which comes from light gray color to
dark blue color so the countries that
are in Gray or you can say light blue
have the lowest amount of profit while
the regions or the countries that have
been shaded in
dark color a dark blue color have
highest amount of
profit I will go ahead and delete this
scale okay next we need to connect this
map to the original data source so what
I'll do is I'll right click on this map
and I'll go to select data here instead
of the previous range I'll give my new
Range now so my new Range will be my or
additional P table that I had created
I'll go on top and click on okay so we
have our map ready now now if you want
you can change the color of the shade so
I'll just go to colors and let's say
will keep green
color so the countries that are shaded
in dark green have the highest amount of
profit while those which are highlighted
in light green color are are the
countries that made least amount of
profit okay now moving
on next we want to create a pivote table
that will show us the profit by year and
sales channel so for this we are going
to create another line chart so I'll go
to insert and click on pivote table so
I'll select new worksheet here since I
want to know the profit by year first of
all I'll drag my order year column to
rows and then I'll choose my total
profit column under values next I'm
going to select my sales Channel under
columns there you go so we have our
pivote table here based on this P table
let me create my P chart so I'll go to
recommended charts and I'm going to
create a line
chart I close
this you see here based on this chart
you you can tell the profit generated
with online sales were actually lower
than that of offline so here the Blue
Line represents offline profit and the
Orange Line represents Online Profit if
you Mark Clearly in year 2012 the Online
Profit was actually higher than the
offline profit so let me go ahead and
edit this chart a bit so we'll delete
the field buttons I'll also delete
delete the legend for now let me go
ahead and add a chart title so I'll
write
profit
by year
and sales
Channel
okay so this is my second report before
moving ahead let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write
profit
by
countries
similarly let me rename this sheet as
profit by year and let's say SC for
sales
Channel
okay moving
ahead now I want to create a pie chart
based on a pivot table that will show
The Profit by sales Channel only only so
this is going to be a simple pie chart
so I'll first go to insert click on
pivote table and click on okay so I'll
drag my sales Channel under rows and
then we'll have the total profit column
under
values so this is my simple pivote table
now let's create our pivote chart which
is going to be a pie chart let me
explore the other types of pie charts we
have Okay so so I'm going to select a
donut chart here I'll click on okay
let's edit this chart I'll remove the
field buttons let me now remove the
legend as well I'll just resize it and
this is going to
be
profit
by sales
Channel
okay let's also add
data
labels and here again I'm going
to format this
label I'll select the category as custom
and my type will be in millions okay let
me just move
this to the
left and this to the right
okay let's also delete the lines
cool now let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write profit
by let's say SC see which stands for
sales
Channel cool finally I'm going to create
a report that will show the revenue and
profit by items so I'll go ahead and
create my pivote table first this time
I'll choose my total profit under values
and we'll also have the revenue
column so I'll put my Revenue at the top
then I'm going to
select item type under row so here is my
pivote table based on this pivote table
let me now create a combo chart so you
can see the preview of the chart the
blue bars represent the total revenue
and the Orange Line represents the total
profit I'll click on okay let me close
this first let's remove the field
buttons let's also
remove the legend
here then we'll add a chart title I'll
name it
as
revenue
and
profit by items
okay if you want you can also go ahead
and change the color of the
bars so let me just
select one of these colors
okay all right so we have our five
reports ready that we are going to use
for our profit
dashboard next let's create a new sheet
and we'll get started with building our
dashboard so I'll click on a new sheet
let me just just rename this as profit
dashboard all right we'll continue with
the previous drill so first of all let's
go to the view Tab and remove the grid
lines now we'll insert a background
image like we did for our Revenue
dashboard so I'll go to insert under
illustrations I'll click on pictures and
select this device
I'm going to have the same background
I'll click on
insert all right so you can see we have
a picture of a company or you can say an
organization let's just drag
this a bit to the
right we'll adjust the size
also all
right now let's copy the title of my
profit dashboard so here you can see I
have brought my Revenue
dashboard and I'll copy the title and
the logos that we used for the revenue
dashboard I'll paste it on my new
dashboard let's just align
it in the
center all right the next step let me
now go ahead and edit the title so this
is actually going to
be Excel
profit dashboard instead of Revenue now
we'll copy each of the charts that we
just created for example the revenue and
profit by items then we had profit by
sales
Channel all this we are going to copy
one by one and put it on the profit
dashboard so let me just copy a few
now I'll paste it
here and later on we can make the
adjustment
copy this as
well similarly I'll bring the other
three charts onto my sales
dashboard okay so here on my profit
dashboard I have added all the
charts and I have aligned and reshaped
it so that it looks good I've also made
some formatting for example I've have
reduced the size size of the chart
title now let me go ahead and show you a
few more formatting that we also did for
the revenue dashboard first let's remove
the white background from all the charts
so I'll select the first chart I'll
right click and I'll click on format
chart area here under fill I'll select
no fill next I'm going to remove the
grid lines so I'll just just delete it
let me close this now we also have a
outline so I'll go to
design actually format and I'll remove
the
outline next I'm going to
add a blue box at the back like how we
did for the revenue dashboard so let me
select a blue box from here and I'm
going to paste it here okay let me just
select the chart and I'll bring this to
front and I'll move
this to the
back next I'm going to change the font
color all to White so that it's clearly
visible and it's more
readable I'll do it for the x-axis as
well okay so here I have my first chart
ready the same I'm going to do for the
rest of the charts
okay so now you can see here I have
formatted all my charts I've also added
a blue
background you see here I have also
formatted the Y labels in terms of
millions which is actually the profit
similarly here I have added the data
labels this is for
Revenue some of the charts also have the
data Legends so here you can see the
blue color represents
offline and the red present online
similarly here you have the Legends I've
also formatted the map as well okay now
the next thing is to make this dashboard
more interactive so we'll add our
slicers as well as timeline first let me
show you how to add a timeline so I'll
select one of the charts and I'll go to
insert under insert I have the option to
create a timeline so I I'll
just click on
timelines so timeline is actually based
on date columns so since in our data set
we only have two date columns one is
order date and one is ship date so Excel
has only shown us two columns so I'm
going to create my timeline based on
order date so I'll select my order date
column and I'll click on okay you can
see here this is called a timeline I can
expand this now this timeline is based
on months now now if I scroll this
timeline you can see here I have my
order year 2010 and I have all the 12
months similarly we have for 2011 then
we have for
2012 all the way till
2017 now you can filter this in terms of
years quarters months or days let me
just select year now so I have years
from 2010 till
2017 let me just squiz this and I'll
play place it somewhere here on the
right now let me go ahead and create a
few slicers for my profit dashboard so I
have selected one of the charts under
insert I'll click on
slicer you can see it gives me the list
of columns from which I want to create
slicers so I'll create region let me
also select
country let's say I want the
representatives name or the customer's
name and I'll click on okay so here I
have created three
slicers let
me first resize it and I'll place
it on the
right similarly I'll place the country
column
also then we have the region
slicer I'll resize this and I'll bring
it here okay the next thing we need to
do is I have to connect all the slicers
and the timeline to the P tables for the
profit dashboard so I'm going to click
on the multiple select option and go to
report connections here I'm going to
select all the pivote tables that are
related to
profit so here I have selected four and
I need one more which is po table number
10 I click on okay similarly let's
create or connect my region filter to
all the pivote tables so I right click
go to report connections here I'll
choose all my pivote tables which are
based on
profit I'll click on okay let's do it
for the country slicer as
well
click on okay and similarly I'll connect
my timeline as well I'll go to report
connections and I'll
select all the pivot tables related to
profit then I'll click on okay let me
now go ahead and create another slicer
based on sales channel so I'm selecting
one of the Poo charts I'll go to insert
click on slicer and I'll select sales
Channel and hit
okay so I have my sales Channel slicer
now let me connect it to all the
respective pivot
tables that are based on
profit click on
okay now let me just bring it here all
right the next thing I want to show is
how are we going to use the timeline
first so you see we have all the
years here from 2010 till
2017 now suppose you want to know the
profit that was generated in the year
2012 so I'll just click on this range
and now you can see our charts only so
information for 2012 so this dot
represents that was 51 million profit in
the year 2012 similarly you can see
here the profit
sales channel for
2012 from the map you can see the
different countries and the profit each
of these countries made in
2012 if I scroll down you can see the
revenue and profit by items now if I
select another year let's say
2013 I can just drag this to the right
and now you can
see our profit by year and sales channel
for offline and online you can see the
map or the line chart for total profit
by year so in 2012 it was 51 million and
then it went up to 54 million in
2013
similarly our map has also changed now
this is a sort of an information that we
have you can click on this
and check the information that Excel has
prompted all right so this is how you
can use a Time line now as I said we
checked by years you can also see it for
months and quarters as
well let me just uncheck
it I'll send it back to the place where
it was and I'll reduce the
size okay now suppose you want to check
the profit made by different
Representatives you can select them one
by one let's say Adam churches
this is
the profit generated by Adam
Churchill similarly you can select
multiple persons as well now suppose you
want to see the profit by different
countries so you can use the country
slicer let me just bring this to the
middle and let's expand our chart a
bit okay so here you have
the profit by different countries chart
I'll just bring this to the front so
that you can see it clearly okay now
here suppose you want to see the profit
generated in let's say United Kingdom
you can select United Kingdom so this is
the map of United Kingdom and it tells
you the total profit that was generated
in United Kingdom and Below you can see
the revenue and profit for for all the
items that was sold in United Kingdom so
you had beverages clothes household
office supplies you can see clearly
office supplies item meet the highest
amount of profit in United Kingdom now
you can also select multiple countries
let's say I want to know for France as
well so
my map will change accordingly so now I
have United k Kingdom and France
selected and the other charts present in
my dashboard change accordingly now I
have
my country selected as India you can see
the map of India
here and these were the respective
profit values now one thing to note here
is this is actually not Millions this
should be in K that is Thousands so
please mark this as thousand and not in
millions
even for this this is actually K and not
million all right so we have
successfully created our second
dashboard that is on profit let me just
resize this a bit and we'll place it
where it was
earlier
cool so we saw how to create different
peot tables and poot charts and then we
format our poo charts based on our
requirement we saw how to edit the
colors now let me show you one more
thing you can also change the look and
feel of the dashboard by going to the
page layout tab under page layout you
have themes so here you can select
different themes currently we are with
the office theme now let me just select
another theme let's say faet you see the
colors have changed and it looks really
really
beautiful similarly let me try out
another theme let's say organic you see
our chart has changed let me just delete
this okay so now once you change the
theme the text also change a bit you can
see the slicers are in a different
font let me explore One More theme let's
say this time I'm going to choose
depth and this is more of a green type
of
color you can play around and select
whatever theme suits the best all
right now let me just move back to my
Revenue dashboard and see how it looks
there you go so since we changed our
theme even our Revenue dashboard is also
impacted
so
this is how it looks
now you can always go ahead and play
with different themes colors fonts and
effects all right so in this demo we saw
how to create a revenue dashboard so we
created line charts this combo chart pie
chart horizontal and vertical bar charts
and then we learned how to add slicers
and connect it to different pivot tables
and we filtered our data to see Revenue
as well as profit by items by countries
by different regions sales Channel we
learned how to create a map however if
you are looking to get certified then
here there we are here with an amazing
course through which you can catch the
eyes of top Recruiters in the industry
allow me to introduce postgraduate
program in data analytics by simply
learn so what are you waiting for for
hurry up and enroll Now find the cost
Link in the description box Excel what
is Excel V
lookup vlookup stands for vertical
lookup vlookup lets you search for
specific information in your spreadsheet
it allows you to search for a particular
value in a column and returns another
value from a different column but of the
same Row V lookup takes advantage of
vertically aligned tables to quickly
find data associated with the value the
user enters now
let's look at the syntax to write a v
lookup function so vlookup takes four
parameters or arguments you can see it
here there are four arguments in the vup
function so the first argument is called
the lookup value the look of value
represents the value that you're
searching for next is the table array
the table array represents two or more
Columns of information the third
argument is called the column index
number now this represents the column
number in the table from which the value
must be returned the First Column is 1
the second column is two and so on and
then we have the fourth parameter which
is called the range lookup now this
parameter is optional now range lookup
is used to find an exact match so if you
want to find an exact match you need to
enter false or zero meanwhile if you
want an approximate match you need to
enter true or one if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know
more now let me give you a brief
overview on what's going to be in our
demo so for our demonstration we'll use
a sales data set you can see the data
set on the left using this data set
we'll understand how we lookup performs
an exact and approximate match we'll see
how we look up is case insensitive then
we'll perform a wild card character
search
we'll understand how to handle errors
when a match is not found and finally
you will look at two-way
lookups now here is a small example of
how V lookup works so we want to find
the unit sold by Morgan using the data
set on the left so here you can see I
have the data set it has some rows and
columns so these are the columns which
are order date region there's a
representative column
item units this unit cost and total and
from this table I want to find the units
that were sold by Morgan if you look at
the table at the bottom you can see the
representative name Morgan and Morgan
has sold 30 units now I want to find
this value using the V lookup function
so here on the right you can see I have
my lookup value which is Morgan and this
is my vooka formula and using this
formula I'm getting the result as 30
now let's go to our Excel workbook and
perform all the demos one by one so this
is my Excel workbook that we are going
to use for our demo and here is the data
set we'll be using now this is the same
data set that you saw a while ago so
this data set has seven columns you have
the order date the region
Representatives name item there's units
unit cost and total which is basically
the total or the amount of sales that
was generated
we are going to use a chunk of this data
set and perform our vlookup analysis so
let's see our first example and the
problem we have at hand let me go to the
exact match tab all right so here I'm
going to use this chunk of data which is
actually taken from the original data
set so we have taken the first 11 rows
from the data set you can see from row
two till ot2 is going to be our data set
that we'll use so we have a question
here we want to find the items sold by
Thompson so here Thompson is my lookup
value which means looking at Thompson I
want to find the item that is sold so if
you consider our table here you can see
we have the representatives name
Thompson right here and from the table
you can see th Thon sold pencil and I
want to get this value which is pencil
using my V lookup function so let's go
ahead and write our V lookup
function I'll consider this as my lookup
value and here under item I'm going to
write my vooka formula to write the
vooka formula I'll write first equal to
and I'll write V lookup if I hit tab it
will autoc complete all right now let's
give the parameters so first is going to
be the lookup value which is nothing but
Thompson so I'll just select this cell
which is
j17 comma now it's asking to give the
table array so the table array is the
table from which you want to retrieve a
value one thing to keep in mind is that
the value you are looking for should be
the first column of a table and you can
select the table array till the end of
the data set or till the column which
has the value you want to find so here
I'll select my table array starting from
the representatives column till the end
of the item column which is going to be
my table array then I'll select the
column index number so the column index
number is based on the table array you
have selected in this case my column
index number is going to be two because
we have selected just two columns and
the value which I'm going to find is in
the second column so I'll give two comma
Now the range lookup I'm going to give
is false because I want to find an exact
match so either you can hit tab or you
can write zero which means
false if I close the bracket and hit
enter it will return me the item that
Thompson had sold which is pencil you
can verify from the table that Thompson
had sold pencil all right now let's try
to change the table array and see what
result are we getting so this time I'll
slightly change the table array so again
we are trying to find the item that
Thompson had sold so I'll write my
formula equal to V lookup I'll hit tab
to autocomplete I'll give my look of
value as Thompson comma this time I'm
choosing my table array starting from
the representatives column till the end
of the data set which is till p12 again
my column index number is going to be
two because if you consider this table
array the item column is the second
column in the selected table array so
I'm going to write it as two comma the
range lookup I want to give as false
because I want to find the exact match
if I close this and hit enter you can
see it has return returned me the same
result that we saw earlier now suppose
let's say this time I want to start my
table array from the region column which
is this column so I want to select my
table array starting from the region
column now this is going to show me an
error because your table array should
always start from the look of value
column so if you consider Thompson as
the look of value my table array should
always start from the representatives
column so let's just try this example so
I'll write V lookup my lookup value I'm
going to give it as Thomson comma the
table array as I mentioned earlier I'm
going to choose from the region column
and let's say I'll select till the item
column give another comma and this time
my column index number is going to be
three because since the table array has
three columns and my item column is the
last column so I'm going to give my
column index number is three comma I
want to get the exact match so I'll give
zero if I close the bracket and hit
enter you can see it has given me an
error okay now let me just show you
another method to use vlookup in Excel
so here on the top you can see there's a
formulas Tab and under formulas tab
under the function Library you see we
have an option to select look up and
reference if I click on this and if I
scroll down below you can see there's an
option called vlookup let's choose this
all right now here you can give your
lookup value your table array column
index number and the range
lookup under this function arguments
dialog box so here I want to select my
lookup value as
Thompson my table array is going to be
from the representatives column till
let's say the end of the data set my
column index number is going to be
two I'll write two and range look up
I'll write as false because I want the
exact match if I hit okay you can see it
has given us the exact same result so
this is one of the other ways to use V
lookup in Excel now let's move to the
next seet which is regarding approximate
match okay so sometimes you might have
cases where you don't have the lookup
value present in the table in those
cases you can tell vlookup to return an
approximate match now one thing to keep
in mind is that your lookup value column
should always be sorted in ascending
order while trying to get an approximate
match so here we are going to use this
table and my lookup value column which
is going to be the representatives
column is already s SED in ascending
order and let's see the question we have
here so I want to find the item sold and
the unit cost for Matt so my lookup
value is going to be Matt now if you see
this table I don't have the
representatives name Matt anywhere in
the table now using an approximate match
I want to find the item and the unit
cost so let's do it so here under item
I'll write my vooka formula so I'll type
V look up I'll hit tab to complete it
and this time my look up value is going
to be mat so I'll select this cell comma
my table array I'll select from the
representatives column till the end of
item column because I want to find the
item value for mat I'll give a comma my
column index number as per the table
array is going to be two comma my range
lookup this time I'm going to give us
true or one so I'll write one close the
bracket hit enter all right it has
returned me binder was the item sold by
Matt now let's try to figure out why we
look up returned binder as the
item now let's say you were asked to
insert the name Matt to the
representative column in alphabetical
order so where would you place it
ideally you should Place between KL and
Morgan since this column is already
sorted Matt should appear before Morgan
and after Kell so in an approximate
match we look up will consider the
previous highest value in this case the
previous highest value before Matt is KL
and hence vup returned the corresponding
item purchased by Kel which is binder
now
similarly if you wanted to find the unit
cost for
Matt again V lookup will return the unit
cost of KL which is
125 let's just try it out so I'll write
we look up my lookup value is mat comma
my table array for this time is going to
be from Representatives column till the
unit cost column I'll consider I'll give
a comma Now the column index number as
per the table array is going to be four
I'll give another comma and this time
I'll double click true because I want an
approximate match if I close the bracket
hit enter you can see it has returned me
125 which is actually Kel's unit cost
okay we have another question and this
time I want to find the units sold by
Rob now Rob is going to be my lookup
value if you see the representatives
column we don't have Rob now let's see
what V lookup is going to return as the
item for Rob so I'll write vlookup I'll
give my my lookup value as Rob comma my
table array is going to start from the
representatives column I'll select till
here I'll give a comma the column index
number is two I'll give another comma
I'll double click on
true I close the bracket hit enter you
can see V lookup has written me pen now
let's understand why V lookup returned
pen for Rob now if you are asked to
insert the Representatives name Rob into
this column so ideally Rob would appear
somewhere between Morgan and sorino
because since this is sorted in
ascending order Rob is actually greater
than Morgan and is less than sorino so
as you know we look up in an approximate
match Returns the previous highest value
which is Morgan here and the
corresponding item for Morgan is pen and
hence we look up returned pen for Rob
all right now moving to the next
sheet which is another property of vook
lookup which tells V lookup always looks
to the right this means that your lookup
value must always be on the left and the
value you are going to find out should
always be to the right of the table now
consider this scenario where your lookup
value is on the left in this case it is
the representatives value and I have
taken svino for an example
and we want to find the order date for
svino now if you consider this table
your lookup value which is svino is
actually this column the representatives
column and we are going to find out the
order date so your representatives name
is on the right of the table and the
value we are going to find out is on the
left of the table now as per the
property V lookup only looks to the
right so if I use the V lookup function
for this example here
I'll write V lookup I'll give my lookup
value as svino comma my table array I'll
consider from the order date because I
want the order date
till the representatives column I'll
give a comma and this time my column
index number is actually the first
column if I consider my table array as
the first three columns
selected and my range lookup is going to
be false if I close the bracket hit
enter it returns me an error the reason
is V lookup always looks to the right
and this time the value we were trying
to find out was to the left of the
table now if you consider the opposite
case suppose you have the order date and
you want to find the representatives
name you can do that easily because your
lookup value which is the order date is
on the left and your representatives
column is on the right so let's just try
this I'll write V lookup my lookup value
is going to be S Vino's order date so
I'll select it from the table I'll give
a comma my table array will start from
the G column let's say I'll select the
entire table comma and my column index
number will be three if you consider
these as my table
array comma my range lookup is zero if I
close this hit enter you can see we have
got svino corresponding to the order
date all right now let's move to the
next
tab now this tab says we lookup returns
only the first match so we have a
question at hand the question is find
the units sold by Jardine if you see
this table we have the representatives
name Jardin twice you see here and if
you look down we have Jardine here as
well but the items sold by jarden at the
first instance is pencil and at the
second instance it's desk now as per the
property V lookup always returns the
first match now ideally when we write
the V lookup function and look for the
units sold by jine you will see V lookup
will return 36 instead of three let's
just write
out I'll write the V lookup
function my lookup value is Jardine
comma my table array I'll select from
the representatives column till the end
of units column I'll give a comma my
column index number based on the table
array is three I'll give another comma
Now I want the exact match so I'll
select zero close the bracket and hit
enter as you can see it returns me the
first match of Jardine which is 36 so we
lookup did not consider the second match
now
similarly if you consider this table we
have Jones repeated Thrice so you have
Jones here you have Jones here for the
second time and also we have Jones for
the third time and let's say you want to
find the unit cost for Jones so if I
write the vup
function I'll consider my look of value
as Jones comma my table
array I'll select from the
representatives column till the end of
unit cost column I'll give a comma based
on the table array my unit cost column
is at the fourth index so I'll write
four comma the range look up is zero if
I click on this and hit enter you can
see it here vlookup has returned the
first instance of Jones and it did not
consider the second and the third
instance so our unit cost
for Jones is
1.99 because we lookup only Returns the
first
match okay moving ahead to the next
example we have here is V lookup is case
insensitive if you consider this table
I've added another row in green so if
you see here I have a representative
name called Gil which is in proper case
or popularly known as sentence case here
I have added Gil's name
in capital letters or all in uppercase
so I want to find the total revenue
generated by Gil the total revenue is
basically the total column let's do it
I'll write V look
up my look of value is Gil which is
actually in Upper Kee I'll consider my
table array from the representatives
column till the end of total column or
the sales
column based on this selection my column
index number is
five comma the range lookup is false so
I'll just double click on
false I close the bracket hit enter you
can see it here our vlookup function has
returned the total as
53973 which is actually the value for
this row so clearly V look up did not
consider Gil which was present at the
bottom of the table in upper case
so this shows that V lookup is clearly
case
insensitive all right now moving to the
next example the V lookup function
supports wild cards which makes it
possible to perform a partial match on a
lookup value for instance you can use
vlookup to retrieve values from a table
after typing only part of a lookup value
to use wild cards with vlookup you must
specify the exact match by giving false
or zero for the last argument that is
range lookup now we we have a question
here I want to know how much sales did
the representative whose name starts
with Ki make now here sales represents
the total column
actually so I want to find out the
person whose name starts with
Ki so if you consider the representative
column I have one representative whose
name starts with Ki that is Kel so using
Ki as my look up value I want to find
the total so let me show you how to use
wild car characters and find the value
using V lookup so I'll write my function
V
lookup okay now in lookup value I'll
give
Ki after that I'm going to write Amber
sent followed
by double inverted commas then I'm going
to write a star and close the inverted
comma this means
the value starts with Ki Amber scent
actually represents concatenation and
star represents anything followed by Ki
so this is going to be my lookup value
in total I'll give a
comma next I'll select my table array
starting from the representatives column
till the end of total column because I
want to find the sales I'll give another
comma my column index number based on
the table array we have ected is five
comma the range lookup is zero because I
want to find an exact match it close the
bracket hit enter you can see it here V
lookup has returned me
99.5 which is actually KS
total now there's another way to do it
instead of selecting the cell in which
we have the lookup value I can directly
write it in the v lookup function fun so
I'll write the V lookup function
something like this so my lookup
value I'll pass Ki within double
inverted commas because Ki is a
character value So within double
inverted commas I'm writing Ki followed
by Amber Cent which is for concatenation
followed
by a
star within double inverted commas so
this is going to be my look of values
this total means anything that appears
after Ki will be considered as the
lookup
value again the table array I'll select
as these rows and columns comma my
column index number would be five comma
the range lookup is zero if I close the
bracket hit enter you see we have the
same value so this is another method or
another way of using
vlookups okay now moving ahead let's
explore another feature of vlookup so if
the V lookup function cannot find a
match it returns a hash na error now if
you want you can use the if any function
to replace the has any error with a
friendly message so suppose you want to
find the region in which an order was
placed on 10th of May
2018 now if the order date is not found
I want to return a message that is
invalid date
so if you look at the order date column
we don't have any value for 10th of May
2015 you can see these values we don't
have any value corresponding to this
date so if my vlookup function cannot
find this lookup value I'll return
invalid date so let me show you how to
write
this I'll type my vup function I'll give
my order date as 10th of May
2015 as my lookup value and then
I'll consider my table array starting
from the order date column till the end
of region
column I'll give another comma my column
index number would be two this time
based on the table array we have
selected comma I want an exact
match so I'll give zero close the
bracket and hit enter there you go it
has returned me an error now I want to
convert this error to a friendly message
saying invalid date so let me show you
how to do I'll do it here so to return a
valid
message I'll use the if any function and
within if any function I'll give my
vlookup function so let me type if
na I'll hit
tab now for the value parameter I'll use
my V lookup function so my lookup value
is going to be the order date comma my
table array I'll select from the order
date column till the end of region
column comma my column index number is
going to be two comma my range lookup is
zero I'll close the bracket give another
comma Now if this expression results in
an error I want to display a message
that is invalid date so I'll put invalid
date within double codes since it is a
text
message I close the bracket hit enter
you can see the result which is invalid
date now moving on to the final section
of the demo we have two-way
lookup now in the vooka function the
column index parameter is normally
hardcoded as a static number however you
can also create a dynamic column index
by using the match function to locate
the right
column and this technique allows you to
create a dynamic two-way lookup matching
on both rows and
columns now let me first show you how a
match function works so
suppose I want to find the index where
unit cost column is present so here I'll
use the match function I'll give my
lookup value as the unit cost column
name comma suppose I'll choose my lookup
array starting from Representatives
column till the unit cost column comma
I'll give my match type a zero for exact
match if I close the bracket hit enter
it returns me four because my array was
selected from the representatives column
till the unit cost column and in this
array unit cost is at the fourth index
all right now using this idea let's
solve the following problem I want to
find the cost of each item sold by
Morgan so let's write our vlookup
formula I'll write
vlookup my lookup value is J5 which has
the representatives name as Morgan comma
my table array I'll select from C2 till
F12 I'll give a comma and this time I
know that my column index number is at 4
but I'll be using the match function to
find the
same so I'll write
match my lookup value is unit cost comma
my lookup array is from C1 till
F1 comma my match type is zero I close
this bracket give another comma and I'll
give my range lookup as zero close the
bracket hit enter you can see for Morgan
the unit cost is 19.99 you can verify
from the table for Morgan the unit cost
is 19.9
99 all right now we have another
question
here I want to find how much sales did
Andrew make in the central region so
here I have two lookup values one is
Central one is Andrews now looking at
these two values I want to find the
total to solve such
problems let me first create another
table I'll place the table somewhere
here here okay so let me just paste the
table here all right now I'll create
another column where I'll merge the
values of region and representatives so
here let me create another column okay
I'll just name this column as
region
rep all right now this
column I'll use the concatenation
operator
so I'll Select East use Amber sent and
then select Jones I'll hit
enter now the same thing I'll just
duplicate it for the other rows as well
so I have my new column created Now
using this table I can easily solve the
problem now to find the total I'll write
my V lookup
formula so my lookup value will be a
combination of
G11 ERS
Cent
k11 comma while table array will start
from the region rep which has the values
of region and rep combined
till the last
column and from this table array my
column index number is five and my range
lookup is zero if I close the bracket
hit enter you can see for central region
which is this one one and for Andrew's
representative the total is 149.
25 all right now we are done with our
demo let's have a quick glance at what
all we did in this demo okay so first of
all we saw our data set which was a
sales data set that we used then we
started with our first example to see
how V lookup performs an exact match we
also saw how using the formulas Tab and
lookup
and reference you can write we lookup in
another way so you can use the function
arguments to give your V lookup
parameters next we saw how vup performs
an approximate match so we had mat and
raw which were not present in the
representatives column after that we saw
an important property of V lookup that
is V lookup only looks to the right
followed by V lookup only Returns the
first match following following which we
saw that we look up is case insensitive
so here we had added a new row where Gil
was present in upper case but still we
look up found the total revenue for Gil
which was in sentence case or proper
case next we saw how we can use Wild
Card characters to use V lookups and
here we saw how to use an if any
function along with v lookup and finally
we saw how to use two-way lookups choose

learn click on the link in the
description to know more now we are on
the sheet of Microsoft Excel and here
you can see some data on my
sheet that is employee name employee ID
and salary so here we are going to
perform our horizontal lookup but before
that let me show you that this
particular drop down menu so this part
particular drop down menu has all the
names of the employees in this
particular table and we have created
this using data validation in Excel if
you want to create the drop- down menus
just like these then feel free to check
out our data validation in Excel
tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement H lookup in Excel so here we
have employee name but we want to find
out the employee ID so for that let's
create the H lookup now for that equals
to hookup
now the first one is a look up value so
this one is the cell which is the
employee name now after that the table
array we have to select all the table
arrays
here
now the row index number so the employee
ID is in row index number two according
to the table so for that provide two and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false and close the bracket press enter
and there you go and if you select Jack
then you'll find the employee ID of Jack
and if you select Jerry you'll find the
employee ID of Jerry reflecting here now
similarly let's find out the salary of
all the employees using hookup so equals
hookup and look up value that happens to
be the name of the employee now the
table
array and next we have uh row index
number that is salary happens to be the
third row in the table so three
and exact match close the bracket and
enter so now if you change the values in
this particular drop down menu you'll
find the employee ID and their
particular salary so Jack happens to be
carrying the employee ID as 10001 and
his salary is 10,000 so similarly let's
try to find out Peter's employee ID and
salary so there you go one5 and 50,000
as salary so that's how you use H lookup
in Excel here you can see the first
chart so this particular data is
converted into a table format to avoid
confusion while you're fixing the data
so here you can see the name of the
employee employee ID Department salary
and date of joining and here you can see
the salary column and the bonus
percentage of each and every employee
based on their salaries now coming to
the new data table and here on the table
two which is an updated table here you
can find we're going to find out the
department of the employee and the
current Department of employee and the
bonus percentage based on his or her
salary so why are we finding current
Department again so here you can see
that we have an intern Emily who has
joined in the year 2020 but recently she
got promoted as a developer so her
department has been changed from
Department intern to Department
developer in 2021 so that's what we we
going to find out here in the current
Department using X lookup now let's
start to implement X lookup so for that
equals to X lookup and for lookup you
can see we need to find out the lookup
value lookup array return array and all
the other two are not important right
now but you can use them to get some
exact matches in the future we'll also
use that in the future for now let's try
to use the first three parameters that
is lookup value lookup array and written
array so the lookup value is the name of
the employee Mary and lookup array is
right here which is this one now we are
going to select the lookup array then
comma and uh we're going to look up the
department so this is the department
lookup array and that's all we
need close the bracket and press enter
okay I think we missed out the lookup
value so the employee uh or the lookup
value which we required was missed so
I've added it here so that is the lookup
value the first one which is Mary and
there you go press enter and you have
the department here now let's add it to
all the rows and here you have all the
rows and all the data related to all the
employees now we will find out the
current Department as you can see here
you have Emily as intern which is the
older data but what if you needed the
latest data that is the developer in the
year 2021 right for that you might want
to to the X lookup formula a little bit
so let's try that X
lookup lookup value which is the same
and comma Now where you have to look for
the array that is lookup array this one
and the return array which happens to be
this
one and
next
you can find the exact match for this
one so that's all right exact match and
here comes the important part where you
have to search last to first by default
X lookup searches for first to last that
is like this in the starting place to
the last place so that's the reason why
we had Emily as intern so now if we give
last to first then it retrieves the
latest data where Emily will be shown as
developer now select that and now you
can close the brackets and press enter
so let's add that to all the row there
you go now you can see Emily Clark Peter
and James all they have got their
updated job profiles as you can see in
the original data Emily is a developer
now so is Clark who was originally a
tester and he got promoted to
development team in 2021 similarly Peter
became a senior Finance executive in
2021 and James the manager of sales now
let's try to find out the bonus for all
these employees based on this salary so
this one is quite simple so X
lookup now the lookup value is their
existing salary comma and the bonus part
so the lookup array is the salary
range then here is another important
point so here you might want to find the
exact match but finding the exact match
will not help you here you might want to
declare another type of value where you
can get exact match or next smaller item
so you'll understand it why I'm
selecting that so now let's close the
bracket and enter
so so now we have the bonus values now
let's add the bonus value to all the
factors all the rows I mean so you can
see we have different variety of
salaries that is 38,000 22,000 39 Etc
but here in the ranges we have provided
10 20 30 40 and 50 so what if the value
is between 30 and 20 that's when you
want the less number right that's when
you want the number which is equalent to
30 or less than 30 which happens to be
15% so that's how it has worked here
that is 0.15% bonus to the actual salary
however if you are looking to get
certified then hey there we are here
with an amazing course through which you
can catch the eyes of top Recruiters in

postgraduate program in data analytics
by simply learn so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll Now find the
cost Link in the description box so on
my screen you can see an example Excel
budget template theme so on my screen
you can see a column where you have the
debit amount so in the I column we have
all the deit amount what we are spending
for a month and on the right column will
be the balance amount or the running
balance of that for example you can see
that there is a row number five where
the deit amount is 8,000 for a jeans
Levis and it is done through UPI payment
now if I change this value of 8,000 to
4,000 something then you can see that
the running balance will automatically
change you can see that currently the
running balance is 73,000 and if I
change this value from 8,000 to 4,000
then all the running balances will
change let's do that so for that let's
press
enter there you go you can see that the
number has been changed successfully and
all the values from the running balance
are also changed until the last dat
which is the March
30th now how is this working and not
just that you can see that we have also
included what is the total debit amount
in January and what is the running
balance that is the total available
balance after 1 lakh has been debited
into the account in the month of
February as February income now the
current available balance is
13,200 and the total expens and February
is 1 lakh
14,500 right how am I doing all this
looks so much interesting right now
let's do this practically so for that I
have already created a new sheet and I
have included all the data that we have
used previously the income of that
particular month and all the expenses of
that particular
month now without further Ado let's
begin to implement the Excel budget
template now our first step happens to
be converting all the data into a
natural table so you know that in Excel
all the data values are stored in the
form of a database by default so it
happens to be our duty to convert the
database type table into the pure table
type table so for that select all your
data and press control T and there you
go we have an option to convert this
data into a table and remember to check
this particular check box and tell your
Excel that your table has headers so we
do have headers here here so now press
okay and your table will be converted
into a natural table now let's typen the
formulas so now let's select the cell
J2 and type in the
formula so what are we doing here is we
are trying to add the sum of G2 +
H3 so which is this particular cell and
removing I3 that is this particular
debit amount so this formula is used for
checking the running balance let's press
enter and there you go so it means that
you received 1 lakh rupees in the month
of January and out of that one lakh you
spend 15,000 rupees for something maybe
your educational or something and then
the remaining running balance out of 1
lakh Rupees is 85 5,000 rupees now let's
copy the same formula to all the
sales and there you go now the running
balance has been calculated for all the
sales here now remember the monthly
income available balance and debit for
January and final balance now let's try
to calculate that for all the three
months so here we have three months that
is January February and March now now
let's do a simple calculation to find
out the available balance of that month
and the total debit made by that person
in that particular
month the formula is really simple all
you have to do is use a sum function and
calculate the sum of all these
values and done
right there you go so the total expense
of the month January is
93,00 rupees now let's calculate the
total du of February month same formula
that
is calculating the sum of all the
expenses made in the month of
February okay now let's also calcul get
the sum of all the expenses in the month
of
March done so we have the final values
of all the total expenses made in those
particular months now let's calculate
the final balance now I think I'm forgot
one important thing so before we
calculate the final balance we need to
find out the available balance
that is the available balance after 1
lakh Rupees is credited into our account
and along with the savings that you have
from your previous month right for that
we have a simple
formula now which all we doing is just
adding the uh income cell with the
balance cell that's
all so there you go now after crediting
1 lakh rupees and adding up the uh
balance of that particular month that is
we have 13,200 remaining from the month
of January and the month of February we
have income of 1 lakh so the total
amount is
11,3 no no no it is
13,200 yeah now we have the final
balance status the difference between
the available balance and the debit made
in that particular month so in the month
of February we had a total balance of
13,200 and the total debit of 1 lak
14,500 so the final remaining balance is
8,700 similarly the same formula has
been applied for the month of March and
the final balance we have is
37,300 so that's how you implement
budget template in Excel all simple
formulas and you have all the numbers at
your filling Tis so here I'll be
discussing some important questions that
that you will come across when You Face
interview for Excel and uh we will start
with the basics the beginner level and
uh most of them will be discussed here
will be the beginner level at the
beginning and then we'll discuss it at
the further level okay so the first
question that you might get asked is
what is a cell address in Excel so a
cell address is a combination of column
letter and a row number that identifies
a cell on a worksheet basically each
cell will have an Associated column
number column letter and a row number so
you have to keep in mind it will be
always be a column letter and a row
number each Excel sheet will have
suppose for instance if you take row
five rows will be in numbers and the
columns will be in letters column a
column B column C column D and so on
and the numbers will be for the rows so
for instance if you take this particular
uh cell the cell address is
D5 row column D and row
five so this is the cell address now
let's move on to the next
one now you will be asked what is
relative cell referencing and absolute
cell referencing in Excel so so relative
cell referencing is usually the relative
references change when a formula is
copied to another cell depending on the
destination row and column okay so this
is called relative cell referencing
absolute cell referencing irrespective
of the cell you know you don't have to
depend on the value of the cell
destination there is no change when a
formula is copied so this we I'll
explain it in the uh next slide the
basic difference is this type of
referencing is there by default in Excel
relative cell referencing you just
insert the formula you don't need to put
a do dollar sign in the formula whereas
absolute cell referencing if you don't
want to change in the formula when it's
copied across cell then absolute cell
referencing requires you to add a dollar
sign before and after the column and row
address so see for instance this is
relative referencing you know if you see
this this particular cell is having we
put the value as A3 into B3 so what it
will do is it will multiply A3 and B3
and it will give the product this is
relative cell reference whereas absolute
cell referencing is again the same thing
but you have to put a dollar sign before
the column and the row number so here
your specifying this as A3 into B2 okay
A3 into B2 and it will give you this
particular answer irrespective of that
it will give you it will calculate what
is there in this and it will give you
the answer okay now we move on to the
next point is basic question when you
scroll across an Excel sheet sometimes
you have a header on the first row and
if you scroll scroll down you will not
be able to see the first row so there is
a process or the there is a trick to
freeze the pains in the Excel so you
just need to have the rows locked so how
do you freeze pain this is the question
so what you need to do is you need to
select the view tab go to the view Tab
and go to freeze pains it's a basic
thing and you will see this if you see
here select the third row and click
freeze paines so you just select this
and click freeze
paines okay so you're going here and
you're going to the third row and you
are going to view Tab and you're
selecting free Spain so what happens is
first two rows will be locked okay these
two rows will be locked similarly for uh
if you want to freeze the column okay
it's the same thing I am going to select
this particular column and then click on
view and then click free Spin so what
happens is the first two columns are
locked A and B will be locked and if I
scroll right you will always see the uh
customer name and category column so
these two we have locked and the next
will be scrolled so this is the function
of freezing pains okay now coming up to
the next one and you will be asked and
you have an Excel sheet or a spreadsheet
and you want to restrict you want to
protect the data for from anyone or from
someone cop from copying the cell for
your worksheet so how do you do that you
need to select that particular data that
you want to protect and then click
control shift F and then you will see
the protection tab okay you just need to
go to the protection Tab and select Lo
okay and you will be asked to put a
password wherein you will be getting the
review tab where you you you need to
select the sheet put a password and just
save it so I will show you across in one
of the examples here so this is
particular uh data that you have and you
need to protect you select it so here as
I said I selected it and then I just
press control shift F so here you see
the protection tab click the protection
Tab and then click select and then uh
locked and then click okay and then you
need to go to the review Tab and then
click on the protect sheet and you
having the you need to select this
protect worksheet and contents of locked
cells so you selecting these and you are
protecting the content and you just need
to uh put some password
okay and then click
okay okay so this is how you protect the
data on a worksheet and you are
selecting this area control shift F and
just put up a password and select lock
sheet so this is how you protect the
sheet from anyone to copy it
the now the next question that you might
be ask is what is the difference between
a function and a formula in
Excel so you will be asked this question
and you need to remember this formula is
like an equation which is typed in by
the user you are typing it suppose A1 +
B2 you are typing this formula in one
particular cell okay whereas function
functions are predefined calculations it
is like a formula
which is already there in Excel and you
can use it so as it says here it
consumes more time and it has to be
typed in manually you this is as per the
need basis and this is particularly it's
very quick and very efficient you have
inbuilt formulas in Excel the sum and
multiplication product and various other
things that you will come across so this
is the basic difference between a
formula and a function in Excel okay the
now the next question that you might be
asked is uh or you need to know
basically is the order of operations
used in Excel while evaluating the
formulas so what is the order you need
to remember this acronym pad Mass p d m
as or in other simple terms you can use
this also please excuse my dear and
Sally so these are the acronyms p e d m
a s now let's see what happens first and
you uh in math when you do some
calculations you have order of
operations okay Bard mass is the one of
the order of operations now in Excel
similarly in Excel when you put up a
formula you Excel will calculated in a
particular order and this is called the
order of operations and the Order of
Operations is first it will calculate
what is there in the parenthesis it will
perform this function and then it will
see if there are any exponents in
and if it is there it will do that
calculation the next and after that it
will see if there is any multiplication
or division so p e d and then it will
see there is any addition okay and then
the last one will be the subtraction so
Excel knows this and you have to know
this so that when you put up a formula
you will know what is going to happen
first and you will not mess up with your
formula okay this is the order of
operations it is one of the important
questions in the interview for a
beginner Excel level now the next one is
uh how will you write the formula for
following multiply the value in a cell
A1 by 10 and add the result by five and
divide it by two it is quite simple okay
see I'm just giving it an example in
this slide and you might be are
something else so you will be given a
task to calculate or put up a formula
for this
so when you are asked multiply the value
in a Cell of A1 by 10 so this is
particularly thing okay A1 is the
particular cell that is being given and
you're multiplying it okay you put it in
parenthesis and then add the result by
five so it will calculate the
parenthesis first okay and if it sees if
there are any exponents you have to
think in that way if there are any
exponents in it or not and then first it
will see the parenthesis and then
exponent there are no exponents here and
then it will do the multiplication and
then the addition and the division okay
so you will get this particular answer
and if you put it simply in this way
your answer is wrong because it will
multiply it into 10 add 5 and divide by
2 so you have to check which one is
right and you have to make sure that you
putting the right parenthesis okay okay
so this is the
formula okay the next question is uh
there is a difference what is the
difference between count counter and
count blank these are three particular
important things that you need to these
are similar but they are quite different
when you actually see it okay so first
we will see what is count count is
basically it counts the number of cells
which have numeric values as the name
suggest it is count it will count count
the number of cells which has numeric
volumes okay if you see this column and
we at A1 we putting it as count equals
to A10 to A2 to A10 so you're taking
this range and you're finding out what
are the number of cells which have
numeric value if you see this 1 2 3 4
five so five cells have numeric values
it counts the cells which has numeric
value and the next thing is the counter
okay what counter does it counts the
number of cells which has any form of
content it can be anything it can be a
number it can be a alphabet it can be
anything it will see what are the uh
number of cells which has any form of
content okay for example this is the
same example we here taken here and we
have put the function as counter A2 to
A10 now see 1 2 3 4 5 6
seven so it sees that there
are seven cells have some content in it
it is numbers and letters it can be
anything but it has some content so
count is the pension for this now the
next one is Count blank okay as the name
suggest it will count the number of
blank cells only so again the same
examples count blank A2 to A10 okay it
will see what are the number of blanks
okay if you see the this is blank and
this is blank so two cells are blank so
it will count the number of blank cells
only okay now the next one is uh what is
the shortcut to add a filter to a table
why do we use filter and it is one of
the basics uh function in the Excel
where you need to do some sorting and it
can be done by using a filter what is
the shortcut key it's very simple
control shift and L this is the key that
is used to put up a filter you just
press this control shift L all together
and you will find the filter and you can
sort it now the next question that
you'll come across is uh how do you
create a hyperlink in Excel so it's
quite simple there is a simple shortcut
control K you press these two together
and you will get the option you will
select the it will select the cell where
you have to insert the hyperlink
hyperlink basically it redirects to any
other document it can be a web page it
can be a Word document it can be another
Excel sheet or so on okay so these are
the things okay now another important
questions uh that is uh how to merge
multiple
cells text strings in a Cell so how do
we merge the text strings in multiple
cells into one
cell there is one particular uh simple
function that that you can use which is
called called as concatenate concatenate
function is used to merge text strings
present in multiple cells okay and uh
it's a very simple thing you just need
to put this equals to concatenate and
then if you for example this is the
formula concatenate text one text two
text 3 or this is concatenate A1 comma
B1 comma C1 this is the data in our uh
three cells Xcel is one in A1 B1 and C1
so now if you want to put them all in
one and you can merge it in one cell
using the concatenate function and it's
very simple concatenate in parenthesis
A1 comma B1 comma C1 okay and you will
get it all merged in one particular cell
okay so this is how you use the
concatenate function and you can also
use the and operator to combine cell
values it is the same thing you can use
the and operator instead of commas okay
and I will show it to you in the example
here okay now we have this I'll just
copy this thing
[Music]
to here okay and let's make it simple
and now I want to put this here
equals
con
concatenate and
A1 comma
B1 comma c i just close it and I put
enter so you see this this all three the
different text is merged in one
particular cell and it will you can
perform various merge functions using
the concatenate function it's a very
simple thing and it is a frequently
asked questions in the interview Okay so
the next question uh it is very very
important one again and very basic as
well so how can you split a column into
two or more columns you have some
particular text or a sentence written or
data written in your cell or a column
and you want to put them across in two
or more or many number of columns so how
do you perform this function it's very
simple again you need to select that
particular cell so for instance we have
it here is India is a democratic country
India space is space a space Democratic
space country so the it's a different
text here and you want to split this
particular sentence into different
columns okay you need to select that
cell and then go to the data Tab and
then choose text to columns there will
be an option where you need to select
text to columns okay and you will see
this screen okay and you need to select
the choose the delimeter here and what
we are specifying here is first it is
delimed and then we are selecting a
delimer as space because we see that
that is space here which is very common
and we want to split it so you will see
a preview here which shows what your
output will be like India in one column
is a democratic country so the dener is
space here
and you need to select this and then
click next okay so you will see the
options select the columns data format
and choose the destination now you see
the data Pro and you need to select the
destination where you want to put this
output as and you select that and then
click finish and this one what it does
it it it splits the text into multiple
columns okay so you see this you have
selected this as the output and it
starts here India is a democratic
country so uh you will come across some
data which is you know huge and there
are spaces or OBS or anything that is uh
differentiated it with and you need to
put them in different rows or different
columns so this is the function uh that
you need to use to split the text into
different or multiple columns okay okay
the next uh question can be very simple
one or most widely used in fact and what
is the use of vooka and how do we use it
so what is this particular thing in
Excel vup function is used for looking
up a piece of information in a table and
extracting some corresponding data or
information so you have some set of
values in one particular column and you
want to retrieve or extract the data
corresponding to that particular column
or a cell in the whole sheet okay so the
syntax is something like this it is you
need to go to one particular uh cell
where you want the output as and you
type the function V look up and you are
selecting the value where is the cell
exactly where you want the output to be
and you're selecting the table here and
the you're specifying the column index
and range look up so value this
indicates the value that you have to
look for in the first colum of a table
okay and then the table table basically
this refers to the table from which you
have to retrieve a value we will show
this in the example in the next slide
and the column index column index it
provides the colum in the table from
which we are to retrieve a value okay
you'll specify the column index which
one you are looking
for the next thing is range lookup which
is optional true with uh if you put true
it is approximate match which is default
and false if it is exact match if you're
looking for the exact match so what is
the use of V lookup and how do we do it
okay so find the product related to a
customer name Richard okay you have this
sheet and and in this one you want to
see what Richard has bought okay what is
a product that he has bought and you can
do this with the V looka function okay
so you just go here and you type in the
function V look up you're naming it as
Richard and first thing is the value it
is H4 okay and then the next thing is
the table okay table is A2 because this
is the table okay and you're looking for
customer name Richard okay and then
you're selecting this the whole column
index which is E15 that mean you're
selecting this whole table then 15 okay
E15 you're selecting this and then the
next thing is optional which is giving
you the uh range lookup okay what it
does is it's optional it is you're
looking for exact value or an
approximate by default it is approximate
map so how it performs the function okay
so it gives you the answer as scam it
goes and look ups for Richard in this
particular it will give you the output
here and the A2 is the table that it
will look for the customer name and it
will search for Richard and then it will
give you the output as cam now the next
thing will be we look up different from
lookup function how different they are
we lookup lets the user look for a value
in the leftmost column of a table so as
we've seen in the example it uh allows
you to look for a data in the leftmost
column of the table and Returns the
value in a left to right way okay it
sorts in left to right way where looka
function lets the user look for data in
a row column and Returns the value in
the another row or column it will give
you the lookup function in the next row
column okay not very easy to use as
compared to the lookup function okay as
we see uh it's a bit complicated when
you compare it to the looka function
it's quite simple and it is used to
replace the V lookup function okay so
this is the different lookup and V
lookup function now uh Excel is
basically used for reporting mainly used
for reporting to management you have to
extract different kinds of reports and
what are the report formats that are
available in Excel this is one of the uh
important questions again uh for a
beginner level and there are three
formats basically compact form outline
form table form okay these are the three
formats that are available report
formats that are available in Excel okay
the next question is about a function
which is how does IF function work in
Excel okay the IF function in Excel it
actually performs a logical test and you
will give a condition it performs the
test and returns a value if the test
evaluates to true and another value
which you again will specify if the test
result is false okay for instance we
have here a simple example which is
shown in the slide and what we doing
here is a written record is valid if age
is greater than 20 we have age here
specified and salary is greater than
40,000 else return the record is invalid
so we are giving two conditions and it
actually checks and evaluates whether
these conditions are met and it will
give you an output whether record is
valid or invalid based on the two
conditions that are specified okay and
F22 XIs which is this this uh column we
are specifying it should be greater than
trendy and G2 to G6 which is the salary
column and we are specifying the
condition to be greater than 40,000 So
based on this two things it will check
and perform if these conditions are uh
met then it will give the desired result
okay so this is the function that is
used in Excel IF function okay the next
thing is sum IF function function okay
again the sum function adds the cell
value specified by a given condition or
a criteria so you are giving a condition
and you are actually doing another
function which is performing the
addition okay it will add the cell
values based on a condition again it is
shown here the total sum of salary where
salary is greater than
75,000 again for example the salary
column is G2 to G6
and we are doing a sum IF function what
the result will be it will perform the
addition of salaries which are greater
than 75,000 so it will see which values
are greater than 75,000 and then then uh
the output will be it will be adding
these salaries which are greater than
75,000
okay now coming to the next uh slide we
will discuss another important function
count F and we'll find the data I result
based on the data that we have and the
count function so we have a slide uh
data here and using the co data find the
number of days in which the number of
deaths in Italy has been greater than
200 okay it's not uh shown here for some
reason but I will show you in the Excel
sheet okay so this is the data that we
have and we will try to find the
function so we'll use the count function
and count function is again simple count
F you are specifying the column that is
the uh source that you're looking for
that is G2 the column G and it is two it
starts from two row two G2 till g357
which is the end of the column and what
you're looking for is Italy you're
specifying ital codes Italy and then the
next column that it will look for is the
E column the number of cases okay here
we have the number of cases e22 again we
are specifying the range and what we're
looking for is number of cases which are
more than 20 so we'll perform this
function and it will show you the output
okay I'll show you to you in the Excel
so here is the sheet and I will uh try
to get the answer here and
uh
the so we performing
count F okay count
F and you're giving the brackets
parenthesis G2 which is the countries
column okay countries column here who
are specifying the whole range 3 5
7 it is Bally uh along long list of uh
data and you're specifying the r and
what you're looking for is
particularly uh any country you can pick
up like uh
Algeria okay
Algeria and you specify it in codes okay
comma then what is the next Target that
you looking for is the column e where is
it is mentioning the number of cases
okay so you specify the colum range for
the number of cases which is again e and
then uh
the 3 5 7 I mean it's a basically long
list of data that you're looking for and
then you are what is the condition that
you want to know and you have to specify
it at C and what you're looking for is
number of cases which are more
than and you hit
enter okay so it give you the output as
143 so there are 143 days in which the
number of cases were more than 20 so
let's uh refine our search further let's
see 30 and it gives 140 so another
example that you can take is let's pick
Afghanistan Afghanistan and H so there
are 11 19 days that uh you will see the
number of cases where more than 30 and
this can be done with the count F
function
so the next question is uh about the
pivot table so what is a pivot table
it's basically is a summary of table of
the data set I mean the data that is
there that can be you know multiple
number of rows and columns which has
different uh data that has to be uh that
is there in the reports and you need to
analyze those Trends and you need to
create a report and basically present it
to the management or in a presentation
so pivot table is a summary of table you
know whatever data is there you can put
it in a summarized format they are
useful if you have long rows or column
that hold values you need to track okay
so you have long list of data and you
need to summarize it and put it in
a presentation or a you need to track
the values so it's very simple you have
to select the data and then go to the
insert tab and select pivot table okay
and then it will show up like this and
you need to uh select the table which is
a table or range and then you need to
specify where you want to put up this
private table okay and it's quite simple
and I can show it to you in one of the
examples okay so what you need to do is
you need to select this and once you
generate or as we have seen in the
previous slide
you need to select this and you need to
uh select the output where you want to
put the priv table and then once you do
that you will see something like this
and you need to select these particular
fields and put it in value so it will
for example you need to select the death
number of death you can just simply
click this select this drag and drop it
in the values okay so these are the
different fields that can be put up in
the table okay we can show it to you in
the example here so this is our data and
we need
to show it in a p table okay select this
and then go to the insert Tab and click
private table okay select that and it
will show you the uh table or the range
and now where you want to put it okay I
will put it in the existing work sheet
okay and I'll just select which color
I'll put it here for example and it will
show you this and click okay so this is
the table and now you need to select the
fields that you want to show in the
table for example we need to see the
continents the number of cases as per
the continents okay I selected and put
it in the row and we see the immediately
we see it in a table where you see the
number names of the contents and now I
want to see the number of cases and I
simply select it and put it across in
the value so this is quite simple and
very informative very short and
crisp form of presenting the data in a
pivate table okay so this is how it is
being used and it is being presented you
just need to go to the insert tab favor
table and it will generate the the table
and then you can select the fields all
right so the next question here is uh
how do we create a drop-down list in
Excel this is particularly useful when
you need to sort particular data with
the drop- down list where a number of uh
different variables are there and you
need to select one particular uh field
and sort the data so you can do this by
creating a drop-down list using the data
Val validation option present in the
data tab it's quite simple you select
the data and you go to the data
validation tab in the data and click
select data validation so once you
select that it will ask you to specify a
range so you need to select what data
you need to sort and put a drop down so
you need to select this and click data
validation and you select the list
option which shows you that there is a
different different option okay I'll
show it across in the Excel for example
what we have here is uh some particular
data and we have different variables we
need to sort or put a drop- down list so
just go to data as in as said in the
slides and go to data validation and
click data validation now as you click
it it will ask you to data validation
settings okay and in the drop down go
and select list option so it will ask
you to specify the source so when you
asked uh to specify the source just
click this particular column and click
okay so here I'm mentioning the source
is column B okay B 3
B4 Okay click okay and then it will give
you the option so here you can uh you
can put this in anywhere across the
Excel and click the option okay so this
is the way to drop down using the data
validation option so in the next example
we will see so how do we apply Advanced
filters in Excel we use the advanced
filter option present in the data tab so
this is the scenario wherein you have
multiple set of datas and you need to
sorted and it's it's actually huge data
and you need to sort a particular column
or a field with this criteria and you
can select it and specify the criteria
and specify a range what you want to uh
select or based on what criteria the
range can be specified and you can just
get it in a single click so this is the
option you have to go
to data tab Advanced and you have to
apply the advanced filter and then you
need to specify the list rint that is
the basically the source and then the
criteria wherein you specify the
criteria present here I mean you are
specifying in this case we will take an
example where we are trying to sort the
data or the number of cases based on
number of deaths and in a particular
country and we are specifying the output
we the copy to field is the output where
you will see the output so I'll show it
to you in the Excel so here we have a
spreadsheet wherein you will see all the
uh data covid data that we have and
based on the countries and the
continents and the number of deaths
number of cases and so on okay and it
also has different field like the date
uh year and month alone so so here I
going to sort the data which is
particularly for Europe and which has
deaths of more than 200 in a day so how
do we do it go to data advance and and
the you need to select copy to another
location okay and this is the list range
so it's basically given in this
countries okay and the criteria range
you have to specify this so I am going
to select this as my criteria okay and
then I have to put the output in one
particular cell so I need to select it
again let's say here okay and then I
just click
okay see it's quite simple instead of
running through the whole thing we can
just do it with a simple function okay
so it shows me the deaths which are more
than 200 and for which particular
country and for which particular uh
continents all right so this is
basically made very simple with this
option the next question is uh you know
you need to highlight some some
particular cells using a particular
criteria in this case we are trying to
analyze or highlight those cells where
the total sales is more than
$5,000 so what we do is we use
conditional formatting to highlight the
cells based on the criteria it's a very
useful tool in analyzing data and
Visually it helps you know you can have
a look at the data in quick flash you
will see the data and it's quite visible
using the conditional formatting so how
we do that is I will show it to you now
so as said in the slide we have the data
of the sales that is provided to us and
we need to see who has done more sales
which is greater than the $5,000 so just
go to home and you need to say go to
conditional formatting so for that you
need to highlight or select this go home
home conditional formatting highlight
okay and you have different options here
you select greater than and you specify
the value here my criteria is
$5,000 okay we can select which color so
let's go for green
okay see this you will immediately see
the option you don't have to dig or look
in deep into the data and find out which
one is more than 5,000 or any particular
value okay so conditional formatting now
moving on to the next question the index
and match function you must be familiar
with the index and match function and
why it is used basically index uh
function is a very powerful tool wherein
you know you for example you have a
table of planets in our solar system and
you want to get the name of the fourth
planet Mars so you can do it with a
formula using the the index function and
at the same time you can use the match
function okay with the match function
together you can play wonders with it
okay match function is another uh
function that is designed to find the
position of an item in a range for
example we can use the match function to
get the position of a word or a look or
in this case we have a name and we can
use the index and match function to find
the city how we do that is shown here
okay it uh it looks quite complicated
here when you see the formula but uh I
can show it to you in the Excel and
explain it further okay so here I have
and I want to know where these people
are and where they belong to okay so
let's see how course we have seen it and
we use the index function okay index
okay now when I have to specify the
range okay so the range is A2 and it
shows it selects the name and I want to
select it from A2 to A7 okay E7 sorry
e call
E7 okay so as you see it highlights the
whole table okay now what I'm going to
do is I want to match it okay match it
with a condition I am I am specifying a
condition a 10 why because I have to
specify a name here and it will show me
the city where he belongs to okay where
it shows is a 2 okay if you see A2 it
shows the name through A7 I have to
specify the range here okay not just one
name we are specifying the hold r as you
see if you put the values it will show
you the
selection okay a and what it should be
it should be the exact match so zero
denotes the exact match parenthesis Clos
and I am putting another match condition
okay what is this then this will give me
the output what output
is
okay B9 okay this is my City B9 is the
city where I'm trying to find from okay
and what it should look for is a column
A a one through E1 okay it you select
these this particular row and what it
should be it should be the exact match
again okay let's see how it goes it will
give you an error because you haven't
put the value here okay so let's see
Andre okay hit enter and you will see
the city where he belongs to
okay now let's see where Anna belongs to
enter and show Dallas okay so this is
the one other function index and match
function being used and it can be asked
in frequently in the interview questions
okay the next question will be uh how to
find duplicate values in a column okay
there are two ways that you can actually
do this and one is basically the very
simple one which is the conditional
formatting and the other one is we have
seen this before count if function okay
how we do that you need to Simply select
the data and go to conditional
formatting and select duplicate values
and it's quite simple and there is
another way which give you the color
coded conditional formatting okay and
there is another way that is the count
if function how we do that is again the
you have to put another column and put
up a ctive criteria ctive function
wherein you see that you are specifying
the
range and the the value which is being
twice or enter duplicate and you have to
put up a condition I'll show it to you
in the ex so here we have the data and I
need to find the duplicate values here
so I just select this and as I said it's
quite simple go to conditional
formatting home and then go to
conditional formatting and select
highlight cell rules and simply go down
and select the duplicate values okay it
will give you which color you want you
can simply select red or anything as you
see the moment you select you will see
the duplicate values highlighted okay so
I just cancel this and there is another
way then count a function so I'll put
another column where it says duplicate
names and I will put up a counter
function
here okay so let's see how a counter
function works here to check the or find
the duplicate name so as I said I will
put up a formula or function here for
the count F and we'll drag it to other
CES okay count it and uh uh since it's
an absolute uh reference I have to put
up a dollar
symbol okay my reference here will be H
the column here
h
2 okay and again dollar because I'm
using it as an absolute
reference
colon
through dollar symbol
again nine okay so it drags still at the
whole it drags still the all the names
okay the H9 all right and
then what I'll do is I'll put a comma in
why I want to do is I have to select
H2 okay this is my criteria I mean it is
repeating twice all right and I have to
close the parenthesis and if it is more
than one
okay so this is my formula I just put
enter and it should say true so this is
the condition and it is true okay I
simply drag it the whole thing and
whether events is uh repeated yes it's
true Andrew it's a duplicate entry false
Emy is a duplicate entry and it says
true and as you see Emy and events are
duplicate entries so this is how we use
use the cter function and the
conditional formatting to sort duplicate
entries in the
date now let's move on to the last
question for the beginner level and
since we have duplicate entry there is
also a problem to remove duplicate
entries so how can you remove duplicate
values in a range of cells okay to
Simply do that you can delete the
duplicate values in a column by simply
selecting the highlighted cells and
press the delete button so you go in
each column and you see the duplicate
values select it and delete it okay and
this is one tedious way of doing it and
you can also after deleting the values
you can go to the conditional formatting
choose clear rules to remove the rules
from the sheet so this is one way okay
the next thing is again a simple button
that is there in the data tab that is
the is one of the tools present in the
data tab which is simply called as
remove duplicates it's quite simple and
it's there in the data tools let me show
you in the Excel so here we are and uh
we have this data and we need to check
and remove the duplicate so as I said go
to the data Tab and simply click on
remove duplicates and when you click on
it it will ask you you want to continue
or expand the selection I just say
continue with the current selection and
remove duplicates okay select all click
okay two duplicate entries that were
removed previously we saw that events
and uh Anna we there Emy were there so
that has been removed okay so that's it
for the beginner level and we'll go to
the intermediate level in the next
slides choose from over 300 in demand
skills and get access to 1,000 plus
hours of video content for free visit
skill by simply learn click on the link
in the description to know more so here
we are at the intermediate level
questions and these are like higher
level or intermediate level compared to
the previous things that we have
discussed with the basic level questions
uh for the Excel interview so let's move
on to the next thing and so there are
there are some scenarios where you enter
the date or uh some dates in particular
data sheet and you need to find out what
is the day of the week okay so you might
be ask you a question how do you find
out the day of a week for a particular
date so that is the function we we have
a specific function and that is the week
day function to find out the day of the
week for a particular date okay so as we
know these are the seven days of the
week and we just put the function at as
it says equals to weekday and we need to
enter the column or the area or the cell
address here so weekday is the function
and it will give you the which which day
it is of the week okay week as it says
one it denotes Sunday okay and three is
again Tuesday okay so this is the
function that is used to find the day of
the
week so now we move on to the next
one and there is a there might be a
question what are the wild cards
available in Excel so basically Excel
supports three types of wild card which
are asteris the star it represents any
number of characters it can be used in
different formulas and all like
multiplication and all so it represents
any number of characters okay the next
one next Wild card is the question mark
it represents one single character okay
you just need to memorize this in the
back of your mind that it represents one
single character okay whereas asteris is
it represents any number of characters
and the third one which is rarely used
in Excel it is the tiller it is used to
identify a wild card character that is
Tilla ASX question marks in the text
okay and it is very rarely used so you
need to memorize these three things that
the there are three types of wild cards
we can see the functions of these in the
later sessions okay then the next one is
we have a question here what is the data
validation illustrate with an example
you might be asked this question and you
have to know what is data validation
what is what is it used for and you you
should know how to set up in an example
okay data validation is a feature in
Excel that is used to control control
what a user can enter into a cell okay
so you have with the data validation
you're not allowing a data kind of data
that should be input in the cell okay
for example you have the authority uh by
setting up the data validation that you
can enter either a number or a text or a
just number and so on okay using the
data validation and where is it
available it is in the data tab okay
select data validation option present
under data tools okay and you just need
to select the particular cells where you
want to set up the data validation I'll
show you to you in an example so this is
how it looks like you just need to go to
data tools and click on data validation
and it will show you and you have the
options here allow and if you click on
the drop down you will see different
options like I will show it to you in
the example here okay for this
particular thing if I want you know this
column should have only names and it
should have if you insert a number you
will be thrown with an error okay you
will get an error message saying that
this is not a valid option okay so there
are some columns where you have to put
only names or you have to put only
numers so you can set this up with the
data validation technique okay you just
allow it or customize it as per your
requirement so this is how it looks like
when you set up an so here we have set
up a data validation saying that it
should not allow you to put any text
okay so you will get an error when you
put a number here the value does not
match data validation restrictions
defined for this cell okay so here as an
example I have some data where I am
putting the names here and I'll put the
salary here I want to make sure that
that you know we cannot enter any
numbers here okay it should be only text
it should have only name so how do I
perform that how do I restrict any user
to that they should not be able to enter
any number and it should only enter the
text okay so there is a function okay
you just need to go to data validation
click data validation and here in the
settings I'll go to custom there are
different options here you you can
choose whole numbers decimal list date
time so you these are the options and I
go to custom and I'm giving a particular
formula here okay what is that it should
be only text okay so it's a simple thing
it should be text and I need to define
the range okay so how I'll Define the
range I just select this okay and I
select the range
okay
so I have selected the range here and if
you go to input message and error alert
you can customize it and here we are
taking the default one and this is the
input message if you want to set or
customize something okay so let's see
how it works okay I have set this and
then I try to put a number here and it
throws me an error the value you entered
is not valid because we have set a
restriction a user has restricted values
that can be entered into the cell so
this is how the data validation works
okay the next thing is uh you will be
given a situation wherein you have to uh
you will be given data and you have to
fun perform a function like in this
example we are taking a condition
wherein you will have data and you have
to specify the result based on the data
you have to formulate Okay so given
below is a student table write a
function to add pass or fail to the
results column based on the following
criteria you will be given a criteria so
this is the student table you're giving
the student names marks and attendance
and then based on that you will have to
specify a next uh a a formula wherein
you will see the result okay based on
the pass uh student data you have to put
a pass fail result in the column based
on the following criteria what is the
criteria and for example here in this
example what they're saying is you have
to say this the student is passed if his
marks is more than 60 and the attendance
is more than 75% okay so how we perform
this function as it says you have to use
the IF function and check with the and
condition to fill the results column
okay so let's see this in the example
here so here is the example and we will
perform the IF function and check with
the and function so how we do that is
here okay so I have
to put the IF function
here okay and check with the and
function okay and I have to specify the
conditions I have to specify where it
should see the check the conditions okay
so we are checking the conditions here
and the marks should be in row I mean
the column U and it starts with u5 so
let's see
u5 okay it will immediately go to column
U and five row five okay and then what
is the condition we are satisfying here
it should be greater than 60 okay and
the other condition
is uh the column V that is the
attendance column okay and what is the
condition we are specifying V 5 should
be greater than 75
okay and we just close this conditions
with the parenthesis and now we have to
specify the result whether it is pass or
fail
pass comma in codes
again F okay okay so let's see how this
works
okay okay see this works okay the marks
is 50 and attendance is greater than 80
so he is failed because his marks are 50
his attendance must be more than 75 but
yes he is he has not scored marks more
than 60 so we drag the same formula to
the whole thing and you will see the
result okay this is quite simple and you
will see
this formula and using the if and check
and check with and condition okay now
moving on to the next uh question you
might be asked to you know this is
simple function wherein you can you'll
be asked to calculate your age in years
from the current date okay so how we do
that there is a particular function and
it's very simple use the year Frack or
dated IF function to return the number
of whole days between start date and the
end date so you specify a start date
which will be uh today's date and the I
mean the birth day and then the end day
will be today's day for example okay and
you will get to know the age using the
year Frack function and dated IF
function okay so here is a small example
and this is how we use the ear Frack fun
fun okay you specify this uh function
and then specify the input dates that is
the today's dates and the date of birth
and the uh today's date okay and this is
one of the ways to get it and there is
also dated F okay this again it is dat
today function and you specify the input
cells okay so let me show you an example
for the same so here we are and U we
have today's date that is 4 of May and
date of bir for anything it could be so
I will specify the year fragment okay
equals ear rack okay and then I should
as soon as you enter you specify the
start date and the end date okay and I
will specify the start date as today's
date it picks the column and then I put
the comma and then the end dat should be
this thing okay and just close it and it
will give you
the
age okay so this is the age for example
if you want to find out my age I don't
want to reveal my birthday but it's
okay
okay let's see if it
calculates I'm 32 years old okay right
so this is one of the ways and similarly
you can use the dated F function shown
in the example all right now moving on
to the next uh question you have nested
if statements this is very important and
you will definitely be uh coming across
this question how are nested if
statements used in Excel what are nested
if statements the IF function can be
nested I mean it can be Loop when we
have multiple conditions to meet okay it
can be nested the false value is
replaced by another IF function okay you
have specified some condition and you
are uh putting up a condition and if
that condition is not there or not met
then if it will be replaced with another
IF function so uh the syntax will be
like this below is an example so we
actually we use two if statements in
conjunction Okay so here is an example
here we are specifying a condition where
in you know uh the result is excellent
if it is more than 80 and if it is less
than 60 it is bad or average so this is
very simple you perform one if condition
and if that is not met it will go for
the next if condition so we are nesting
to if conditions we are joining two if
statements okay uh I'll show the same
example here in the Excel so here we are
we have some data and the students and
their marks okay and we are specifying a
condition wherein uh if the result or
marks are more than 80 the result is
excellent and if it is less than 60 it
is bad or average okay so how we get
this is we use two if conditions if
statements so uh as we have seen it
if if now the first condition is uh our
source or the source is B2 okay so b 2
and what I'm specifying is it it should
be greater than 80 all right I just
close this and the result should be
excellent
okay
excellent if it is more than 80 and if
this condition is not met it will go to
the next if statement okay we are
nesting another if statement what is the
condition here for the next statement it
will check D2 is less than or equal to
60 you can specify any marks all right
so if it is less than 60 it should give
the result as bad
or average okay specify anything and
you okay and just close the double
parenthesis so let's see how it works
okay see it works like
this now let's pull up the same formula
the for the other results okay see if it
is more than 90 it is 90 it is excellent
so it is checking the first thing if it
is greater than 80 it is excellent okay
now in this case for Mark it is bad why
because it will first see whether it's
excellent or not if it is not excellent
then it will check the other condition
if it is less than 60 it will give you
the a bad result all right and similarly
so on for the other marks all right so
this is how we use the nested if
statements you are adding two if
statements the first condition and the
second condition with another if
statement okay okay when it comes to
excel it is basically involves a lot of
data and a lot of data to be analyzed
and we have some powerful tools which
are used in Excel to analyze the data
one such uh important tool is
descriptive
statistics that is used to to analyze
the data so we might come across a
question and you will be given a data or
a table and you need to find the
descriptive statistics of the columns
using data analysis tool okay so you
will be given us maybe for example
anything and you will have a lot of data
you have to use the descriptive
statistics option in Excel for the data
analysis okay how you do that is you
have to add a pack okay you should be
knowing that you need to add a pack
which is called the analysis tool pack
which you go to uh file options and then
just click on the addin and select the
analysis tool pack click uh Excel addin
and just click go then it will add the
option and then when you select the data
you have to go to the click on the data
analysis option which will be which will
show up when you select the addin or
when you you add the add in okay then
you need to select the descriptive
statistics what we need to do is we need
to analyze this data and it will show
you the values like mean and the you can
also customize you can you see you have
this data and for you to check each and
every row and find the mean the smallest
the maximum number and things like that
so this can be easily done using the
descriptive statistics for the data
analysis uh I'll show the same thing in
the Excel how it can be performed so
here we are and I'll show you first how
to add
the option to it okay go to add in
select analysis tool pack as shown in
the slide and you need to click go if
you just click okay it will not add so
just click go and then you need to
select analysis tool pack okay it will
give you these are the different options
uh for now we are selecting analysis
tool back and then click okay as soon as
you do that you will see the data
analysis this option gets enabled when
you add that pack so this is the data
that you have you need to find or
analyze using the descriptive
statistics so as you see it click data
analysis and click uh select descriptive
statistics okay and it will show up the
option like this and you need to select
the input range okay for some reason
it's already there and if you want me to
show I will show it to your cross you
have to select the whole
data okay this is my input range and you
need to select this labels in the first
row so that you know it doesn't take the
first row okay I'll
show okay and now I'm putting the output
in another worksheet okay you can
specify or you can pry a new worksheet
and these are the options that you can
select you can you are getting a summary
statistics which is the default and you
can select the confidence level that is
the mean value and you can set it up by
whatever value percentage you want and
you are selecting the largest one and
the smallest number so all these data
will get analyzed and it will open up in
a new sheet and just click okay and you
will see this so these are the if you
see this is our data paid organic social
and revenue so this is
uh
okay make it more
precise okay so with a single click all
our data is analyzed okay this is the
mean value and this is the minimum is
zero maximum is this is the total and
the number of count is, so you don't
need to scroll down and check what is
the largest amount that is paid so this
is the largest amount for the paid okay
and so on so the largest revenue
generated all these things are generated
with a descriptive analysis okay
descriptive statistics with a data
analysis tool so the next question is
about a pivot table and this is more
refined or more advanced compared to the
last one that we discussed in the uh
beginner level so here you are asked to
create a pivot table to find the total
cases in each country belonging to their
respective continents you are giving you
are being asked to uh put up a table or
P table with two variables basically
each country and their respective
continent so again we have the same data
and we need to set up a piver table
which shows the continents and the
countries with the respective continents
the number of cases okay so let's see
how we get this in the example so here
we are we have the same data it shows
the days months year cases
countries and their continents okay
continents here and so on okay so I am
I'll go to the insert Tab and select the
payit table okay again the same thing I
will be asked to enter a input range
okay so I select
this and since it's huge I'll
just put the number to be
7777 okay let's
assume now this is our input data and uh
where you want the output to be it's
already selected you can put it anywhere
I'm putting it here okay just click okay
and it will give you the option to
select the fields now what we want is
number of cases okay which will show you
the value and the countries and
territories their respective continents
so okay so this is how it looks like and
we have to check now it is asking us to
find the countries okay so with their
respective continents you see this you
see Africa as a continent and you will
see okay you will see
Africa if you just remove this you will
see the number of I mean the cases with
the uh respective continents and if you
want to include these countries
territories where the respective
continents you will see as such if you
just expand this you will see the
countries that are having the cases in
the continent Africa okay so country
device sorted with the continents okay
this is another Advanced step to get the
data or show the data in the PIV table
okay another question that you might be
ask this is a basic and we have already
seen this in the previous example that I
have shown how do you provide the
dynamic range in data source of a pivot
table you have to select a particular
data source in your input table of to
show up in the piver table so you have
to select the input range but how do you
create or how do you create a provide a
dynamic range in this data source so
just need to create a name table to
provide a dynamic range so where is the
data of your table so as we have seen in
the previous example you will be able to
select the input range and you just need
to put this value any number so that you
know it will pick up the dynamic range
for your input source for the table
okay so now we move on to the next one
and is it about about the pivot table
again is it possible to create pivot
table using multiple sources of data yes
yes you can create a pivot table from
multiple work sheeet sometimes you will
have different data in different sheet
can you create a pivot table for all the
worksheet in a single fav table yes you
can but there is a condition there
should be a common Row in both the
tables so you cannot have different
types of data there should be a common
row okay so then only it will act as a
primary key for the first table and the
qu key for the second table okay so this
is something that you have to remember
and you need to create a relationship
between the tables and then build the
pivot table so you have to analyze what
kind of data it is it should have a
common Row in both the tables on both
the sheets and then you have to
establish a relationship between this
table and then build the table okay
there is a visit for that we'll see that
later now let's move on to the next
question so the next question is again
you know with the pivot table uh wherein
you will be asked to further refine or
you know refine your search and show it
in the data so here we have with the
covid data example again you will be
asked to create a pivot table to find
the top three countries from each
continent based on the total cases using
the co data again and we have done this
before we have created a prev table for
this and we need to further refine it
showing the top three countries with the
number of cases and I will show that
same thing in the Excel and we already
have created a table and we'll refine it
further to show the top three countries
which are having the highest number of
accounts in the respective content so
here we are we have the uh table uh
already leave with us and I just click
on
the show field list it will show me the
countries and territories what we are
asked is you know to show the countries
with the top three that is number of
cases so you just need to go here and
you need to select the value filter
there is a filter which you can select
with the value and now I select top 10
and what I need is top three it's very
simple
and you just need to know these things
okay and based on the Su of cases okay
this is our field already then just
click okay and it will show you the top
three countries so it's quite simple and
it is very important to know this field
and how you play with the value of the
filters for each particular uh field in
the pivot table so it shows you this
things all right and now you can refine
it further with the continents and all
okay so different continents and you can
see this so you go there and there is a
value filter you can set up all right we
have set up a value filter
okay okay now there is another one how
do you create a column in a pivot table
okay like you will be given a situation
where you need to add one more column
and show it in the pivot table with a
particular calculation or with a
particular value and you have you don't
don't have that actual value in your
data but you have to calculate it and
show it across in the table so there is
another option which is called pivot
table analyze and you need to create a
calculated field from pivot table
analyze option so when you go to your
table and then go to pivot table analyze
you will see the option to add a
calculated field okay just go there and
click select calculated field and you
need to Define for in this example we
are going to Define another column where
we calculate the bonus of the sales and
there is a particular formula the
formula is you put an if and statement
and then you calculate the formula you
specify what is the bonus and what is
the way that you calculating the bonus
and it will particularly add it another
column to your table so let's see how we
do that in the table actually so here we
are we have this table and I have
inserted a pivot table and I am putting
it in output
here okay and then you will get the
table okay now you need to select the
customer
name and the unit sold unit price saes
okay so we'll add another column to it
how we do that is this go to rivit table
tools and then you go to analyze Okay
click on field items and set okay you
need to select calculated field here
select that and we are defining a new
field here which is the
[Music]
bonus bonus
and as I said we will put up a formula
for this and we will Define it how we
calculate the bonus okay with then if
and statement which we have seen before
how we uh put up
a and if and statement okay now I'm
going to say it as
a like this sales my sales should be
I'll specify a condition how they will
calculate the bonus if sales is greater
than 4,000
and the unit sold okay I am trying to
put it as the unit sold it also depends
on the units
sold is greater than th000 okay for
example let's say th000 a person who is
uh able to do uh sales of th 4,000 and
the unit sold should be more than th000
then the sales what is this the bonus
will be
sales into that is the amount of sales
he has done into 5% okay let's say 5%
bonus
and
sales
is if it is 2%
okay
okay we are adding this field bonus and
click add okay so we have added this and
we have put up a calculation for the
formula and you will see this in the so
this is simple way of adding the column
to your existing data and we are doing
the calculations and showing it up okay
so this is one way go to pivot table
analyze and field items and sets you can
select this option and add it okay you
can customize this as I said with adding
different fields this is pretty handy in
analyzing the data which does not exist
in the table and you add some value to
your fav table
okay the next uh question will be about
slicer you must be familiar with what a
slicer is in a pivot table and how do
you use it what are the purpose of using
it and how do you put up a slider in the
paper table so how does a slicer work
basically slicers are used to further
filter a data in the P table suppose you
already have some data and it's for ease
that you can do it by just adding a
slicer you can select particular uh data
in or a field and you can see the output
for that particular field that you have
chosen in the slicer okay so it's very
simple go to the insert Tab and select
slicer under filters okay and then it
will be like this okay and here if for
example you see this is our P table we
have added two slicers to filter our
table that is month and countries and
territory so this will be the general
pivot table that looks like and we have
added another two slices that is month
and Country so if you go uh for example
if you want to see what is the number of
cases and some of the deaths for a
particular month and for a particular
country you can just do it by a single
click and it will show that particular
data only in the table let's see and do
this in our Excel okay so there is a
table of pivot table already created for
this and I want to add a slicer so how
do I go ahead and do this is I go to the
options and insert slicer okay the
moment you click on it you will see what
are the options that you want to add you
can select different fields and uh
select the slicer for it uh for this
example we are choosing month okay this
is one of our sliders you can just put
it
here adjacent to the and
again this will be our slider
okay let's add another slicer here okay
and this will be the countries and
territories Okay click on that and you
will see two simple badges here that you
can choose from so if I want to know in
the month of Feb how many number of
cases were there for particular let's
see the moment I choose the month it
will show that particular number of uh
the corresponding table for the whole
and now I want to further refine it to a
particular country so for example
Australia okay so there were total
number of 18 cases and zero deaths at
the same time if I go for Algeria it is
like this
so as you see it goes like this okay so
this is one of the very important tool
that you can use to show the data in a
much simplified Manner and
ease okay so the next question is about
the pivot table again what is the
percentage of contribution of each
country and continents to the total
cases again the same example for our
code the covid one and this time we want
to show the output as the percentage of
contribution for each country and
continents to the total cases so we have
the same data and we generate a pivot
table and we should show it as the sum
of the cases uh to be percentage okay
and this is how we do it this is
our data and I'm going to create a pivot
table for
this okay so it shows the table and here
I have to show what is the fields that
we need to select okay for E we are just
selecting the the cases and the
countries and territories okay
so cases to be the values
okay okay so this is how it looks
like now when I see okay let me show it
to you see it shows the number of cases
now if I just want to refine it further
and see it as number of percentage
percentage as the number of cases okay
so how I do it show field list I go here
and I go to Value field settings okay
then again number format show the value
as
okay
sorry should show the value as you need
to select this thing percentage of grand
total and then just click okay and you
will see this to be the percentage so it
shows the data in the form of percentage
okay this is very simple and you just
need to remember as we have seen before
show field and then value field settings
okay this is the thing that you need to
check okay Grand percentage there are
other options also and you can select
from whatever you want to in this case
we are showing it to be the percentage
okay okay guys now the next question is
about very important aspect of
presentation when we come to Pivot
charts how do you create a pivot chart
in pivot tables this is very basic or
very you know important aspect of pivot
tables that you can represent a data in
a in a form of a chart and there are
different types of charts which I'll
show it to you in the uh example okay so
we have a data here and we want to show
it at in right now it is in a tablet
form okay we have put up a pivot table
for this and now the same thing can be
put up in a pivot chart okay so what you
need to do is go to the insert Tab and
select the pivot chart depends on
different versions of excel that you
have different uh forms or different
buttons so I will show it across to you
and this is how it looks like okay it's
very simple it can be a pie chart it can
be a bar chart it can be different forms
and we can see that in the example here
okay so let's go to the example
and so we have the uh pivot table
generated here already what you need to
do is you need to select the table and
go to insert and see the options there
are there is a column chart there is a
line chart there is Pi Bar area
scattered and other parts okay there are
different forms okay so right now what
we do is we will select the column chart
here okay you need to select the pivot
table and click on the column chart
again there are different forms which uh
can be seen uh in some time now so this
is the basic form okay and it will show
you the countries I mean the it will
show it as a form of a chart okay again
you can change the chart type you can
change it to Pi okay this personally is
very good in presenting or doing
presentation and you can select
different forms different styles okay
will also show you the percentage so
this is one form of presenting your
table into a chart okay again bar type
is also
there so this won't suit here in our
example there are different ones I'm
just showing it to you as how it looks
like so depending on your I mean the
aesthetic you can see and select what
kind of chart is best suitable okay
so this is how you put up a pivot chart
in pivot tables okay so this is then
last for the intermediate level and what
are macros in Excel create a macro to
automate a task basically you have some
daily task that you perform in Excel
okay and you can do this with quite ease
using the macros okay it basically is a
program that resides within the Excel
file and it is used to automate task in
Excel some daily task that you run like
running when you come across in any data
and you have to scrub that data and you
do some daily routines and by removing
some columns or adding some formulas and
you know doing some adding some colors
and changing the form ons or beat
anything that you perform and you have
to do a repetitive task so all that can
be done by recording a macro and this is
what macro is used for in Excel so how
you capture those steps in Excel is
through a macro to record a macro you
can either go to the developer tab in
the Excel and click on record macro or
you can use or access it from the view
tab okay so these are the uh ways to
access macros okay just go to the
developer tab and click record macro
where in you know when you click record
macro it will record the steps that you
performing in each step and it will
capture that and you can save that it is
like a daily routine that you run and
you can do all these multiple steps
maybe n number of steps within a single
click by running that macro later on
okay so you record a macro and run that
okay you do it through the developer tab
go to developer tab and click record
macro and it records all the steps that
you performing okay you need to name it
and you just need to perform the actions
and it will record the macro and you
just save it later on whenever you come
across the same daily task that you run
you can just click it by running that
macro okay B so in a single click it
will perform all the actions that you
have done or steps that you have
performed on that particular Excel sheet
or any other Excel sheet okay this is
very handy when you have similar data
and you do the similar task each day
okay so this ends the intermediate level
and in the next we slides we will see
the advanced level so now we discuss the
advanced level uh interview questions
for Excel and when it comes to the
advanced level you will come across
definitely you will be asked about what
if analysis how does it work how does it
how does what if analysis work in Excel
so what if analysis as the name suggest
uh you have to have an analysis done
okay with the help of different complex
mathematical calculations like formulas
and using different formulas and Cal
calculations you can experiment with the
data and you can analyze if this
particular input changes what will be
the scenario how will your output turn
out to be so as you can see uh it is
about different variables to see how
your changes would affect the outcome of
a situation so this is what uh what if
analysis is and the same thing can be
done with Excel and how it is done is
you need to go to the data Tab and click
on the what if analysis under forecast
okay so there are three options
and one is the scenario manager goal
seek and the data table so these are the
three situation or three tools which are
available in the waterf analysis in the
data tab okay so goal seek is basically
for reverse calculations okay and you
have some idea you have some set goal in
mind and you have certain variables and
what you need to do and what you need to
achieve to have certain set goals okay
you have you will set a value for the
goal and with the goal seek option you
can get to know what value you have to
achieve to come to that level okay so
this is what goal seek is
it is one of the simplest sensitivity
analysis tool and uh so for example you
know that you know a single outcome you
would like to achieve like you have a
set goal that you have to achieve this
particular grade okay and the goal seek
feature in Excel allows you to arrive to
that goal by mathematically adjusting a
single variable within that equation so
you set the goal and you will do the
what if analysis goal will
seek uh option to know what you have to
do or what you have to achieve for the
set
goal the next option is the data table
and it is basically uh used for
sensitivity analysis okay so in this uh
scenario you the data tables allow the
adjustment of only one or two variables
within a data set but uh each variable
can have unlimited number of possible
values okay so basically they are used
for side by side comparisons and it
makes it very easy to read the scenarios
okay one but you need to set up the data
table correctly okay and what you do is
uh you give the input in the table and
then you set up the formula and for
instance you need to calculate the
monthly payments for a loan okay you
provide the principal amount like uh
whatever amount you're taking 2 lakhs
three lakhs and you set the interest
rate in a formula okay and uh you set
the term in and then you need to uh
provide different uh input options like
what loan amount that you're taking and
you set the formula and go to data table
and I mean go to what if analysis and
select the data table stretches across
and then you will see the monthly
payment options or the monthly Emi that
you can calculate there are different uh
things that you can calculate you can
calculate the Target or the sales bonus
or things like that okay giving
different scenarios in the variables
okay but you need to set up a data table
it might be a little challenging but yes
it is a very powerful tool okay so the
next one is the scenario manager it is a
bit more complicated compared to the
other two but then it is uh more
advanced than goal Seeker as it allows
you the uh to adjust the multiple
variables at the same time okay and uh
this is very complicated compared to the
other two and it is even I mean it gives
more better output when it compares to
the other two wtif analysis tools so
here when you go to otif analysis and
the scenario manager you have to select
the data and provide different scenarios
that is different values for each
scenario and then it will create a it
will analyze calculate and create
different scenarios okay so it becomes
very easy for you to analyze what if you
are changing the value of your interest
amount or the uh term of loan or your
targets like uh monthly targets or an
yearly targets and things like that and
you just have to uh see what the
scenario will be when you set this
particular value for
a table or for data whatever targets
that you need to set you can use this
what if analysis in Excel for the
different scenarios and different
calculations okay these are very
powerful tools and you need to know this
now as we move on to the next one you
might be asked what is the difference
between a function and a sub routin in a
VBA okay even though these two are used
quite frequently there is uh pretty much
different from each other okay so a
function always returns a value of the
task it is performing okay so when you
uh writing a module you will have a
function when you have a function it
will always give you a value okay for
example you are performing an addition
it using the function it will give you a
value for sure whereas sub routine it
does not return a value of the task it
is performing functions are called by a
variable okay you can uh set up a
variable and you can call the function
okay where sub routines can be recalled
from anywhere in the program in multiple
types okay in many different phase you
can recall a sub routine like we have
seen uh we write a sub routine and we
put up a button and we can when you
click the button it will recall the sub
routine functions are called by variable
okay you have to set up a variable and
when you enter it it will come up okay
functions are used directly in
spreadsheet as formulas whereas Subs
cannot be used directly in spreadsheets
as formula okay this is very important
difference and the next thing is the
functions can be used to perform
repetitive task and return a value
whereas users must insert a value in the
desired cell before getting the result
of the sub so this is particularly Li
limited okay whereas functions can be
used to perform different repetitive
task and return a value user input is
not required whereas if you see the sub
routines user must insert a value okay
in the desired cell that to in a
particular cell which is defined in the
sub routine to getting the desired
result okay so these are the differences
between functions and sub routines now
the next one is uh what is the
difference between this workbook and
active workbook in VBA so when you work
on modules and different Excel
spreadsheets and workbooks you will have
these different workbooks open and there
is a particular difference and you might
be asked what is the difference between
this workbook and active workbook so as
the name suggest this workbook refers to
the name of the workbook where the code
is actually running from okay you're
running a code VBA code and it is the
actual workbook where you are running
the code code from and that is this
workbook okay and you have multiple
spreadsheets open and you're working on
particular suppose for example you're
working on uh sheet X okay and you
active workbook is the workbook that is
currently active from the different open
workbooks you have different open
workbooks but you are working on one
particular workbook and that is called
the active workbook so this workbook is
the refers to the name of the workbook
where the code is actually written
whereas active workbook is the one that
is currently open currently active Okay
so this is the difference between this
workbook and the active workbook in VBA
as shown in the example this is a simple
uh sub that is written a code that can
be written to find out which workbook is
the uh uh which workbook is the uh this
workbook in the VBA and the active
workbook as well okay so this is a
simple thing that you can run to
determine okay it shows the active
workbook and the this workbook okay
so as we move on to the next one so this
is the question how will you pass
arguments to a vbf function okay there
are two ways basically arguments can be
passed to a VBA function as a value or
as a reference so this is uh an example
that you can see it is by reference the
key word for this is by reference okay
so when you are passing an argument by
reference the keyword should be by RF
whereas uh by value you're specifying a
value and the keyword is by V value okay
so these are the two ways that you can
pass an argument in
VBA so when you pass an argument by
reference in a procedure the variable
itself okay the variable itself is
accessed by a procedure and it is to the
location or the address in the memory
okay the value of the variable is
changed per ently by the procedure in
this case all right okay so to pass an
argument by reference you should use by
ref that is the keyword before the
argument okay so in this example it is
clearly shown what is the keyword that
is being used okay and by reference is
the default in the VBA unless you
specify something else which in this
case is by value okay and as I said the
keyword for by value passing the
argument by value is by V okay so when
you set the keyword by Val the variable
uh what happens is the by value argument
function or argument uh uh is passed
through by value okay the number
function is called here which means it
assigns a value to the variable X here
okay because the variable was passed by
value in the function any change to the
value okay any change to the value of
the variable is only the current
function so it ends after it performs
the function okay then it revert back to
the value when it is declared again
where it is set to zero so if the
variable has been passed by reference in
the function then the variable would
have permanently assumed the new
assigned value so this is the basic
Difference by reference and by value so
now we move on to the next one so there
might be a question that you will be
asked that how do you find the last row
or a column in a VBA okay so to find the
uh last row sometimes you have long list
of uh data and it has like n number of
rows and N number of columns so instead
of scrolling down all together to find
the uh last row you can use this uh VBA
code you can write this code it's a very
simple one and it will give you the last
row you will find the last row with a
single click okay let's see it in the
VBA so here I have a sheet which uh you
