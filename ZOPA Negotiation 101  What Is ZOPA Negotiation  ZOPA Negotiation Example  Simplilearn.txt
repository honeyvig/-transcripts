hello everyone welcome to yet another
exciting video by simply learn
today we are going to discover what
super in negotiation means
we'll also understand how it can be
applied to negotiations in real life
scenarios with the help of an example
so without wasting any further time
let's get started with
that meet steve
he is an outstanding management student
he has been preparing to buy a new
automobile since the last few months in
order to gift his brother on the
occasion of his 19th birthday
stews parents also loved this idea so
they gave 20 000 us dollars to steve
steve also has gathered an extra amount
of two thousand dollars by saving his
pocket money
that means steve can purchase an
automobile worth twenty two thousand
dollars from the market
he started researching about which
vehicle he could buy with that amount he
went through a couple of e-commerce
website and realized that he could
either purchase a good refurbished car
or a brand new cruiser bike
he thought buying a refurbished car
would be a great option so he went to
the ebay e-commerce site and started
discovering good deals
steve came across one great deal which
captivated his interest it was about
jeep's suv wrangler car
marked with a price tag of thirty
thousand us dollars the price of new
jeep wrangler car is roughly around
sixty thousand dollars and this
reconditioned automobile was committed
exactly half of that price tag
so steve decided to get in touch with
the seller in order to discuss about
further process
the amount that steve has is 22 000
dollars and it is 8 000 less than the
committed price hence steve decided to
connect with the seller to bargain about
car pricing
the seller on the other hand was looking
to sell this car around the price range
of twenty one thousand dollars to 30 000
30 000 is the highest value he can get
for this product whereas in the worst
case scenario 21 000 is the least amount
he can profitably agree on
steve's buying range lies around twenty
thousand dollar to twenty two thousand
dollar which means he cannot offer a
price more than twenty two thousand
dollars in the best case scenario twenty
thousand dollar deal will be a deal of
lifetime first day
hence during the negotiation meeting
stew started assessing the range that
seller is willing to sell his product at
the skills such as persuasion active
listening and soft skills that steve
gauge through his management experience
can definitely help him crack that rage
steve also understand that if the
outcome price of the negotiation is
lower than the seller's worst case cost
estimation then he would definitely walk
away from this deal
the possibility of agreement between
seller and steve is there if their
pricing ranges overlap with one another
this feasible area where sellers and
bias range overlap is called as zone of
possible agreement
this is the area where both parties may
find common ground the parties will be
able to compromise and strike a deal in
this region
as mentioned earlier this zone of
possible agreement can only exist if
there is some overlap in what both
parties are ready to accept from an
agreement
in other words you can treat zopa as an
intersection between two sets the one is
bias range and another one is seller's
estimated reservation value
negotiating parties must strive towards
a shared objective and seek an area that
integrates at least some of each party's
views in order to establish this
settlement an agreement can never be
achieved outside of the zone of possible
agreement no matter how much negotiating
takes place hence negotiating parties
must understand each other's
requirements values and interest in
order to establish a solid win-win
agreement if the zopa does not exist in
the case of your negotiation
then it is known as negative bargaining
zone the chance of you reaching an
agreement are almost zero in this case
and at steve's and seller's reservation
range was overlapping they were able to
establish a mutually beneficial win-win
agreement
the outcome of negotiation between steve
and seller was 21 500
which is a win-win outcome for both
these parties as their desires or
objectives have been satisfied
understanding the zopa can assist you
reach a win-win agreement hence before
entering into any negotiation setup you
must evaluate your zopa
that's all we have for today i wish you
the best of luck for your mba journey
and more strategized negotiations
