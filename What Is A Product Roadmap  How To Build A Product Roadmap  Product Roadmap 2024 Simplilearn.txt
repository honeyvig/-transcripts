product Vision actually means if you

complicated explanations like it's the
emotional future idea of a company but
let me make it easier for you your
product vision is basically your big
goal what you want to achieve with your
product or the impact you want to make
for example Elon Musk vision for Tesla
is to become the top car company for the
21st century that's their product Vision
their destination some people mix up
Vision with why of a product but they're
not the same your vision is where you're
headed while the why is the reason
behind aiming for the future in business
we call this reason the mission so if
your vision is where you're going the
mission is why you're going there having
a Clear Vision is very important in
product development for two reasons
firstly it motivates your team and
stakeholders by giving them an exciting
goal to aim for and it helps you to make
smart decisions about what to build and
what not to build with a Clear Vision

direction and make sure everyone is on

free plan next we have got jira which is
a popular tool that can be leveraged for
creating and managing effective product

map out your product road map we will
now discuss how to make a product road
map in Excel today I'm going to walk you
through step-by-step process to build
one using Microsoft Excel let me
illustrate with an example step one the
first thing you'll do is to map out your
overall strategy identify the key
components you need to include in your
road map these could be things like
product phases future releases or team
responsibilities get these main elements
listed out in the column this will be on
the vertical axis of your road map step
two you'll want to set up a timeline
across the top of your spreadsheet the
horizontal axis will serve as a Time
reference for your road map you can
break this down by in months quarters or
any other time increments that make
sense for your project step number three
now it's time to start building out the
visual elements of your road map create
swim Lanes to group related task and
initiatives you can even add sub swim
Lanes to break things down even further
this helps organize a road map and make
it easier to digest at a glance in our
road map example we have listed a few
project steps breaking down the
implementation step into phases that is
phase one phase two and also phase three
step number four within each swim Lane
we'll start add some shapes to represent
the different components of your product
road map go to insert shapes and then
select the shape you would like to
insert step number five draw the shape
by placing the cursor on the needed
position and drag it to draw adjust the
width of these shapes to align with your
timeline and Visually communicate the
timing to each initiative of Milestone
step number six move multiple shapes at
once to do so click on the desired items
after pressing and holding the control
key and drag and drop them into the new
position next next we have format shapes
right click on any shape and then open
the right side format shape menu step
number seven do not forget to add clear
descriptions to your shape double click
on any of the shape and start typing to
provide the details of the element you
want to represent you can even style the
text to make it pop next we have in this
step we will incorporate the key
Milestones into your road map add these
