let's start an introduction to scrumban
the scrumban methodology combines the
iterative Improvement approach inherent
in Canan with the structured framework
of scrum which is rooted in agile
principles this approach encourages team
to consistently enhance their workflows
initially it was adopted by
organizations seeking to move away from
agile iterations scrumban attracted
attention for its full based scrum gos
this amalgamation of scrum and Canan
techniques offers enhanced flexibility
for adapting changes in real time as it
incorporates the strength of both Ganan
and
scrum all right let's talk about the
features of scrum man first is
flexibility there is flexibility in
planning imagine your project as a
puzzle scrum ban makes it feels like you
are putting together puzzles with the
flexible pieces PL change no big deal
scrum banss got your back adapting as
you go then there is task management if
I talk about task management task
management with scrumban is like having
a playground for your to-do list it's
not rigid it's adaptable TS move around
and you can adjust things on the fly
foit in the ever shifting project
landscape then there is timebox
iteration scrumban got a similar Vibe
with the time box iterations it's like
setting these little time boxes for
focused Works keeping things moving
without burning out then there is
continuous delivery magic continuous
delivery is like having a magic vanand
for your project with scrum band you are
waiting until the end you are constantly
delivering and fine-tuning making your
project
evolve then there is self- Task
selection who knows better than you in
scrumban it's not like a top down
assignment it's like you get to Choose
Your Own Adventure Ure you know your
strength so pick up these tars to play
with them it's all about empowerment
okay picture this your project has its
own BFF and it's like the feedback loop
scrumban is all about keeping that Loop
tied constantly checking in adjusting
and learning for each iteration it's
like dance that makes your project
better with every step now let's move on
to the feedback loop picture this your
project has its own bfm it's called the
feedback loop scrum band is all about
keeping that Loop tight constantly
checking in adjusting and learning from
each iteration it's like dance that
makes your project better with every
step so there you have it scrum Bine the
agile super hero that brings flexibility
adaptability and Touch of Magic to your
project management journey I hope so
guys you would have got a brief idea
regarding the scrum pan now let's move
on and discuss about the basics of scrum
scrum promotes self-organizing teams
that continuously assess and adapt while
striving for a shared objective at the
conclusion of each stage a minimum
viable product is produced enabling
teams to gather user feedback and
respond promptly the scrum team is
composed of three key roles the product
owner scrum master and the development
engineering team now let's discuss about
these things first of all comes the
planning let me explain
imagine project planning as an exciting
start of an adventure with scrum it's
like Gathering your team around a map
plotting your course for the upcoming
Sprint it's not just about what you do
it's about how you are going to conquer
it together next comes the Sprint the
heartbeat of the
productivity it's like a time box period
usually 2 weeks where your team focuses
on a set of tasks it's like a mini
marathon sprinting onwards your project
goals with a clear plan in mind next
comes is Sprint retrospect the project
review party after the Sprint it's time
for the Retro spectum the ultimate
project review party you and your team
sit down celebrate victories and figure
out how to make the next Sprint even
better it's like learning from the past
to supercharge the future then the next
one is
transparency the open book of the
projects in the world of scrum
transparency is the key pick picture
your project like an open book everyone
can see what's happening which builds
trust and keeps everyone on the same
page no secret just teamwork next is
your inspection with scrum you are
constantly inspecting looking for clues
or in this case areas to improve it's
not about finding faults it's about
making your project the best version of
itself next is adaptation the project
Shape Shifter ever wanted your project
to be shape shifter
that's scrum for you it's not about
sticking to a rigid plan it's about
adapting to the twist and turns of your
project Journey flexibility is the name
of the game so there you have it a brief
idea regarding scrum the agile mro
turning project management into Dynamic
Adventure filled with planning
strategies sprinting productivity
retrospective celebrations transparent
collaboration and continuous inspection
and adaptive Evolution that was all
about it now let's move on and discuss
about what happens in scrum so basically
first of all you get product backlog
creation next you have is all about
Sprint planning then there is
implementation moving ahead you have a
review and finally you retrospect now
let's move on and discuss about canman
so guys canman is a visual workflow
management method that helps team
efficiently organize and track their
work it is originated from the lean
manufacturing but has been widely
adopted in various Industries including
software development and project
management the key idea is to visualize
work on a board divided into columns
representing different stages of the
workflow tasks or items move through
these columns as the progress providing
a clear visual representation of the
work status Canan emphasizes a pull
system where work is pulled onto each
stage only when there is a capacity
promoting a more flexible and responsive
approach to managing task the method
aims to optimize efficiency minimize
bottlenecks and enhance overall workflow
transparency there are few key things
and first of all is visualization if I
talk about visualization guys it's like
your project storyboard if wish your
project has its own storyboard like
scenes in a movie then Canan is for you
with visualization you get this
beautiful Dynamic snapshot of your
project task move across board telling
stories of progress in real time it's
like seeing your project Journey unfold
right before your eyes then there is
pull system the Queue at your favorite
coffee shop think of pull system like
standing in a line at your favorite
coffee shop and when your order is ready
they make it fresh for you in Canan
tasks are like your coffee order the
team pulls them when they are ready to
take on the new work it's efficient just
like getting your favorite latte without
the weit next comes is working progress
limits imagine juggling but with a Twist
Canan introduces WIP limits like saying
hey you can juggle these balls at a time
and no more it's about overwhelming
yourself or the team instead it's about
keeping a manageable Pace finishing what
you have started before grabbing more
it's like secret source for your study
progress so Canan is the visual
Storyteller the pull system magician and
the WIP limit enforcer it's like turning
project management into a well
choreographed dance visualize pull when
you need when you are ready and juggle
task with fin so that was all about
Canan dance I hope so guys you would
have got a brief idea regarding this now
let's move on guys and discuss about how
does scrumban combine scrum and Canan
the scrumban is like a love child of
scrum and Canan it was born because team
wanted to switch Thing Up full from
scrum to a more canun style group and
you know what it's because bit of
Superstar because it Cherry picks the
best bits from scrum and Canan for
maximum awesomeness or performance now
in the scram ban world it's like scrum
party with a can ban twist let's see how
these things mixes up so from the scrum
side it's something like this we have
got these Cool Fix time parties called
iteration where the team reviews and and
struds their stuff regularly if I talk
about task planning that's a
personalized Affair considering the task
complexity and the Sprint
duration next it's something like
backstage p with segmentation on demand
the team picks up the next task without
compromising the
quality before the creative magic starts
there's a quick check for the ready Vibe
you know making sure everyone's on the
same page before diving in and finally
picture this a q sandwich between
between backlog and the doing it's like
the VIP sections for the task only I
hope so you would have got an idea what
people on the scrum side are doing now
from the canans corner something like
the pull system have you ever heard of
it it's like inviting task to the party
only when the team's ready no forceful
entries here then there is this rule
about not overcrowding the dance flow
limits on the work progress keep the
vibe just right not too crowded and not
too empty
if we talk about roles well they are bit
free Spirits in Crum man now let's talk
about these pointers the first one is
flexible planning with Sprints it's like
tailoring a suit scrumban gives you the
power of flexible planning especially
with Sprints it's like tailoring a suit
you have the structured plan thanks to
scrum but can adjust the fit as needed
no need to extend a Sprint or add more
task scrumb nods and says sure thing
that what happens with the flexible
planning in Sprints next we have is the
visualization on the Canan BS it's
something like your Project's visual
story board picture your project as a
visual story board with a Canan boards
scrumban brings the best of
visualization like having your project
story unfold before your eyes tasks move
across the board giving you a real time
snapshot of progress It's like seeing
your project come to life then we have
the continuous delivery and flow a river
of progress next we have continuous
delivery and flow is something like your
project doesn't wait for a big reveal it
constantly
delivers it constantly delivers ensuring
a continuous and smooth flow next you
have work in progress limits something
like juggling with a Twist canbar
introduces WIP limits in scrumb like
saying hey you can juggle these balls at
a time and no more it's not about
overwhelming yourself or the team
instead it's keeping a manageable Pace
finishing what you have started before
grabbing more it's the secret source for
the stady progress I hope so guys you
would have got a brief idea regarding
how does scrum man combine scrum and can
bang so guys we will discuss how does
scrum bang Works based on these pointers
such as the backlog management then
Sprint planning with the Canan boards
next is your time box iteration and
finally the visual management let's talk
about the first one that is the backlog
management okay if I talk about the
backlog Management in scrumban is like
having a too list for your project you
have got this backlog of task
prioritized and ready to go it's not a
chaotic mess it's a Well organized road
map for what's next next is your spring
planning with a Canan boards visualizing
your Sprint Journey imagine planning
your Sprint using Canan boards scr B
brings this visual element to the Sprint
planning it's like laying out a map of
your Sprint Journey task move across the
board making Sprint planning not just a
meeting but also a visual experience
next comes is your visual management
your Project's Art Gallery visual
Management in scrumban turns your
project into an art gallery Canan boards
charts and graph became the masterpieces
that tell the story of your Project's
progress it's not just about data it's
about about creating a visual narrative
that everyone can understand I hope so
guys you would have got a brief idea
regarding how does scrum band works now
let's move on and discuss about when a
team should use the scrumb band A team
may choose to use scrum band when they
find themselves in a situation that
requires a balance between structure of
scrum and the flexibility of canbar so
guys here are eight pointers to consider
when deciding to use scrumb the first
one is continuous delivery goals teams
aiming up for the continuous delivery
and the ability to release increments of
the product and more frequently may find
scrumban beneficial it allows for the
iterative release of the features within
the time box Sprints next is desire for
visual management teams that benefit
from visualizing their work on Canan
board to enhance transparency and
collaboration May opt for scrumban the
visual representation help track tasks
identify bottlenecks and ensures a
smooth workflow next is the self-
selection if a team values autonomy and
prefers self- selection approach for the
task where team members can choose their
work based on expertise and capacity
scrumban supports this
flexibility now next is the changing
priorities if a team frequently
experiences changing priorities or has
Dynamic environment where requirement
evolve scrumban flexibility allows for
easier adaptation to these changes
without disrupting the workflow next one
is we have variable workloads scrumban
is suitable for teams with the variable
workloads the capacity to add or
reprioritize the task within Sprint
allows for a more adaptable response to
fluctuating demands the next one we have
is focus on continuous Improvement teams
committed to continuous Improvement and
use of metric to enhance their processes
can benefit from scrum bands it
iterative nature regular feedback loops
and retrospectives are integral to scrum
bands approach next one is limited
planning constraint if a team desires
planning approach that is less
constrained by fixprint commitments and
allows for more Dynamic task planning
scrum band's ability to adjust
priorities within Sprints can be
advantageous and finally we should have
an experience scrum team teams with
experience in scrum may find it easier
to transition to scrum ban as it retains
some scrum elements such as time box
iteration while introducing the
flexibility of Gan ban ultimately what I
would say guys team should consider
their specific context project
requirements and the desired balance
between structure and flexibility when
deciding to adopt scrumban it's
important to continuously assess with
the scrumban alliance within the team
evolving needs and goals I hope so you
would have got idea when you should use
scrumban now let's move on and discuss
about pros and cons of scrumban if I
talk about pros of scrumban the first
one that comes into my mind is
flexibility and adaptability scrum ban
provides a balance between structured
nature of the scrum and the flexibility
of canva this allows team to adapt
quickly to changing priorities or
requirements during a Sprint fostering
agility and response to the evolving
project needs next one we have
continuous delivery scrum B supports
continuous delivery by allowing teams to
release increments of the product within
the time box Sprints this promotes a
more iterative and frequent delivery
model compared to the traditional scrum
next one we have is visual management
the use of visual boards in scrumban
enhances transparency and collaboration
teams can easily track task identify
bottle lengths and maintain a clear
overview of the work and progress thus
promoting efficient communication next
next is autonomous task selection team
members have the autonomy to self-
select tasks based on their expertise
and capacity this promotes a
collaborative environment and efficient
task allocation thus leveraging the
benefits of both scrum and Canan and
finally we have enhanced focus on
continuous Improvement scrumban
encourages regular feedback loops and
retrospectives fostering a culture of
continuous Improvement team can analyze
metrics and make adjustment to enhance
their processes and overall performance
now let us discuss about the cons of
scrumb the first one is complexity in
implementation transitioning from
traditional scrum or can band to scrum
band can roduce complexity teams May
face challenges in Striking the right
balance between scrum and Canan
practices requiring careful planning and
adaptation the next one is there's a
potential for overlapping rules the
flexibility in task selection may lead
to potential role overlaps where team
members with similar skill set pick up
the task interchangeably this could
impact Clarity in responsibilities and
accountability third one is risk of
reduced planning structure scrumb
flexibility might lead to reduction in
the structure planning associated with
the scrum this can pose a challenge in
terms of predictability making it harder
to plan and commit to specific
deliverables within a fixed time frame
fourth it requires skilled team
collaboration successful implementation
of scrumban relies on effective
collaboration and communication among
the team members if the team lacks
strong collaboration skills or
experiences difficulties in self-
selection it could hinder the
effectiveness of scrum band finally
there is a potential risk for the
project getting bigger than planned the
ability to add or reprioritize task
within a Sprint may increase the risk of
scope if not managed carefully without
clear boundaries the team might struggle
to maintain focus on the original Sprint
goals staying ahead in your career
