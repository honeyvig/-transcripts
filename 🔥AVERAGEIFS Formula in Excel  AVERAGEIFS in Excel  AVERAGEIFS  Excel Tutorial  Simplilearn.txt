let's get started with our onepoint
agenda that is average ifs in Excel so
average if is basically an average
function but with an if condition let's
say if you have multiple departments in
your industry or in your office and your
HR asked you to find the average salary
of all the employees who are present in
a certain Department let's say
development team then you might have to
create a new table with all the
employees in the development team and
then find out the average but what if I
say there is one such average formula
which comes with a condition called if
and using a combination of average and
if you can find out that average number
just within a few clicks yeah that's
exactly what we are going to do today so
for that let's get back to Excel
spreadsheet where we have the data set
ready so this is our employee data set
and here we have the same use case we
have a lot of people from a lot of
designations or a lot of departments now
let's try to find out the average salary
of all the employees who are present in
development team so the formula is
really simple equals to average F and
range comma you want the value as to be
present as department so we will be
adding it in between double codes so
development close and get now the salary
range select the salary column press
enter there you go so the average value
of or average salary of the employees
present in development team is around
38333 per or per month if you're
considering this in rupees this could be
per month if you're considering this in
terms of dollars it can be per anal and
that's how you use average F in Excel
and with that we have come to the end of
the session on how to use average F
function in Excel if you have any
queries regarding any of the topics
