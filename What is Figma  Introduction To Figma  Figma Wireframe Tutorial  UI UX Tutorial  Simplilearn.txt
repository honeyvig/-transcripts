apps and websites in figma and will give
you step-by-step instruction you can
literally follow Click by click I will
only tell you the stuff that you need to
get started designing interfaces so
let's get started
so we are going to look at the tool
called figma and it has a few advantages
but most importantly for you it's free
to get started if you are working by
yourself feel like using it at smart
because it has also really good
collaboration so we can have multiple
people working on the same design file
at the same time at its really very fast

YouTube channel so you will never miss
an update from Simply learn I wanted to
start off with the templates so what I
want to do now is create a triangle for
my own design and it will call as frame
so the first tool you need to know about
is the frame here or you hit the apps on
your keyboard or anything I press will
show here in the bottom left corner so
you know exactly what I pressed to
activate a particular tool and then I
can start drawing a size but I know if I
look at the frame here I click on that
it shows
I can hit F again to go into the frame
mode and then I can select from here A
bunch of templates and I will select
iPhone Pro Max
and then it automatically puts in the
frame of a particular size and I will
just place here and I will start
designing so let's assume I want some
different color background right so the
easiest way I could accomplish this is I
could draw a rectangle I could do from
here you can see that there is a
rectangle tool and it already says like
R next to it so I'm going to hit r on
the keyboard and draw a rectangle right
so I don't want to take it up foreign
this is fine now I can see by default
this is dark color so I will click on it
and so here is I say whatever like I can
select the color
fine
foreign
to make it more attractive for the right
under the position and the dimension so
if I want to change this
this is just a changing Y coordinates
and
this is for
sorry this is for the Y coordinates and
this is for the x coordinates
you can see the dragging yogurt says see
the cursor turns in the sideway arrows
and I can click and just drag left and
right change these values or I can type
them in the right I can also change the
width and the height
foreign
ERS radius right so the rounding effect
is there so I can
use that
so with the arrows
the surrounding effect
and
Corner radius
suppose it must be 29 or 39
39.
and I will keep this also by 39
so we can see
this and this Corners are giving the
round effect
so if I change 0 you will see there is
no longer around it and if I want
to keep the top rounded but not the
bottom then I can change the bottom ones
right and now it looks good now the next
thing I have to create
is a circle
thank you
is from the shape menu you have an
ellipse which you can do also use with
the letter o
on your keyboard now by default you will
be able to draw any kind of circle with
any aspects of ratio
now let's change the color of the circle
you will often need when designing
mobile interfaces because you are you
will want to have an icon for home
screen or something like that and you
can literally Google free figma icons
after searching uh this page will open
and let's say I want to copy this one
and I come back to my file and I will
paste the element
and sigma also helps you to with
positioning it automatically centers
things and let's say what I wanted to
get an image here for the interesting
instead of the blank color so one good
website is called unsplash
here I just write
food
and I will get the image
and save it
we will copy that and paste it over here
yeah I hit the command V to paste and I
just can reposition
this
now the thing that I need to text here
that says non-contact deliveries and the
way I get the text is through the T icon
here and I can just hit the T on my
keyboard and text
no none
please
so we will change the font by double
clicking
we will change the font of the text in
SF Pro text
foreign
foreign
little small
foreign
paragraph here below so I will hit the
icon T again
we can add something related to our food
foreign
as small
something like and we'll make it in the
mid
foreign
so now I'm gonna have a button for order
now so for that I will hit the keyboard
again with the T
repeat
have rectangle for
so now I'm gonna have a button for order
now for that I will have the rectangle
so I will hit r
and I'll make one rectangle over here
and make it in the center
I will pick one color for that
if you can steal the corner radius and
so I said order now text
and I will make it in the mid
I will just
Center this
and make it and let it be white and this
is very easy and now I will just write
another text for
dismiss
foreign
so starting with a template we had make
our Splash first page for food delivery
app in Sigma
