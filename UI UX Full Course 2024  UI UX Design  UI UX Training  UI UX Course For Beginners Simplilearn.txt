description box to find a uiux program
that fits your experience and areas of
Interest so the user interface or user
experience design or also known as uiux
is the process of creating digital
products with a user first approach the
goal of uiux design is to provide a
product that is both aesthetic and
extremely pleasurable to use it is a
common idea that UI and ux are
essentially the same thing and belong to
the same discipline but that is not
totally
accurate they are separate FS that
concentrate on different aspects of the
user interaction with a digital product
however they are closely related and
overlap in so many ways that they are
largely merged into one profession so to
start off with let's have a quick look
at the agenda for today's session we
will start off by understanding what is
UI ux we will move on to what skills do
UI ux designers need and what are their
tasks next we will see the difference
between UI and ux then what are the
research techniques in UI ux and how
they work together and what are the
disadvantages of combining them vote so
I hope I made myself clear with the
agenda
now what is user experience and user
interface is our first topic let's get
going so how a person will engage with a
product understanding your users's
complete journey and translating it into
a product the interaction of human user
with daily products and services is the
subject of ux design it includes user
engagement user engagement would come up
if you were to summarize the aim of your
user experience efforts they maintain a
connection with their user interests
motivations and Ambitions through
engagement next objectives objectives as
in the industry ux design seeks to
increase consumer satisfaction and
loyalty through the usability Simplicity
of use and enjoyment provided in the
engagement with a product ux refers to
the complete user experience that
customers receive with a product by
evaluating products usability we can
tell whether consumers can execute task
successfully and quickly good usability
is the basics for a successful user
experience and it is frequently confused
by user experience and the Simplicity of
use a part of user experience ux design
is usability usability is the second
level of user experience therefore you
must address your product's usability
once you've established that it can and
resolve users problems the degree to
which a designer's features fit users
demands and situations determines how
usable the design is and usability
involves
navigation the discipline of creating
analyzing and implementing ways for
users to navigate through a website or
app
familiarity next is
consistency a usable and userfriendly
design always provides a consistent
experience
followed by that we have error
prevention alerting a user when they're
making an error with the intention to
make it easy for them to do whatever it
is they are doing without a mistake next
we have feedback feedback is used to
engage and explain and can improve the
user
satisfaction followed by that we have
visual Clarity visual Clarity is the
measure of how effectively visual design
prioritizes and conveys information
information lastly we have
flexibility it is about knowing your
customers and giving flexibility for
different customer intents now that we
have brief understanding of what ux is
let us understand what is
UI UI or user interface the point of
human contact and interaction on a
device is called user interface this can
include desktop display keyboards mice
and other pointing devices it also
refers to the manner in which a user
engages with a website or application in
other words they design the user
interface of a website or app after
knowing what is user interface we will
see the different types of user
interface first we have command line
interface or CL line CLI enables users
to input commands into a terminal or
dashboard window in order to commun Comm
unicate with a piece of software and it
is a platform or Channel where users
respond to a visible prompt by typing a
command and receiving the system's
response next we have GUI or graphical
user interface graphical user interface
enables people to engage with just an
operating system using Graphics in the
graphical user interface there are menus
like Windows scroll bars buttons Wizards
painting pictures alternative icons and
much more it is simple to understand and
natural the user is shown or given
information in any format including
plain text videos photos Etc followed by
that we have touch graphical user
interface a touch graphical user
interface can be used with either the
user's fingerprints or a stylus to
control Graphics this can be done on a
desktop computer laptop or a portable
device like mobile phone touchcreen
graphical user interfaces are
increasingly used in hospital situations
and provide both patients and healthcare
workers with a number of
advantages there are a lot of skills
required for both UI and ux let's have a
look at those skills skills ux designers
need due to the nature of their
work ux designers require a
technological skill set such as design
or development with programs like sketch
caused by defect and adob XD successful
ux designers have had the following soft
talents or abilities let's discuss the
different skills for ux
designers in addition to hard
capabilities are research problem
solving and communication research
research is a fundamental skill
designers must derrive useful insights
from the data they gather both in early
stages and during the real world testing
next we have problem solving and in a
process called Dynamic ux designers look
at a variety of methods to solve a
single user problem they not only fix
difficulties during prototypes but they
also continuously develop and improve
goods or services to make them more user
friendly finally we have communication
because ux design is indeed a highly
collaborative process communication is
essential this includes being able to
effectively communicate within the team
and to customers about the user's needs
and requirements when using the
product now let's discuss about the
skills that UI designers need to work as
a UI designer they must need some hard
skills UI designers must keep up with
current trends methods and Technologies
to grow they must be familiar with
design Aesthetics user interfaces and
brand design layouts and other aspects
of graphic design they must also know
how to use graphic design and
wireframing software there are some of
the following skills required to become
a UI designer creativity the only way UI
designers can effectively fix problems
is by coming up with novel ideas since
imagination is a part of creativity
businesses seek out creative individuals
teamwork and communication the user
interface designer must work work well
with others they collaborate closely
with product Architects and web
developers so clear communication is
essential for a successful end
product adaptability technology evolves
at a rapid Pace to consistently develop
their products and services good UI
design Embraces changes and keeps on top
of the industry Trends after knowing the
skills required for ux and UI designers
we will look into their different tasks
ux designers ux designers start by
researching in-person interviews are
frequently the first step in user
research these conversations allow them
to have a better understanding of the
users's motives and problems user tests
are also conducted by the designer to
observe the user activity they improve
and deliver the greatest possible user
experience by detecting both verbal and
non-verbal stumbling obstacles such
tasks done by ux designers are user
understanding analyze interaction and
wireframing or prototyping so the first
one is user
understanding the depth research is
typically the first step in new design
with the aim of understanding the
audience their needs and wants a key
competency for us designers is empathy
it aids ux designers in comprehending
and revealing the hidden wants and
reactions of the target
audience next the analyze interaction
designers of user experience examine how
users interact with things including
their routines preferences and shortcuts
better design Solutions are proposed
during all the available insights and
the last one is prototyping a prototype
is a model or a trial version that you
teams use for testing before launching
it seeks to test and validate ideas
before sharing concepts with
stakeholders and ultimately handling of
the final versions to design Engineers
with the development process ux
designers are always active in how a
product is put together to make sure the
design is going in a proper direction
they communicate with each team member
now after knowing task done by ux
designers we will look into UI designer
task
UI designers the web designer is in
charge of creating how the product is
set out graphically once the ux team has
completed their process and handled over
a wireframe they must of course design
from the users's perspective this
includes understanding interface design
and implementing basic design principles
it also entails selecting fonts menu
designs buttons icons and other elements
with care to both Express the brand and
satisfy the user there are several tasks
done by UI designers and the first one
is testing in general UI testing
sometimes referred to as testing is a
process designed to test the features of
any product that the user will interact
with typically this involves doing test
on the visual components to ensure that
they are performing and functionally in
accordance with the
specifications communication typically
the technical team ux design ERS and UI
designers collaborate closely
communicational abilities are needed to
grasp technical viability wireframing
one of the most important processes in
uiux design is wireframing this involves
modeling the framework of digital
applications a wireframe is a product
outline that shows what software
components will be present in important
Pages it is an essential step in process
of design interactions now we will see
the difference between you
iux two of the terms used in web and
application design that get mixed up and
confuse most are ux design and UI design
and that makes sense on the surface they
appear to be describing the same thing
because they are frequently combined in
face uiux design but don't worry we will
try to understand the basic differences
between UI and
ux user experience relates to the users
experience of the product or service
whereas UI refers to the visual
components through which humans connect
with a product therefore ux focuses on
visual interface elements like fonts
colors menu bars and much more whereas
UI focuses on user and their experience
with the product after knowing the
difference of ux UI we will see the
research techniques in both UI ux the
practice of gathering information from
actual users in understanding their
demands and trouble areas is known as
user research there are the following ux
research techniques user Persona a user
Persona is a fictionalized picture of
average user the objective of this is to
assist ux designers to develop Solutions
with particular Target user in mind as
opposed to a general one user interviews
user interviews are a great method to
get user data learn why users encounter
certain issue and determine whether your
design fulfills their needs next surveys
A specific group of users is sent a set
of questions by designers as a part of
ux research survey to learn more about
their attitude and preferences now we
will see the research techniques of UI
designers research ensures that user
wants and expectations are taken into
consideration while designing user
interfaces which is is typically the
very first stage in the process after
the user experience has been established
the UI design process begins the best
color schemes patterns and other visual
components must be determined by UI
designers this makes it possible for the
UI designers to get ideas and ensure
that the design components they select
are in line with users choices and
needs now we will see how they work
together while UI and ux design involve
quite distinct technical skills they are
both majorly elements that must work
together to provide the optimal user
experience without a proper ux design a
beautiful UI design might become clumsy
and complicated to navigate
understanding the users demands should
be the first step in any front-end
design and development
process now after this we will see the
disadvantages of combining them
both it's almost like wearing two hats
at once when you have a combined UI ux
function UI and ux designers have
diverse skill sets even though most
firms advertise a ux UI function as a
single unified rule its main focus way
of looking at things and approach to
prototyping a product are very different
it might be difficult and reduce the
amount of focus needed for each
discipline in a mixed uiux rule to
constantly trans transition between
ideas and representations when you visit
a restaurant what's the first thing that
comes to your mind you look around the
furnishings and fixtures and then feel
the ambience around you similarly when
you visit a website you look at the ease
of usage and experience that Comfort
involved while using the application to
simplify it further with the same
restaurant example the food menu the
services the ambience music taste and
the restaurant environment can be
considered user experience or ux you are
all already watching simply learn and
today we bring this informative video
about yousign before we begin if these
are the types of video you like to watch
then hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to get notified and if you are
a tech geek here is a pre teaser for you
who call the concept of ux design is it
Alan K T Norman John wner or Dylan Fe
let us know your answer below and get a
heart from Simply learn without any
further delay let's get started with the
session on what is ux design ux design
creates software or desktop application
considering the an user expectations and
requirements it's the process of
creating a steam LM experience whether
digital or physical that customers will
find practical simple to use and
enjoyable to interact with it involves
improving the user experience of the
consumers when dealing with your product
and ensuring they give you good feedback
on what you offer the thought process of
constant iteration and ideology to to
enhance the user interaction with the
application and its service can be
termed as ux design there are many
factors involved with ux design but the
three most important ones are usefulness
usability and desirability if you sum up
all these three factors we can design a
great ux or user experience first come
the usefulness of ux the primary focus
of a ux design should always beond the
application usability our website become
dominant only when it's simple to use
Serve the purpose and proves beneficial
to the user next come the usability of
ux this factors usefulness and usability
may sound the same still the parameters
considered in usability revolve around
the effectiveness efficiency and
performance of the application and it's
calber to handle multiple user requests
at the same time without crashing the U
designer must ensure the application is
strong enough to easily serve
multi-users environments and the last
one is desirability that plays a key
role in uxm the visual Aesthetics of
application engage desirability in users
since the application need to complete
with several other similar applications
higher the desirability better the
application look at all the products
around you think about usefulness
usability and desirability and see which
one has a better ux next we will discuss
what will make the user experience
better let's see some examples one of
the most helpful employe on boarding
checklist is provided by LinkedIn how
would you go about looking for work or
hiring new people as LinkedIn helps in
recruiting new people easily and it's
relatively easy while opening a LinkedIn
account we notice how the website keep
offering suggestion to improve our
LinkedIn profile and use the tool more
effectively it can be either by adding
relevant skills acquired certification
or just connecting with people in our
domain to create a network and we recall
completing them because they seem
important and will give our profile
better visibility in this case is
LinkedIn is a success let's take a look
at another example Spotify completely
modified personalization Spotify rep
deserve a market oford one thing is
obvious with r daily mixes and the most
recent addition the Bland tool that
enables you to combine your music and
create a playlist with your friends
nobody does personalization better than
Spotify spotify's ux is different since
it offers the customization that we all
desire in 2022 the Spotify user
experience include not only
customization but also how the software
revolves around the idea of personal
music they retain users on app by
creating a loop of personalization music
while constantly recommending music you
may like with daily suggestion I
recommend playist this helps create a
musical experience that other platforms
strive to replicate user experience one
of the industry's trending themes you
should be more familiar with the
complexities of user experience if you
are in the design profession so far we
have seen the big picture of ux design
now let's look into more details about
the process and what steps are required
to have a good ux design so the first
one in the process is to understand this
is one of the most important procedure
in the ux designing for the product te
before creating anything in the market
because understanding the product
context is more important before
designing it this phase of understanding
gives you the foundation for the design
process next is the ability to research
after brainstorming IDE
the product team moves the application
to the research phase then the designer
conducts thorough research identifies
the problem and comes up with a better
solution the research phase can be
classified into two categories market
research and user research market
research is checking out similar
products available in the market and
understanding their unique features that
make them stand up user research will be
given a higher priority and will form a
base of your product by hosting test
groups and conducting service this
information will help you discover user
expectation and serve a better design
platform up next we have design at this
phase the product team start working on
activities that involve constructing
Mups images icons colors and Etc the
design phase include creating
prototyping wireframes and sketches but
the wireframe is among the most
important aspects you can produce a wif
frame is an extremely simplified
representation of your product the next
one is testing this phase determine how
the market uses your service and product
for example if you were the swigy app
designer you might ask your user to use
the app and place an order you may have
seen how users respond to app while
ordering the food you can qu them about
their experience once they have finished
this is an excellent chance to determine
how satisfi your user is with your app
and whether it meets their demands
should there be any concern those can be
rectified right away before the product
hits the market Market finally we will
look into evaluation the benefit of
getting users feedback is to compare the
ideas and assumptions you develop you
can utilize this input to make change to
your product or think of the brand new
features you may have yet to consider as
we learn more about the ux is being
received by the general public the team
can work on the further improving the
base to create the best version of your
product after understanding the basics
of ux design are you ready to start
practicing on your own and start
mastering a design tool now let's pick
out two tools one is figma and it has a
very generous free plan you can work on
it using all the features completely and
it has some collaboration features that
if you are working with someone you can
work on the same design file
simultaneously it can work directly on
the browser making it platform
independent while also having dedicated
apps for certain operating systems
another option is Adobe HD adobe's
Creative Cloud offers a synchronization
features with other Adobe products which
can be very much helpful when working
with large projects with a very large
customer base and readily available
support from Adobe there is a huge
collection of templates and project
ideas that can be used directly in Adobe
XD with minimum first you can find a
link for our detailed tutorial on how to
use figma in description that will get
you started with the platform without
any U basic knowledge hey everyone and
welcome to Simply learns YouTube channel
you're already watching simply learn and
today we bring you the informative video
about Adobe XC tutorial this tutorial is
designed for learning your I design
using Adobe XC it is very useful for UI
and uxix designers graphic
designers and the other professionals as
a is leading and training the market
among the UI designing tools available
because of its many Advanced features
and tools before we begin if these are
the videos you like to watch then hit
that subscribe button and the bell icon
to get notified
and if you are a tech geek here is a
brain teaser for
you who coin the concept of adobe
XD the first one is Don Norman talin
wsor Dylan field or is it Raymond ly let
us know your answer below and get a hard
from Simply learn without any further
delay let's get started with the session
now let's take a quick look at the
agendas first here we cover the basics
and advanced topics of adobe XE first we
will start by understanding what Adobe
XC is we'll then review some of the
Adobe X's Advanced features then we'll
see how prototyping Works in Adobe XT
lastly useful tips for Designing and
creating image graphics and web designs
in Adobe XD with top use cases what is
Adobe XD Adobe X is a powerful and
trending design tool that is easy to use
and a vector-based software tool for
Designing digital designs and
prototyping UI in uix that gives the
tool that a developer needs to develop
the world's best experience
collaborative Adobe ex is designing the
UI or uxix for web applications mobile
applications and many applications it
also provides an ideal way to create
assets for different applications Adobe
ex is provided and managed by Adobe Inc
it comes for Mac OS operating system and
windows only we cannot use it in Linux
based operating systems it creates a web
based link that can be open using any
web browser but Adobe XT becomes the
most useful tool before Adobe XD the
photosho tool was widely used for design
purposes but Photoshop doesn't have a
user experience this disadvantage of
Photoshop design makes Adobe XE the most
efficient design tool as we have an
application for user experience its
prototyping and animation features give
if the application a complete virtual
tool the best thing about Adobe ex is
that it provides a user interface for
design each tool in Adobe XD has optimal
options making it incredibly simple to
utilize as a result it saves the
designers a huge amount of time on the
same project designers make various
places can simply work together team
members can watch and provide comments
and suggestions through commenting and
pinning directly from their browser
using the link sharing tool now we will
see what are the advanced features of
adobe XD Adobe XD has a wide range of
extensive and Powerful features and
applications that makes it an essential
tool for any ux designer some
highlighted features of adobe XS are the
first one is components and States
second padding and
stacks the third one is repeat grid and
the last one is responsive resear so the
first one is components and States these
are Advanced features that photoshop
doesn't support components allow the
creations of it once and then can use it
multiple times in the same existing
project providing features to the
applications when building certain
Design Elements like buttons and
navigations and maintaining the
alignments across our design components
are helpful changes we make to the
primary components will also affect the
supporting components therefore it will
be helpful for design changes and for
the stats as opposed to components are
also effective approach to making the
design functional we can preview our
variations on a single components thanks
to States States can be used to design
produce effects like
hover click toggle and many more and it
is helpful to create and design cleanly
by reducing the number of artboards for
example instead of developing a new
artboard for a drop down menu we can
construct one using a click state so the
next one is padding and stacks these are
also some Advanced features of adobe XD
that are not available in other
designing softwares like photoshops and
are useful features of adobe XT it is
very helpful when working with Dynamic
content such as buttons and
labels and managing content sections and
exploring design it will save
significant time and effort and provide
a well organized design structure and
the third one is is repeat grid repeat
grid is also one of the excellent
feature of adobe XD and also one of the
best feature of adobe XV by using a
feature of a repeat grid we can easily
cop up with the same layout multiple
times it can be used in building the
images data tables image
Galleries and other things it takes a
long time to design these UI components
the repeat grid functionality could save
our lives in such circumstances we may
turn on the repeat GD for a certain
items with just one click using the
repeat slider we may repeat any objects
or collections of object once the repeat
grid features is enabled the text and
graphics on the repetition grid can also
be
modified and the next one
is responsive freiz the world is full of
different types of EEG gadgets
smartphones smart watches and TV so
while working with the design we must
ensure UI compatibility for all sizes of
devices the responsive resize features
allow us to automatically understand the
design for a new device and fit the
design in there are several other
explosive and intelligence features of
adobe XC that allows us to choose Adobe
XC over any other graphic designing
software to understanding some of the
features of adobe XC we will see how
prototyping Works in Adobe XE Adobe XE
supports dynamic and interactive
prototyping for the design to interact
with different layouts we can add
animation transitions to stimulate the
flow of the application we provide a
realtime preview of the application
using the Prototype features of adobe XT
we can experience a virtual toour of the
application the Prototype can be shared
with the team and stakeholders through a
web link the team can experience a
complete preview of the applications and
provide valuable feedback right from the
browser
Adobe X supports Dynamic and interactive
prototype for the design to interact
between different layouts we can add
animation transations to stimulate the
flow of the application it provides a
realtime preview of the application
using the Prototype features of adobe XD
we can experience a virtual tool of the
application the prototypes can be shared
easily with the team and stakeholders to
a vaping the team can experience a
complete preview of the application and
provide valuable feedback right from
their
browsers so in the design mode we create
the design for our applications using
Adobe xit tools and Designs features
then we switch to prototype mode to
specify the interactive links between
the artboard and components we can also
create prototypes using the component
State once we are done with the design
and prototype we can share the design
using the share feature we can preview
the designs and prototypes using the
previous features the Prototype is one
of the finest features of ad OBX which
makes it different from other tools we
can also add Transitions and animations
to our prototypes While redirecting to
other screens after understanding how
prototyping Works in Adobe X3 we will
understand the top uses of adobe X3 in
different fields top Adobe XD use cases
Adobe XD is a flexible tool and can be
used for a wide range of design projects
some popular uses
include create wireframe templates and
prot
prototypes design user
interface create illustrations and
Graphics streamlines the UI and ux
design process enjoy custom design and
the last one is design augmented and
virtual reality the first one is create
wireframes templates and prototypes
Adobe exists an excellent tool for
quickly creating wireframes and
prototypes creating simple and complex
design is easy and you can add
interactive Al M ments to make your
prototype more realistic the Prototype
tool is excellent for web design Mups
and mobile apps and for making realtime
updates to your UI and ux
project and the next one is design user
interface Adobe ex is a great tool for
Designing it's a vector base so you can
create designs and has many buildin UI
elements to use in your
designs the third one is create
illustrations and Graphics Adobe XD is a
great tool for creating illustrations
and graphic design elements offering an
extensive creative library with the
vector
images shapes colors and fonts the
interactive prototype updates in real
time so your workflow is fast and
responsive when building mobile apps and
web designing and
more the next one is streamline the uiu
design process Adobe XD makes it easier
to duplicate and reuse the common
elements create repeating content and
automate the process to save time so the
next one is enjoy Custom Design Adobe XD
lets you create variations of a single
components and maintain spacing between
the contents of a group and the other
bounds it is possible because of its
padding
options andless customizations using
space
wireframes and colors and more within
the adob XC design system and the last
one is design augmented and virtual
reality Adobe exit supports designing
augmented and virtual reality experience
you can add 3D objects to your
prototypes and test how they work in an
immersive environment making crafting AR
and VR experience easy even if you are a
beginner let's take a look at uh Adobe
experience design X is a part of the
Adobe SS that uh primarily focus on UI
design a ux design prototyping and
responsive web designs it's available
for both Mac and PC as long as you have
an adobe CC subscription it's most
definitely competitor to along the
modern design tools that have come out
recently and you might be using like
sketch or figma or the dozen others that
are on the market right now so in this
video I'm going to cover the basic
things you need to know about uh XT when
you first open up the project to help
you to get up and running and feel
really confident about the program I'm
ready to get started I hope you are
let's do this thing okay let's get jump
into write the computer and figure out
when the 10 basic things are the basic
that you need to know about I'm just
going to roll and I'm going to open
XT okay and we will open up uh the
program and you can see it's open it's
right up and it's dropped an
artboard into our canvas the artboard
system is really common things nowadays
and mod design tools and exit is no
different and allows you to put new
artboards onto the canvas anytime you
want you can do that's by rolling over
over here into the tools panel and here
an artboard tool and you can use the hot
key of A and and you
can you can do the things you can draw
out and customize the size of an
artboard and I'm just going to command
set to undo that
or you can choose from the different
selection that we have like we have
iPhone x up here maybe we want to do
like an Android mobile device as well
and then and I'm going to like an iPhone
14 pro to the right and then it's every
time you want to put an artboard just
down on the screen it's going to just
space it when you open out to the right
and also with artboard um um you can you
can use and also with artboard you can
press V command or use your selection
tool and you can grab the artboard by
just grabbing the top kind of portion of
the name of that
artboard and you can move it around the
canvas and you can get some automatic
snapping for um spacing and all that
kind of good stuff but that's the first
thing uh that uh uh you need to notice
how to make artboard how to move them
and also how to resize them by just
simply that and all right uh so the
second thing uh you probably
need um you need is a basic tool or
understanding of the interface and so
what we are going to do right now is
very general fashion not real in dep we
we're just going to kind of cruise
through the
interface and show you what we have on
the very left hand side we kind of
already covered it we have the tool
panel where you can drop the different
shapes or lines you can use your pen
tool text and you can zoom
in um each of these have an HW key and
that you can learn to kind of speed up
your W uh workflow sorry down at the
bottom of this same panel and you can
see there we have a h key and as well as
and you can click over yeah these assets
the assets where in uh in where exit is
going to store all of your colors and
your characters style and your reusable
symbols or components you can reuse
through your projects and so you knowing
how to click back and forth between your
layers and your symbols or your layers
and your assets really powerful part of
x3 right next to that we have all the
artboards displayed we can see all the
tree on their own separate line up at
the top
left uh you can see we are currently on
the design Tab and we'll talk about this
layer but we can click over to prototype
tab where we can able to create
interactions between our kinds of
artboard and create interactive
prototypes so that's the difference
between these two tabs that we have the
name obviously of our
project and then we have some Basics
controls on the top right like zoom in
zoom out like what personage are we
currently looking at um it it we we want
a device preview with or desktop preview
it looks like so we can we can share
these designs and then you all have your
basic tools if I just draw a rectangle
and then you have all your basic tools
if I just want to draw a
rectangle and then if you all see the
basic tools I have just drawn the
rectangle and you see over in my
properties panel uh then you have all
your alignment tools and some
interesting repeat beats grid and you
have a Pathfinders or the Boolean
operations and you have all your
different
properties uh for your width your height
your X and Y value and we have some
different prototyping options as well as
all of your appearance options like
colors Texs in different strong sizes
and all the good stuff is there and that
is a basic tool of the interface of the
interface all right the third thing you
might want to know how to do using adob
XD like any other Adobe product is to
use the pen tool and that's by simply
clicking on the pen tool in the tools
panel or by pressing the hot key of P
once I do it I get my pen icon and I can
start by adding notes to my artboard and
and create custom shapes filling those
custom shapes with colors coming back
and redness of uh redressing we can
redress the individual node and we can
redress in the individual node and I can
add new nodes on however any line I can
redress in the individual
note I can add new
node by hovering over any line I can I
can also delete each each one at a time
by pressing delete key and it will just
slowly move around and delete each of
these points a few interesting things
about the pen tool in ad do XC is that
un like most other dopy products May
hold hold down shift and gently Gally I
can hold down shift and get increments
on I can just kind of freeform it by
doing it with nothing but my hand once I
release and I have created here a
brasure curve uh so it's going to be uh
and it will come out straight it's going
to automatically kind of smart pan or
bow the curve I don't know if that's a
good thing or bad thing it's just a
thing if I created a straight line and
if I hold down the option key like is in
most of the program I can just control
one of the basic handles um instead of
both the handles to give myself um a
little a little bit more controls of
where I'm going to go next but the
automatic curve thing it's a little bit
um yeah the four thing that you are
going to want to know about in x uh in
Adobe X3 is about Styles and reusable
symbols we have created kind of funky
shape on our canvas and I can select the
shape fill it with and we can add an
ugly
color yeah that's not such an ugly color
but now let's say I want to make this
some sort of
reusable component that I could use over
over and over in this a bad use case and
it I had it's probably be something more
likely a button or logo or a certain
style that you can have to going on your
project uh but for your uh our example
this would do this will do if I want to
create a reasonable symbol out of this
Al though I will I would roll all the
way over to the left and down between my
asset and my layers I have an asset
panel and it's here there's a few there
are few things I can do while I'm here
in my asset panel I could probably
create a reusable color so now I have so
now we have a border color and the fill
color that are both a part of now that
the rest of this design this design and
I can always count come back and reuse
those Styles I can also create a
reusable symbol and I can rename this
symbol I can call block because this
what uh what it looks like to me and
anything and anytime I want another one
of these I could either option to drag
and this could either option drag
another one out or I could drag one from
my my asset panel and there's like I uh
like this it's a nice visal
representation of all your reusable
components in your project and it's
really really nice symol work and a very
interesting way I will say uh you just
take any of the represent uh represented
symbols on the canvas and you can change
the properties with the color and we'll
change the size of this
right and I can also double click and
change the size of the element when I do
that it changes every symbol not only on
the canvas but also the symbol panel
so
yeah so
that's so that's kind of of interesting
so now we have changed the size of our
symbol and uh maybe we want to have that
color into our colors we also have
character Styles so I can use my text
tool I just drag out some text and say
let's just write
headline and we will let's choose a
headline and just wrag out some text
and say that's uh and say that let's
just write a
headline and we can let's choose a
headline like maybe we will all
grab a
fur or
Bol or let's make the size little
big and maybe even um make it little
more
bold
yeah and our headline still something
like 60 and then we can take the
character style and we can take that uh
headline into our character
style and we can add it into our
character character style panel and we
can uh rename like and we can take the
take the character style and we can add
it into our character style panel and we
can uh rename this like maybe we want uh
this just to be uh like H1 and so
now so we have a headlining and anytime
we have like two new text we could start
are uh when to typing anything
like
[Music]
see uh
with uh kind of text that I was using I
can apply that character style simply by
clicking on my
new and uh text and double clicking on
my character style and home man uh we
have our headline style has been has has
been applied on one thing and uh I
really enjoying is if you have a
multiple of those Styles or
multiple uh of those symbols on a page
or across different canvas you can right
click and highlight all of them on every
canvas throughout your entire project
that's really really cool as well the
fifth thing we are going to talking
about uh adob XT is in my opinion uh one
of its coolest features and that's It's
ability to repeat grids and speed of the
design process with its repeatable grid
features I have now created what I
consider to be a reusable
component I am going to
click I'm going to click back over to
my layers View and I'm going to group
The
together I will I'm just going to call
that card
okay now I'm going to group uh that
together uh together I'm just going to
call that card
okay and now I want to perhaps make lots
of these cards and then added the
spacing and how they all work together
like all at one time instead of
duplicating again and
duplicating instead I can just click on
the element I want to duplicate and head
over to my properties after dragging
down and all the copies of it of it
appear and now we can have multiple
copies that are being controlled by our
grid uh we can just kind of fix them
like and that if you want to change or
added the
spacing that we have of our cards in
between from one to another we can
literally just uh double
click
and we can roll over those margin areas
and we can grab and just kind of stretch
out uh to our liking so now and this
feature is very extremely enjoyable I
think it's really speed up kind of the
rapid prototyping aspects of design as
well as some of that tedious kind of
back and forth of spacing things you
don't have to do that because all these
taken care off right here in our repeat
uh grid function the next thing we need
to talk about is prototyping it's uh
kind of big deal in XD it's so big it
has its own tab up the top of the left
to and to the right of the design now we
are in the Prototype Tab and prototyping
is really really easy you literally just
going to click on any sort of element
that you want to like um for instance
for our our carts or for the triangle or
for the circle I'm going
to grab the uh Tab and just connect it
to and you're going to set it any type
of trigger for instance I'm putting the
trigger as a tab and animation should be
like I will choose only Auto animate and
this one back to this for this we have
have to uh see whether is it working or
not first we will tap on this and we
have the play button over here so the
thing it will pop out and when uh the
thing we have putting on the trigger as
by tapping when we will tap
on the circle the next page of the iPad
is coming after the iPhone 14 pro to the
iPad one um so our final point it's all
about about sharing sharing is uh cing
and SD is all about sharing and so we
are our uh we are sorry we are in our
prototype view right now uh it doesn't
matter if you are in your design or
prototype the share icon will always
show up and the Very uh top right and by
clicking I can publish the prototypes uh
and some Pro uh publish some designs
space manage my public links but first
thing we are to do publish our prototype
we are going to allow I come across apps
that may not be the most feature Rich
but are just so welld designed that you
can't help but use regularly to generate
such high functionality uiux designers
play a crucial role in creating
userfriendly and Visually appealing
digital products such as websites and
mobile apps additionally the increasing
use of digital products in everyday life
life had led to high demands for you iux
designers making them valuable Assets in
many Industries you're already watching
simply learn and today we bring you this
informative video about how to become UI
and ux designer and if you are a tech G
hey is a brain teaser for you user
interface design implemented is an
iterative process that draws on
predefined design principle is it true
or false let us know your answer below
and get a hard from Simply learn before
we begin if the these are the videos you
like to watch then hit that subscribe
button and the bell icon to get notified
every time we upload a new video without
any further delay let's get started with
the session on what makes uiio easy to
use well uiio designers aim to create
products that are easy to use by
following several principles such as
keeping interface simple and using
consistent design patterns designing
interfaces that provide clear feedback
following accessibility guidelines and
continuously testing the product with
users to get feedback and make changes
accordingly by following these principle
and the best practices uiu designers can
create products that are user friendly
and meet the needs of their target
audience so now that we have understood
how UI is easy to use we will now
explore their importance uux design is
crucial for success of any digital
product for example the uiux design of
Instagram stories emphasizes Simplicity
creativity and ease of use allowing
users to quickly and effectively share
their experience with others various
creative tools for adding text stickers
filters and more to enhance the visual
appeal of stories also it determines how
enjoyable it is for users to interact
with the product a well-designed uiux
can distinguish between a widely adopted
product and a quickly abandoned one but
why UI and ux UI ux is important because
it directly impact a user experience
with the product a well-designed UI us
can make a product easy to use visually
appealing and provide a seamless
experience for the users this can lead
to increase users engagement and
satisfaction and even drive sales in
short a good UI uxix can make the
difference between a product that is
successful and one that is not a poor UI
ux can lead to frustration confusion and
ultimately users abandoning the product
additionally it's also a way of
differentiating your product from
competitors as a well designed uiux can
make it stand out in the market now that
we have covered all the basics of UI
uxix next let's discuss the salary for
both UI and ux designers the salary for
a UI ux designers can vary widely
depending on the factors such as
location experience and the specific
company or industry however here are
some approximate salary ranges for UI
designers in India and the US UA
designer salaries in India ranges from
2.1 lakh to 15.0 lak peran with an
average annual salary of 5.5 lakhs and
talking about the US a uiux designers
annual salary is approximately
$98,000 the employment situation for
them is stable and expanding but what
kind of role should uiux designers aim
for UI designers play different but
complimentary roles in the design and
development of digital products UI
designers are responsible for products
visual design and layout including the
lay L out of buttons menus and other
interactive elements they create the
overall look and feel of the product and
ensure that it is visually appealing and
easy to navigate ux designers on the
other hand focus on the overall user
experience of a product they conduct
user research testing and analyze to
understand the needs and behaviors of
users they use this information to
create wireframes prototypes and user
flows that will guide the development of
the product they also ensure that the
product is easy to use and efficient in
summary UI designer focus on the visual
design and layout of the product while
ux designer focus on the user experience
and usability of the product both roles
have worked together to create a digital
product that is visually appealing easy
to use and provides a great user
experience now that we have talked about
the role let's explore the road map for
becoming a UI designer the first one is
learn the fundamentals of design study
design principles such as layout
typography color theory and user
experience and the second is get
familiar with design tools learn to use
popular tools such as Adobe XD sketch
figma and Invasion and the third one is
build a portfolio create a portfolio of
your design work to Showcase your skills
and abilities to potential employers the
next one is Network attend design event
meet other designers and join online
design communities to learn about new
design Trends and Technologies the next
one is keep bling stay update on the
latest design Trends and Technologies by
taking online classes attending
workshops and reading design blogs and
books the next one is specialize decide
on a specific area of U iux design in
which you want to specialize such as
mobile design or web design continual
Learning and Development as a field of
design is constantly changing and
evolving
it's important to keep learning and
staying updated with the latest design
Trends and Technologies and the last one
is certification if you want to
demonstrate your skills and knowledge in
a specific U IUS design area consider
obtaining a certification up next we
will see the skills required to become
uiux designer now to become a uiux

summary uiu designers must have a blend
of Technical and creative skills a deep
understanding of design principles a
user Center design approach and the
ability to learn and adapt to new
technologies and Trends constantly now
we'll see what tools are required or
what tools are commonly used in UI us
designing so the first one is sketch
adob vxd these tools are used to create
wireframes workups and user interface
prototypes HR this prototyping tool
allows designers to create interactive
wireframes and prototypes Invasion this
is also a prototyping tool that allows
designers to create interactive
wireframes Mups and prototypes figma
this is a cloud-based design tool that
allows for collaboration among multiple
team members and can be used for
creating wireframes Mups and prototypes
user testing this tool allows designers
to conduct user research and testing to
together feedback on their designs these
are some common tools used in uiu design
but the specific tools used will depend
on the project and the designer's
preference let's discuss what practices
are needed for uiu designers becoming a
uiu designers require educations and
practical experience a strong foundation
in design is essential to gain practical
experience designers can participate in
internship or freelance projects

for example the dark mode concept tools
and Technologies to ensure you can
deliver design that meets the need of
the modern digital landscape
participating in design communities
attending conferences and workshops and
taking online courses can keep your
skills sharp the ability to cooperate
and communicate with cross functional
team such as developers product managers

for example be BSC btech or Etc so let's
add it over here so here I'm adding the
educations and the skills of the
expertise skills that is web designing
uh creative thinking Adobe Photoshop
Adobe illustrators and Etc and for the
education also I'm putting the Masters
in arts and illustrations and ba in arts
or illustrations so next so next we will
add the certification Hobbies or
interest or projects like this section
uh will contains additional informations
about your habits projects Etc uh for
example Hobbies like playing Cricket Etc
we will uh mention it with the Stars or
we can mention it with the dots or
weekend with the poll how much the
language you know so here I have uh
mentioned the certification or the
Hobbies interest or the projects like
the language also like how much she
knows the language of English like she
knows I have written it by I have
mentioned it by the dots like how much
five out of five she knows out almost
four or out of five she knows only three
for the French and Etc and for the
interest she she's interested in
traveling or reading books so this part
is of the certification hobbies and
interest and the projects so the next
one is uh the work experience this
section contains the details of your
previous work experience like your role
and responsibilities in that company for
example uh system engineer and you're
having an experience in that so we will
keep that in in this section so here I
mentioned the experience the experience
for the users where she worked before
present or before that also I have
mentioned it over here so that wrap ups
our tutorial on how to build a canvas CV
templates and the final output of the
resume is
[Music]
this or we can make it more attractive
with the different colors we can use it
like as I have chosen the
rectangle we will keep it over here 1
minute
send
backward and we can change the color for
this let's
pick some colors like
um
soing it
there from this side also we will
increase a
bit Yeah similarly we can apply it to
the right side also we can copy
then yeah so this is the final output
for our resume templates in that we have
created where we have wrap up with the
profile picture of the user with the
name and the designation in highlights
after that we have come with the header
with the contact information where we uh
put all the information of the user
after that we put the Professional
Profile where we are putting what the
expectation from the company and the
expertise skills of that of the user and
the educations of the users Masters or
ba or something else are with the uh
interest on the language and after that
we have mentioned the header with the
contact information and after that we
have mentioned the summary statement and
the career objects with the educations
and skills and after that I have puted
the work experience of that users and
the final I have put uh I have mentioned
the certifications if you'd have or the
hobbies and the interest and the
projects so to start off with let's
understand the top UI and ux tools to
master in 2022 and the first one is adob
XT all the graphic designers are
familiar with the adob industries
leading software including illustrators
and the photoshops these adob XD Cloud
products are beneficials to the UI and
ux designers photoshops can be used to
modify composite and produce visual
contents such as arts and Graphics some
of its features are they can change the
master component then distribute it
throughout the compy company and it is
perfect for designers in huge business
and organizations with the necessity for
asset
uniformity and it is good for
prototyping and
designing and it works on Mac OS and
window next one is sketch in order to
create high quality prototypes and the
interfaces with just an intermediate
preview on the mobile devices sketch has
become a common ux tool it it has an
icon that makes it easier to construct
UI elements for reuse with the help of
these capability it is possible to
create Design Systems and uphold
consistency in interface design some of
its features are user can generate mup
using these design and prototype tools
and share them with the group for the
feedbacks to get an accurate knowledge
of the final product they can add
photographs and addit the text and it is
good for prot typing and designing and
it works on
Mac the third one is Invision Studio it
is a set of three UI and uex tools that
offers user a centralized workspace for
the collaboration and quick screen

are so close to reality as possible
professional UI designers aiming to
produce amazing prototypes that should
consider using framework some of its
features are it provides collaborative
early stage creation input from the
JavaScript and it supports a development
of complex and advanced prototypes
including the projects for augmented
reality and virtual reality it aids in
the establishing minor yet important
Transitions and it is good for
prototyping
and it works on browser and
mqu and the sixth one is flow map it is
an another specialized ux tool that
makes it onto our list the tool works
best for IAS sit Maps user flow and
sites using flow map several team may
see the workflow quickly when creating a
ux
strategy flow and the site Maps need to
receive a lot of considerations there
are several techn Oles available that
integrate UI and ux tools in a single
platform some of its features are it is
a straight forwarding sit map tool that
facilitates team work and the website
page construction customer personas are
created with the help of the Persona to
and it is good for Vi Framing and web
designing and it works on
browser the next one is origami studio
in contrast to other ux design tools
like Invision it is extremely Advanced
software that specially for expert it
was originally developed for the
Facebook designers but it is now freely
accessible it has a steep learning curve
that makes it a difficult prototyping
tool for the new users and it is one of
the most advanced ux tool available and
it creates interaction that are
realistic and offer easy sketch
integration some of its features are it
creates a prototype logic using the
patch editors and it has a substantial
fixed library that can be assessed
instantly and the components from the
sketch can be copied and pasted without
any issues and it is good for design
misss and it works on Android Mac OS and
iOS
devices the next one is
balsamic is among the greatest UI design
software and a popular WI in tool among
designers product managers and
innovators and it was specially created
to make low Fidelity wireframes despite
its Simplicity this tool is recommended
for the ux designers of all the levels
to quickly demonstrate the usability of
a given website or the applications any
product manager or business owner trying
to put an IDE on paper will find Bic to
be very much helpful some of its
features are it helps in the creation of
lowtech wireframes that focus on the
utility and the user flow a drag and
drop editor is available to make
designer quick and
easily and it works on mup and
wireframe and is good for browser Mac OS
and
windows the next one is Mel another
excellent U ux tool is marel which can
be used to create a variety of high-f
five and low five wi frames Pro
prototypes HTML and CSS handoff it is a
fantastic tool for polishing the
interface for the prototypes and giving
it a finished look the learning C for
this app design tool is quite minimal
and it makes the tool efficient and
developing and the interface and
creating prototypes some of its features
are it provide testing handoff and fast
prototyping and it enables you to easily
construct pages and even use a prototype
to test your design
and it is good for wire
framing
animations and it works on web Android
and iOS
device and the last one is
exure the dynamic content conditional
logic and the adaptable views
capabilities of the exure RP UI design
tools allow you to quickly create the
prototypes that function similarly to
the real things in order to exchange
design with the stakeholders you may
also connect XR to the well-known design
software like
sketch some of its features are you may
instantly distribute prototypes with the
organization for the intermediate
feedback using the built-in exure Cloud
capability it enables ux designers who
don't frequently work with the coding to
transfer a design to the development
team with the full
documentation and it is good for
prototyping and it works on Windows and
Mac now let's discuss what figma is and
proceed further for the
scene figma is an online tool for
Designing and editing users and Graphics
interfaces it may be used for various
graphic design task including wireframe
websites creating users interfaces for
the mobile applications creating design
prototypes creating post for the social
medias and everything in between
compared to other graphics editor
software figma is unique mostly because
it immediately works with your browser
also you can begin designing and getting
your project from any computer or
platform without installations of
additional software or acquiring
addition
licenses after discussing what is figma
we will see how to use
figma it is a web based application as
we already explained to begin using the
app you only need a desktop or laptop
with a reliable browser and an internet
connection after that you may sign up
for a free account on the figma websites
Additionally you may immediately get to
work on your designs with figma you may
design products from scratch or from
pre-made templates using an editor that
is incredibly users friendly for the
beginners there are many sources that
are available online to teach you how to
use figma but but learning will be much
simpler if you use the lessons we
provide
Below in the tutorial I'm going to show
you the best way to start practicing
designing apps and websites in figma and
we'll give you stepbystep instruction
you can literally follow Click by click
I will only tell you the stuff that you
need to get started designing interfaces
so let's get started so we are going to
look at the tool called figma and it has
a few advantages but most importantly
for you it's free to get started if you
are working by yourself we like using it
at smart because it has also really good
collaboration so we can have multiple
people working on the same design file
at the same time it's really very fast
it works on any computers whether you
have a Mac PC Linux whatever you have it
works right in the browser as you're
watching the video if you have any
questions about how to do a particular
effect in figma or any comment or
something that you want to recommend
please put it in the comment below and
if you want to find out more tips about
UI and ux make sure to subscribe our
YouTube channel so you will never miss
an update from Simply learn I wanted to
start off with the templates so what I
want to do now is create a triangle for
my own design and it will called as
frame so the first tool you need to know
about is the frame here or you hit the F
on your keyboard or anything I press
will show here in the bottom left corner
so you know exactly what I press to
activate a particular tool and then I
can start drawing a size but I know if I
look at the frame here I click on that
it
shows I can hit F again to go into the
frame mode and then I can select from
here A bunch of templates and I will
select iPhone Pro
Max and then it automatically puts in
the frame of a particular size and I
will just place here and I will start
designing so let's assume I want some
different color background right so the
easiest way I could accomplish this is I
could draw a rectangle I could do from
here you can see that there is a
rectangle tool and it's already says
like R next to it so I'm going to hit r
on the keyboard and draw a rectangle
right so I don't want to take it
up I don't need to take up the whole
screen
this is fine now I can see by default
this is dark color so I will click on
it and so here is I say whatever like I
can select the
color
fine to make it more attractive for the
right under the position and the
dimension so if I want to change
this this is just an changing Y
coordinates
and this is
for sorry this is for the Y coordinates
and this is for the x
coordinates
you can see the dragging your cursor see
the cursor turns in just sideway arrows
and I can click and just drag left and
right change these values or I can type
them in the right I can also change the
width and the
height this a
WID and this is a
height the right or the corner radius
right so the rounding effect is there so
I can use
that so with the
arrows the surrounding
effect
and Corner
radius suppose it must be 29 or
39
39 and I will keep this also by
39 so we can
see this and this Corners are giving the
round
effect
so if I change Zero you will see there
is no longer rounded and if I
want to keep the top rounded but not the
bottom then I can change the bottom ones
right and now it looks good the next
thing I have to create is the
circle is from the shape Manu you have
an ellipse which you can do also used
with the letter
o on your keyboard now by default you
will be able to draw any kind of circle
with any aspects of
ratio now let's change the color of the
circle you will often need when
designing mobile interfaces because you
you will want to have an icon for home
screen or something like that and you
can literally Google free figma
icons after searching uh this page will
open and let's say I want to
copy this
one and I come back to my file and I
will paste the
element
and figma also helps you to with
positioning it automatically centers
things and let's say what I wanted to
get an image here for interesting
instead of the blank color so one good
website is called
unsplash here I just
write
food and I will get the
image and save
it we will copy that and paste it over
here yeah I the command V2 paste and I
just can
reposition
this now the thing that I need to text
here that says non- contct deliveries
and the way I get the text is through
the T
icon here and I can just hit the T on my
keyboard and
text
no
none
so we will change the font by double
clicking we will change the font of the
text in SF Pro text
for
make it little small
so now we will write one paragraph here
below so I will hit the icon T again
we can addite something related to our
food and we'll make this font as small
four something like and make it in the
mid
yeah so now I'm going to have a button
for order now so for that I will hit the
keyboard again with the
T
repeat have rectangle
for so now I'm going to have a button
for order now for that I will have the
rectangle so I will hit
R and I'll make one rectangle over
here one make it in the
center I will pick one color for
that I you can steal the corner radius
and so I said order now
text and I will make it in the mid
I will just Center
this and make it and let it be white and
this is very easy and now I will just
write under the text
for
disiness
so so starting with a template we had
make our speci first pach for the food
delivery app in figma if you are a web
designer or you are ux designer you may
already be familiar with the figma and
all it can do for you but did you know
that some simple figma tips and tricks
are available to help you with your task
and it is a tool that are responsive
quick and simple although the tool is
simple to use there are many hidden yet
effective features to find although if
you feel comfortable using it daily
these additional 10 suggestions May
improve your workflow let's get right to
it the first one is use a scale tool to
avoid
Distortion the second one easiest
progress Ring third drag objects outside
of a frame while keeping them inside it
the fourth one is swap the position tidy
up and organize the green fifth
duplicate The Last
Action sixth one is preview a color with
the eye
dropper seven fix the line height in
seconds e create the square cells with
ease ninth control the reels and
unsplash and the last one more tricks
with space bar let's get into in
details for the first one is use a scale
SC tool to avoid
Distortion with the scale tool you can
keep your design Pixel Perfect and to
use it choose what you want to scale
press K on the keyboard and drag this
tool extremely flexible and has several
benefits firstly adjust an object size
is simple without picking it up a key
second you may adjust the sizes of
several items at once with the free
transform tool third you may rotate an
item using the free trans form to among
the most crucial design concern is Skate
which needs to be given great thought in
each
project and the next one is easiest
progress
ring pigma is a great application for
Designing Rings since it has many tools
and features that makes it simple to
construct beautiful pattern these are
helpful for reminding users to carry out
the desired action or for letting them
know how much of a product product or PL
still they have left and in figma you
must first create a new file and to
begin select create new file from the
screen upper left corner menu in the
menu or the left side of the screen
select the shapes that will be the tool
doing this will appear in the menu of
several forms you may use in your design
we advise utilizing the circle from the
Rings and the next one is drag objects
outside of a frame while keeping them
inside it
an object can be dragged so far any
object can attempt to drag off the
canvas while immediately log back into
the
position to keep an object inside a
container while dragging it outside of a
frame hold down the space bar in order
to view the object while it is outside
of the container you may also disable
clip contents for the frame that
includes the
item and the next one is swap position
TI the up and organize the
G organize your design by selecting
numerous objects in an array and then
clicking the grid symbols in the corner
as a result every object spacing is
equalize and you may drag items to
rearrange them and change their
spacing and the fifth one is duplicate
The Last
Action by choosing using the item in
figma hitting the keyword control+ D
that is Windows or Mac OS and then
dragging the copy to the desired area
you can copy an object several times
Additionally you can use the duplicate
menu option under the edit menu use the
replicant menu or the command to copy an
item many times in the Grid or the
pattern and the next one
is preview a color with the eye
dropper
you may paint over text layers stroks
and other vectors object with the color
peer the ey dropper tool allow you to
add color samples from anywhere in a
picture to your element panels to
acquire the desired effect adjust the
tool setting like sample size and Sample
using the option bar select the color
you wish to view by clicking apply solid
fills gradients or pictures using the
Color Picker in addition you may use the
blend modes to modify a color situation
or
opacity and the next one is fix line
height in
second when you input Auto or remove the
current value from the line height box
your line height automatically adjust if
it appears weird and you don't have a
specific value using the leading setting
in the text section of the inspector's
panel is a second technique to modify
the line height in figma you you may
enter a number or a percentage to
specify the distance between the line of
a Tex in this
option and the next one is creating
Square s with
e do you know how IOS app icons are
shaped they don't resemble typical
rounded rectangles they resemble squares
in between a square and a circle a
square cell is a form the term square
cell has at least two meanings the most
popular among which is based just on the
Square ellipse a combination of terms
square and circle the word squares in UI
design this kind of form is becoming
more and more common how to make a shape
like this in figma it is incredibly easy
the square cell is in between a circle
and
square and the next one
is control reels and
unsplash two essential plugins to save
the time are content real and unsplash
Avatar's names and address and much more
can be added to your design with just
one click and thanks to content tree a
free resource for high quality Graphics
is
unsplash when creating a new file in
figma choose new from unsplash to use
unsplash images this will launch a pho
library that you can look through and
utilize it for your
design and the last one is more tricks
with the space
bar
you may also set aside space as you
sketch a form so that you can reposition
the object
afterward pressing the space bar will
cause figma to immediately transfer the
item into an autof frame or design if it
is sufficient and can be used in the
place of nesting a space bar is a great
tool to expand the selection size of
your pointer drag a selection region and
then hold down the space bar you may
also hold down the space bar while
sketching a form to move the items
around and in addition you may also use
the space bar to prevent the figma from
automatically nesting items inside the
frames pigma is a great tool for
prototyping in UI and ux
design that allows you to create an
interactive flow and that allows users
to interact with your
design prototyping is important for
different reasons setting the workflow
for the new users and examine and
getting feedback from users
so now we will see what is
prototyping protyping is important for
many reasons and you can examine new
users
workflow prototyping is what allows
designers to design in the era of
digital products prototyping is the
interactions between the users and the
interface prototyping is a process of
how the final product works and this
allows the product team to test their
Design After understanding what is figma
and prototyping we will see how
prototyping Works in
figma so the first one is we can add
prototype flows add interaction fix
position add overflow scrolling and how
to present and share prototype so the
first one is ADD prototype
flows in the Sigma file you can have one
or more than one prototype flows on each
page and they should have their starting
point and unique name select the first
frame you want to appear in your flow
and then click the add icon right to the
flow starting point and after adding you
can rename the Flow by clicking on the
name input and can add a description by
using the point by clicking the delete
icon next to the flow starting
point and the next one is ADD
interaction interactions are used to
build a prototype and can be used to
show a different Behavior a pattern of
navigation and outcomes and they work by
connecting two different layers and then
we'll examine how these two layers will
interact with each other by adding
animations act and
triggers interactions can be simple and
easy but sometime it's more complex too
as animated elements move and change
their
properties interaction can be done in
three
steps instant
interaction animated
interactions and the smart animated
interaction so the first one is instant
interaction use instant interaction
animation to let the action to be taken
and plac without movement or effect it
will be helpful to navigate between the
pages or model example navigation
between the pages with an instant
animation you can navigate by by just
tapping a
button the next one is animated
interaction use animations to add
movements in interaction that helps move
in move out slide in slide out Etc use
different features that are
available and last one is smart
animated use Smart animations to examine
matching layers on different frames and
animate their differences these
differences can include a change in
color size and
position fix
position fix the position of an element
in the Prototype so that it will easy to
stay in the same place while scrolling
and it is helpful for the element that
wish to be in the view example
navigation for top and bottom configure
the design panel
set the next one is ADD overflow
scrolling it allows scrolling in through
each frame inside the Prototype it is
very helpful for prototyping components
or UI region that have their own
property of scrolling example menus
table list Etc and it is important to
have a frame with content overflow while
using overflow
scrolling and the next one is how to
present and share
prototype first select the icon press an
icon near the top toolbar that presents
the Prototype and if there are multiple
flows on a single page switch down
between the sidebar and here comments
can be mentioned as notes task and
questions although you can leave
feedback to prototyping can be shared by
clicking on shared prototype in the
presentation toolbar after understanding
how prototyping Works in figma we will
see how it is
useful using prototype is a great method
we can use it in user flows and
interaction in
advance idea sharing and
Improvement we can get the feedback from
the users and also we can test the users
interactions and the last one present
your concept to the interested
users you may preview a users journey
and experience with your ideas by
creating several flows for your
prototype on a single page with figmas
prototyping features so in this tutorial
we will will look at how to create
prototyping with figma figma is a
powerful design and prototyping tool
that you can use for both your ux and UI
projects if you are new to figma I
recommend you to check out the tutorials
I created on how to create Mups in figma
first which I will link to it in the
description below in this tutorial we
will make some interactive prototype so
we will get started by opening up the
figma file with this fire frame here we
have few static Pages including the
homepage and the uh women's category
page and the product page and I will
walk you through in this tutorial is how
to connect these pages so users can
click through just like they would on
the real products so the first thing we
want to do is enter the prototype in the
figma yeah and you can do that and that
by clicking on the Prototype tab in the
top right corner now you will notice
that nothing really changes except for
the content in the right side bar yes
the Side Bar so we will start there and
there are the settings for your
prototype these are the few things you
want to change uh depending on your
device or sorry your design so the first
setting that you may want to change here
is the
device and device refers to the device
that your protyping is presented in so
in this case uh we are designing for the
desktop so we are probably would not
want to present these design inside in
any additional uh device I think so uh
but
uh wait let me do it in that yeah but uh
if you were designing for mobile
instance it would be nice to show these
designs uh yeah these designs uh inside
an
iPhone iPhone but for our case we will
design it for the desktop so let me back
with the none
okay um another setting that we want or
we can change is the background color
and this refers to the background color
of our prototype that appears where you
are presenting the mode or this present
mode so if I open
up yeah present mode here is a top
right hand corner right so I can see the
design
here yeah I can see the design here
there are some few margins uh these dark
margins on the side that are currently
look black and that because here is a
background and the setting that we can
have is the background color and this
refers to the background color of your
prototype that will appear in your
present mode when you click it in this
and you can present it and you can have
that color of the background if you
are
suppose
yeah this is the color of the background
that is black and you can change
it
so yeah so that uh if you'll do it as a
white color so it it's
lot more than a natural feels like there
is not uh that awkward cut or the sides
of the design if it is a black color so
let it be white so yeah
so uh so now so now that we have set up
our prototype and adjusted the settings
then we can actually start the
connecting these different uh screens
and the way you do it is by just
creating the connections uh so to create
the connection we will actually have to
go here to the
homepage yeah this is the
homepage for instance right so and let's
imagine that we want to connect this
woman link to the women's women's
category this is the women's category
right so uh page which is on here like
like to do that I would like to click on
the
women you will see that the right of the
woman there's a
little uh
White uh this one there's a little white
circle appears and that's what known as
a node and nodes allow you to connect
these links to other pages so if I click
on the Node and the white
circle yeah and and I will drag it one
minute
wait if I'll drag
it yeah I can now drag to many other
pages in this file so I can drag to this
category page or I can drag to another
page which is further on this file so if
I drag it to the category page of this
women you will see that there is a
connection created
right uh wait it's not created I
think let me connect it once
more yeah it's connected right
so there is a line revealed here that
shows that there's a there when you
click on in the women see when you click
in the women it's going to take you to
the women category page and another
thing uh that pop up when I created uh
that connection was a little
arrow yeah this one here in the top left
and this is known as the starting frame
indicator and allows this and all these
indicators is which a frame of a
prototype on or which one of these
screen will be the first screen that
people see when they open their
prototype
right um so uh right now it's set to uh
the home homepage home but if I wanted
to change as it I would just click it on
the arrow and drag and then change it to
another screen so in this case uh when
people open your prototype they will
start on the women category page but in
our case we actually want users to start
on the homepage so I will click that
Arrow again and drag it back to the
homepage
yeah um so now let's create another
connection So currently we are having a
connection from the homepage to the
women's category link uh to the women's
category page right but now let's create
a way for users to get back from women's
category page to the homepage so what we
want to do is just select
I see
shoe and then you can see the node
appear right here so the right you will
want to click in on that node and drag
it
over 1 minute and drag it over to the
homepage so
that uh let me connect it with here
yeah yeah
so so that uh way when you the when the
users on the same on uh when the users
on the nicey Shoes logo it will take
them to the back to the home page of the
women's category that will be this
one um so before we create more
connections here uh in our own prototype
let's make sure that the connections are
already created are working correctly so
to do that and to preview your prototype
what you do have to do you have to go to
the right of the corner and there's a
play button so it will open up
open it up yeah right present mode this
is known as the present mode
right and you have already look at the
screen previously and there is a there
is your actual prototype and this is
what you did you want to share with your
users client teammates Etc so in in this
present mode the there are few things to
know we will see the present mode is
just another tab right in your figma
file so if you want to go back to your
design you just click on the tab to the
left of you can go yeah this one and to
the another tab to the right side and
enter present mode again and you can do
the present mode right and what's really
nice about this present mode is that it
updates automatically as you uh as you
update any uh as as you update any of
your prototype here in the left this tab
here just updates automatically you
don't have to keep opening up a new
prototype every time you want to preview
something so in your case you want to
preview all of the connection we just
created so to do that we just have to
click
anywhere so uh you will see that the
little
triangle sorry a little rectangle
appears overlaying in the
women so and that's what are known as a
hotspot and that indicates that there is
an interactive element that we have to
click and we can click on so if we go
ahead and click as we already clicked on
the women Al vant uh women that takes us
to the women's category page and this is
the category page
right SC down and uh this page check out
the content like a normal website and
then we can also want to click again to
see if there's any other hot spot in
this page so yeah so if you click here
we will see there's a Hotpot on the logo
which is uh we know as we
created uh uh and that will take us back
to the same page if we'll click on that
yeah so it's look like uh both our
connections are working correctly right
let's create few
more
okay uh the next connection uh we will
uh we want to make
is
yeah okay uh sorry the next connection I
will want to make uh is from women's
category page right to the product page
product details and where we want to add
the connection is here to the
button suppose button in the top kicks
for the women's as a specific product
right product name top cakes for women
so I could just goad and select the
image
and drag the node and bring it over to
the product page right but what I
actually want to do is to make this make
this whole card clickable so this image
here or this block and then this title
as well
as so to do that what I want to do is
Select both the
elements here and then hit the control
g 1
minute
yeah on the window okay you have to hit
the Control G on the window and what
does uh what that does it uh that will
group both the elements together and
create one single note for this entire
group so now this whole card is
clickable and us is just the rectangle
and now I can take this
node yeah and this node and drag it to
over to the product detail page right
and we will see that there is a
connection now and now when I it go back
into previous mode I will go over to the
women
page scroll down let's
wait and when we scroll down
and if I click
anywhere
yeah here's the Prototype I will see
that the hotspot is for the entire card
so if I so I can go ahead and click that
and that takes it to the
product yeah product page this is the
product P so the next thing I want to do
is uh give users way back to the women's
category page so actually I want to
include a right uh include a link right
here
so yes are connecting that link back to
the women's category page or to do so
that I will go back to design file and
then I will select
this women here
by double clicking on that yeah when I
select the women the selection box or
this uh boundary box is actually pretty
large and I will show you what that
means when we go to our prototype so if
I clicking on that
node and we'll connect it to the women's
category page I will zoom out see
yeah so you can see what uh when we go
back to the
Prototype that the selection box is
actually the same as our
hotspot
yeah is actually pretty large as well as
it would be fine for the most cases that
prod ipe find in this cases because it's
just a couple of
pages and uh we are just linking back
and forth but if you had a more complex
prototype where you want to include a
link include a link on women's and then
another link on the sneakers that's
really wouldn't work so to fix this um
and to make this Hotpot slightly smaller
what you to do you have to go back to
your design
file and then we have just drag click to
drag the
selection on women's
here you have to drag it
slowly and make sure it only covers the
women link and now when you
go and now when when you go
back to our prototype we can click
anywhere you can see that the
prototyping uh let's wait one minute
yeah okay 1
minute yeah actually uh yeah after
prototype we click
anywhere uh we can see that the Hotpot
is exactly the size of the women legs
and the sneakers below
right um so last connection that I want
to make here is a connection from the
product page this product page uh which
is Page
uh product page uh which is uh the page
where on the back on the homepage so to
do that I will create a connection here
on the logo
of nice
shoe yeah logo that links back to the
homepage uh so we will go over this
design file design file is this
one yeah I will just could just select
the nice shoe uh logo drag uh drag the
no drag it over to the homepage but I'm
actually going to show you a trick to
speed up this process of creating uh
connections especially when it comes to
navigation element so what can I do is
go to another
page and I can select this element and
then
simply paste it into another page so
first I will copy
this and now we will notice that when I
paste it in actually past is the
connection as well as see this one and
it keeps this one to so you have a
connection on the women's category page
which made
before um and we have uh this new one in
the product page and this is amazing
especially when you are working with
things like menus because um when you
have menus with 10 different links uh
that you want to do that each page and
create more connections like um to do uh
on each one of the your link instead you
can just copy and you can uh copy the
entire menu paste it on the new page and
those connections uh will already be
made and now we will look at how to edit
your prototype in other words edit some
of the connection that you already
made um
yeah uh doing this in figma is super
straightforward and all like you have to
do is Click uh on one of the connection
so in the first case the connection from
uh women's to women's uh category page
this one category page I will click on
that yeah and now you have a few options
uh or what call interaction details on
this specific connection and there
appears a little pop up here to the
right call interactions details and
there are few things that you can do
here is uh one you can manually
change uh what screen you're navigating
to so for that if you're do for the
instance I could choose product page
instead of
women right which I will touch on
briefly but few cool features that figma
has to offer so first off animations
between the screen so when I click on
this
link and that makes me to the uh uh
that's make me
to the category of women's category page
um this is the animation or the
transition that happens between these
two
screens so right now it's Set uh uh it's
set to in instance so uh yeah the
animation it sets to instance so you can
see when I click on the women so
instantly it's taking me to the women's
category um but I could actually change
that add to something like uh
dissolve uh I want uh that does is
instead of but just flashing to the
women's category page there is actually
a nice dissolve
transitions uh let's click in on
this yes this one uh that's a dissolve
transitions between the screens and this
is just one basic animation style but
figma has a few more advanced features
uh that are really amazing actually so
if you choose a smart animations for
instance let's see for the
dissolve yeah suddenly it dissolves
right that effect and uh actually if you
choose a smart uh animation for instance
let's
choose okay so uh we set it as a smart
animation let's
play and if I hit the
women there a smart animations for
instant if I hit the women it will go
with a smart animation of instance and
and if you can see that some elements
start to shift and that was not very
smooth because these were not a lot of
common elements from page to page but if
I do something like that takes so the
women page uh duplicate that and then
we'll actually make this
duplicate 1
minute
and if I change
this changes to
theand
it little
small and then pan repeat then men to
this page and I will connect
this and if I link men to this new page
and now I
preview
uh this let let me connect
it with this
is and uh see it's h set to Smart
animate already if I preview
this let's preview this
one here here what I looks like is so as
you can see that the line automatically
animate see and it's menu Link in the
case if it is also gets smaller I mean
that what smart anime uh can does that's
really basic
example and it gets a lot more complex
when you are working with different
elements but it's a uh it's really uh
quick way to create transitions between
the screen and it works especially when
things like an app where where you are
pulling up sheets or popup um yeah figma
offers some amazing features when it
comes to animations and it's really uh
powerful so I definitely encourage you
to play around with some of these
features in the interaction details
panel um so the next thing I want to
talk about here is how to share your
prototype so you might want to share
your prototype with a client or a
teammate that involved on the project
and to do that in the Fig Mite it's
actually uh super straightforward and so
the first thing you want to do in is
your open your present mode you if it is
not open then you can click it on the
right side of of this one or otherwise
we already open the prototyping um
present mode so you could know that when
you open up this tab you already open
then you have to hit the share prototype
now you important note that you make
sure you are not hitting share from the
actual design file because in this case
you had to share a design file not the
Prototype so when you are sharing just
prototype make sure you are not doing it
from present mode so uh will you go
ahead and hit the share uh then repeat
and hit share prototype and that gives
us uh few options right so the first
option is to invite
access um and you can do that by
entering email here or here and just
they will get you get an invitation to
the Prototype and they will get open
that up with that that's one way to do
it but the way uh I actually prefer to
share out your prototype is by hitting
this uh copy link option and that just
open copies a link to your clipboard to
this prototype that can share out in the
message or the personal message by email
or by FB or Facebook messages or really
whatever you want uh yeah but just to
mindful that if you're doing this copy
link method I guess you want to make
sure that this is a set to this is set
to anyone with a link because if it's
set to only people invited to this file
when someone receiving that links and
they are not invited to this file they
may not be able to open so if you are
sharing out your link make sure you set
it to anyone with the link hope you

I'm going to share an in-depth canva
tutorial for beginners and you will
learn everything there is to know like
to start designing your own graphics and
whether you like to use it for YouTube
Instagram or other social media channels
it doesn't really matter because canva
offers a great variety of tools and it's
free to use as well for watching this
video you will know how easy it is
actually the design with it so let's do
this so I am bringing you a
comprehensive canva tutorial and if
you're not heard about canva it's a free
design tool completely brilliant it's
got tons of different photos elements
and other graphics for you to use so in
other words a complete Lifesaver in the
content marketing world it's absolutely
brilliant for any graphics that you want
to design whether it's a social media
your website and blogs whether it's for
any presentation card invitation card
anything of that nature canva will sort
you out so without any further Ado let's
do this okay so we will start off with
creating an account in canva and it's
completely free to begin with um so you
can sign up either with Google with
Facebook or traditionally with an email
address obviously I have an account
already so I didn't need to do that so
just signing up and it's super easy and
then we will start designing all right
first so in the top left you have got
the main navigation panel and you have
got the you know the returning of the
homepage of course and then you have got
the templates and then obviously
categorize into different types you have
got their uh social media templates
background birthday marketing Educators
so there are various different templates
for you to browse and whenever you need
something you can just glaz through it
and see what they offer already already
in canva you have got the
features let's see the
features section as well with the photo
icons print because canva now offers
printing as well there are different
apps uh you can uh have to connected
with canva and some of the use cases are
there with different Graphics charts
video teams you can invite your teams
different templates are there so there's
also the learn section which is super
important especially when you are a
beginner so after you watch this whole
video set up your account kind of get
the feel for what canvas I would highly
recommend you actually go to the learn
Tab and watch some of the kind of uh
videos um like how to create top designs
logo maker flyer maker and then so that
as they say in here uh you can see how
to learn how to connect and grow your
community here so uh they have uh give
you quite few different features and
tips for you so the learn section is
really really important and I will
mention something at the very end of
this video as well a resource for you to
learn even more in depth then this video
is going to go but stay tuned I will
explain at the very end so uh this is
what the canva homepage looks like there
are quite a few different areas to help
you navigate so I will explain each and
every every one of those so that you can
or you know where to go certain
functionalities over there so let's
start off with the top right panel uh
you have got your account so there is
where you are and you can find a change
of your account settings you can set up
your profile photos as well and refer
your friend the things of that nature
then there is a create design button
which I will explain uh in a moment you
have got the setting in here the account
setting as well as there is a Center so
let's get back uh 1 minute yes so and
one of the most important part is the
search bar you can or once you have
signed up for the free canva account
there are some different between the
basic kind of free canva and canva pro
which I will explain at the end of this
video so make sure to watch uh till the
very end um but at this point I'm just
going to use the free canva because this
is what the majority of people will use
and need so uh we'll just stick with it
and then at the very end I will explain
it uh all the details so the first thing
we want to start off with is in the
middle here's a search bar and I have to
say it's one of the quickest way to find
any template I need different design
with specific dimensions that you need
to look for so for example if I wanted
to quickly create and school poster uh
so for that I will go to create a design
and we take take
whiteboard or we
can select okay I will select the
Whiteboard
portrait okay then after that we will
color the background first to decorated
uh first we will take one frame for
that
um let's search more about
it let's not to select a more designing
like let's select the simple
one
or we can choose another
one after this uh we already taken the
Border like it is not that design but
simple and so not that much designing
but simple let's take a picture let's
find some pictures regarding School
say
board
so as we know this is a poster for uh
school so let's say let's write um one
heading was
maths
Olympia
quiz let's see the want for
this now let's add some elements some
images that I've already installed I
think to decorate this poster for the
school let's take this
medal you can download these pictures
from Google and you
can uh actually paste it over here you
can download the pictures regarding your
topics whatever you are going to create
so these are some these are the
collection that I have
sted like this you can create add all
the pictures whatever you have done
download
it you can add elements according to
your needs
so so this is how it
looks this is the final design for the
School poster for math Olympiad quiz or
you can add some if you want you can add
some more pictures over here you can
addit the color for the background you
can uh pick any frame regarding your
posters and your needs and I have add
the medal cuz it's a Olympia quiz and a
bag as a design for the school and some
books with the specs and pencil and it
is a Olympiad quiz for the math so I
added the
just a uh to look attractive I add this
animation of math with the colors and
poster over here one glob is there and
one pencil just to make it more
beautiful as it is a school poster so
this is the final poster for the school
math Olympiad quiz the next we will
create an advertisement in the uh
Instagram suppose so just go to create a
design once again and let's let's take
this it's already open so still
Instagram poster for
square or portrait let's see how does it
look what is the size for
this okay this is
perfect
let's change the background color let's
take
this this
and just go to file and show margins
wait
okay so after
this choose some elements to make the
design look you know so cre
uh be so now just choose some elements
to make your design look more attractive
and beautiful so we'll add some elements
um let's say
Circle it in the
mid change the color for this let's
take
okay I change the color for the
background let's add one element over
here be little darker in color let's
suppose
this
this copy
this
make a design with this that's make it
over
here
you can add or adjust any elements
according to your needs
[Music]
so a line over
here
now and you can upload and choose any
image so as I have already downloaded
one image of a
man fix it over here fix it over
here
okay
adj just the image and just make it
look this is the
image and
just added the image with this
saturation it be zero
yeah after
that just add a text to your
design let's
suppose and always keep in mind that
always you have to choose one font in
any all the design
so you can adjust your letter size with
according to your design let's choose
one take font one font for all
the okay
let's add another text over
here just adjust the size
adjust the size uh
let's change the font for this to
[Music]
okay

font let's change the color for
this let it be little
[Music]
darker
now let's add another
page copy this
first you can paste over here you can
write actually anything but for the
design
let's look how how does it look you know
then
again this actually we will keep it
little down over
here
copy and paste it at down as this is
Effect
one so
we'll
you can add uh design to Carousel your
effect
let's an element again or you can copy
from
here
let's make a different
[Music]
color
so we have written over here about jity
we will write something about J again
over
here adjust it
let's this big and same font
again
the first page so we
will see this as
adjust the size and the alignments of
the
text similarly you can add another
page
with the same design with different
text
second
and
again can add any other text over here
just for creating and just want to show
you how does it work I'm just making
this change the
color you can add as many as you
want
change the color for this
also
yeah so this is how does
it so this is how does it
looks so this is the final output how
does it
looks
so next we will create a web
page so let's uh create a web design for
the uh game FIFA or the football let's
create it let's take a
whiteboard let's take
site
fine first we will uh choose a
background color let's give a theme so I
have already installed or downloaded one
theme for the
football let's edit it and make it
little let's see more if it is
there
yes
I want a background uh to be little
lighter so
okay this is fine a
bit it's good so we'll add elements
first we will upload and picture of a
man playing football 1
minute first all
let's let do
this and we'll create one boundary
first let's give a background color as
we have
after this we will add some lines
suppose
home align it over here before that
we'll add one
rectangle just as a
margin
change the color for
this will be about
section will be
setting and let's add one more
option
log and one
contact pages
this will be
Conta after this we will uh write one
text uh for as a
adding best
keing let's change the font let's
see
always remember just to keep a same
font change the
color also we will change the
color
let's add
an element suppose
ball
sorry to highlight
it add some
elements
e
so this is the basic uh web design let's
try to change the color for this
no okay this is fine only so this is a
basic uh idea to create a web design a
simple design the basic design for a
football or a game now let's go through
the top tips and tricks for the
Cana then animation canva magic
resize instant image background
remover or use Cana
templates align the text and the images
perfectly use frames to customize the
images filter The Elements by different
colors use grade to organize the
images blur the background of the photos
unlog the elements or IM image position
let's discuss each points in detail so
the first one is instant
animation with canva Pro you can quickly
add instant animations to the
presentations social media posting and
other places where you want to create a
lasting visual effect click once to
start animating and save the file as a
gift this your customize animation films
will help in improve knowledge intake
and storage of few
be a free animated movie generator
includes all the tools you want whether
you are creating a video for a lecture
in your class or presenting an idea at
work so the next one
is canva Magic
resize canva magic resize is essentially
the finest thing because if you ever
created a graphic templates which I'm
sure you have you are aware of how how
much time is lost when you must recreate
the design to fit various platform and
unfortunately or fortunately canva BR
magic resize function takes care of that
issue for us you can use the tool of
bulk resize your visuals to fit numar
preset formats to view their
measurements move your mouse over them
more than one size is available click
resize a change and design the
size and the next one
is instant image background
remover visual impact is crucial for
everything from social media to
e-commerce but even in the case of
flawless photograph backdrops can be
annoying with just one click any product
head shot or logo can stand out and
shine thanks to the canva pros easy to
use backdrop removal features simple
choose an image then under the effect
section click on the background remove
the back background will magically
vanage to Showcase particular Goods or
add layers to the
design and the next one is use canva
templates canva templates are already
made designs that various users can
quickly alter you may buy Cana templates
on thirdparty websites that digitally
Market goods include online stores canva
templates is a pre-made design that you
can quickly change the design framework
already exists but you may add your own
Creative Touch by altering the colors
fonts and the other
components and the next one is align the
text and the images
perfectly align text components or
images is incredibly used to do with
canva you may quickly use the alignment
tools to align and organize the text and
the pictures instead of manually
positioning each object are relying on
visual
approximations with the regards to the
design page alignment moves your element
to the location you
specify and the next one is use frames
to customize the
images you may clip pictures and videos
using the canva frames to fit their form
you may change the setting and the
transparency of inserted photos as well
as apply the filters or effects
Additionally you may drag the uploaded
files and movies into the frames to add
them and the next one
is filter The Elements by
colors can has many different elements
available instead of utilizing the
secret codes to find the pieces with a
similar design but if you only require
the elements of a single color type few
individuals are aware that elements
purchase may be colored filtered simply
enter the element search T choose the
desired color palette by clicking the
filter icon and then press the enter key
the element search result will be there
that update to the match your color
choices so the next one is use grade to
organize the
image in canva great function as a frame
into which you can put photos it may
stretch photographs across your entire
design and group several images or small
images in a composition the single frame
grid is the most often used grid you
should always include one of these grids
into your designs if you use an image as
a background or the backdrop if you do
you can drag and drop various
photographs while keeping their own
filter Cotes or
effects so the next one is blur the
backgrounds of
photographs adding a background blur to
your photographs May highlight a
particular topic such as a person in a
portrait of an object is a still life
while giving your work a more polished
appearance thanks to advancement in free
photos editing tools like Kena you can
create this lovely background blur often
known as poke even after taking your
shot so so the next one is lock elements
or image
position while editing other components
of your design lock elements to prevent
unwanted changes from being made to them
click the element or page thumbnail you
wish to lock to select several
components you may also click on them
while holding the shift key on your
keyboard you may use the open lock
symbol on the edited Toolbar to partly
log a page or the elements and only
enable aables content replacement so now
we will see the steps to create
templates for Instagram stories first we
we need to click on the create design
panel that is located on the top right
of the screen and we will search for

is there the birthday party and the
venue according to our need in many
Industries visuals are essential we
propose ideas for improved
Communications whether well displayed
photographs or buttons canva and figma
provides equal access to use and prize
and third party plugins or the
applications but there are also many
distinctions with some of the basic
comparison between the two so the first
one is platform
access best design purposes drawing
tools image
editing and the last one plugins and
apps let us have a simple quiz question
to brush up on our
knowledge who is the founder of figma so
the options are Milan Perkins danan
field shantanu Narayan and the last one
Steve Jobs please answer in the comment
section below and we will update the
correct answer in the pin comments you
can pause the video give it a thought
and answer it in the comment section so
now let's discuss it in detail first we
will see what is
canva it is an online graphic design
platform for non-designers wishing to
quickly and easily creating the simple
graphics for nearly anything including
infographics presentation posters and
social media Graphics logos and other
visuals content after the canva we will
understand what is
figma figma is more than just a tool for
manipulating photos in fact it is a
design software with the singular forces
on UI and uxix design in the canva
versus figma discussion figma is a
software for Designing products you can
quickly create and prototype application
with the help of figma now we will
discuss some basic features for the both
canva and the figma so the first one is
platform access
the key factor to consider When
selecting a design platform is
accessibility the places where you are
can utilize the canva and figma are
listed
below for the
canva you may use canva as a browser
based design tool by downloading an app
for Mac Windows IOS and Android your
previous design will be saved in your
canva account even if you can check in
using a different device you could use
an app to save work locally if you don't
have an internet
connection for the figma is there
another online design tool that can be
used on Mac windows and Linux desktop
computers an IOS and Android mobile app
is also available for figma your design
history files and plugins are all
accessible from any device when linked
to your figma account although the
application permits offline
design and the next one is best design
purposes consider their Simplicity
convenience and accessibility certain
platforms are made for more effective
uses than others here is a list of what
canva and figma Exel
is for the
canva canvas's primary area of expertise
is social media design including
Instagram stories YouTube thumbnails and
Facebook panel there are lot of free
themes available for popular social net
working sites you can produce a variety
of reasons canva offers easily editable
templates for calendars presentations
and
stationaries and for the figma since
figma is a primarily employed as a user
experience and user interface design
tool it performs well when being used to
create the website applications and
other interfaces however you can also
use it to make other things like
presentations resume and the animations
for Instagram stories most designed in
figmas are Dynamic rather than
stat and the next one is drawing
tools if you are required drawing
instruments the comparison that follows
will assist you in making the best
option and for the
canva it is a design capabilities that
are limited in comparison to other
design software there is no pan tool
available in the elements menu only the
line and the Form Tools it's free to use
lines and Curves in your sketches than
to start from the
blank and for the figma drawings can be
edited right in the app using figma pen
and pencil tool a few Form Tools are
also included that can utilize an
additional to the pan tools having the
ability is great however it's the best
to import individual drawings from other
applications for the UI and U System
sign the next one is image
editing image editing is a workflow
feature whether you manage social media
or photographers you may read more about
the canva and figma's abilities in the
section
below for the
canva most of canva image editing
capabilities are adjustment switchmen
and thirdparty filters while some of its
features are equal to those of
photoshops canva products offer less
customization and the texture
application is covered in the tutorial
with the canva pro you get the access to
more and better editing
tool and for the
figma the majority of figma's image
editing features are quite basic because
it is not designed to be used for photo
editing additional options include
altering the colors or applying brand
modes to the image the tool called figma
needs a change image from another tool
to be provided in
advance and the last one is plugins and
app your productivity may be greatly
increased by using plugins the tools
that you can combine with canva and
figma are listed
below for the canva this provides unique
method for locating and utilizing other
resources the elements panel is the
first item on the menu bar to use your
Creations you can find here Graphics
audio video movies animations and
illustrations you can actively download
alements that are not already in the
canva however you can only perform
searches for the particular
words and for the
figma figma offers a huge selection of
plugins on its Community page in
addition to the third party application
like unsplash for stock images wi frames
or initial designs and placeholders
plug-in for the text figma also offers
smer plugins anybody can make a plugin
with a figma account and anyone also can
use a plugin after the comparison
between the canva and figma we will
discuss the pros and cons for the canva
and
figma some of the prones for the canvas
are the software is easy to use and
amazingly made templates it's free to
subscribe and there is a collection of
animated gifts and some of it cons are
not for professional designers there are
not many free templates readily
available in
canva now for the
figma some of it PRS are it makes quick
prototypes and presentations possible
utilizing the browser based application
for the cloud data
storage it works well for design and
graphics
some of its cons are it's difficult to
understand the auto layout the
presentation mode might be improved
after understanding the pros and cons we
will see the pricing for the
both pigm and can offer a free version
of the program and paid addition
depending on your needed capabilities
there are three price categories for the
canva it's free as
$0

what are Mups now let's discuss what
Mups are and proceed further for the SC
Mups are mainly designed that represent
how a service or product will seem in
the future anything from websites and
mobile applications to the basic thing
like packaging may use them before
devoting excessive time and money to a
particular design Mups allow designers
to test their ideas quickly
additionally they allow designers to
gather early clients or other
stakeholders commands which can assist
in enhancing the finished product after
discussing what are Mups we will see how
to create Mups in
figma figma is an excellent tool for
generating mup since it gives you a lot
of customizing choices and capabilities
create a new file in figma and choose
the mooch of template from the list of
available templates to start creating
Mups you can create Mups in figma by
accessing hundreds of Premium artboard
Studio Mups component within your figma
files with only a button press quickly
convert figma frame into a realistic
product Mups so in this tutorial I'm
going to show you the best way to start
practicing designing apps and websites
in figma you can quickly download Mups
plugin in the figma rather than saving
your figma design and switching to
another software to build a mup although
numar plug-in alternate are available in
different styles they are all easy to
use and can be integrated into bigger
projects so just go to
Google cardboard
studio all right click on the get
started for
free right guess that makes just quickly
create an
account as I have already make an
account so I will go to the setting then
integration okay then click on the
setting to reveal the API key and you
will be shown an API key and then copy
this and come back to the figma and
paste here in right now here you can see
you can reveal the API key over here and
you can paste it over here so right now
maybe it's not making any sense but when
you launch this plugin you are going to
see more data that shows input API keys
right so just go over the website create
an account create your o API key and you
have to copy and come back over your
figma and paste that API key right and
it may look like a little stressful but
it will take a long run it's going to be
an actually a beneficial to you all
right so now you have a lot of Mups
right so we'll click on right button and
you can have the plugin over here in
artw studio yeah it will take a bit of
time okay now I'm going to search or I
can select only fre items okay let's um
use this let me click on
this okay let's use this so yeah you can
click on the mup item you actually
presented with the two or the three
screens depending on the kind of mup
they you are clicking so first you have
to Mo up by yourself your item you not
going to make any change to this one so
you can lock this so you're not going to
move that and or you're not going to
touch this so you're not going to addit
this you can even go as far as you can
lo this right right I have done and so
this is what you're going to make
changes to
whatever whatever changes you are going
to imp Implement sorry put here it will
reflect on this m it looks like a magic
right so let's create a design for the
food delivery app for the first splash
screen first let's change the color for
the
background um let's take a light color
maybe yeah this is fine and we will give
the effect to this we will change this
color Also let's take the sky with the
gradient we not going to get the
gradient effect so fine fine
after this first I'm going to make a
water we will select a line from over
here yeah again I will press the keyword
L and I'll make the
border so similarly I have drawn all the
four borders I'm going to make the
little
bit big let's give this a black
color so this is how it will look after
giving the border now we will put a text
as a name of our full delivery app so we
will give a
name
in we will make the size a little bigger
than
this
36 let's make it
bold with different color let's take
dark blue
right
fine now we
need to make a button with the name get
AAL so we will um keep one rectangle
over
here and with the
text let it be a little small with
4
16 24 yeah
fine we'll align it in the mid and we'll
change the color for this
also yeah
fine for making it looks a little good
uh we will put one picture over here so
so for that for first I will make a
rectangle in which I'm going to insert
the picture suppose I already downloaded
the picture so this is how it will look
and now for making this little good we
will put one icon over here related to
the food so I'm already downloaded one
icon yeah so this will look like this
after putting this icon over here
so we will make it in
alignment
so after importing all the items and
customizing the frame click on the
render button first we have to choose
the screen that is a spash screen so we
will render this and it will reflect
whatever your designing is going to
render the item in that perspective and
changes that going to made on this same
frame would be rendered on the item
after the render button just click on
the visible in the screen
see
now for the next we will see now we will
see something different when the user
will log in into that the app and the
next screen will be like how we are
going to design let's pick a
different let's take this
one
yeah we will again loog this one so we
are not going to make any change in this
and I'm not going to addit this but this
yeah first I will pick the line and now
I'm going to
copy the
line
sizes three four yeah now I'm going to
copy
this I will resize this
also want to copy this
and so it will look like this let I want
to add a text and that that text should
describe or what you want to select your
mean different locations maybe from your
workplace or something like that so we
were going to add a text over
here size it with
24 and will change the design that it be
Samy or
medium Let It Be Sam and we change the
color for this will keep
right the bottom yeah and we will change
the color of our p
and so after this there will be the
varieties for choosing the meal so I'm
going to add one more text like choose
your
here
sorry and I size this
hole um with a little smaller than
before like 16 yeah fine and I'll change
the color for this
also let's make it
medium and I will change the color for
the text Let It
Be
about blue only okay fine this is
fine I'm going to align it
again moove
this okay there will be the location so
I'm going to put one polygon in the name
of location so we change the color for
this let it be green
color yeah
fine so if you want to search your meal
there will be search button also for
that I have an
icon download it yes it seems like this
and we are going to put different
different
four four icons for that we will take
rectangle align
it
yeah it will like this and now I'm going
to quickly add the four different
icons that I already downloaded as we
are in the choosing page uh first icon
will be active and other three will be
on offline so we will keep them in dark
color
so it will be visible like this so we
are going to add the items or the food
that we are going to select there will
be different different options so let's
do it so first I'm going to take um
square and one
Circle we will use the rectangle later
we will keep the circle over here and
we'll select a picture of the food that
we're going to insert over this so first
and I have inserted picture I've already
downloaded from the Google and I'm going
to shift this rectangle over
there this is the vegetarian so I'm
going to give a circle with the green
and it is in the our favorite list so
I'm going to give a heart over
there change the color with the green as
it is
vegetarian so it will be like this after
that we are going to give the name of
this meal so quickly I'm going to give
the name of this
meal and I will resize
this and another text for the prize so
I'm going going to give
like it be italic and the
size
biger
hello yeah so similarly we are going to
make the different rectangle suppose
like
here
or let's copy the first one only with
the similar
size yeah now we are going to render
this for that we will go into plugin
again on the item mod and we are going
to select
this yeah so it takes a little bit time
and we are going to see it to reflect in
the screen so it will be like this so
whatever we are going to make a change
in the first
screen and and that will be reflect on
our mup screen suppose we take
another let's take this one let's try to
put uh this
screen over here I'll let it be like
this so this is for this moveup screen
so I'm going to render this and it will
come over this
also let's quickly plug in and open add
Locus item and I'm going to render
this yeah so it doesn't overlap but it
is showing the same screen that I have
used before and yeah I didn't make any
different screen for that and it is
overla but in this it is not it is
showing
yeah so similarly whatever the changes
we are going to make in this reflect on
the mup of screen
suppose I will choose
this anything like or any other shape
like stick
star give it a color
with I'm going to render this
screen and this is going to reflect over
here yeah after importing the items and
customizing the frame click on the
rander button and your design is going
to render on the item in that
perspective or any changes that you are
going to to made on the same frame would
be rendered on the item after the render
button is clicked on
consecutively
so this is how we create a Mups in figma
what is
wireframe a website service can be
designed using wireframes and is
frequently utilized to lay out
functionality and content on a page
while considering users need and journey
and before adding visual design and the
contents to the page the basic wireframe
and the frame work of the page is
established using wireframes early on
the development process it is a double
structure sketch of a web page or app
comparable to the visual interface
design in wireframes
style
color and Graphics are typically kept to
the minimal because they represent the
initial product concept depending on the
level of information required wireframe
can be created as either digitally or
manually the most frequent users of wi
framings are ux designers before the
developers begin writing code for the
interface this approach enables all the
partners to agree on where data is
placed and will place the data digitally
or not after knowing what is wireframe
we will understand its
purpose wireframe having Tre main
advantages they keep the concept and
they are quick and inexpensive to
produce because they stimulate users
feedback kick off conversation with the
stakeholders and Inspire Innovations in
designers wireframes are helpful as
Communications tool the designers can
receive direct feedback and identify key
problems that help them to create the
proposed product by conducting users
testing during the first wireframe
stage they clarify and describe website
functions and they maintain the concept
users focus with particular W framing
features you may explain exactly how
they will work to your clients and what
function they will ser and it has all
the stakeholders combine the website's
information architectures with its
visual design and make the page
operational
clear the third one is quick and cheap
the best thing about wireframing is how
easy and affordable is it to create that
you can design a wireframe with a
newspaper paper and pan thanks to the
abundance of tools you can quickly
develop a digital wireframe the consumer
is typically less likely to be honest
about their early thoughts whenever a
product is highly polished the longer a
period is developed the harder is to
make the
change after understanding the purpose
of the wireframe we will see the
different types of
wiame and the first one is low fidil
wireframes and they are very simple
visual depiction of the web pages and
are typically used as a designer's
foundation as a result they usually lack
of all the sense of Grid or pixel
accuracy and tend to be quite slopy it
contains basic pictures block forms and
dummy contents including fillers text or
labels with the headlines and they leave
out any information that would serve as
a possible distraction these are useful
for starting conversation selecting
navigations layout and mapping users
flow in the second one is mid fertility
wireframe the most popular of the three
while they avoid distractions like
graphics and distracting fonts they
mostly focus on specific features
distinct from one another headings and
body materials could potentially be
separated using different xray although
remaining in black and white artists can
convey the pro of specific features
through various shades of cre these are
typically produced using a digital
wireframing program such as sketch or
Bic even if they are still useful in the
early stages of a
design the third one is High Fidelity
wireframe finally the pixel specific
layouts are features of high fidil fir
frames they may have actual featured
images and textual information unlike
low fidil wire frames they are the best
Cho for exploring and capturing ideas
manual on interactive maps because of
their additional depth and Rising
wireframes should be safe for the last
stages of the product's Desiring
cycle now what is included in the wi
frame as we briefly said previously
whether a wireframe is low mid or high
quality greatly affects how many details
are contained
however elements like tread makers
searching areas headings share buttons
and placeholder text are frequently seen
in wireframes so the first one is
information design by illustrating The
Roots between the pages wireframe
relates the web database structure to
its visual design among other things
explain how it should display specific
type of information consistently on the
interface identify the interface primary
use of the functionality
the second one is navigation design aite
structure comprising all the components
is structure so users can easily
discover informations VI frames
navigation charts and Etc to develop a
flowchart of your website you will be
evaluating sorting grouping and linking
comparable information during this
process and the third one is interface
design the method designers use to
create useful software interfaces or
electronic devices emphasizes Aesthetics
or Styles designers strive to produce
userfriendly and enjoyable interfaces
user interface design and other types
such as voice control interfaces are
called UI design it's a vital to
remember that because wire frames are
two-dimensional they don't work well for
displaying the interactive elements of
the
users now we will discuss what tools are
used to create the
wireframes three best wireframe tools
are the first one is
figma as a potent cloud-based substitute
for the applications like sketch and XD
figma stands out the best thing is that
it offers a range of usual capabilities
whether you are freelance designer or a
member of a large team with no
restriction for free users there are
many available free wireframes tool
figma is a fantastic altern creative if
your team wants one simple tool for the
entire creative process but it's also a
great option if you are a tight budget
you may discuss ad map user Journey with
figma and a digital whiteboard that
consist with figma without exporting
your ideas to another design program
proceed directly to wireframing and
testing second one is adob XD adob XD
sends out as a user friendly choice for
bu Framing and UI design task even
though adop Technologies are famous for
being content and challenging to learn
within XD you can do anything from wire
framing to simple prototyping
additionally X simple UI is a breath for
fresh air in the comparison to certain
other features which adopt XD
tools the second one is sketch sketch
has remind a Top Choice among Mac users
as a p yet portable Vector design tool
wire frames contemporary UI and simple
graphic art some interaction design and
more can all be done within on their own
compared to the industry leader the
vector design Atomic designers and adob
illustrator it has a simpler and more
userfriendly interface because of the
sketch Simplicity wireframe may be
quickly constructed using a combinations
of templates and graphic
shapes so guys I have an empty page and
I'm going to start my design right away
so for that first I will take one
rectangle with the effect of
gradient and I will align it here and
you know size so what I'm going to have
a picture which I've already downloaded
so what I'm going to do is to take that
picture right into my
screen and now I'm resizing
it and this SI is okay so next thing I
will do is to add an a text so I'm going
to select the
text and click here and some basic
configuration is
there for my text and I I need like to
say text to be complete and bold but
before I will go ahead and I will
type l
eight for the configuration of my
text I will make it
bold and I will just go
ahead and we change the
color color say I
can white
so now I will put the button over
here but before that I will align it
little
up I will change the
color
by the
name
character
name we'll change the configuration will
change the
size sorry this could be
me I store the little light
color or some other color that could
match
with the
background so let me know what you think
about this flash screen and if you have
any other great ideas on how to bring
out a good flat screen let me know in
the comment section below and for now we
are going to proceed with further with
the home design and the next Splash
design so guys the next thing I want to
do do is the home as I said earlier so
we will copy this first
and we place it over
here
yeah or we can choose any other plain
rectangle we will from
here
now I will pick the
line keep this
hair
and I'm going to copy
this and then I will reduce the
size
I will again copy
this and I will reduce size of this
also and the next thing I want to add a
text and this text should describe of
what you want to select your meal from a
different locations maybe at your
workplace in your school or office so
they get the kind of place you select
determines the kind of food that comes
out for you so I'm going to select a
text and I'll give a text let's
say
workplace you're selecting from your
workplace so do the same basic
configuration K
Bol should left be left
align
now this is fine and I can add more
description to this and the description
should be a little bit easier than what
we have for the workspace and the
workplace so I'm going to make a
description of
size uh little
small
Tex
actually
like choose your delicious
meal
me
so now I can drop this here with the
point like a more
description so we might so you might
want the users to select the different
location so we can achieve that with our
triangle
icon so it will be something like this
and we'll change the
color white
next thing I want to do is um you can
also search for food by the name so I'm
going to add search icon
yeah so
it and we'll keep it align with this so
it will look good
and drag it to this
point yeah and we can keep this as a
white color also yeah it looks
good make it
dark
so
next what I want to do uh quick two
icons so I'm going to create some icons
with the rectangle with some curves so I
will add the icon home over
there
so we'll add the icon of home we will
search it over
here home
icon save this
one and I'm going to drag it into the
home screen and I will bring it in the
center this way and also going to change
the color or this color is fine okay
I'll change the
color
yeah so next thing I will do I'm going
to copy
this and make it into four
places
the same
alignment so I'm going to quickly change
the icon for this this and another this
one so second one I will
keep
this
one I'll keep this
there
the third
one I will use the filter
icon for the fourth we'll use card
icon
like
this this this one is the active one so
we'll keep this as bright
color
these are not active so we will keep it
in white
color
yeah so guys I'm having my icons the
four icons that should show me the
favorite meal which I started offer now
this should show me like a filter screen
where I can filter if I am a vegetarian
same meal that are good for vegetarians
and this should show me the T card I
have selected to my card then from there
I can payment also so what I'm going to
do now so the next thing I will do is to
add our card for the different meal
where you can select so I am going to
add a
card so what I will need is a rectangle
tool so we'll click
on
rectangle
I have my rectangle tool next thing I
will do a drag in and this
slide and I have a color for this I will
do go with the light
color so next thing I will do is maybe
add the image and I'm going to select
the circle
first within this I will keep my
image over
here and we will align this here now we
will add the image
in the circle what to do again image you
can just select the
image from where the image is in your
system and upload it as I already
downloaded so we'll upload it
here yeah so the next thing I will do is
um I will show you that this is the card
so I'm going to add little design in the
circle
Circle over
here one give this green
color we copy this and make another
Circle we'll give this as another color
it's little
dark
okay and I will copy the
heart and make a duplicate over
here I'll give this the color and around
the red I'm going to the next
thing then the next thing is what the
name of the
me so I'm going to selecting the text so
I can copy the
text but before I will select the
text
configur
it and I'll give this name
as
wburg and make it
small this over
here the
board
I'll copy
this put another text for the
pr let's
suppose the price set must
be
see I put it over
here
yeah and the next thing
is we add a button down over
here like plus icon so here here we can
add a
button plus
[Music]
icon keep this
here
when you click on this plus button you
can add to your card
similarly and we can change change the
color when you click on this you can add
to your card the Fe food that you wanted
you can add more
similarly this we can
make
similar to this we have created another
F suppose this is a wed burger or this
is something else and this is this an
example and these three are in our
favorite and these two icons we showing
this is in our
cart so here we can add a little
description that says okay there there
is a discount in this particular meal
suppose this one so what will I do in
this way now I'm going to make so we'll
make
a
small description over here with the red
mark
suppose 10
10%
off let's just use this size
yeah and we'll change the color also
yeah I changed the color and so now we
have something like this if you're
really enjoying these to tutorial you
can let me know in the comment section
what you think about this tutorial and
if you think I need to improve or
something also let me know and this is
the final screen designers nowadays are
always on the lookout to streamline
their workflows collaborate more
effectively and create better design
outcomes with a versatile set of
features and interfaces Invision has
become a goto platform for designers
worldwide Invision has proven to a
valuable tool for various design
projects including mobile app design web
design user experience design and
product design it is a lading digital

for more details and if you're a teag
geek here is a brain teaser for you when
was Invision Studio
released is it
2015
2016
2017 or 2018 let us know your answer
below and get a heart from Simply learn
before we begin if these are the videos
you like to watch then hit the Subscribe
button and the bell icon to get notified
every time we upload a new video without
any further delay let's get started with
the session on so you have delivered
your final design to your internal or
external client only to find out the
work you created was way off the mark
and the hours you have spent on the
original design have been wasted sound
familiar this scenario and others are
exactly five wireframes are an essential
step in turning any digital products
into a reality think of a wireframe like
a building blueprint but for your
digital product the goal of a wire frame
is to create the basic skeleton for each
screen in your design that you can
review the overall layout of the design
with your CLI before things like
imaginary color and branding get brought
into a mix a wireframe will save you and
your clients a huge headache and a lot
of time now you may be asking yourself
okay but what program do I need to
create a wireframe so in this video
tutorial we'll be using Invision one of
the standard software use in Industry
let's get
started
app.com after signing it it may take you
to the project dashboard near the top
right of the page click the plus button
or the red circle but before that you
have to sign it up or sign in create a
white board with a free hand let's
wait you can just log in you have to
cross it
out
okay so from here you can get uh any
like you can create a blank freehand you
just select
it and you will get the page let me
select it once
more than
freehand
or let's remove any of the before let's
delete it from
here
it
let's take a minute to look at the
interface the whole blank space is
called your canvas when you where you
can draw endlessly uh in the top left
hand corner there is the Invision logo
to go back to your dashboard beside the
logo is the title documents uh wait a
minute yeah this is a highlight document
that uh that name to be typed in for the
new file let's take
it
demo invion in in the middle these are
the different tools in the top right
hand corner these are the menu options
after that access an additional menu for
exporting and uh version history
creators and enter presenters mod to
share your net on the bottom side on the
left side or at the bottom in the middle
of the toolbar to start your drawing in
the bottom right hand corner you get a a
pan Edge or to hold space zoom in and
zoom out now let's talk about the first
tool that is pointer tool that uh
pointer tools allows you to select move
and resize suppose it helps you to move
the elements or the pictures on your
canvas and you can make a copy of this
let's make it like this you can click it
hold and drag create a box around and
choosing things like a select
uh in Adobe Photoshop or illustrators
alternatively you can hold down shift
key and click each
object so for this keyword shortcut is V
and one draw on a canvas with your
pencil tool when you select the pencil
tool you can change the color uh let's
take an color over here we have selected
the pink
color
and you can change the color even from
here again let's take this
color and you even adjust the line
thickness or set the default and caps to
the top
so with the chosen color you will see
three different oppacity
options along with your opportunity to
add fills but remember to keep the
wireframe as simple as possible by using
black and white and gray color only it
is over here to create neat Circle or
squares hold on the option key while
drawing
while drawing uh that will help you to
creating a straight
line suppose I'm making it will be
automatically will become straight at
0° or at
0°
45° or 90° to create any straight line
at any angles uh let's take another
color like this like this like if we
will make a line without pressing the
shift key it will be like this there
will be no straight line but if you
press while using shift key it will be
straight and
automatically okay hold shift key
whenever you click to draw but release
shift before finishing your line let's
take a look how is it
work
like this can see we can make it up
at okay when we release a shift key it
will become a straight it will become a
straight line keyword shortcut is P or
two okay so now to erase or clear the
canvas shape uh with the Eraser tool
click once on the
pencil oh yeah the pencil tool you can
see on the right side there is a eraser
tool that you can use it to erase
whatever you have done before let's you
have to just touch it over it or Pat it
over that eraser on the top of the line
that you want to remove and just and it
just get erased and the keyword shortcut
is e so the next is uh when the text
tool is selected click once on the
canvas the text tool adds to type
something go ahead and enter text on
your
canvas
to create a line break press
enter switch to the pointer key tool to
resize you can see the resize you can
use it with your use of pointer key you
can change the color formatting and
Alignment let's change it to the red
color metallic or let it
be
you can highlight the text and you can
format the line of the text or you you
can do it at alici size and set the text
alignment to the left or right or Center
as we have already text align in the
center you can also lock the text on the
canvas to keep it uh in
place or convert any text box into a
sticky notes let's
see keyboard shortcut is T or three T
tool you can create rectangle Circle or
straight line rhombus oval or any Arrow
shape click the shape tool and then
select the appropriate shape whatever
you want to keep here let's copy and
I'll paste it over
here and you can hold shift while trying
to create a perfect square let's do
that let me select the circle just hold
the shift key first and you can create a
perfect
[Music]
square while drawing a line will lock
your
line how does it work let's
see it can lock it at
0°
45°
and
90° keyword shortcut is s and4 What I
suggest just avoid using graphics and
images in iio wireframes use Simple
rectangles and square shapes from here
let's
see
if you place an X through the middle of
the
Box this is a signal where you can place
the image and for the videos you can put
the triangle
like um make it like
this as a play button let's make it a
color got a note you want to clarify a
point sticky notes allow you to add
notes anywhere on the
canvas
it is in the fifth option with a sticky
note selected you can change its colors
actually adjust its
width and you can even add a text over
here let's
suppose you can keep anywh with the
cursor and the keyboard shortcut is n or
six see something you like go ahead and
add an emoji uh let's let's you can keep
this Emoji over here or one more you can
add over here okay start creating uh one
basic wireframe let's take it over here
from
here
let's select uh this
one we will use some basic tools uh with
the shape first we will have
this pick another
one and the editing toolbar appears when
you have one or more uh objects
selected like this and let's addit it
with the text let's write
something
let it be a
normal we will use our cursor
to align the
name okay similarly we will have
passord
pass
for let's make it a little bit small in
size
okay
and another text over here let's make it
submit
button so now after create shapes and
line you can edit them using the menus
actually
so let's change the color for this is
pink this also we can change the color
with pink and we can change the color
for the
text Let It Be
black and we can change the
width of the line let it be
normal this
one okay it is already normal okay we
will change the color for this
also and for this also it it be little
bold with the red
color
can see the alignment of this is
always like to this
okay uh when you have text you can
select uh you can change the color
formatting and Alignment that we have
done
already so you can un log the text on
the canvas to keep it in the place like
uh let's suppose we can make it move
around like this but if we lock this
one we can't move it because it is
locked so just open it with the tab
let's
see or you can even convert any text
blog into a sticky note suppose this
and you
can get a sticky note of
this outside right let it do this okay
and now you can click on the hand tool
at the bottom uh to pan around the
canvas like or press and hold the space
bar to access the hand tool so you can
move
your and you are enabling to move around
an image by pushing on it like
this and the magnifying tool is to zoom
in and zoom out on the
canvas just like Adobe
products you can command control plus uh
minus to zoom in or zoom out so that
wrap ups our Invision tutorial where we
created a simple wireframe with multiple
frame styles today's session was for

to code time saving instead of spending
hours coding the basic layout developers
can use sketch to code to quickly
generate code based on a handdraw sketch
reduce errors sketch to code generates
code Based On A visual representation of
the user interface reducing the risk of
coding
errors and the third one is user
friendly sketch to code is easy to use
and doesn't require coding knowledge
making it a valuable tool for designers
and non-technical users some of its cons
are limited functionality while sketch
to code is excellent for generating
basic layouts more complex user
interface code quality sketch to code

find that adobe sensus preil automation
tools are too rigid for their needs cost
Adobe sens is only available through
Adobe subscription based Creative Cloud
which can be expensive for some users
dependency on technology like an
automation tool Adobe sensor relies on
technology which can be disadvantage if
there are technical issue it's important
to keep keep in mind that while AI can
help to generate ideas and create
stunning visuals I'm going to show you
exactly how you can generate these
yourself websites are going to be built
with AI art as well as tools like chat
GPD in future so in this video I'm going
to explain the whole process and we are
going to have it write the entire
Website Layout for us all the content
the hero section and feature section and
much more this means that we can build
an entire website from the ground up
without writing a single line of code
and this will be a pretty damn gool all
right we will start with the mid journey
in Google search we will
write
Journey this is an AI tool that allows
you to create the AI art that we are now
seeing all over the web to go to this
you just go to the mid journey.com and
join the beta it's easy to get started
because all you really have to do is
join the Discord when you do this it
will open up the Discord Community which
you can accept the terms and condition
and start creating your own AI Arts
let's do this
now here I have got the mid Journey
server and I'm going to head over to one
of the newcomer room here and and where
everyone is creating different types of
AI art the first thing we need to do is
uh to do a forward slash and type in an
imagine give us prompt
for
we can uh request the AI any type of art
we are after here I'm going to type uh
in a beautiful
website
for
shoe then I'm going to pass in dash
dash V4 which means
uh the version four of the mid journey
of AI tool finally I'm going to pass it
in style stylize I'll do dash dash
stylize it's basically how random we
want to be in uh it's it between 0 to
th000 and I'm just going to set it to
about 500 which is average so I will do
the enter it will take a little bit of
time here this will start working in the
background it's going to generate a low
Fidelity version of the website and the
design for this art and this low
Fidelity version will be iteratively
updated to be higher in resolution these
four examples then can be picked from
and then we can upscale them as well as
uh let's have a look at what kind of
results we get now one thing uh to
notice here is that we do get a bit of a
loading percentage bar and this is how
long it takes for the actual AI to
generate the image uh usually takes
between 1 to 2 minutes but it will
essentially refresh and ping you once
it's complete so here is it is complete
and here are the four versions that we
got which are not too bad uh not that
great either they are bit uh yeah I
suppose it's looking a funny in a way so
this is where we can start being more
creative with our prompts so what I mean
that uh is by giving more context as to
what we want to do so here is a prompt
that we have created what I'm going to
do is to pass it in the imagine once
more and I PES prompt in this and I'm
going to give some more context I'm
going to pass it to the word UI wait
choose UI
ux UI ux website this basically means
that it's more or less focused on having
good UI and good at ux and being more
like a website rather than just a
creative shoe or a design and it's
important to give these context clues to
the AI if you want better outputs
different types of uh context clues you
can provide is to find a kind of style
that you want uh for for example um how
you want the design to look and feel
whether you wanted to represent a
certain brand or much much more like
these are just simple examples but let's
take a look at the kind of results we
will get just from making these small
little changes to the design here here
you can already see uh wait a minute
look it's a little bit more interesting
we have a bit of our sliders and what
looks more like a Nike shoes and also
have uh uh what looks like a menu at the
top and and I really like this uh design
uh that we have here on the bottom and
here it is because it just look very
much like a website that we have got a
bit for a hero section or a hero set
section and what's not so from here we
can select the version one uh so from
here uh we can select uh the version 1 2
3 uh 4 to upscale and I'm going to
upscale version three where which is u3
and this will give us a higher
resolution version of this one
particular design that we can uh that we
can start to take uh to the market or
even you can use to bit this again uh
will take a little bit of time it's
going to process this and uh to do and
you can upscale in data and let's run
this in the background so that you can
see uh wait a minute this again will
take a little bit time to process it's
going to process this and do an unscare
or upscale in beta and let's run this in
the background so that you can guys see
what's the look look so here's the final
result and this is looking uh pretty and
we have got the nice design here for a
shoe uh we have got a bit of a hero
section and we also have what looks uh
like a two call to actions and we got
some option here to at the very bottom
and as well as at the top we have got
this colors and that essentially are
looking like these shoes colors being
used as a part of the website design so
not too shy uh let's select uh the
another one let's see
for yeah uh but I think we can do a
little bit more um in terms of
customization the design for this
website and I'm going to show you how
you can do this I'm going to copy over
this uh prompt once and for this prompt
this time I'm going to pass a couple of
extra things so let me just uh maximize
this
we are going to type um as I have uh
pasted that URL over here so I'm going
to pass uh in the context clues of like
uh clues of Nike because Nike made
obviously website showes so
also uh so we'll write it
here n
key right
here repeat and I also I want it to be
red
blue
green and
and or uh maybe uh
yellow and I suppose we want to uh else
uh running
person would be
interesting sorry
person uh it would be interesting to see
how that gets designed uh and I think
that this should be enough let's
actually improve the styling here uh 1
minute change the
styling
let's let's have it
750 uh to make it a little bit more
creative and here are the results I
don't have a running person but I do
have a website that has definitely
started using the colors that I
recommended uh with joury AI art systems
to use so the these website designs look
way more creative than we had previously
still we have this slider design these
website designs look way more creative
than we had previously we still have
this slider design here at the bottom
section where we can pick out different
shoes but even these shoes look damn
cool I can see that the Nike logo on
these and these are actually ones that I
would probably buy if I saw in the Nike
store but generally uh these also are
website because we we have got the menus
here at the top of the right uh we got
the text so generally speaking uh these
are pretty interesting interesting
designs so now I have another option
here called version 1 2 3 4 what this
does is actually allow you to pick uh
more Generations uh based on uh actual
image from these images or these designs
now from these design I actually like
the 12 three and four I think it is most
I think four cuz uh it teals and red or
it's a bit yellow or blue so I'm going
to select the version um four and that's
going to create uh four more version
based on the specific version for us
let's take a look at the what those that
we got and here here we have got our
results uh where we have more examples
of that all of these looks very similar
I think the only difference here is uh
Blue Line a red line it seems to be
shift and change as well as a hero
section and and you would normally have
this menu at the top right and something
these shoes here are a little bit
inverted but generally speaking this is
the kind of variations you can
expect now let's take a look at another
way we can generate Our Generations for
website now you can do is just uh jump
into any website and select any image so
first we will go to an app and website
and you can uh select any image that you
would like and I will actually go on
here and I'm going to pull in this image
of this shoe and
but I do like the design Aesthetics uh
here we are going to here and then we
can copy the URL from here but this time
what I'm going to do is type the
imagine
imagine then I'm going to pass uh in the
URL what we have copy uh we will paste
it
here again I'm going to write
we did it before we'll copy
this paste it over
here so what's going to happen here it's
uh it's going to have a look at this
image that we have defined in in terms
of the URL it's going to use this as a
reference point then it's uh going to
take a look at the prompt we have bon
which is the shoe prom using the colors
and it's going to try to
design a website that has a similar
Aesthetics to that image which is really
cool let's see the result we get back
looks like uh that's ready uh let's take
a look at this so here you can see that
the design is
Statics uh wait a minute static uh that
is uh similar to the page seen in this
one so this is more bubbly and colorful
image and now I represented very much so
in this design
Aesthetics uh we have these four
elements here at the bottom and if you
have a look at the design originally uh
we had four elements here so you can see
that it's pulling in these design
Aesthetics to create a design based on
that and this is where you can really
start using the air art repeat using the
air tool to your own benefits trying to
combine different styles customizing
them and creating new and independent
and unique ones from there so in this
four I'm really like uh uh the version
of fourth one or the second one is a
pretty so uh what I'm thinking of doing
is an upscale on this so so we are going
to upscale uh V2 and we are going to
wait for that uh 1 minute is uh use chat
GPD to write out the most of the content
for me and then I would I could take
this to a client to immediately start
sailing so let's see the upscale version
happen if we take a uh closer look we
will see that it has all the main
elements for a website including a logo
area uh a menu area a nice hero uh image
as well as a title tagline Button as
well the feature section uh so what I'm
going to do is to save this image to my
computer I'm going to save it and then
customize it a little bit but before we
do that uh we are going to head over to
a
GPD here we're going to prepare the
outline for the website using some AI
tools so here I'm going to ask thatp to
give me the Brad prod
outline for a website for
shoes including hero
title tagline call to action button and
section for features and details about
the shoe so let's see what charil will
comes back with um it's pretty quick uh
it's got a Title Here call to action
button features and detail section and
it's not really telling me what these
are these are where we might need to be
a bit more specific as to what we wanted
to do it's giving me uh it's giving me
like broad outline of the website on
what it needs so please please I will
write please
provide
then for each one of these that I can
copy
paste
straight to the
website um here title is here tagline
call to action
buttons
features
okay and the
details okay detail specification is
there okay reviews and
rating
okay so I think I have got enough hairs
to go by to Simply copy paste and the
website so let's start beginning to
design this I have opened this design up
in the Photoshop and I'm going to
actually just crop it into the main
element over here and I really want to
capture
this image and I will crop it and I will
clear out the rest and we can design
each aspects or each part of this
design bit by
bit I will save it over here
it's time to build our website so I'm
going to head over to editor
X and I'm going to build this uh a
website in this and I have login already
and then I will create to a new site and
here I will takeen to a web uh dashboard
and I'm going to start by cop copy paste
all the elements from chat gbd as well
as mid Journey straight and the first
thing and and I want to jump back into
the chat GPD here and copy over our hero
text so I will just take it
first and I'm going to T add title and
I'm going to paste it over
here
and then I'm also going to grab the tag
line but before I will make it sure to
keep it over
here before
that I will first I will put one image
over
here I will change the
image as I have already uh downloaded
the
image
let's upload that
image we'll open it and let's wait to
get
uploaded yeah it's uploaded and now we
will update
it let's make it big in
size okay so we
will we will change the size but first I
will remove this I will change the size
for this this I will make it little
small next I will add the icon
for uh for the company of the shes that
we I'm going to make a website for I
will add this and I will update
it make it
small
and this will be the task bar
but make the size uh small a bit
and
we'll insert one more
[Music]
picture and it will be the logo of the
company that we are going to put over
here we will minimize it we can resize
it can
keep
keep the logo over
here now next uh then I'm going also
going to grab the tag line over here so
I'll I'll pick this
tag I will add the
text comes up over
here
okay I'll make it small in
size and we will paste on
and finally Let's uh grab a call to
action which says
sh
and create a button button for that so
so here we have all the workings of what
we uh at least what we would need at
least so for for the
content let's resize this
first
now we will add uh we need to add the
image itself so instead of just having a
browser stock images or anything like
that we actually had our images either
done inside of the photoshops that we
have done before as from the Journey as
well as so I'm going to just
drag the
image and I'm going to change the
image and it should be here I've already
downloaded no I have to uploaded I have
a collections of
some shoes uh let's
see
and I will just install one I'll upload
this
picture it will take a bit of time let's
wait for a
while and once it's upload it we
will we will update it
I'm GL to
did
let's keep it like
this or we
can
e
e
so uh we change our content place from
that to make it a fix in a place so here
we can change this
also pretty
well

little bit
