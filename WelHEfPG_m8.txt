1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,040
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,559
tutorial my name is hen Baki and this

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,120
time we're going to be going over my

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,720
first iot video so to begin what is iot

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,480
I will be releasing another video on the

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,599
topic really going into depth about what

7
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:26,160
iot is and what it means however I'm

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,119
just going to quickly explain it

9
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:29,240
Internet of Things is quite

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,039
self-explanatory

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
it's literally just lots of things

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,360
connected to the internet so they can

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,040
all they can take their data and get

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,960
them analyzed by something like IBM

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,920
Watson which uses machine learning in

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,399
order to benefit you or someone else or

17
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,079
something for example your exercise

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,719
machines like your treadmill could

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,960
connect to your Apple watch and it could

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
give Health Data or exercise data and

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,520
your Apple watch could then send that to

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,000
your iPhone and have that processed by

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,199
Watson algorithms and stuff and finally

24
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:02,440
give you output in the form of what

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,640
workouts you should do how many calories

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
you burnt how what sort of meals you

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,119
should have if you want something really

28
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,920
faing but least calories that sort of

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,479
thing how much have you exercised have

30
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,240
you gone over your goal are you going

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,880
under your goal stuff like that and so

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,360
again tradeoff analytics with another

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,720
Watson service would be great for that

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,840
but continuing that's basically what iot

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,799
is however today I'm going to be showing

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,680
you how to be how to create a starter

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,640
iot app in Blu miix and so actually I I

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,439
met up with uh Marcus van kempen uh who

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,240
is an executive architect at IBM a few

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,000
days ago uh and so we were discussing

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,680
things like uh Watson hardware and

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
especially iot because that's where he's

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
sort of um working uh and so you know he

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,320
taught me a bit about this iot stuff

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,719
with blue miix and so as part of my

46
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,360
knowledge sharing uh t bakshi uh slogan

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,479
uh I'm going to be sharing my knowledge

48
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,280
about this with you so let's begin uh

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,680
and so to start now first of all I'm

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,000
going to be uh bringing to your eyes

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,560
another device that you probably have

52
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,239
not yet heard of it's called the ti uh

53
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,519
you know what give me one second oh

54
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,920
never mind about that okay so

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,640
TI sendor

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,480
kit now the ti sensor kit is just a

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,160
little device sometimes if you get it in

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,879
a red case I mean it could look like

59
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,879
this but never mind that it looks

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,160
however but basically it's a the ti

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,800
Texas instrument sensor kit has 14

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,920
sensors on there including humidity

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,000
temperature accelerometer gyroscope

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,560
magnetometer and uh the light meter

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
um and lots of things like that

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,959
basically um and so you know it has 14

67
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,560
sensors on there uh and all of them are

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,760
accessible via via

69
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,640
Bluetooth also one more device you

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,360
probably have heard of your

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
phone is something you're probably may

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,760
be using right now but uh basically you

73
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,720
all know what a phone looks like and all

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,920
phone looks different but basically it

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,640
has one main sensor that no JS can

76
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,959
easily access which is the location

77
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,599
sensor okay and so B basically what

78
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,680
we're going to do is we're going to use

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,080
a node.js app coded by Marcus um and so

80
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,000
basically we're going

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,560
to use the location sensor on the phone

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
to Output stuff on node red which is a

83
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,239
Blu miix service and also something

84
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,640
created by IBM and then we're also going

85
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,319
to use later the sensor kit with node

86
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,319
red and output sensor data but then in

87
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,200
part two actually I'm going to be

88
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,840
describing to actually how to create

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
this stuff uh and then in part three I'm

90
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,120
going to be showing you a actual sort of

91
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,680
practical example okay let's

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,040
continue so now let's look at the blumi

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,159
side of things now in blue

94
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,480
miix all we're really going to do is

95
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,320
first of all um

96
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,320
deploy um

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,240
sorry we're going to

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,120
deploy Marcus

99
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,360
sample so basically um Marcus has

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,479
prepared some sample code for us to work

101
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,400
off of and so we're going to deploy that

102
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,639
to Blu miix and then we're going to

103
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,280
create a

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,000
node

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,560
red starter

106
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,560
app okay so a node red

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
starter so that's basically all we need

108
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,919
to do on the Bloomix side however

109
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,560
there's also going to you're going to

110
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,039
have to use another device called a

111
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,880
Macbook or a Mac actually just Mac OSX

112
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,919
the operating system and so basically

113
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,720
you have to have a Mac with Bluetooth

114
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,520
low energy uh enabled Hardware I mean

115
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,080
this could work for Windows and Linux

116
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,759
but I will I might be putting links in

117
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,360
the description uh that contain links to

118
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
repos that may help you uh with

119
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,160
connecting the ti sensor kit to uh Linux

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
or Windows but then again you have to

121
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,759
have Bluetooth low energy on your system

122
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm not exactly sure if uh there are

123
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
scripts online for that but I will try

124
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,960
to find them and put them in the

125
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,080
description if they are

126
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,440
existing okay so now first of all what

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,080
our goal is is to take this phone sensor

128
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,759
data location sensor data

129
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,039
specifically and bring it over to Blue

130
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,560
miix and specifically debug it into node

131
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,919
red how are we going to do this let's

132
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,800
begin once we deploy Marcus's sample

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,039
this is essentially going to be

134
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,039
accessible from both node red and the

135
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,560
phone so what we're going to do is once

136
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,960
we have the sort of host name in Blu

137
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,360
miix I'm sure you've used Blu miix

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,319
before once we have a host name in Blu

139
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,960
miix uh then we're going to take that

140
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,280
host name and run that website on to our

141
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,199
phone so we're going

142
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,599
to open up the website on our phone now

143
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,440
it's going to ask uh first of all if

144
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
you're on iOS It'll ask you if you can I

145
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,080
think Android does this as well but

146
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,599
it'll ask you uh if you want if you like

147
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,000
to allow this website to access your

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,280
location sensors and probably say yes

149
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,840
because of course you want it to be able

150
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,000
to access your

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,720
location then uh It'll ask you to enter

152
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,599
a um unique identifier for your phone

153
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:45,039
which I mean anything tan May whatever

154
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,240
will work your name actually but it must

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,280
contain only letters and numbers uh no

156
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,039
spaces uh and so uh once that's done uh

157
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,840
this will start posting um location

158
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,360
sensor data into the uh cloud and DB

159
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,560
database uh on the app uh and so now

160
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,520
this also this app also contains a iot

161
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,960
starter Foundation kit Service uh and so

162
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,680
basically that uh service can be

163
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,360
connected with node red so let's just

164
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,879
say we have that iot service here and so

165
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,160
basically what I'm going to do is I'm

166
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,440
going to connect Marcus's deploy app

167
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,960
deployed app to this iot and then this

168
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,639
iot into no node red and then what we

169
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,280
can do is from node red print out stuff

170
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,759
so we can print out location sensor

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,039
data location data okay that's that

172
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,720
that's how we would get location sensor

173
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,440
data from our phone whether it be

174
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,199
Android iOS whatever we're going to take

175
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,919
this put it into Blu miix specifically

176
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,800
the app which goes to an iot Foundation

177
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,520
starter kit um Service uh come over here

178
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
uh and then goes into the node red

179
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,159
starter which will then print out

180
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,520
location data from the phone that's that

181
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,159
but how are we then going to connect our

182
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,120
sensor kit to Blu miix well this is how

183
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,240
do we do it how we do it first of all

184
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,919
we're going to configure some settings

185
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,400
in the iot we're going to um start

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,080
working here and stuff so nothing really

187
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,440
that I can explain right now we're going

188
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,759
to have to do that in the implementation

189
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,120
part which is the next part okay so in

190
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,159
the iot we're going to do some settings

191
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,719
fiddle around here and there uh so they

192
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,320
can actually recognize the sensor kit

193
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
however next what we're going to do is

194
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,080
pretend actually what we're going to do

195
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,480
is via Bluetooth low energy b l e

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,880
Bluetooth low energy uh we're going

197
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,120
to establish a sort of bir

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,880
directional communication protocol

199
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
which can essentially allow the sensor

200
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,959
kit and the Mac to communicate with each

201
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,240
other and then what we're going to do is

202
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
in a

203
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,079
nodejs I hope you can see this

204
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,360
node.js um thing in the nodejs script in

205
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,480
the Mac uh side we are actually going to

206
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,040
take this BL this uh TI sensor kit um

207
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,240
location data magnetometer data every

208
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,440
single for every single one of the 14

209
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,440
sensors on this uh little board we're

210
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,440
going to take that sensor data uh bring

211
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,959
it into node.js and then into straight

212
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,480
skip Marcus's app it's just going to go

213
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,160
straight into the iot service which of

214
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,519
course node red is already connected to

215
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,240
and so then finally we can print out

216
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,680
TI uh sensor kit SK

217
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,720
data now what is an example use of this

218
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,240
sensor kit well let me

219
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,040
explain now let's pretend now in this

220
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,000
example we're using location data so

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,760
since the sensor kit has acceler uh

222
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,680
acceleration uh and motion uh motion

223
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,440
location data let's say you're shaking

224
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,240
it really fast like just really shaking

225
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,360
it it'll start speaking I mean not

226
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,440
speaking because it doesn't have a

227
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,279
speaker on board but it can actually

228
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,160
print out to node red please stop

229
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,120
shaking me something like that how and

230
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
let's say you bring it down really low

231
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,320
it's going to use that location data and

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,480
print out to to node red please please

233
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,160
raise me up something like that and so

234
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
then you can continue on and say get the

235
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,279
magnet away from me if the magnet

236
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,639
magnetometer data is really high stuff

237
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,399
like that that's just an idea so now uh

238
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,360
in the next part we're going to be

239
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,880
talking about uh how to implement this

240
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,920
in blue mix and then some more practical

241
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,200
examples like please pick me up from the

242
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,399
ground that's going to be it for today I

243
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,600
