hey everyone welcome to another video by
simpler
i am sure you must have watched our
previous videos on uipath if you haven't
watched them already i would suggest you
to go through easy tutorials on every
topic on uipath
uipath is a well known rpa tool it has
grown in popularity over the years
and it is now used by organizations all
over the world
uipath assists business in successfully
automating their business process
if you are planning to attend an
interview for an rpa or ui part
developer role here is a comprehensive
list of most frequently asked ui path
interview questions with answers
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell icon so you never
miss an update from simply learn
so without wasting any further time
let's get started
what is ui path
this question looks simple but people
most of the time end up giving wrong
definition
uipath is a robotic process automation
tool for large-scale end-to-end
automation
for an accelerated business change it
provides solution for business to
automate routine office activities
it uses a variety of methods to
transform tedious tasks into automated
process
what are the different components in ui
ui path consists of three components
mainly ui path studio ui patch studio is
a user friendly interface that allows
users to visually plan and design
various automation process through
diagrams using the drag and drop
functionality
these diagrams are merely a structural
reflection of specific tasks that must
be completed
uipath robot after you have built your
process the next move is to put into
action in the uipath studio
uipath robots are used to translate the
strategies into tasks which are then
executed
these robots are used to assign various
tasks and carry them out in the same
manner as humans but without human
interference when given an operation
occurs on the computer they program
uipath robots to begin executing task
automatically
uipath orchestrator the orchestrator is
a web-based application in uipath
it has features for deploying monitoring
scheduling and controlling automated
bots and process
it's a centralized forum for managing
and maintaining all software bots
what are the different workflows in
uipath
sequences
a sequence is a small type of project
that is best suited for linear process
it enables developers to transition from
one activity to another easily they can
be reused numerous times
flowchart
it can be used for large or small
projects that help in development of
complex business and connecting
activities in a variety of ways
flowcharts assist in the presentation of
multiple branches of logical operators
state machine
a state machine is a machine that uses a
certain number of states for automation
during execution
it will only change states if an action
is performed on it let's look at the
next question
what is a ui path robot
the robot is a ui path execution agent
allowing you to run process created in
the studio
in order to execute process robots must
be connected to the orchestrator or
licensed locally
what are the different components of
uipath robot
service the robot service is the primary
controller for all operations
it communicates with studio the robot
agent and the robot command line
interface by an inter-process
communication channel to receive and
process information
executor the robot executor is the
component that is directly responsible
for process execution
the robot service creates a robot
executor instance every time a job is
started
command line interface the robot command
line interface is a console application
that starts jobs and waits for the
results
uipath assistant is a tool designed
specifically to improve the user's
interaction with our robots from the
comfort of the desktop it is where users
can easily access manage and run
automation with a few clicks
what is the difference between attended
and unattended robot
attended robots are supervised robots
that humans operate
they work on the same workstation as a
human user and is triggered by user
events
unattended robots
unattended robots are those that do not
require human supervision to perform
tasks
they run in virtual environments without
human control and can automate any
number of process
what are the features of uipath
drag and drop workflow the uipath user
will develop visual process steps by
dragging and dropping related tasks onto
the graphical workspace then with the
user interface properties they can
transform these process steps into a
visual workflow users may also use the
recorder wizard in the uipath tool to
build web-based or application workflow
record and playback the user can use
this function to record actions and
transform them into an automated process
series
inbuilt activities in uipath ui path
comes with over 300 built-in activities
covering a wide range of process
automation and application integrated
design task
you can find these activities in
activities pane which covers most design
tasks such as data extraction data entry
and automation
advanced scraping options scraping data
from web pages and applications is more
accessible with ui path screen scraping
furthermore the data scraping wizard
helps in the scraping of data with a
repetitive structure
scraping solution works flawlessly with
any program including dotnet java flash
pdf legacy and sap
high security and robustness you can
create super smart durable robots with
uipath visual canvas everyone in the
company can use these boards uipath
offers high security auto login
functionality to run the bots and
operates with a locked screen allowing
automated process to run in complete
privacy
what are the different recording options
in uipath
basic recording it focuses on automating
single task and is commonly used to
develop each activity's complete
selector
desktop recording it can be used for a
variety of actions as well as
application development
web recording web recording is a
standard tool for viewing and recording
web activities
citrix recording it is very widely used
for recording stuff like pictures and
virtualized environment automation
what is a manage package in ui path
the package manager functionality allows
to download activities packages
libraries frameworks wrappers and others
and view and update the ones already
installed for the project and add and
remove it
it displays the list of available
packages per feed and a list of
dependencies for the current project
the manage package windows always opens
with the project dependencies list
how to publish a project in uipath
to publish a project in uipath first
create a new project
then in the design ribbon tab click
publish the publish window will open
in the package properties tab enter the
name for package then click next
in the publish options tab select the
location where you want to publish your
project and finally the information
dialog box displays
so let's see a demo
how is it done
so let's jump in the ui patch studio
so here we are in ui patch studio
let's open our workflow
i'll drag and drop a simple message box
just to show
enter a message say
hey
so i have created a simple workflow just
to show you how to publish project in
uipath
so here you can see the publish option
once you have created the project go to
the ribbon tab and click on the publish
when you click the publish window opens
here you can change the package name if
you want you can see the version new
version package icon
and release notes
so let's click on next
here you will get the custom url
where you want to publish to
then click on publish
here you go you can see publishing
package
so a info dialog box appears
project published successfully
if you want you can copy to the
clipboard
so this is how the project is published
in the ui path
what is data scraping and screen
scraping
data scraping is the process of
extracting structured data from a
browser application or document and
saving it to a database or a dot csv
file or even an excel spreadsheet
screen scraping methods are activities
that allow data to be extracted from a
specific ui element or document such as
a dot pdf file
explain the different types of
automation in uipath
excel automation excel automation is a
useful tool for sorting deleting
retrieving and analyzing data
it is simple to migrate and integrate
data into platforms
studio x has a strong integration with
microsoft excel and ships with several
activities that automate excel task
mail automation enables task automation
with emails from the outlook desktop
application gmail and outlook 365.
add the activities that use data from
the account inside the resource activity
after adding the account to the
automation as a resource using a used
outlook 365. use gmail or use desktop
outlook app activity
word automation in the word automation
add the word document to be worked on by
using a word file activity and then add
the word activities to automate within
the use word file
powerpoint automation
powerpoint automation allows the user to
automate the most common task in
powerpoint presentation at the
presentation to work with the use
powerpoint presentation activity and
then inside the use powerpoint
presentation add the presentation
activities to automate
file automation
it refers to the automation of task
performed on your computer with files
and folders such as creating copying or
renaming files and folders
studio x includes several activities
that automate tasks that you perform
with files and folders
csv automation
in csv automation
add the csv activities inside the use
excel file activity where the excel file
is defined to move data between csv and
excel
explain a few read and write activities
read range read range reads the values
of an excel range and stores in a data
table variable
read cell reads the values of an excel
cell and stores in a variable
read csv reads all entries from a
specified csv file
write range writes data from a data
table variable to a spreadsheet
write cell writes a value or formula
into a specified spreadsheet cell
write csv overwrites a specified data
table to a csv file
what is an excel application scope
excel application scope opens an excel
workbook and sets the scope for excel
activities
when this activity is completed the
specified workbook and excel application
are closed
what is an orchestrator
uipath orchestrator is a web application
that orchestrates the execution of
repetitive process
it manages the creation monitoring
scheduling and controlling of bots and
process
it can manage the entire robot fleet
name some orchestrator capabilities
provisioning
provisioning establishes and maintains
the connection between the robots and
the web application
deployment ensures that it delivers the
correct package versions to the assigned
robots for execution
configuration looks after the
maintenance and delivery of robot
environments and process configuration
queues ensures that it automatically
distributes the workload across robots
monitoring manages user permissions and
keeps track of robot recognition details
logging
logs are stored and indexed in an sql
database
explain process job asset and queue
the process page allows you to build new
process from uploaded packages managing
existing process and keep all of your
process up to date with the latest
package version
jobs
on an uipath robot a job represents the
execution of procedure it can start the
execution of job in either attended or
unattended mode
cues a queue is a storage container that
can accommodate an infinite number of
objects multiple types of data such as
invoice information or customer data are
stored in queue objects
other systems such as sap or salesforce
are used to process this data
assets assets are usually shared
variables or credentials that can be
used through several automation projects
they allow you to store unique
information that the robots can easily
access
how to connect a robot to the
orchestrator
step 1 open uipath assistant
step 2 sign in the uipath orchestrator
step 3 create a
tenant step 4 connect the robot to the
orchestrator
and step 5
check the status
it shows connected and licensed
so let's see a demo of how to do this
so let's jump into the uipath studio
open you step one open uipath assistant
so we'll open uipath assistant
after opening uipath assistant
login to the uipath orchestrator
so go to the browser
go to the browser and type
platform.uipart.com
this will take to the uipath website
so sign in
if you're new to this if you don't have
the account
then you can
enter all the details and login
since i've already created an account
i'll sign in
after logging in the uipath orchestrator
go to the admin
here you can create a new tenant
you can add a tenant here and create a
new tenant since i have already created
a tenant named admin
so after creating a tenant connect the
robot to the orchestrator
go to the ui path assistant
go to preferences
go to preferences
go to orchestrator settings
here you can see the status it is
offline
click on the sign in button
once you click on the sign in button
allow this open uipath
here you can see it is connecting
and you can see
it is connected and licensed
so the ui path robot is now connected
with the orchestrator
what is a tenant context and folder
context
in tenant context to view and control
tenant level entities in the
orchestrator pick tenant from the
sidebar menu with only one instance of
the orchestrator multi-tenancy allows
isolating data
for the folder context from the sidebar
menu pick any available folder to view
and control the entities within the data
folder
so i'll show you let's
go to the orchestrator
so
let's go to the orchestrator
here you can see this is the tenant
context
to view and control the tenant level
entities in orchestrator you can pick
the tenant from the sidebar
menu from the sidebar menu pick any
available folder so these are the
folders pick any available folder to
view and control the entities within
that folder so this is with respect to
the folder context
what is an re framework
the robotic enterprise framework is a
state machine based project template
it allows to handle even the most
complex business situations it's
designed to incorporate all of the
industry's best practices for logging
exception management application
initialization and other areas
what are the features of re framework
settings
during the initialization phase of
several process some configuration
settings and configuration values are
frequently read
like urls to a web application
orchestrator queue names and default
logging messages
logging
the built-in locking mechanism is
another helpful feature of the framework
the majority of the system's workflows
use log message activities to output
information about what is happening at
each execution stage
business exception
if the issue is with the data or any
underlying business requirement the
system skips the transaction and moves
on to the next search exceptions are
known as business exceptions
application exception if the issue can
be resolved by restarting applications
the framework will do so automatically
and attempt to process the transaction
again search exceptions are known as
application exceptions
how to merge two excel files into a
single excel file
first we need to create a sequence
after creating a sequence we need a few
activities like read csv activity assign
activity data table activity and write
cs file activity
so we'll drag and drop all these
activities and do the process
then we'll run the sequence and see the
output
so let's jump into the ui path studio
and start with the
workflow
so we are in the uipath studio
i have already created a sequence you
can go to new and create a sequence or
press ctrl n
so after starting a sequence first we
will drag and drop
read csv activity
since we are using two excel files
so we need to read csv activity
we will drag and drop another read csv
activity
so we will select the location of the
first excel file
select the first excel file
i'll show you
both the excel files which we are
merging
so this is the first excel file so it
has five rows
five names
so we'll this is the first excel file
and
this is the second excel files
this excel file has five different names
and the other excel file has five
different rows
so these are the two excel files will
merge both these excel files into a
single new excel file
so we'll close this excel files
so in the first read csv activity
we have copied the location of the first
excel file in the output 2 we will
select this
and create a variable right click and
create a variable and let's say name the
variable as sl underscore 5 1
we have named the variable
okay now we'll
go to another read csv file and select
the location of the second file
so i have downloaded this sample excel
files from the internet
just for the demo
right click and create a variable
let's say name this variable as sl
underscore file two
so now that we have dragged and dropped
to read csv activities now next we need
assign activity
so drag and drop assign activity
so assign activity has two parameters as
you can see two and enter a vb
expression
in the two parameter in this right click
and create a variable
and name the variable
let's say merged
essay
after naming the variable enter an
expression here
so enter the expression
as sl underscore file 1 which is the
variable for file 1 select this
and enter the expression dot clone
what this clone function does is the
clone function creates a new data table
with the same structure
but does not copy the data so we are
creating a new excel file that is the
third file in which we are merging the
data tables of both the excel file so
the third excel file which we are
creating will have the same structure as
the file one so this clone function
creates a third excel file with the same
structure as the file one
so it's showing an error so select this
assign
let's go to variables
here you can see variable type string
change it to system dot data dot data
table
and here you go the error is gone
okay
so now we have dragged and dropped
assign activity the next activity which
we need
is merge data table activity
let's search for
merge
data table activity
drag-and-drop
modulatable activity
we need to merge data table activity
since we have two excel files
select the first merge data table
activity go to the destination
and enter the destination which is the
variable which we created in the assign
activity the merged is so
enter this
and enter the source file
that is the variable which you created
in file one
that is sl underscore
file one
similarly similarly
go to merge data table
and
enter the same destination
but here the source will be the second
file
okay
now that we have dragged and dropped too
much data tables the next activity we
need is a write csv file
so we'll search for write csv file
after dragging and dropping write csv
activity
go to file path
and create a file
create a file say
one will name it as
file
three
safety file
now that we have created the file
we will write from the data table that
is we need to copy the merge data table
so we'll enter
now that we have finished the program
the file is created let's save
and run it
process execution has started and ended
so
let's go to the file
so this is the file which we created
let's open this file
and here you can see
both the excel files have been merged
into a single excel file
let's go to the next question how to
send a file over at mail
so first create a sequence and create a
file after you have created a file drag
and drop get password activity
then drag and drop a smtp mail message
activity so basically these two
activities are used to send a file over
me
then run the sequence
so we'll jump into the ui path studio
and
see so this was the previous question
which we answered
how to merge two excel files so the same
file we will send it over and mail
so we need a get password activity
so we'll drag and drop a get password
activity
so if you go to the properties section
enter the password to whichever
mail you are sending riffs file enter
the password of that mail id
after entering the password in the
result go and create a variable
so that password is stored in that
variable so name the variable say
anything any randomly
so i've named the variable
after
after this you need a smtp mail message
activity
so drag and drop send smtp mail message
in smtp mail message
under the properties pane under the host
enter the port value
for the port number which is 587
after entering the port number go to the
server
and enter it as smtp.gmail.com
okay
now after entering the email id
go to your email and enter your email id
to which you want to send this file
don't forget to use double quotes
otherwise it will show an error
enter the password
so we had showed the password in the
variable say sss
so
we'll write that
so after that
enter the email id here under the two
option
and enter the subject
say it has demo since we are showing a
demo
we will enter the subject as demo this
is the this subject and body
is the subject and body of the
mail
now let's attach the file which we have
created
copy the file location
so we'll go to the file
and copy this file location
after attaching the file
let's save
android
the process has started
and the process has ended here you can
see in the
the output
has started and the process has ended
let's go over the mail and check if we
have received
here we go we have received the file
let's open the file
and here you go the same this is the
same file which had merged the data
so the file has been sent over the mail
one thing you have to keep in mind
when you use the get password activity
go to your google account in the
security section
go to this secure app access and turn it
on
you have to turn it on to receive the
file over and mail
explain the different states and
transitions in re framework
there are four key states in re
framework
the first state is initial state this is
the point at which the procedure begins
it's an event where the process
initializes the settings and runs
application test to ensure that all of
the prerequisites for the process start
are met
next we have get transaction state
this state retrieves the next
transaction object this can be a queue
item or a collection item
transaction items are queue items by
default but this can be modified to meet
your needs this is also when the
developer can set the condition to exit
the state when there are no items to
process
process transaction state
for the transaction item obtained in
previous step it performs actions logic
in various application
if a transaction item has been processed
the process moves on to the next
transaction item available
end process state
the procedure is completed and the
applications open during automations are
closed in the end process state
let's jump into the ui path studio
and see the different transitions in
robotic enterprise framework
so this is the robotic enterprise
framework this is the initialization
state the first state so it has two
transitions
system error that is system exception
and successful
when it shows system exception when a
system error is not nothing it gets
transition to the end process
suppose if you have an application
exception during the initialization
phase and we don't have enough details
to start a process then as a result we
are going to end process state to wrap
it up
and the successful is when a system
error is nothing it gets transition to
get transaction state
if during initialization we have no
error then it goes to the get
transaction data
the get transaction data
has two transitions
no data and
new transaction
no data is when if the transaction item
is nothing then we are at the end of our
data collection so it goes to the end
process and in new transaction if the
transaction item contains data then it
processes it
the process transaction data has three
transitions
success business exception and system
exception success is when if the
condition is business rule exception is
nothing and system error is nothing then
the transition to get transaction data
if there is a business rule exception it
is logged and we move on to the next
transaction
and rule exception is if the business
rule exception is not nothing then it
gets transaction to the get transaction
data
and the end process does not have any
transition since the end process is the
final state so there are no transitions
what is a g-suite activity
the uipath g-suite activity package
helps in the automation of google
workspace applications such as google
calendar google drive
google sheets
gmail
google docs you can create and modify
google calendar events manage google
drive files read and send gmail messages
and create new google sheets
spreadsheets and google documents with
the google g-suite activity package
what are selectors and wildcards in ui
path
wildcards are the symbols that enable
you to replace zero or multiple
characters in a string this can be quite
useful when dealing with dynamically
changing attributes in a selector
selectors uipath studio uses what we
call selectors this store the attributes
of graphical user interface element and
its parents in the shape of an xml
fragment the selectorates in the
automatic generation of the selection by
utilizing wildcards
what is a machine explain standard
machine and machine template
the machine page allows you to provision
and manages machines to use them to
register robots with orchestrator
it displays the types of machine that we
currently in use it enables you to
design your machine whether standard or
template
standard machine it should be used when
the name of the machine on which you
want to define robots is the same every
time you connect to it you define the
machine once and then you can connect to
as many robots as you want from the
robots page
machine template it should be used
whenever the name of the machine on
which you want to define robot changes
you represent this entity once and then
you use a unique active directory
username to connect to any number of
attended floating robots
explain delay do if and switch
activities in uipath
the delay activity allows you to pause
the automation for a specified amount of
time
this activity is beneficial in projects
that require precise timing such as
waiting for a specific application to
start or for some information to be
processed before using it in the another
activity
the do activity allows you to run a
specific piece of automation while the
condition is met
the project exits the loop when the
specified condition is no longer
completed this activity can be used to
iterate through all the array elements
or execute a specific action multiple
times
if activity the if activity includes a
statement as well as two conditions
if the statement is true the first
condition is executed if the statement
is false the second condition is
executed if activities can be used to
make decision based on variable values
switch activity the switch activity
allows you to choose one of the several
options based on the value of specified
expression the switch activity uses an
integer argument by default
but you can change it in the properties
panel under the type argument list the
switch activity can be used to
categorize data based on predefined
number of cases
how to create chart in excel
step 1 create a new sequence go to the
ui path studio and create a new sequence
and then
drag and drop the following activities
to create a chart we need to use excel
application scope create table activity
and bar chart and pie chart activity
depending on which type of charts you
want to create
then at last after completing then run
the sequence
we will see a demo of this in the uipath
studio
how to upload a file on drive
so create a new sequence and drag and
drop a g-suite application
then inside g-suite application drag and
drop upload file activity fill in the
details
and finally run the suite let's go and
see a demo to how to create charts in
excel file and how to upload a file on
your drive
so let's jump into the ui path studio
this is the excel file which i have
created
it has all the number of cases in this
five states in the year 2021 the month
of jan feb march and april all this
record i have taken it from a website
called prsindia dot org
so i have two sheets sheet one and sheet
two
so let's jump into the uipath studio
to start off with the demo we need to
have the three packages installed
one is the uipath excel activities
package the other one is uipath g suite
dot activities this activity this
package is used for
drive top load on the drive
then
the other package is
balareva excel activities this package
is used for bar graph and pie chart
so
after installing these three packages
we'll get started
so let's create a new sequence
name it as sequence
2
so first we'll drag and drop an excel
application scope
so excel application scope what it does
is it opens an excel workbook and sets
the scope for excel activities when this
activity is completed the specified
workbook and the excel applications are
closed when the workbook application
variable is specified in the output
workbook activities field the
spreadsheet is not closed
after this drag and drop
create table activity
so by default we have sheet 1 and
enter the range
so the range is in this excel sheet the
range is from a1 to f5
so enter the range
for this
we need to enter the file path so we'll
select the file
so we have selected the file
we have entered the
entire table name
say
number of cases
so once this much is done
next we'll drag and drop a bar chart
drop it outside the excel application
scope
and select the file path
so select the file
so select the file
select this cell range
that is the same range what we had
entered earlier
a1
to s5
so once that is done if the chart title
say basis
and you can select the chart type
barge tag 3d clustered 3d stand whatever
is required
for now we will select bar cluster
we have many other options to explore
data label type
will keep it in
show value so that it shows the value
and
select
show value
if you want to show percentage you can
select percentage
and select show legend
and size
you can vary the size accordingly how
much ever you want
so i'll keep the size
as 350
to 350
you can change the width
so the bar chart is done
and you can enter the sheet which sheet
are you using so it's sheet one
so we will drag and drop pie chart
select the file
similarly enter the options here
enter the cell range
the same range
a1 is to f5
show percent will show value
show legend
select show value
and select the sheet which you are we'll
select the sheet 2
so done
so we have completed till here
next we need to upload this on the
google drive so
we'll select this option upload file
select the file
so we have selected define
so select the destination folder
for that
go to your google drive account
so we will go there
so in my drive i have created a folder
called excel automation
so i'll copy this
url
till here not the entire
copy this
and
go to your ui patch studio and paste it
in the destination folder
delete double quotes
then create a variable and
create a variable as file
oops there is an error
oh we have forgotten to use a g-suit
application
this can be only used inside a g-suite
application
so drag and drop a g-suite application
and inside g-suite application
will write this so there is god
so we'll run the file now
we'll save it
and
run
you can see the file is getting
run
so the execution is ended
we will
navigate to the drive
so here you can see
the file is successfully uploaded will
open the file
it's working on the graph
here you go here you can see the bar
graph
for the sheet one
with the values
number of values and each state was and
for sheet2
we created a pie chart so here you go
here you can see the puzzle
