hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on lean thinking at simply learn
do you know friends that lean thinking
is a management philosophy originating
from Toyota's production system lean
thinking focuses on maximizing value
while minimizing waste emphasizing
continuous Improvement and respect for
people it aims to streamline processes
reduce inefficiencies and also enhance
productivity by identifying and by
eliminating value adding activities by
applying lean principles such as just in
time production and continuous flow
organizations can optimize operations
enhance customer satisfaction and
Achieve sustainable growth now before we

the agenda for our today's session so
guys we are going to start our session
with an introduction to what is lean
thinking moving ahead we will discuss
about what is the goal of lean thinking
then we will deep into five principles
of lean thinking and at the end we're
going to conclude our sessions with lean
tools and
techniques craving a career upgrade

the description box so guys let's start
with what is lean thinking did you know
that Google the big tech company got
some cool ideas from the car factory to
make it software better they looked at
how Toyota makes cars and thought hey we
can do that too but with the software
Google wanted to make its apps and step
faster and better so they borrowed a
trick from Toyota called lean thinking
it's all about making things that people
want and cutting out the stuff they
don't need first Google listened how to
what users wanted then they looked at
how they make softwares from start to
finish they found places where things
got slow or messy and fixed them up
instead of making a bunch of stuff and
hoping people like it Google started
making just what people needed right
when they needed it and that's the way
they didn't waste time or energy but the
coolest part Google made a culture where
everyone always trying to make things
better they call it continuous
Improvement it's like they are always
trying to find out new stuffs and making
changes to make their software awesome
so the Google didn't just make better
software they also showed that you can
learn cool stuff from unexpected places
like car factories and use it to make
own things better sounds very cool now
lean thinking is a management philosophy
and operational strategy aimed at
maximizing customer value while
minimizing the waste it is originated
from Toyota's production system and has
been widely adopted across Industries
worldwide at its score lean thinking
focuses on creating more value for
customers with fewer Resources by
identifying and eliminating activities
that do not contribute to this value
lean thinking emphasizes respect for
people empowering employees to
contribute ideas for improvement and
fostering a culture of continuous
learning and Innovation by applying lean
principles and tools such as value
stream mapping 5S methodology can ban
system and many more organizations can
enhance efficiency quality customer
satisfaction while reducing cost and
Lead times now let us move on and
discuss about what are the goals of lean
thinking so guys the goal of lean
thinking is to maximize customer value
while minimizing the waste this
overarching objective is achieved
through several key aims the first one
is value creation identify and
understand what customers perceive as
valuable and focus resources on
delivering that value efficiently next
one is continuous Improvement they
Foster a culture of continuous
Improvement also known as Kaizen
throughout the organization where all
employees are empowered to identify and
Implement incremental changes to enhance
processes products and services and
finally we have streamlined processes
with this they optimize workflows and
production systems to ensure smooth and
efficient operations with minimal delays
and bottlenecks and also interruptions
so these were some of the goals of lean
thinking now let us move on and try to
understand the principles of lean
thinking so guys the principles of lean
thinking are as follows the first one is
defining value second one is value
stream mapping third one is creating a
flow fourth one is establishing a pull
and the fifth one is continuous
Improvement now let us move on and
discuss each one of them one by one
so the first one is value so guys if I
talk about value it means that you're
going to identify and understand the
specific value that customers are
willing to pay for it this involves
defining value from the customers's
perspective and focusing efforts and
resources on delivering that value next
one is value stream mapping so guys here
in this scenario you are going to map
the entire value stream for a product or
a service from raw materials to delivery
to the the customer this includes
identifying all the steps and processes
involved both value adding and non-value
adding to understand how value is
created and where waste exists third one
we have all over here is creating a flow
you're going to ensure the smooth and
continuous flow of work or production
throughout the value stream you're going
to minimize interruptions delays bash
processing to facilitate a seamless flow
of materials informations and activities
next one we have all over here is pull
so guys while creating a pull you're
going to implement pull based production
systems where goods or services are
produced in response to actual customer
demand rather than forecaster demand
this helps reduce inventory levels
minimize over production and improve
responsiveness to customer needs and
finally we have is continuous
Improvement here you're going to strive
for continuous Improvement and
perfection in all aspects of
organization this involves relentlessly
eliminating waste optimizing processes
empowering employees to contribute to
Improvement efforts and pursuing
excellence in quality efficiency and
customer satisfaction these principles
serves as a guiding Frameworks for
organizations seeking to adopt lean
thinking and drive sustainable
improvements in producti quality and
customer value so Guys these were some
of the key principles of the lean now
let us move on and discover lean tools
and techniques so guys the first one
that we have all over here that is 5S
methodology it is a systematic approach
to workplace organization and
cleanliness consisting of sort set in
order shine standardized and sustain 5S
aims to create a clean organized and
efficient work environment next one we
have all over here is value stream
mapping a value stream mapping is a
visual representation of the endtoend
process flow highlighting both value
added and non-value adding activities
value stream mapping helps identify
opportunities for improvement and waste
reduction next one we have is Kaizen
events it is a short-term focused
Improvement projects aimed at addressing
specific issues or opportunities within
a process of workflow Kaizen events
involve cross functional teams working
together to implement rapid improvements
next one we have is just in time
production producing goods or services
only when they are needed in the
quantity required and at the right time
is called Just in Time jit helps
minimize inventory levels reduce lead
times and improve responsiveness to
customer demand next one we have is can
ban systems can ban system is a visual
scheduling system that uses cards or
signals to control the flow of work
through a process Canan helps balance
workloads reduce over production and
maintain optimal inventory levels next
one is po yog which is a error proofing
here you're going to design processes or
systems to prevent errors or defects
from occurring POC yog techniques
include using visual cues mistake
proofing device and automated checks to
eliminate mistakes at the source next
one we have is total productive
maintenance or TPM it is a systematic
approach to equipment maintenance aimed
at maximizing machine availability
reliability and performance TPM focuses
on proactive maintenance employee
involvement and continuous Improvement
and finally we have is continuous flow
here you are going to design processes
to achieve a smooth continuous flow of
work or production with minimal
interruptions or delays Continuous Flow
helps reduce cycle times eliminate
bottlenecks and also optimize resource
utilization so Guys these were some of
the lean tools and techniques which is
generally employed in the industry to
improve the product development so guys
