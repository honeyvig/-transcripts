hey guys this is dr. Dana Joshi and I
would be taking a bit of discussion on
vaccines and vaccinations so starting
from what the vaccine is it is basically
a immuno biological substance designed
to produce a specific protection against
the given disease whichever disease
occurs we are providing an advanced
protection against it so it is a kind of
what we are prophylactically immune in
other selves so it is an type of immuno
prophylaxis and this is octet this gives
us an artificial acquired active type of
an immunity no Tom vaccine was coined by
you is first pasture first however later
the term vaccination must given by
Edward Jenner who developed the first
vaccine of smallpox in year 1798 right
so this was a first major breakthrough
for the discovery of vaccine through by
Edward Sir Edward Jenner later on or
other vaccines were also discovered so
if you have a brief history of vaccines
and it's difficult sometimes to remember
each and every year so how you can
remember is write a briefly kind of an
remembering in which our T's is occurs
that the first vaccine that was invented
in by Sir Edward Jenner in 1798 that is
a smallpox right the smallpox vaccine so
we can remember in 70s 70s right
1700 this was discovered right then in
1800 so in 1800 switch vaccines can
double to two major I'll see you RC in
1800 so rabies and cholera then
in 1900 so in 1900 there are there was
much much more discovery and invention
of new and other kind of and vaccines
which occurred so in 1920s so in
nineteen months since we had a major
breakthrough the most important vaccines
right so remember this in 1920s we had a
basic vaccine group that was a BCG
vaccine that is bachelor's Talmud guru
Dean the full for this area but iNSYS
and tetanus vaccine right in nineteen
thirties we had a yellow fever and
influenza vaccine in 1949 a year before
the India but Republic was the month
vaccine was discovered in 1950s foster
ah intravenous polio vaccine was
discovered and then oral pal
polio vaccine was discovered right in
60s we had Mr sixties the 60s mr right
so on measles and rubella next month in
70s also meningococcal Type C vaccine
was also discovered in 60s only right in
17th we had type in meningococcal
vaccine and another important
breakthrough here was HIPPA Titus B
vaccine here's how to remember Rafi by
not remembering the exact year even if
you are remembering this you can have
some highlights for remembering the
years
next we come up to the classification of
patterning that is what are the types of
vaccination so broadly classified there
are major four types we can say like
based on the type of preparation that
based on the type of conjugation which
we know type of immunization and built
in a type of fruit they are administered
okay so built on the type of preparation
that is
how basically we are preparing the
vaccine so are we taking live organisms
okay so my organism step attenuated life
what is when my attenuation is we are
didn't lie you microorganisms but we are
reducing the pathogenicity that is their
capacity of producing a disease we are
removing that pathogenicity part but
however we are maintaining the
antigenicity of the microorganism so
that the antigen would stimulate the
further production of our amuse immune
cells that is antibodies okay then we
are producing killed vaccines we are
killing the microorganisms we are
inactivated it and we are producing it
next is at oxides or toxins like
whatever toxins that are produced by
virus and bacterias they have been taken
and they have been converted into the
form of toxoid that is the removing the
pathogenicity and capability of those
toxins to Kiryat the disease and they
have been used to produce vaccines right
the another type is a using subunit that
is we are using a protein or a
polysaccharide a fragment or a subunit
from the bacterial or viral antigens
which are responsible for producing a
specific type of an pathogen isset e so
we are not using an whole organism or
something
we are just you taking that much
fragment and which is responsible for
providing us immunity and we are using
that and then 50 titles the combination
type we care where we can we are
combining two types of vaccine that is
either lime plus that is d pity for
example then we are combining Victoria
produces return as vaccines together and
we are injecting them as one next is
names upon conjugation so the subunits
are of two times we are either
polysaccharide or they are made up of
protein so the polysaccharide part of
the subunit they are unconjugated right
but however when this bone is like a
right is a conjugated that is we are
connecting it joining it with the help
of a protein carrier then those vessels
become conjugated vaccines okay then the
Vectrex things are based upon the type
of immunization so and we know that
there are vaccines which are to be
routinely in your nice life so from the
birth there is a cycle which is to be
given and these are the mandatory
vaccines which are being written by the
national immunization schedule which is
provided by government and they are for
free most of them right so the other
routinely immunized in vaccines and
another type they are immunized for
individual so every other message which
are costly we are being spent and they
are to be taken with by the people of
you need to buy them for all you need to
provide them for example if there are BR
dot dentistry a doctor so we are
repeated exposure to hepatitis B vaccine
so we must to do the vaccination of that
by ourselves right there are other
vaccines like Reddy's vaccine so we are
providing it only when a person gets a
infected by a dog bite or something okay
then based upon the route of
administration it can be oral which is
provided by oral route that is oral
polio vaccine and parenteral route it
can be either intradermal or
intramuscular subcutaneous and we can
provide them by both some accents can be
given by both the route now here o
vaccines which are being designed to
give by subcutaneous route of it they
can be given I am that is
intramuscularly
however the vaccines which are to be
given
intramuscularly we cannot we can never
give those vessels in by the
subcutaneous or into their mobile
because after a reaction and
side-effects okay so this is one all
about the classification and types of
vaccines coming up to the next actor how
do vaccines work right so basically the
main the main mechanism by which the
vaccines worked is by producing
antibodies that is the cell mediated
immunity right however there are two
types of antigens that are there right
one is a T cell dependent antigen and
another one is the diesel independent
antigen okay so one those are the T cell
dependent antigens they are better the
vaccines are better with a T cell
dependent and they work either by
antibody production right producing you
wanna cell mediated immunity and it is
not antibody production then they walk
by cytotoxic cd8 T lymphocytes
production right there are the specific
empty viral cytokines okay now when in T
cell dependent antigens so these are
dependent antigens are mysteriously the
protein antigen which are the pure
proteins against the vaccines of
hepatitis B a and toxoid
right ah for this what happens is they
activate the antigen T cells right then
T sin T cells o triggers they migrate to
the germinal centers the germinal
centers are the one which are the
Sentinel which dot
immune cells have been produced and then
produce the specific antibodies against
the disease for providing the protection
however this is a form of definitely the
plasma cells this canvas as well short
half-life identify
four to eight weeks after vaccination
however the few plasma cells which are
remaining from here
right they exit the nodes and split and
migrate to the a bone marrow site and
they survive there in the supporting
stromal cells and then later on get
converted into the memory B cells
generated in response to the T dependent
antigens right so this memory is then
preserved when the infection occurs and
member er infection occurs immediately
this memory B cells would work and start
producing antibodies against the antigen
or the pathogenic organism clear now
next is t-cell independent mechanism or
antigens to each other t-cell
polysaccharides polysaccharides antigens
are the basically t-cell independent and
agents right so these are offers tough
to caucus new money
Nigeria meningitidis Haemophilus
influenzae Salmonella typhi right this
aller the desiccant is the main example
the polysaccharide and pigeons and this
at the but whenever from the injected
site they don't go to the germinal
centers right they go to the marginal
zone this is the reference we go to the
marginal tones of splints and nodes
lymph nodes and they bind to the
envelope and receptor at bedside and
stimulate measles and estimate and
produce the proliferation which is
further converted into plasma cells now
here already they have reduced from the
Miller center so they never get exit and
plasma cells nice after two to four
weeks in the response and they will know
and so the immunogenicity or the
antibodies are short lived and died
rapidly although what happened better as
the P antigens do not induce the
germinal centers
memory B cells are not elicited from
here so consequently when we re exposure
of course the vaccine is to be given
same type and in the same time there is
hyper responsiveness to the vaccine then
the previous time
okay so in such cases we do not have to
give booster doses and if we give there
is only a single booster dose that is to
be given for polysaccharide vaccines to
acquire a lifelong protection clear
about t-cell independent and T cell
dependent now coming after this step
after what happens we injected the back
fin so it is the false step following
the injection so it is referred by live
action and the tilde vaccine so what
will live actions basically do the live
action antigens attract all of the local
and system is in itself or in it this is
related to innate immunity that area
then dry pixels monocytes and
neutrophils okay and in response to that
further those activate the lymphatic
vessels the draining lymph node and
further take place the activation of T
and B lymphocytes so they are activating
the generalized whole system to work
against it for producing the immunity
however for the T listen kill vaccines
what do they do they go only to local
all you need at 12 lymph node sites that
is very limited area
so then immunogenicity is really very
low and the preferred site for with the
vaccine is or intramuscular right now
coming up the top polysaccharide
vaccines and the polysaccharide vaccine
oh the point satellite antigen
specifically is unable to evolve the
immune response in children because they
have
immature marginal zone they really
develop around 18 months that is around
nearly 2 years of age so polysaccharide
vaccines are not to be given in children
below 2 years so what to do in such
cases in such cases what we do because
you get the polysaccharide mix-ins and
we inject the conjugated form of the
vaccine because as we saw before the
polysaccharide antigens give us a step
to cook us new Mali Nigeria meningitidis
right all this bacteria they are most
prone to cause infection in the owners
and children lesson to you ok so it is
important that we can you get them and
give the vaccines so this was all about
how the virus oh sorry vaccines whoa now
coming up to the general instructions
rules
Ponta indications and side effects
produced by the vaccines ok so whenever
the term is given that vaccines that are
to be given at birth cut off an massive
BCG vaccine okay so weapons that are
given to be ad board should be given as
early as possible after the birth right
or if this is not possible then it
should be given within 24 to 72 hours if
still not possible then it should be
given at least not making delay later
than 1v after the birth right
so whenever a question comes to you that
when the BCG vaccine or the vaccines at
the birth are to be administered right
the very first option you should go is
with as early or as soon as possible
clear now when we are injecting to
inactivated X vaccines right the time
interval between two doses of another
activated vaccine should be at least
four weeks now
regarding the administration of multiple
vaccines right whenever my are the
administrating multiple vaccines
together so to live vaccines can be
given together line plus King vaccine
can be given together however in the
case of cholera and yellow fever
we cannot give those two vaccines
together because it may cause adverse
reaction clear now coming up with a
contraindication of vaccines so
logically speaking eliminating O in
inhibit or contraindicated live vaccines
what do live absence fronting
microorganisms yeah then then we have
reduced the pathogenicity
however they are live organisms then I
miss chances that infection may occur as
a response okay so we would be it split
pregnancy is the part where we don't
want that infection to occur ed it may
cause damage to fetus right we don't
want any toxic reaction occurring due to
live microorganisms so B are
contraindicated live vaccine during
pregnancy secondly in the cases of
immunosuppression right even the
corticosteroid therapy causes immuno
suppression right ah a bit it will do
this inflammatory response and all so in
both cases as only this immunity is
suppressed the counts are low the WBC
are low in such cases the effective
antibody production would be not so good
right so and if this predominates the
immune system of our body there are
chances the disease or the adverse
response in the might occur in such
cases also in symptomatic a child what
happens in symptomatic HIV the cd4
counts we'll know sometimes say so if
there are less number of cd4 counts and
normal so in that case
obviously the vaccine the live bacterias
or the life strains myth predominant and
sometimes made there are chances the
disease might occur right now all
polysaccharides vaccines as I said are
contraindicated less than two years so
basically as I said the stic
pneumococcal and meningococcal there are
polysaccharide antigens so the
polysaccharide vaccines
this three are in contraindicated days
and us water is which is meant more than
two years it's greater than two years
purchases vaccines are contraindicated
because they can produce some noodle
logical complications however in adults
participant uses vaccines I am NOT
contraindicated in the cases where
epilepsy is properly controlled by
medication and in the cases of cerebral
palsy right now coming up to the
side-effects of vaccines
number one is shock which is produced by
diphtheria produces tetanus and
pertussis vaccines then next is the
boolean value lead on this syndrome is
usually produced by a bacterium it is
Campylobacter jejuni and some of the
viruses okay so in this what happens
there are multiple syndromic or symptoms
which are produced as a result of
infection that is you have vomiting
followed by diarrhea followed by lower
limbs inability to walk coming up - from
ascending way from down to upward your
system and it affects the central
nervous system by producing antibodies
right so this syndrome may be a side
effect that is produced you to get
influenza next is the toxic shock
syndrome
right it is produced by MMR vaccine and
the hypersensitivity that is fun is why
you protected me meningococcal and the
Tedder produces tightness waxing so this
is
all about the basic about the vaccine
that is classification how the walk and
the contraindications and side-effects
here is the latest immunization
timetable Pro given by Indian Academy of
Pediatrics in 2016 so ah NPC around the
eight side the first set is given at
birth then we have at six week ten weeks
14 weeks
the gap is of four so that is 6 plus 4
10 10 plus 4 14 then that thing come in
mul status having the gap of 3 right
that is six months nine months 12 months
and 16 month followed by a gap of 2 that
is 16 to 80 months 18 months two years
to four to six years and ten to twelve
years clear so first four there is a gap
of four then there is a gap of three
then there is a gap of two so how do you
remember the schedule if you want so
remember the three main lessons which
are to be given and both then see the
first node of vaccine which is being
started and the last dose so for example
if it is B vaccine was first started at
the board right then it was given at six
weeks and then later on it was given s
the third one was at six months or you
remember it would take 6 that is 6 weeks
and 6 months now dat WP 1 max in was
given started at 6 weeks 10 B 14 weeks
three times okay three doses then the IP
vaccine
similarly satedan six ten ten so
remember the first one first noise and
then go along according to the gap you
can remember it well
this is about the injection site there
is to be given and at what is and which
person okay that is freedom and unit you
give it the middle third on lower the
junction of interval lateral thigh and
influence also in toddlers and alders
you give it an deltoid region enter
lateral ty in adolescents and adults and
deltoid in infants at ty in children
greater than to Elias or subcutaneous
route you give it an outer triceps and
all intradermal injections are given is
left to Delta so okay
now coming up to the storage of vaccine
so where do we store vaccines it is
enough
cold chain right so here usually the
routing or time routine temperature for
the storage of vaccine is plus two
degree to plus eight degree Celsius so
if you want to store for the longer
period of time then the temperature
should be minus twenty degree to minus
40 degree Celsius clear and similarly
here the iso picture is shown the most
important component of cold chain in
india is
i L are right what is this IL r it is
eyes lined refrigerator right in which
our vaccines can be maintained at plus
two degrees plus eight degree Celsius
here the temperature monitoring is done
with the help of a dial thermometer and
we must check the temperature twice
daily and it is the medium of storage
for all kinds of vaccines clear now how
can cool the chain oh there is a vaccine
vial monitor that is vlm vvm that is a
marker of potency of vaccine however it
can be used or not right so in this case
how it works is the DVM has a heat
sensitive material placed within the Val
vaccine which registers that you will
let you hit exposure over the time right
so in that what does the mark and you
stop it sends it up an outer circle and
it consists of an inner square right so
based upon the degree yes then our stand
with a blue color okay so next what
happens in sir if my wh o grating if the
color changes the color changes is only
in inner square so in the color change
in inner square is white than it is
grade one this light blue that is in red
- then in this two cases grade 1 grade 2
well color is white and blue light blue
respectively
the Bison can be used right if it is too
diffident blue after the conversion the
square is also blue then and then if the
square is purple or black then it is
termed as great 3 and great for
respectively in
which case the vaccines cannot be used
and it should be discarded so grass
three is the mass point where the
vaccine should be discarded this is
given with an example of an oral polio
vaccine mostly the or italia polio
vaccines are monitored with the help of
vaccine vial monitor clear that is all
about the bad basics of vaccines and
thank you for watching this video with
patience hope that covers you are all
doubts regarding the vaccines and make
you clear with the basics of vaccines
thank you
