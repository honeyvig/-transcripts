1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,909
so welcome to the tutorial my name is

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,950
Tammy Bakshi and this time we're gonna

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,379
be going over a second revision or

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,429
second part of my ex coat IPA tutorial

5
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,200
now the reason I've been doing this is

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,089
because there were a few issues with the

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,520
last one and I also just want to make

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,199
this better because you think about it

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,130
the last one wasn't very practical it

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,109
every time you wanted to build you would

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,510
have to create a new deal we linked you

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,340
would have to create a new tiny URL link

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,450
it was just really annoying but if but

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,790
this method will require you to setup

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,370
once but then you can keep building and

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,230
you will be able to run on your iOS

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,770
device so now this was actually made for

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,430
one of my really good subscribers if you

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,510
go to the Xcode

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,539
IPA tutorial the original one you will

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,789
see that in the comments we've been

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,199
having a little conversation then he

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,809
also emailed me his name is Wade sellers

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,270
he actually asked me to create this

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,190
video not this video will this app

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,409
because he was having issues with the

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,110
code signing with the older version so

28
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,420
what I decided to do is why not just

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,040
make a video and share it with all you

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,770
guys too and while I was at it while I

31
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,960
was fixing issues why not just make it

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,600
better too right so yeah let's get

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,790
started as you can see I have a little

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,979
diagram here on how this one we built

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,119
how this will work the last one was

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
quite a bit more complicated what you

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,140
would do in the last one is you would

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,299
convert to IPA with the tool that I

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,240
created okay then you would send this to

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,780
Diaw we okay that seems simple enough

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,119
but that's very manual and then this

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,770
will go further down into tiny URL then

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,790
this would go onto your device

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,650
now how can we go through this entire

45
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,990
thing every time you were to build this

46
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,330
was like around 90% in manual work 10%

47
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,750
automated well I created a method that's

48
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,020
basically the reverse this is around 10%

49
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,630
manual and 90% automated and the O and

50
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:25,600
5% of this is just the setup so it's

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,860
pretty easy now now as you can see this

52
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,920
method does look much longer but that's

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,080
because the setting up does take some

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,480
time now when we're done setting up

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,110
however it's really easy to use and it

56
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,640
still isn't that practical if you're

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,200
changing a little bit of code then

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,210
building on your device again changing a

59
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,680
little bit of code than building on a

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,660
device again it's more for those

61
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,459
developers that are creating a game and

62
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,240
they want to build and then do another

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,550
code modification for another hour so

64
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,300
maybe 30 minutes then build again then

65
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,190
make another modification then build

66
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,260
again so it's more for that sort of

67
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,750
thing because again you can never really

68
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,830
achieve a 100% automated build unless

69
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,750
Apple actually includes the feature that

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,030
they did in Expo 4.2 but then they

71
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,570
removed it so again let's just go over

72
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,989
how this method works now essentially we

73
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,120
use someone I forgot what his name is

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,739
but you'll see in a minute you go to

75
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,290
github and you download a person

76
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,209
software his I don't know his name yet

77
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,900
but I'll show it to you in just a second

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,040
you have to download a software called

79
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,900
Shenzhen or at least I think that's how

80
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,200
it's pronounced and then basically this

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,470
software will help us convert our Xcode

82
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,480
project to an IPA from the command-line

83
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,610
really easily you just need to type an

84
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,190
IPA build that's it no file names

85
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,670
nothing then you basically send this IPA

86
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,820
to Dropbox which will basically use a

87
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,630
drop pages Dropbox app to create a

88
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,440
simple web hosting service and this and

89
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,959
this will go to your iDevice which will

90
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,730
then install the app on itself

91
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,879
and yeah that's really how it works so

92
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,950
let's get to the Mac and I'll show you

93
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,940
exactly how it's done

94
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,829
so hello there and welcome to the Mac

95
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,080
part of the video so now I'm going to be

96
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,690
describing to you exactly how to go

97
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,110
through this and how to actually upload

98
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,950
your apps wirelessly to your device

99
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,850
step-by-step from the beginning

100
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,889
using the example code that I will give

101
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,380
you in the description so let's get

102
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,090
started as you can see I'm on my desktop

103
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,990
here I'm just going to one second I'm

104
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,419
going to move over to Google Chrome here

105
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,310
then I'm going to go to github and

106
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,620
actually not even get hub I'm just going

107
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,610
to type in Shin Zen and Google and as

108
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,610
you can see nope we don't want this we

109
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,570
don't want the city we want github so if

110
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,479
you go to nomads shenzhen get hub

111
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,780
repository as you can see there are some

112
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,510
already files and stuff but you just

113
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,370
want to come down here and you see this

114
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,930
little command just copy this and go to

115
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,410
terminal

116
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,450
now don't worry this command will be in

117
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,860
the description as well if you're too

118
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,500
lazy to go to the github website so then

119
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,960
in terminal you want to type in sudo and

120
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,780
then paste in the command type enter and

121
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,169
then type in your password now I've

122
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,760
already done this this will take a

123
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,110
little bit of time so I'm just gonna go

124
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,500
ctrl C and it'll interrupt it now you

125
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,669
want to copy in this long command from

126
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:50,530
here and also install now again I've

127
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,450
already done this so I'm just going to

128
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,750
ctrl C out of it now there is a slight

129
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,479
problem with these though the problem is

130
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,610
that it doesn't install IPA to the

131
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,370
correct folder error to solve that I've

132
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,169
created a little package for you

133
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,900
so if you go to the description and

134
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,080
download from my site or actually from

135
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,599
my github then you will get this entire

136
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:16,180
package that has all the files that have

137
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,909
to do with Xcode type a2 and also

138
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:21,699
Jensen's current version of I

139
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,650
and so if you go into Shenzhen first

140
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,689
you'll see these files and if you go

141
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,030
into the bin folder you'll see this

142
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,090
little executable for Linux if you just

143
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,310
click on this and click command C or if

144
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,740
you can go down here and click copy

145
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,680
where is it copy then you want to click

146
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,379
you want to go up here and click on the

147
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,710
actual go button then go down here and

148
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,530
click on go to folder or you can type in

149
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,830
shift command G then what you want to do

150
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:59,719
type in slash USR slash bin go and then

151
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,000
you'll get here now you want to paste in

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,710
IPA and since I've already done this I'm

153
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,810
going to stop but as you can see just

154
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,849
want to paste it in here now don't worry

155
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,949
if you don't already have all these some

156
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:14,539
people might have a million things in

157
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:16,580
here some people might have nothing so

158
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,770
it's completely ok no matter how many

159
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,949
things you have in here just paste it in

160
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,960
ok so now that we have that out of the

161
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,330
way we have IPA successfully installed

162
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,340
in order to test this you can go to

163
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,719
terminal and type in IPA as you can see

164
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,900
it basically prints out all this stuff

165
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,750
to the screen and so now we can just

166
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,870
close the terminal window to exit now

167
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,669
that we're done with that part let's go

168
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:49,339
back to my xcode to IPA folder and as

169
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,279
you can see we have three files here now

170
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,699
what i want you to do is you want i want

171
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,469
to create a project a very simple app

172
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,599
and we're going to drag it into that

173
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,060
folder so let's just go to xcode here

174
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,610
and let's click on click on create a new

175
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,669
Xcode project let's just create an iOS

176
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,819
single view application and called this

177
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,360
Wireless hello world okay

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,539
now let's just go next and let's just

179
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,819
save this inside of that little package

180
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,949
that I'm going to give you or actually

181
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:23,539
let's just save it to my apps folder and

182
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,879
I'll tell you why in just a second so

183
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,550
I'm just going to create this and I'm

184
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,800
going to go to my main not storyboard

185
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,349
and let's just create a quick label that

186
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:33,950
says

187
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,400
hello world on screen and so that'll

188
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,330
really be it so we see the UI here which

189
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,800
I can edit to be iPhone 4.7 inch I'm

190
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,890
going to hide that part now I can get a

191
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,280
little label drag it to the center of

192
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,170
the screen and just name it hello world

193
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,010
actually drag it to the center of the

194
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,320
screen this time and as you can see we

195
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,770
want to run this app on iOS device now

196
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,390
I'm going to close this down actually

197
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,280
first I'm going to open this in finder

198
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,520
then I'm going to close this down then

199
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,290
as you can see we have all these project

200
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,570
files now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

201
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,670
make a little copy of my a package

202
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,130
really quickly and I'm going to go into

203
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,520
our package open up the second folder

204
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,880
here Xcode type a2 then you'll see these

205
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,680
three files as I've already shown you

206
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,780
and you just want to take all these

207
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,340
files or project files

208
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,360
and copy it into here okay now that

209
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,790
we're done with that let's do some more

210
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,070
work so now what you want to do is you

211
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,420
want to head over to google chrome again

212
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,430
and download Dropbox for Mac now you'll

213
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,350
see this you don't want to click on this

214
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,350
you want to click on this so as you can

215
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,110
see it'll go here and then it will allow

216
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,090
you to install Dropbox then you just

217
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,110
want to go through the installation

218
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,180
process for Dropbox which I will not do

219
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,730
because that'll take a long time and

220
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,070
then once you're done in your favorites

221
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,750
under finder and you should also have

222
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,090
another Dropbox folder then you want to

223
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,770
head over to Google Chrome one last time

224
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,470
and you want to type in drop pages in

225
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,500
Google then if you go to this one drop

226
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,140
pages calm and you click on sign in and

227
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,170
you will be able to sign in to your

228
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,300
Dropbox account and so I've already

229
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,240
created a drop pages account by linking

230
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,310
it to my Dropbox well that's a fairly

231
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,020
simple process you just sign in with

232
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,730
your Dropbox it'll ask you if you want

233
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,800
to give this app permission to view your

234
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,560
Dropbox and you just click on yes so

235
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,420
then you create a simple site I just

236
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,800
called my aunt Angie Manny dot draw

237
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,360
pages calm because that was

238
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,160
email and I just wanted to keep it

239
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,589
simple and so that's really it

240
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,209
now if I go to Dropbox I could also go

241
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,800
in here but I don't want to destroy this

242
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,850
for you so then if you go into your apps

243
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,529
folder my dot drop pages and then you go

244
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,260
to your website and then you've got a

245
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,529
public there will just be a main dot CSS

246
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,959
when you create this but I want you to

247
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,589
create a new file or a folder sorry and

248
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,089
let's just name this hello world or

249
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:23,570
actually 8uw for symbol this okay let's

250
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,430
create this folder and let's go into it

251
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,709
now what I want you to do and go back

252
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,930
here take all of this stuff that was

253
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,000
inside of the package including your

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,750
project copy it go to your Dropbox go to

255
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,360
your apps my doc drop pages go to your

256
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,300
website public and go to this folder

257
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,550
that you just created now paste it in

258
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,040
and go over here and make sure that it

259
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,800
uploads everything to your Dropbox form

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,399
a files remaining and in just a second

261
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,589
it should be done syncing okay now it's

262
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,630
done it's all up to date and we've

263
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,060
uploaded everything now you're ready to

264
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,890
change the links and as I said this is

265
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,800
quite a big setup process but it all

266
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,740
works out in the long run and it's much

267
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,050
better to set it up once and have it

268
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,720
work for the rest of the life of your

269
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,290
project okay so now let's continue as

270
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,600
you can see we're in this folder and so

271
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,740
now we have installed HTML we're going

272
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,649
to modify this to be able to basically

273
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:31,550
install our app onto our iOS device in

274
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,980
order to do that we have to go to this

275
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,880
wireless app disk plist file by

276
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,670
right-clicking open with and I just

277
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,560
recommend Xcode for this because that's

278
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,730
the simplest thing you could possibly

279
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,480
use and by default you can go to items

280
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,170
item 0 if you go into assets then I am 0

281
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,290
and you'll see kind software package do

282
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:54,950
not shake

283
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,680
change this and you'll see URL and then

284
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,830
something called link goes here I put

285
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,750
this in for you and what do you what

286
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,670
this means is you have to go to your

287
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,030
Dropbox and just before you do anything

288
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,240
else go to your terminal and type in CD

289
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,780
space then go to this folder that you

290
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,370
created in your Dropbox and you're sorry

291
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,000
drag it into your terminal ok remove the

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,370
extra space and click enter now you are

293
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,070
inside of that folder now if you click

294
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,700
LS you'll see all the contents of the

295
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,830
directory in Dropbox and so what you

296
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:39,320
want to do type an Sh update ipas H this

297
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,960
will create a new IPA file using a

298
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:51,130
predominance name was just check

299
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,189
well his link will be down in the

300
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:02,879
description he was I used his little API

301
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,999
for the last X coat IPA and so we are

302
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,519
also using it here so as you can see it

303
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,719
says successfully built and then the

304
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:18,149
location to the IPA file now what we can

305
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,659
do is we can go back into Dropbox and

306
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,059
you see that in just a second

307
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,399
after Dropbox is done syncing it on

308
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,399
which it says it'll take four seconds 30

309
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,159
seconds and it's almost done ok there it

310
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:32,429
is

311
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,109
now what you want to do as you can see

312
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:36,329
there's a little share button here just

313
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:38,279
click on it and you'll get this little

314
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,029
link now copy this link and head back to

315
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:46,799
your Xcode now in your url instead of

316
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,739
link goes here paste in the link now let

317
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,389
me tell you how to modify this link to

318
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:51,899
work

319
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,679
remove this question DL is equal to zero

320
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,049
just take that out now replace

321
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,109
www.sceeto.com just remove this part and

322
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:10,099
replace it with DL Dropbox user content

323
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,299
dot-com and then keep everything else

324
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,779
the same and yeah that's it now if you

325
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,519
go to your metadata tab in the P list

326
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,009
you'll see the bundle identifier bundle

327
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:22,259
version the kind which you should not

328
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,619
change and the title let's just do these

329
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:32,059
quickly Wireless hello world

330
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,370
and then the bundle version which is 1.0

331
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,620
now just to make sure that these are all

332
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,690
right I'm going to open up my Xcode

333
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,000
projects in from Dropbox I'm going to go

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,660
over here

335
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,260
TBS s dot wireless hello world and if I

336
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,620
go here just a sec sometimes it does do

337
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,300
this because I mean it's from Dropbox

338
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,770
and it'll take some time for it to load

339
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:08,160
up okay there so TBS s dot wireless

340
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,440
hello world and then so if we go here as

341
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,870
you can see it's correct so then we can

342
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,440
save this and close out of it now as you

343
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,650
can see it will instantly almost sync it

344
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,330
because I mean it is a pretty small file

345
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,840
then we want to edit this the installed

346
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,320
HTML file you want to open this up with

347
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,230
well I recommend sublime text to because

348
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,970
that's just the best text editor I've

349
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,260
seen yet for Mac specifically but I mean

350
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,240
you could use any other text editor but

351
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,910
do not use TextEdit for my experience it

352
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,490
just messes up the HTML and it just

353
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,780
doesn't work okay

354
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,730
okay so as you can see we have a little

355
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,000
link here called install and I have this

356
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,550
thing called link goes here remove that

357
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,000
again and go back to your Dropbox

358
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,170
there's nothing else you need to do this

359
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,760
time just look at your wireless app

360
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,220
tostop plist and do the same thing that

361
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,770
we just did click on the share button

362
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,440
find this link copy it go here sublime

363
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,560
text paste it in then modify it to the

364
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,840
exact same way I told you to so DL

365
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,680
Dropbox User Content comm and you also

366
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,780
want to change this DL equals 0 to

367
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,500
nothing there that's it now if I were to

368
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,290
save this and close out of it as you can

369
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,300
see in our Dropbox it says that we've

370
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,090
just modified this now what I'm gonna do

371
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,970
is I'm going to stream my iphone to my

372
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,360
Mac so that you can see what I'm doing

373
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,900
command

374
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:48,200
chin and so then I guess what we can do

375
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,060
stream my iPhone not my face

376
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,680
and I can just quit out of these okay so

377
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,780
as you can see I'm streaming my iPhone

378
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,050
to my Mac now so if I open up my iPhone

379
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,920
so as you can see it all works it's

380
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,490
perfect however now if I go to Safari

381
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,180
you can see that's what I can do let's

382
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,770
just head over to the website that we

383
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,990
created which is tangi mani not drop

384
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,650
pages comm and specifically we want to

385
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,950
go to /hw which is what we just created

386
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:45,370
slash installed on HTML okay now we

387
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,620
click on go as you can see just I'm

388
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,890
gonna zoom in so that you can see this

389
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,260
it gives us an install link now what we

390
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,790
want to do is we're gonna click on this

391
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,950
and it should theoretically install the

392
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,680
hello world app to our eye device so if

393
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,490
I click on install as you can see we

394
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,350
would like to install a wireless hello

395
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,540
world let's just click on install shall

396
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,570
we now as you can see it's going to wait

397
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,430
for a while wait for a while wait for a

398
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,940
while and it will successfully put the

399
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,390
hello world app on to our iPhone and we

400
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,580
will be able to use it now just while

401
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,020
that's installing I'm gonna tell you a

402
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,330
really good trick as you can see if I'm

403
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,700
gonna go back to Safari it's a pain to

404
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,710
keep going back to this website just to

405
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,720
install your app so what you want to do

406
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,520
click on the sender little share button

407
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,650
here at the bottom then you want to

408
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,770
click on add to homescreen and rename

409
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,650
this to instant basically anything you

410
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,860
want I'm just gonna name this install HW

411
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,060
yeah I'm gonna add this and as you can

412
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,640
see well it's also done installing so if

413
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,830
I go into this app as you can see it's

414
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,320
the correct app completely works in the

415
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,340
label spine and just quickly yeah so you

416
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,640
see we've also added install HW so we

417
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,429
can use that whenever we want and so we

418
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,290
also have the app now let's just do a

419
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,179
quick lot of

420
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,639
Asian and time how long it takes for us

421
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:17,850
to get it onto our I advice just roughly

422
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,749
so I'm going to go into Xcode and we're

423
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:24,119
going to open up the wireless hello

424
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:30,779
world from the Dropbox and so what I'm

425
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:33,179
gonna do I'm gonna go to the lane not

426
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,519
storyboard and I want to make a little

427
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:47,940
change okay that works now that that's

428
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,769
done let's close out of it

429
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:52,830
and once it is done syncing to Dropbox

430
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,730
all you do is you go over here and go

431
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,809
and delete these two files okay now

432
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,490
let's start timing again a rough time so

433
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,080
if I go to well I guess isn't there a

434
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,960
pro oh yeah clock sorry and then if I go

435
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,669
to timer stopwatch so then I can

436
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,850
basically just go to terminal again I'm

437
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,950
going to update the IPA again

438
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,560
okay

439
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,460
okay so that's done now we can exit out

440
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,800
of this and let's just go to install HW

441
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,060
or actually before that we have to

442
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,290
delete this app okay now it's going to

443
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:08,740
install HW and install install retry

444
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,820
sometimes the reason that happens is

445
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,740
because it's not done syncing to Dropbox

446
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,720
but then when you click on retry it will

447
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,980
sync to Dropbox and then it'll work so

448
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,880
just give it a minute or two I guess

449
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,450
will successfully install so till now I

450
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,760
say it's been around 50 seconds maybe a

451
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,720
minute now but if we just wait a little

452
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,520
bit longer the only reason it takes this

453
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,830
long the installing process is perfectly

454
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,960
fine it's just that it's getting it from

455
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,670
my server and not just any App Store

456
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,740
server which is much faster than mine so

457
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,750
yeah again this also does vary your

458
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,450
Wi-Fi connection your Wi-Fi speed and

459
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,910
another benefit about this I mean it

460
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,320
this was also benefit in the last Xcode

461
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,360
type EA but a really good benefit for

462
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,310
this is that you don't need to be on the

463
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,710
same Wi-Fi network as if you would with

464
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,080
Xcode 4.2 when you and wirelessly deploy

465
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,510
so as you can see it is done and now if

466
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,830
we were to go into the clock so yeah I'd

467
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,800
say it takes around one minute 40

468
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,200
seconds maybe two minutes for each build

469
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,660
to go on your device so again as I said

470
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,640
it isn't for that developer that's

471
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,710
building and running every 20 seconds

472
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,300
it's for that developer that needs to

473
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,130
build and run around every 30 seconds

474
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,620
and so yeah that was basically how it

475
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,900
worked I subscribe to my channel if

476
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,180
