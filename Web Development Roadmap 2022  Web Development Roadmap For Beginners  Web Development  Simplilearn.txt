an e-commerce website with more than
thousand products cost somewhere between
five thousand dollars to sixty thousand
dollars a database website cost even
so do you guys ever think about who
creates these websites and how much
money they make a web developer is
responsible for all the stuff
hello everyone and welcome to simply
learn's youtube channel
caution this side and i hope you guys
are doing well
in this video tutorial we'll take you
through the web development roadmap
will let you know about all the
different roles you can land on if you
know certain methodologies related to
web development
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on multiple
technology videos so if you are a tech
geek in a continuous and for the latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and press that bell icon to
never miss any updates from simply learn
so without any further delay let's get
started
let's go through the agenda for this
video
we'll start this video with an
introduction to web development followed
by the roles and responsibilities of a
web developer
we'll then discuss its types since web
development can be divided into three
different sections front-end web
development back-end web development and
full-stack web development we'll discuss
what technologies you need in all the
three web development types
along with the resources and roadmap for
each type
we'll end this video by going through
some non-technical requirements for
becoming a web developer
let's start this video with what is web
development
web development is the branch of
computer science that deals with
creating and maintaining a website or
web application
every website we come across is designed
with a mix of certain methodologies
a website is generally divided into
three parts front-end back-end and
database so who does all these tasks of
creating and maintaining a website
a web developer is a person who is
responsible for all the stuff that goes
around the website a web developer not
only creates the website but also make
sure that the website should not face
any issues right after the deployment
moving ahead let's discuss the different
types of web development
there are certain jobs you can land on
in the area of web development we'll
discuss the types of web development
followed by the job roles they offer
so web development is generally divided
into three parts front-end web
development back-end web development and
full-stack web development
let's start with front-end web
development
front-end web development is the branch
of web development that concentrates on
user experience
in order to ensure that the data is
presented understandably and entails
converting the code created by back-end
developers into a graphical interface
without front-end development you would
see incomprehensible code on a website
or web application but thanks to
front-end developers non-programmers can
easily use and comprehend websites and
web applications
when you visit google apps canva
facebook and other websites everything
you see is the result from the
collaboration between front-end and
back-end developers
let us take you through the roadmap to
becoming a front end developer we'll
also discuss about the technologies used
for front and web development
the first step to becoming a front-end
developer is to find yourself a
technology that is easy to understand
several technologies are present in this
area but one should know their
requirements so we'll discuss all the
technical aspects here
html is the most basic technology one
should
html stands for hypertext markup
language and is also known as web
architecture's most basic building block
it is used to create the structure of a
webpage to become a web developer one
should know how to create the structure
of a website
there are various resources you can
refer to for learning html you can find
multiple videos on youtube or if you
want to enroll yourself in a free course
you can find the link mentioned in the
description box below
the next step is learning css cascading
style sheet or css is used to style a
web page html creates the structure and
css makes the web page look more
appealing to the user
bootstrap is another front-end
technology that is not necessary to
learn but is always adds up to your
skills
it is a framework based on css and
javascript
bootstrap is used to make a web page
more interactive and mobile friendly as
well
the next step is to learn javascript
javascript plays an important role in
front-end web development it is a
scripting language that is used to add
responsiveness to a web page
basically javascript is known as the
programming language for the web
it can help you create a dynamically
active web page by adding elements to a
web page to engage the user
generally it is said that these three
technologies html css and javascript are
enough for creating the front end of any
website but we'll suggest you some more
technologies
javascript frameworks like react
angular vue and jquery are also used for
front-end web development
you can learn any of these frameworks or
all
it depends on your requirements we
suggest you to go for react as react is
the most widely used javascript
framework today
however professional developers prefer
vue because of its ease of use
so these are all the technologies
basically required for front-end web
development although if you want to go
for a job in this field it is highly
recommended to learn website deployment
tool as well
netlify and versal are some of the free
deployment tools you can use to take
your application online
projects also play a vital role while
you go through the learning process
it is rightly said that you can learn a
language only by programming in it
so this is the roadmap to becoming a
front end web developer
talking about the resources for all the
technologies we discussed in this part
you can find
youtube videos based on different
technologies you can also find the
playlist on our youtube channel but
taking up a course will definitely be of
more help
skill up by simply learn is a free to
use platform where you can enroll
yourself in a free course and learn many
things
the plus point is you will get a
certificate on any course completion
the link for the front-end web
development introductory course is
present in the description box below as
well as on your screen
click on the link and you will get to
understand the concept of certain
front-end technologies like html css
javascript angular and react do check
that link out for words
let's move ahead and will now discuss
the roles and responsibilities and
salary insights of a front-end web
developer
the responsibilities of a front-end
developer include deciding on the layout
and structure of a web page
achieving harmony between practical and
aesthetically pleasing design
creating code that can be reused in the
future
maximizing the speed and scalability of
web pages
writing web pages using a variety of
markup languages ensuring that the
design is consistent with the brand once
you are ready to take on all the
responsibilities of a front-end web
developer you can apply for this job
rule via different platforms and grab an
opportunity
according to glassdoor.com
the average salary of a front-end web
developer in india ranges between 3
lakhs to 11 lakhs per annum with an
average salary of 4.9 lakhs
rest depends on the experience and
knowledge one holds while applying for a
job
let's move on to back-end web
development
back-end development is the term used to
describe tasks carried out while
executing program on the web
instead of front-end web development
which focuses on customer-facing
services and programs
back-end development handles server-side
web applications functionality and
integration as well as activities like
designing apis creating libraries and
working with system components
focusing on website architecture
scripting and building code that
communicates between the website's
database and the user's browser is all a
part of back end web developers job
consistency security and integrity of
data must be guaranteed for this job
the skills required in back-end web
development differ from what we come
across in front
the first step to understanding the
backend is by understanding the concept
of web servers
the web server manages websites and
responds to user requests by storing
processing and delivering online pages
several parts of an http server are
capable of understanding https and urls
when a web server receives a request
from a user an http server accepts it
and it finds and return the requested
material to the browser using http
open source platforms that distribute
content in response to queries include
web servers like apache
the next step in backend web development
requires the knowledge of programming
language
which refers to the language used so
that the computer can understand it
additionally frameworks are collections
of libraries that simplify and
facilitate programming
the basis of a web page is the
programming language being a back-end
developer requires knowledge of
programming languages and associated
frameworks
which is not so easy to achieve
although many programming languages are
available only a few are frequently
advised for back-end web development
javascript and node.js
the most difficult programming language
javascript
allows you to explore many novel ideas
and create a truly amazing website
it is applied to the creation of dynamic
and interactive websites
node.js is a javascript framework
created with real-life push-based
architecture
and the single threaded model used for
back-end api services in mind
javascript may be used to execute on the
server side with node.js
python and django
python is the most user-friendly
programming language
and when combined with django it makes a
fantastic website building tool
you can create better and simpler web
applications with less amount of code
python is the most popular programming
language for creating websites because
of how quickly it can be implemented
the most reliable and flexible framework
to use with python is gengo
php with loro
the general purpose scripting language
php which is also known as hypertext
preprocessor is ideal for creating
websites
it is a quick adaptable and practical
language that runs the most well-known
websites and blogs
it is a quick adaptable and practical
language that runs the most well-known
websites and blogs
the open source laravel framework is
used to create a variety of web
applications
it is solely a server-side framework
that handles data
management and employs mvc mvc stands
for model view controller to decompose
the back end architecture of an
application into logical components
making it simpler to construct
you can simply choose any set of
technologies from all the technologies
we discussed here and go ahead with that
it totally depends on you
to get data from a database a backend
developer writes code that does
relational mapping
among the most popular database
management systems are mysql
sql server and postgre sql
mongodb and oracle database so you must
be quite familiar with how they operate
a version control system is useful for
keeping track of and retaining changes
to code
that can be applied to future
there are computer programs that assist
in managing source code modifications
over time
git a free and open source version
control system may be the ideal option
due to its secure adaptable and simple
to edit characteristics
even for small projects using a version
control system is the best practice
because it allows you to rapidly alter
the source code whenever you want to add
a new feature or make improvements and
produce an efficient application
an api is a collection of operations for
communicating with operating systems
microservices and external software
components as well as for accessing data
in essence it transfer user reaction to
the system and returns system responses
to the user
two apps can communicate with one
another thanks to api
which serves as the software mediators
back-end developers utilize apis to
connect services or applications and
start conversations in order to enhance
user experience
a good server to build and provide api
for client server communication is
express
you should be familiar with few of the
apis like rest json soap json xml rpc
and aes
everything including software
applications services and products is
moving towards the cloud
utilizing the cloud
web development computing offers a
pay-as-you-go service and enables
organizations and individuals to consume
computer resources
including virtual machines databases
processing services storage and events
software as a service platform as a
service and infrastructure as a service
are the three main divisions of cloud
computing
a back-end developer should know what
clouds are and how to use them
mostly used cloud services are google
cloud amazon web services and microsoft
azure
so you can take any one of these cloud
services and then you'll be ready to
become a back-end developer
you won't be able to identify the
necessary elements for a functioning
application until and unless you create
your own backend project
build some incredible creations ranging
from simple to complex you can check out
our youtube videos and learn about these
technologies or you can enroll yourself
in a free course on the skillup website
the link is present over here on your
screen and in the description box as
well
find yourself a course and enroll as
soon as possible
moving ahead let's discuss about the
salary and responsibilities of a
back-end developer
a back-end developer mostly deals with
server side of a website in other words
someone who manages data on the server
side
also interacts with the ui or we can say
front
and saves and organizes data a back-end
developer is in charge of creating the
web applications framework
the product list you see in the user
interface of any e-commerce website like
amazon
is saved somewhere right
the sign in button you see takes you to
another page
when you enter your details since the
backend makes an api call and the server
side rendering is also handled entirely
by the backend developers
that data is kept in the database which
is handled by the backend only
according to glassdoor.com a backend
developer's average salary in india
ranges between 3 lakhs per annum to 17
lakhs per annum with an average annual
salary of around 7 lakh
so
moving on to a final type in web
development let's discuss what full
stack web development is
full stack web developers are
individuals capable of developing both
the front end and the back end of any
web application
full stack technology refers to the
total depth of a computer system
application
a full stack developer creates both the
front end and the back end of a program
while ensuring that it has all the
necessary functionality
there's no special technology related to
full stack development a full stack
developer should know about every
technology we come across in the
front-end web development and the
back-end web development
there is no shortcut for this you should
know technologies like css html
javascript angular react back-end
technologies like node
and many
additionally a full stack web developer
should know about databases clouds apis
and almost everything
they have the expertise to handle any
tasks including customer interaction
system engineering database management
and server administration
full stack developers are familiar with
all the stages of website development on
a practical level
they merely take an idea and
independently develop it into a finished
good
they are proficient in various languages
particularly web languages software
development methodologies contemporary
ideas and the many tools required to
create a fully functional website
you can apply for the full stack
development for beginners course for
free
click on the link mentioned in the
description or you can have it here on
your computer screen
enroll yourself today or you can go
through our youtube channel as well to
find the latest technology videos
related to full stack web development
according to glassdoor.com the salary of
a full stack developer in india ranges
between 2.5 lakhs per mm to 9.5 lakhs
with an average annual salary of
5.10 lakhs
this salary is for freshers only so
choose your career wisely and don't
forget to check out the free course
provided to you by simply
before we finish this video let's look
at some of the non-technical skills
required for becoming a full stack web
developer
when we mention skill you might think of
programming automating and comprehending
various frameworks databases techniques
and libraries
some non-technical abilities are highly
significant for becoming a successful
web developer
as these are for your personal growth
only
communication
efficient teamwork and customer
satisfaction always depend on effective
communication
it is occasionally overlooked competent
developers ensure they are constantly
accessible and provide timely responses
to team members or clients
communications
teamwork
web developers rarely take on a task by
themselves they collaborate in groups
most of the time
the effectiveness of the team's
collaboration is the key component in
data mining whether current online or
mobile application development projects
are completed on schedule according to
the requirements and our own budget
time management
being productive or falling behind can
be entirely determined by how well you
manage your time and your attention
sometimes there are too many things
happening at once you are a good
developer and need to be trustworthy and
have an excellent work ethic as well
creativity the key to creativity is
coming up with multiple solutions for a
given issue
you can successfully incorporate your
creativity into creating an effective
product with this ability as a developer
you should have this crucial ability in
your toolkit so that you can present the
team with creative suggestions that will
benefit other project parts leadership
skills you have a better chance of
succeeding in the area of web
development including creating mobile
all online websites
you can advance quickly to the senior
developer level and be given managerial
responsibilities
it is a standard procedure that you will
have to coach people with less
experience
even if you do not have enough
experience to lead it
so these are some of the non-technical
skills one must achieve to become a good
web developer
now it's totally up to you which one of
the web development jobs you wanted to
land on
i suggest you guys to take some time and
do some research and then go ahead with
