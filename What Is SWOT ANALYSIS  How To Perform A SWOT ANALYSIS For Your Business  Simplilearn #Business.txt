success one day the company faced a

delay let's get started with SWAT
analysis for business so the agenda we
will first understand what exactly is
swart analysis followed by that we will
go through the components of SWAT
analysis then you can understand how can
you use a swart analysis for business
and lastly we will close the session by
a use case which will be helping us to
learn about an example of SWAT analysis
I hope the agenda was clear now let's
get started with the first point what is
swart
analysis swart analysis is a basic
straightforward model that assesses what
an organization can and cannot do as
well as its potential opportunities and
threats in 1960 Albert s humfrey an
American Business and Management
Consultant was the one who was
specialized in organizational management
and cultural change coined the term SWAT
analysis SWAT strategy analysis has two
main branches
analysis of a firm's external
environment and Analysis of a firm's
internal environment SWAT is a famous
framework that allows us to combine the
two types of analysis SWAT is sometimes
referred to as an internal external
analysis SWAT is an acronym that stands
for strengths weaknesses opportunities
and threats now let's move ahead and
understand the important components of
swort
analysis every SWAT analysis will
include the following four categories
through the elements and discoveries
within the categories so the first one
is strengths strengths describe what an
organization excels at and what
separates it from the competition a
strong brand loyal customer base a
strong balance sheet unique technology
and so on for example a hedge fund may
have developed appropriative trading
strategy that returns Market leading
result
it must then decide how to use those
results to attract new investors next
component is weakness weaknesses stop an
organization from performing at its
Optimum level the areas where the
business needs to improve to remain
competitive a weak brand higher than
average turnover high levels of depth
and an inadequate supply chain or a lack
of capital are some of weaknesses next
we have opportunity ities opportunities
refer to favorable external factors that
could give an organization a competitive
Advantage for example if a Country Cuts
tariffs a car manufacturer can export
its cars to a new market increasing
sales and market share the fourth one is
threats threats refer to factors that
have the potential to harm an
organization for example a drought is a
threat to a wheat producing company as
it may destroy or reduce the crop yield
other common threats include things like
Rising costs for materials increasing
competition tight labor Supply and so on
we can use a swort analysis when
analyzing Industries companies products
new initiators policies or even people
it is a simple and practical framework
that allows us to group and visualize
strengths and weaknesses and to identify
potential threats and opportunities that
exist in the external environment in
addition the SWAT framework could be
helpful when youm performs and the one
that needs Improvement under strengths
we expect to see score competencies in
the areas where the business excels and
has a competitive advantage over
competitors an example of a firm
strength could be its strong brand
recognition weaknesses are areas that
need improvements such vulnerabilities
place a company at a disadvantage when
competing against other firms usually
resulting in other companies getting a
comperative Advantage now let's proceed
and understand the example for swort
analysis an example of weakness is a
higher cost structure opportunities are
favorable factors existing in a
company's external environment in its
operating industry and have the
potential to improve its current results
and competitive position taking
advantage of the opportunities depends
on how skilled a company's stop
management M teammates
work to take the advantage of an
opportunity the management must be able
to recognize it when they arise they act
accordingly when the time is right an
example of the opportunity is the Advent
of new technology the company can
exploit and expand its product offering
but you can identify a threat you can
lessen its impact by taking precautions
an example of a threat is the entry of a
strong competitor with access to
Advanced technology this is an excellent
overview of SWAT framework let's
consider a hypothetical example of a
small technology startup that
specializes in developing mobile
applications in this scenario the
startup is conducting a SWAT analysis to
assess the current position in the
market and plan for its future
strategies starting with strengths
Innovative product the company has a
unique and Innovative mobile application
that sets it apart from competitors
talented team the startup has a team of
skilled and experienced developers
designers and marketers Agile
development process the company follows
the Agile development process allowing
it to quickly adapt to Market changes
and customer feedback strong financial
backing the startup secured funding from
investors providing a stable Financial
foundation for growth moving ahead we
will discuss limited market presence the
compan is relatively unknown to the
market struggling with low brand
recognition dependency on Key Personnel
certain key employes employees possess
critical knowledge and there is a risk
of disruption if they leave the Company
Limited marketing budget the startup has
a constrained marketing budget hindering
its ability to reach a broader audience
lack of diversification the company
relies heavily on its Flagship
application lacking a diversified
product
portfolio moving ahead we will discuss
the opportunities growing smartphone
usage with an increasing number of
people using smartphones there is a
significant opportunity to expand its us
partnership with tech joints exploring
partnership with established tech
companies could provide access to a
larger audience and resources Global
expansion the startup can explore
entering International markets to tap
into new customer bases lastly emerging
Technologies staying updated on emerging
Technologies example augmented reality
artificial intelligence and
incorporating them into products can
give a Competitive Edge let's move to
the last one which is
threats first one is intense competition
the mobile La Market is highly
competitive with many established
players and new entrance second one is
rapid technological changes the
fast-paced nature of Technology can
render current Solutions obsolete
quickly next is data security conerns
increasing awareness and concerns about
data privacy may affect user trust and
adoption proceeding ahead we have
economic downturn economic
uncertainities could impact the funding
environment and consumer spending on
non-essential applications and lastly
after conducting this SWAT analysis the
startup can develop strategies to
leverage its strengths address
weaknesses capitalize on opportunities
and mitigate for instance it might
prioritize marketing efforts to enhance
brand recognition diversify its product
offerings and establish contingency
plans for key personal turnover this SW
analysis serves as a valuable tool for
informed decision making and strategic
planning in the dynamic business
environment and with that we have come
