hello everyone and welcome you all so
today is very exciting day because today
we're going to help you to understand
like how you're going to be developing
some very attractive website having the
css html and lot of images in a packet
this mini project will help you to
understand how we can align our content
to display to my end user so not many
things are there we have got css in
place we have a html in place and using
some css3 based effects using some html5
based effects we will be creating our
mini website having some
single html page and
a css and lot of images will help you to
understand in case if i want to develop
a website how to kickstart them
okay so let's get started so this is my
folder i've created call web pro and in
a similar folder i'll be creating some
of the files so my first file will be
called styles
dot css
so in this style start series first of
all i need to import some of the fonts
which i will be using it throughout my
development so i'm saying to add it
import url
and here i'll be offering the location
by saying
https
songs
dot
google
apis
dot com
okay google please dot com slash
css
okay question mark we have to use family
equal to here we can use alure
and with using this pipe symbol we're
using joe's friend
joe's film
plus
sense
so that is the url for me in case if you
want to verify whether this url does
exist or not so what you can do you can
just copy this
and go to your browser
and uh
try to paste this and check if it does
exist yes it does exist that means this
urls are available to us so this is a
url which i'll be using it
for my development after that i'll be
using this as trick
and providing some of the core features
like enlarging
colon 0
followed by
other details
okay like i'm saying margin colon zero n
padding once again zero
followed by box sizing
this we're saying bottle box
followed by outline
okay none
okay
and
post this will be offering this style
here we are also saying none
after that text decoration
text decoration once again

after that font family
font family so we are using this
this option which you are saying called
joe's fill
okay
science double which you have used
comma
we're using one more call signs
hyphen sorry
so this would be a first
set of the style which will be global to
all i'll be using this
well earlier we have given the common
style to all not be giving a start to my
paragraphs
so
here in my paragraph we are trying to
save margin

give it for 14 pixels
followed by line height
line height i'll grab 20 pixels
after that color

called light blue
for that there's one value called
five
f
okay 8 e

you can see that is called a kind of
light green color which is coming up now
okay which is used now a part of this
paragraph we'll be using h1 title

followed by letter spacing
uh let us specify 5 pixels
so these are the details we have given
for the
h1 title
okay so now we'll be talking about our
buttons
which are the look and feel we have to
go or provide to our button so we are
saying once again dot btn
okay space a means under my button tag a
what i want so i say

line height we're giving 35 pixels
followed by border
this border will be 2 pixels
solid

this form family we are once again using
the same
the one which you have used earlier
you remember alura and curacao let me
we can use the same
whatever we have used it earlier
so
same condition you can use it here
so we remember earlier what we have used
in my previous program
okay font family so the same font family
i would like to use it here also
okay so logo a but let me check
somewhere down the line
what weight

and paste here right now
okay so we have a god for family with me
which we have taken it right now to my
existing logo a along with i want to use
for
font size
we would like to use 32 pixels
also color
and as usual i would like to use red
okay
so that is for logo on which we have
basically applied this
a part of this we would like to also use
for navbar
mapper underscore
item
space uh
and here we would like to provide margin
0 and padding
again 0
followed by line style
list style sorry
list
style here using none see that is the
benefit of having this visual studio
called because sometimes when you're
going wrong it immediately
give you the idea of like saying like
hey you're going somewhere wrong that's
what the suggestions were not given to
us
so till here we've added furthermore
we'll be adding few more styles into my
code well
never
tell us we have seen now followed by
saying
dot navbar
okay underscore
items
followed by
lul which we have it and along with this
we would like to go ahead with this list
items also
and in this list items we need
few details first i talk about golf load
so float left for sure then we talk
about color width
width will be 100 pixels
and now we talk about color height
height will be 40 pixels
well
float width height we have talked about
now we talk about called background
color
background color we can say light
solomon
that looks nice
and opacity
opacity we can just give call 0.8
followed by line height
light height i can give called 40 pixels
okay along with this we also want
texture line
once again
center
okay this is for
these items
now under the same nav bar you may have
some other properties also
okay this is for navbar uli
and we can also have the same property
copy
but along with this li i can also have
this anchor tag we can select multiple
elements together
so here i would like to offer text
transform
you see this text transform
uppercase
followed by color
this color we are saying black
and we are talking about called text
decoration
text decoration we want nothing
along with this i want display
and as usual it will be a block type
okay that was li and within this anchor
tag i also can have a hover
let me copy the same
and with this anchor i can have the
property name called word
cover
so what property you are expecting for
this
so here in my hover property i can say
background color
and i can use
tomato
okay
well after this in the same name bar
items
i also want to have
after the anchor tag what should happen
so this conditions i want to utilize
because i want to offer some of the
animations behavior
right over there
so what animations i would like to go
ahead that i need to offer under this
navigation
items like so i just copy this
paste it below but this over which we
are talking about we would like to
change from
to after
okay
after
so i'm removing this background color
with this because background color can
be changed to something else
so i can change to white
might
well let me have few more properties to
be get added
first thing we are trying to secure
position
position will be absolute
okay we want from left side
left i want to give 50 percent space
after this from bottom
i'm saying zero
okay
now i want to talk about transform
you remember to the property available
in css
and here we are saying
translate
x and in say this translate x i say
minus 50
okay and here we are saying after that
scale
x
okay and here we are providing what
zero
so that's what the condition we want to
provide it for the transform
and the next thing will be transform
origin
transform origin so i say fifty percent
and again
fifty percent
after this we would like to talk about
width
width will be hundred percent
okay and we also want this height
height will be two pixels
okay with hundred percent height to
pixels
after that we talk about transition
and this transition we can talk about
transform
okay transform to 50
ms
okay so these are so far the details
which are available with us
which i would like to use it in my code
okay that is for after of this anchor
tag
so when you talk about whole you further
want to change the behavior over there
so in this case i would like to use the
same
condition i just copy that
and here
let me say colon
so you can see
ally
space
a colon over
colon after
so what conditions you want to use it
here so
transform
okay so here
translate x
okay so here you say
minus
50
scale x
1.0
followed by we would like to use again
dot
nav bar
okay underscore item
okay ul
followed by li followed by once again
url
once again li
and here in this case we want to offer
display none
display
none
okay
so
that's okay and one more conditions i
would like to take it here is
here when i say ulli li colon hover so i
can say li
colon
over uli so we will say display
block
that's the condition
okay so so far we have written this much
of css we would like to go ahead and try
to implement some of the html behavior
and we'll be back to our css to make
this possible
okay everyone so we have developed a lot
about css it's time for us to move
towards our next
ui that is called the html part okay so
here i've already kept it just for the
kind information i've just downloaded
few of the
images
okay from the internet just to utilize
into my application
i'm gonna create
the another
file
and give the name called index.html
okay this index.html file let me have
this template with me okay so i have got
template with me
now here
uh we want to use some of the
awesome css styles for of my usual
development
so within my head tag we would like to
use this link

and href equal to now i'm going to give
the location so this css anyways is
there that's called style we want to say
called styles.css
and
one more style i would like to use in my
code
but the location will be somewhere else
i'm saying
https cdnjs
dot
cloudflare
dot com slash
ajax slash

okay that is a well-known style sheet we
are giving the version called 5.15
dot one slash

okay now i want to just check whether
this location does exist or not so i'll
just copy this
paste it in my browser to verify
well yes this
style does exist so we would like to go
ahead and continue
well i would like to give some title in
case if i want so this is called
document i can just get the name called
website
okay just keep this double capital
website development
coming to my body tag
here i just want to give a div
class equal to
let's give the name called main
thunderscore
container
okay and also we want to give id equal
to
oh

now along with this i want to give some
other type of div tags to where i want
to use it now here within this div tag i
want to give another div tag
where i want to provide the navbar so
dave

and this will be provided to
home so this is we have a god dev class
we have a quality of class equal to logo
and under this we are providing this
hashtag and using

okay that is the first anchor tag the
drip tag is getting closed and we would
like to start
another tab tag
and in this div tag we would like to say
class equal to
navbar
underscore
items
okay
within this div tag we would like to use
this human
and within this ul i would like to use
this li
okay and in this ally
uh
we would like to bring some
ahref
equal to
hash
that is the link which i need to provide
okay
so in this anchor tag we want to provide
a location called home here this is the
first list item which is there
like this i can provide some other list
items too
like i'm going to talk about call about
we're saying hash
about and here we say
about here
so this anchor tag is getting closed
okay
and
here before i close this list item here
you would like to take another url tag
okay in this url tag we would like to
paste this list item again and here with
this hash we can just give the name call
something whichever you want to give it
again
blank
and
empty
so after that ul is also getting closed
li is also getting closed here
okay
after this
we can provide few more li tags here
okay so
href equal to here we would like to
provide a real url remove the hashtag
and say
https
simply learn
dot com
slash
corporate hyphen
training
okay and here we will be giving
the option called services
this falls into the category of what
services
like this we would like to provide one
more anchor tag for contact us
that's a
contact
one more for our team
okay and here we say
our t
okay let me go back to my index.html
file
and check
the status
well it looks pretty nice now here we
have got simply learn solution with us
and right inside you can see now here in
about you see how the things are working
for me
this links are coming up automatically
it came because here if you remember
in my code
when i was saying this about
okay this was a part of our current code
and due to that it is now making it
possible for us
and that is possible because here in
white style dot css
if you remember
we were using this
a kind of
neighbor uli
okay so the moment i try to hover
okay so this was giving me the complete
details and due to that
i was in position to get all the details
so looks pretty
nice okay so going forward what i would
like to do is within my program
as i could see in my index.html file we
have provided this
tag so ul is getting close this dip is
getting close this tip is also getting
closed
okay
now here we would like to start another
table
we say dev class equal to banner image
minor underscore
image
okay now within this tip i would like to
use one more div tag within this div we
say
class equal to
banner underscore
content
okay
banner underscore content now within
this div class we would like to use this
h1
here we can say
welcome to
welcome to simply learn
okay after this
break tag as you know that is a for
break
and now
so this is fantastic we can say
words
okay
words
number one bootcamp
okay here the h1 tag is getting closed
after that the paragraph tag within this
paragraph we can say
get certified
get
ahead
this value
after this the div tag is getting closed
the second tip tag is also getting close
let me check
okay so that we need to organize it
uh in a better way so but initially we
have a god welcome to simply learn
words number one bootcamp
how my look and feel
is really gonna help because this banner
part
i want to organize it because i do not
have a css for this
clear so certainly i need a css to
organize this particular banner
getting it because when we talk about
banner content so i need to tell where
it needs to go because i also would have
some banned image also too so i will go
back to my css now
and in my style css
here
let me say banner content
banner underscore
content and here we can save
text align
center and say color
we can say
white smoke
okay and also within this banner content
we want to use the h1 tag
within this h1 tag you have to just say
text transform
upper case
and line height
line height 30 pixels
okay and
margin bottom
this margin bottom we want to use 15
pixels
okay
so that's when we have it let me close
this
sorry
and here we want to use one more
property called banner content
with h1 and the span tag so that i can
change the color
so here
banner content
h1 we also want to use
span tag
within this i want to say
color
and you can just say
tomato and let's check does it affect my
application
yes exactly it does effect now you can
see it is somewhere coming down the line
like this
okay
so i can further change it
to my application
like
if i talk about about and all so this i
can change it for sure because if i have
some images also
those images i also want to change
towards my application but it is just a
simple part we are talking about call
banner
and
we have also have to take some images
too
for this banner image
so let's go back
and talk about our index.html file and
see
what some of the balance i want to
utilize it here
okay
now when we talk about get ahead i
certainly need some of the banner image
too but banner image is not available so
let me go back and try to use some
banner image whichever we have to define
under my
css
okay so here in my style css let me go
here and say
dot
banner underscore
image
in this banner image we have to say
background url
background
colon now we have to say
url and in this url we have to use this
image called images
slash p4
dot jpg
that will be my image and also we would
like to use one very common option that
is called no repeat
so that it should not repeat it and i
want to fix it to the top
and in the center
okay now let's check
perfect it is coming up but it is not
looking as good as it looks like it
so we want to use few more important
things saying this background size
background size
cover and also want to use width
width i want to use 100
and height
we want to use it called 600 percent
okay display
we want to use it flex
and justify content
we want to use it call center
and align items
center let's check this out
okay now you can see it looks pretty
better
compared to the previous version
whatever we have written it
but this image needs to be look even
more better
okay and the content needs to be more
awesome
but anyways that is the first thing
which we have written after that we have
to write an about us and other areas but
that is initially which i would like to
make it
even more better and more look
okay
okay so we have seen the value still
call option called get certified get
ahead the div tag is getting closed and
i want to use another
div
and inside this div we want to say
class equal to about
okay and
id equal to about
okay
and within this div tag i want to use
this h1 tag
with the set one tag i say
class equal to
title
okay here i want to say
about us
h1 time is closed
after that i want to define this
paragraph
and want to give some details about the
simpler okay like
and talk about simply learn
words number one
training okay we can just
provide
you know some details training providers
that's it so
we can write it that much about in
paragraph tag
and we can use this tab again
within this step we
say to
plus equal to
bdn
and say
a
h f
equal to
and in the search results we would like
to say
colon
simply learn
dot com okay slash
resources and here we can just give the
option name called
learn
more
to this anchor tag the div tag is
getting close later on
okay and now
just like in dev we have provided here
we can also offer the details with
regards to your
services so i can just copy the same
and provide about the services so we can
say
services id equal to
services and you can provide anything
whichever you would like to provide
title is same about us we can say our
services
our services
so
you can give any details if you want
okay paragraph
now
here after this paragraph using div
class equal to
div
underscore services
and uh
we may not have any href right over here
so we're removing this href tag
okay deb class equal to
diff on sickness particularly
i
developed inter services
here we want to use another div tag
and
in this div tag we want to say
class equal to
enter underscore
services
underscore
item
we have to basically provide
and within this i have to use this
option called img
src equal to now you have to provide a
location so i'm saying
under this images folder we have a call
services
because the results one
dot jpg
alt equal to
in case of the service is not available
you can just say
service underscore image
okay within this
once this is close you like to use a h3
diagonal
and in this h3 tag i just say
class
equal to
sub
underscore
title and here we get the title name
called

yeah so i can see this option called
about us is coming up
learn more if i talk about learn more
you see i'm taking you to the
website of this
simply done resources which are
available to us so this link is working
perfectly fine
and
i can see here called our services
it is the same
well going back so we have a call
this our services
so alt equal to
services underscore image
sc class equal to subtitle web
development
and uh
that's it
so the div tag is getting closed here
and i may choose to
talk towards
diff service item so let me have
another div tag here and
in this div tag we say
class equal to
div
underscore services underscore item
active underscore services underscore
item
okay now within this dev tag
okay so
what you want to offer now
i want to offer some again certain
images
so what those images will be let me try
to copy this
and the s3 tag to let me copy this again
service one i'm giving call service to
service underscore images so underscore
title rather than using web development
we can say app development
okay
so this div tag i will copy it again
which is getting closed and try to use
one more
so dev underscore service underscore
item again images i'll say service 3
instead service image and here i can say
online certification
online certification
okay
so
like this
all the three dip tags are getting close
now and after that we will start
meanwhile let me check
so these image sizes are pretty big so i
just want to make them small
but initially they are okay
okay you can see we have all our
services
okay
so
you can see like web development
so image sizes are pretty big which we
can
make them small
to cover up the way they are supposed to
but this way we'll be doing it little
later on let's go ahead and talk about
the complete html portion which we want
to complete it now
okay so did online certification we have
taken
so also the three div tags are getting
closed now here onwards
we want to start the another table

after that let's start with another div
tag
with this div we want to use class
equal to
form
underscore
wrapper
okay deb class equal to what form
underscore word wrapper
div
again
okay
class equal to
form underscore what input
and here we say
the input tag
so it is input applicable to what a
check box for me
so i would like to say
text instead input applicable to what
text and uh
just say remove the name and id and say
please hold it equal to
email
okay so this div tag is getting closed
after that i can also use
so for
i would say subject as well as for
message i copy this
form input
so once again
placeholder
subject
and
once again placeholder equal to what
three options we are using it right now
okay
after this
once it is over we would like to use
another div tag
and
class equal to
btn
and within this i want to use
some anchor tag
a h f equal to hash
is equal to what hash
and want to use submit
okay that's it
now
[Music]
now you can see we have got these three
properties are coming up at the end
but certainly we can go back and try to
fix those images
which are there behind the scene
okay using what the style
so
first important thing is
we have got this images with us
what those images are if we just check
here
we have a call
def service item
okay we have a call what dev service
item so that we want to change it but
before that i will go back to my style
and after this h1 span we want to use
for dot
about
okay dot
service we press enter
service or i can say services
here we talk about dot
contact us
we also talk about dot dot
our team
okay
so these four properties we are going to
use it by saying
texture line
center and
[Music]
adding five percent
ten percent
okay
now
we talk about services so we saying dot
services
with the services we can say
background
white
smoke
now we would like to provide the tip
services where we have these options
with us we say dot
div underscore
services
here
margin top
25 pixels
from margin top usa after that display
we are selecting this call type flex
also justify contents
of type space between
for div services
now in this div services we may get many
different type of options
okay
this is the first dev service now in the
same option in dot
dev services
space
we talk about dev services underscore
item
okay
and here we want to save with
30 percent
okay now
i copy the same
in this div services item
so we want to use
image part that is the most important
area
here we say
width
hundred percent
okay and margin button
okay margin bottom 25 pixels
okay
okay now you can see this images looks
pretty nice
yeah looks better
so that's how you see your websites are
really creating some difference compared
to the previous one now they're aligned
properly
and
you can see here
these images are really nice
okay that's the benefit
so we have this
let me call the classes
yeah and
once this image part is closed we would
like to talk about h3 part
let me copy this
item
and with this item we save as3
and this h3 will say color
tomato and margin bottom
these are 15 pixels
okay for this h3
and when it comes to this text boxes
certainly you can change the look and
feel how you really want it
so for this you can say dot
form underscore
wrapper
form underscore
input
okay form wrapper form input
we say margin hyphen bottom
15 pixels
okay perform input
now in a similar line
form input we may have a for text area
input
text area and in this text area we
want to offer some of the details like
i'm talking about like in width we talk
about padding
let's talk about like in the width
i'm saying 250 pixels
okay we said padding
we say 12 pixels
and
20 pixels
we talk about
height
80 pixels we talk about resize
we talk about
none
we say border
this bottle we say one pixels
call it
and
right
this is for this
and in a similar one i can use it for
the text box so form colon input
whatever we have used it
form wrapper
form input so let me copy this
okay form input and here we say
input equal to
type of text
so what
combination you'll be using so i'll be
using width padding and border
copy i need which paddock and border
height and precisely removing it
and
awesome
so they look
pretty nice
okay so we have this three text boxes
with us
and all are looking
nice the way
we are expecting from our application
okay so that's the one
which my application is offering about
this
text area and all
so that looks really nice the way we are
expecting right now
okay
so
what are the areas we have seen
tiff services item
and everything whichever you are saying
like this
so let's go back and check
my index.html file
so we have a call
form wrapper which is the outermost
okay
you see now here it contains lot many
things
so here in my
program and i see like form wrapper
okay
form underscore wrapper
dot form input
and
talk about like the other details
talk about input type equal to text
you see like the border is like that
so if you want to have this border some
different color
and certainly use black
now you can see it looks pretty nice
because earlier it was looking like
pretty much different now at least i can
see
here the location has been given
okay uh so going back towards the
previous
html page so we had a call uh submit
button with us
okay after this the
all three div tags are getting closed
and now onwards we would like to start
working with team details
so we are saying div
so div
class equal to
our team
and uh
id equal to
team again
okay and now we want to use this h1 tag
here this h1 tag we say
class
class equal to title
and here i say
in a h1 tag
now once it is over we will use again
another div tag
which having
class equal to our team wrapper
our
team
underscore
wrapper
now within this step tag
we want to use one more div tag
here in this
class equal to
team underscore or team iphone one
base
team
there is a div tag now here we will be
using a lot of other div tags inside
this like
i say
div
class equal to team members
team members
okay
and uh
data hyphen
name equal to you can give any name like
let's give the name
call display space k
okay
and within this
i want to use one image tag
img space src equal to
images slash
team one
dot jpg
okay
so that's the first thing
we have it so this div tag is closed now
i copy the same
the total i want to use this three one
two
three
and
here team members i would like to change
the name here
rather than display let me give the name
called
abiji and
one more
that is gone
okay and change the name to two
forward five three
okay so this is the first div we have
used it so this jack is getting closed
right over here
along with this the second drive tag is
getting closed
so
after having this
two div tags closed we want to use
another one so for team two
okay so i just copy the same
okay uh
i would like to go ahead with
team two team so team members
and
here i would like to say four five
four
five
six
and change the name
like
you can give anything i just give the
name called
suppose
rn
radish
and
so these names we are using it now let's
go back and see how it really looks
so these images are coming like that
okay so we want to use those images in
[Music]
somewhere not like this or horizontal
vertical
so this spot fix that issue i have to
once again look back to it to my styles
okay where
this option can be used in better way
i like to go back to my style.css
and want to use
the first option called dot over 3.
background
sorry
background now here we say
white smoker
now
again
our tea
rubber in this i would like to say
display
flex
and flex direction
space between
oh sorry column
let's check already looks like it
there's a no more change but
certainly few more classes can really
make a difference
so our team
okay underscore rapper
let's check this is the same name we
have used
it is our team
now in the same way we want to use this
team
so
again our teamwrapper
okay
dot
team
display
click
and justify contents
space between
okay
now here
we talk about team we also want to say
our team underscore rapper
dot
team
underscore
members
here we would like to give width
how much 30 percent
and height
this will be auto
and here we'll be having cursor
pointer for sure
and overflow
hidden
and position
relative
this is for team members
now you can see it looks better now now
we have to basically divide those
because we have got separate team
members are available so we have to also
divide them too so here after this we
want to say
dot
our team
wrap up and again dot
team members
space img
these images we say
display
block
width
100
okay
height
auto
okay
transition
transition
or
transition i can say or type all
like this
okay and in a similar way
copy this team
and we'll say members
over
image
and we can say
transform
scale
1.1
that's it
okay so we have this
look and feel appeared
okay with
transition image over so they're all
ready with us
okay everybody so after writing all
those the only difference i've made it
like i had used hyphen but i'm using
underscore here
finally when i see my look and feel
of this
i can see now it is moving you can see
now it is all moving
okay so that gives me the confidence of
like yes exactly the code is working the
way it was expected earlier
in my index.html file
okay so once this portion is over
okay we want to go ahead so three tip
tags are getting close one two and three
and here
we would like to start working with the
footer so here we start
folder
so within this footer i say
class equal to
footer
okay now after this i use container
there
div class equal to what
container
and again
div
equal to
row
okay
now
do class equal to row again another div
equal to
footer hyphen col
call footer hyphen column
now let me use h4
within this h4 i say
company
okay after this we want to use this ul
within this um
once again
i want to use some
link items
list items within this list item
a
equal to
so this hrf tag we want to say
http okay we have already used this
simplyland.com url
here
let me copy this
come down
http.com rather than resources i can say

okay
after that
we want to offer the careers to be safe
and we want to use

review
that's it
aluminum speak
so this is the detail of this so the ul
tag is getting close
and after this ul tag is getting closed
uh
we want to use one more div class equal
to footer hyphen column
okay i copy this
it is getting closed here
okay so do classical to photo hyphen
column so rather than using company we
want to use test cover
discover
and here in this discover we say
simplylink.com
and here we have this option called
skill up
hyphen
free iphone
online hyphen
order
okay so here we will give the name call
scale up
okay after this
we have this called careers we say
resources
very much
resources
here we can give the name called
resources again
resources
we have called tutorials

create as many number of urls as i want
okay
so
once it is over
let me copy this again
and here
photocolumn we say follow us
follow
us
or else we can say this option name
called work with us
work
with

some options with us and you will
remove those two
in this we would like to say guest

[Music]
follow us we would like to use another
table

social hyphen
links
and this dev time will be closed later
okay
templar is equal to social links
in this i can have some facebook.com
and uh
you know twitter.com and many more
names i can take it so here in our
dev classically social link
here i would not be using any url here
i would not be using any ally here
okay so i'm closing this even in analyze
closing this url like
to
well simplyland.com or else we can just
give the name called twitter.com
okay
twitter.com slash
simplylab
okay
so
we can offer the user
to
follow
sauna instagram also or the
twitter also so here we say
a hdf
but what we need to give it so we can
say trader.com
slash simply
learn we remove this values whichever we
have it
so instead we use this i
okay and in this i i say
equal to
okay anchor tag is closed
so in case if you want to talk about
like in
typical uh
you know instagram that instagram also
you can use it now so here
we say
dot http
we say instagram.com okay slash
simply learn underscore
underscore e-learning
okay and i want to use the same option
there also
i
and with this
remove this
okay
so here just give the name called every
hybrid
instructor
now let's go back and check
okay so you can see now we have got this
links coming up for facebook as well as
what
of this instagram so that looks really
nice that gives us a feeling of yes
exactly the code the way we are looking
forward for it is working
the way it was expected
okay and
if you want to offer
any
other type of details that also you can
offer but this is the first thing which
we have taken so this is the navigation
links are available
these navigation links you could also
change the way they always look forward
for so i'll be providing some links
which we can later on use it
okay everyone so finally we are all
ready so i have basically added some of
the additional styles to my code you can
see here from
this one downwards we've added this
image url
this is for body this is for star
container row ul
this is for footer
this is for photo column so because we
are also using some photo portions into
my code as you can see we will call
photo column and photo class equal to
what
footer so implemented this photo
background color equal to black we have
used it padding 70 pixels footer column
footer column because we are using this
h4 tag also you remember like we're
using this h4 tag also
so for all h4 tags this would be the
basic setting
for footer column h4 before we would
like to give the contents like this by
giving this background color height box
sizing width and then all
for the column unle not last time we
gonna give this margin bottom and this
is the style for photo column uli and
list items
clear and here you can see this font
size we are giving it this is for over
this is for photo column where we have
social links whichever we have created
so it is showing me the display line
block margin border radius
and this is for social links when i try
to click on or over it so the color will
change to this white color
and the media this is for responsiveness
to make sure like in case if i reduce
the size of my browser they look
better the way it is expected
so when the line size will change to 720
pixels so this color will be changed and
this is the styles for arrow footer one
this all we have implemented and finally
my application when i refresh it
actually looks like that see now this is
the photo area of my application
so i'm sure that this looks even more
better and convenient because when i try
to
reduce the size
you see now it's still going to give you
the responsiveness
can you see this now this is going to
give you the responsiveness reason
because here we are using this
logic for
media when the change
of width will to 720 pixels if it is
going to 767 pixels so like that you
implement that so guys our project is
now ready i'm sure that you enjoyed
thank you very much for enjoying this
project so final our application is set
and our application is working the way
it is supposed to work for us
okay thank you
