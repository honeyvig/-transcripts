when you visit a restaurant first the
first thing that comes to your mind you
look around the furnishings and fixtures
and then feel the ambience around you
similarly when you visit a website you
look at the ease of usage and experience
that Comfort involved by using the
application to simplify it further with
the same restaurant example the food
menu the services the ambience music
teas and the restaurant environment can
be considered user experience or ux you
are already watching simply learn and
today we bring this informative video
about you its design before we begin if

who call the concept of ux design is it
Allen key Turner Norman John Warner or
Dylan feed let us know your answer below
and get a heart from Simply learn
without any further delay let's get
started with the session on what is ux
design ux design create its software or
desktop application considering the
anti-user expectations and requirements
it's the process of creating a steamland
experience by the digital or physical
that customers will find practical
simple to use and enjoyable to interact
with it involves improving the user
experience of the consumers when dealing
with your product at ensuring they give
you good feedback on what you offer the
third process of constant iteration and
ideology to enhance the user interaction
with the application and its service can
be termed as ux design there are many
factors involved with ux design but the
three most important ones are usefulness
usability and desirability if you sum up
all these three factors we can design a
great ux or user experience first come
the usefulness of ux the primary focus
of a ux design should always be on the
application usability our website become
dominant only when it's simple to use
Serve the purpose and proves beneficial
to the user now eggs come the usability
of ux these factors usefulness and
usability may sound the same still the
parameters considered in usability
revolve around the effectiveness
efficiency and performance of the
application and it's scalable to handle
multiple user requests at the same time
without crashing the uxana must ensure
the application is strong enough to
easily surf multi-users environments and
the last one is desirability that plays
a key role in ux the visual Aesthetics
of application engage desirability in
qsys since the application need to
complete with several other similar
applications higher the desirability
better the application look at all the
products around you think about
usefulness usability and desirability
and see which one has a better ux next
we will discuss what will make the user
experience better let's see some
examples one of the most helpful
employee on boarding checklist is
provided by LinkedIn how would you go
about looking for work or hiring you
people as LinkedIn helps in recreating
new people easily and it's relatively
easy while opening a LinkedIn account we
notice how the website keep offering
suggestion to improve our LinkedIn
profile and use the tool more
effectively it can be either by adding
relevant skills acquired certification
or just connecting with people in our
domain to create a network and we recall
completing them because they seem
important and will give a profile better
visibility in this case LinkedIn is a
success let's take a look at another
example Spotify completely modified
personalization Spotify app deserves a
market of what one thing is obvious with
that daily mixes and the most recent
addition the Bland tool that enables you
to combine your music and create a
playlist with your friends nobody does
personalization better than Spotify
spotify's ux is different since it
offers the customization that we all
desire in 2022 the Spotify user
experience include not only
customization but also how the software
was around the idea of personal music
they retain users on app by creating a
loop of personalization music while
constantly recommending music you may
like with daily suggestion I recommend
playlist this helps create a musical
experience that other platforms strive
to replicate user experience one of the
industries trending themes you should be
more familiar with the complexities of
user experience if you are in the design
profession so far we have seen the big
picture of ux design now let's look into
more details about the process and what
steps are required to have a good ux
design so the first one in the process
is to understand this is one of the most
important procedure in the ux design for
the product team before creating
anything in the market because
understanding the product context is
more important before designing it this
phase of understanding gives you the
foundation for the design process next
is the ability to research after
brainstorming ideas the product team
moves the application into the research
phase then the designer conducts
thorough research identifies the problem
and comes up with the better Solutions
the research phase can be classified
into two categories market research and
user research market research is
checking out similar products available
in the market and understanding their
unique features that make them stand up
user research will be given a higher
priority and will form a base of your
product by hosting test groups and
conducting service this information will
help you discover user expectation and
server better design platform up next we
have design at this phase the product
team start working on activities that
involve constructing more curves images
icons colors and Etc the design phase
include creating prototyping wireframes
and sketches but the wireframe is among
the most important aspects you can
produce a wireframe is an extremely
simplified representation of your
product the next one is testing this
phase determine how the Market uses your
service and product for example if you
were the swiggy app designer you might
ask your user to use the app and place
an order you may have seen how users
respond to app by ordering to food you
can query them about their experience
once they have finished this is an
excellent chance to determine how
satisfy your user is with your app and
whether it meets their demands should
there be any concern those can be
rectified right away before the product
hits the market finally we will look
into evaluation the benefit of getting
users feedback is to compare the ideas
and assumptions you develop you can
utilize this input to make change to
your product or think of the brand new
features you may have yet to consider as
we learn more about the ux is being
received by the general public the team
can work on the further improving the
base to create the best version of your
product after understanding the basics
of ux design are you ready to start
practicing on your own and start
mastering your design tool now let's
pick out two tools one is figma and it
has a very generous free plan you can
work on it using all the features
completely and it has some collaboration
features that if you are working with
someone you can work on the same design
files simultaneously it can work
directly on the browser making it
platform independent while also having
dedicated apps for certain operating
systems another option is Adobe XD Adobe
is Creative Cloud offers a
synchronization features with other
Adobe products which can be very much
helpful when working with large projects
with a very large customer base and
readily available support from Adobe
