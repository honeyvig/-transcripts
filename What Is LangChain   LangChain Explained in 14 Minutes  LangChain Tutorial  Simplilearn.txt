hello everyone and welcome to this
fantastic video on what is Lang chain on
the simply Lear YouTube channel all of
you must be already aware of blockchain
but let me give you a quick refresher a
blockchain is a digital Ledger that
store information like a digital
database without a central Authority
controlling it instead a blockchain is
maintained by a network of computers
each one is storing a copy of The Ledger
when a new transaction is added to the
Ledger the network has to approve it
before it can be recorded other side l
chain is like a blockchain but with a
few differences unlike a blockchain
which stores information about financial
transaction L chain can store any kind
of data or information like medical
records supply chain data or even social
media profiles L chains design also
allows for private transaction where
only a certain people can access and
view the store data which differs from a
regular blockchain sounds fascinating
right well it is and there is a lot more
to learn and discuss about blockchain
technology in this video so stay tuned
till the very end as we embark on this
amazing journey of exploring langin

without any further delay let's get
started so what is Lang
chain Lang chain is a versatile open
source framework that empowers AI
developers to integrate large language
model llms such as gbt 4 with the
external data available in the python
JavaScript packages Lang chain addresses
the limitation of GPT models trained
only up until 2021 while GPT for models
exibit impressive general knowledge
their potential is greatly enhanced by
connecting them to customize data and
customized computations and this is
precisely what Lang Chain facilate by
enabling LMS access comprehensive
database Lang chain empowers them to
generate responses based on the most
upto-date information found in the
reports documents and website content
since the launch of GTP 4 in March lch
has garnered substantially popularity
due to its flexibility and the my rate
of possibilities it unlocks when
combined with the high powered llm so
moving forward let's see why we need
Lang chin so Lang chin represents a
practical solution to overcome this
limitation through a practical approach
it involves pre-processing the tax
Corpus by dividing it into manageable
chunks or summaries and adding them in a
vector space and subsequently searching
for similar chunks when a question is
posed so this methodology of
pre-processing real time and data
collection and interaction with the llm
is not only applicable in the context
but also extend to other scenarios such
as code semantic search so Lang
simplifies the composition of these
components by offering an abstraction
the simplification of the process often
called prompt Plumbing plays a crucial
role and will grow in significance as
llms becomes more powerful and
necessitate the provision of additional
data during the prompt execution so
moving forward let's see how does Lang
chain work so Lang chain simplifies the
process of organizing large volume of
data that can be easily accessed by the
llm requiring minimal computational
power it operates by taking a
subsequential data source like 50 page
PDF and breaking it down into manageable
chunks and that are embedded into a
vector store so with the vectorized
representation of the extensive document
at hand we can combine them with the llm
to selectively retrieve the necessary
information for creating prompt
completion pairs so when we input a
prompt into our chatbot equipped with
langin it queries the vector store to
find perent information a kind of
miniature Google tailored to your
document once the relevant details are
obtained they are combined with the llm
prompt and fed into the llm to generate
our desired response after this
integration of Lang chain with the open
a llms also enables the creation of
application capable of taking
such as web serving email sending and
other task related to APM and at the end
you will get a reply so this is how Lang
chain works with open AI llms moving
forward let's see some use cases of Lang
chain so there is a wide range of
potential application for Lang chain
here are few examples so first one is
personal AI email assistant Lang chain
can be used to develop an intelligent
email assistant that understood and
generates responses based on the user
preferences and writing style the second
one is AI study body so langin can
assist a student in their Studies by
providing real-time access to relevant
research papers textbooks and
educational resources offering
personalized study recommendation and
answering theoretical questions and the
third one is AI data analytics Lang
chain can be employed to enhance data
analytics by allowing large language
model to access and analyze V amount of
structured and unstructured data
enabling more comprehensive insight and
prediction and the fourth one is custom
company customer service chatbot langen
can power chatbot that provide tailored
customer service experience by
integrating upto-date company
information product knowledge and the
customer data to offer personalized and
accurate responses and the fifth one is
social media content creation so Lang
chain can help content creator generate
engaging and relevant social media
content by leveraging its ability to
access the latest information Trends and
insight from various sources so these
example illustrate just the fraction of
the potential application for L chain
and its versatility extend to a wide
array of other scenarios as well so
after seeing use cases of Lang chain
let's move forward and see using open AI
how L chain works or not so welcome to
the demo part so here first we will set
up the what the problem is using the
chat
GPT so this is the chat GPT this is
something that we all know and I'm going
to first ask CH what is Lang chain
and we will see what it will say okay so
here I will write
what okay what is
Lang
chain so as you can see it is saying I'm
sorry but as of my knowledge cut off in
September 2021 I'm not familiar with the
term langang chin it is possible that it
could be a term or concept that emersed
or became popular at the at
time and could you provide more context
or details about what you are referring
to that way I can try to assist you
better so as you can see why this is
happened it is because lanin is a more
recent
Library so this is the new library and
Lang chain is I think published in uh
somewhere around January and it is new
and Chad GPT has not been trained on the
data more recent than I think like
around 21 as you can see it is written
here September 2021 okay so this is the
problem number one so let's see the
problem number two so here I will write
hey
chat
GPT tell me how
many
meetings the meetings are blocked
today
using using
my
Google
calendar again it is saying I'm sorry
but as an AI language model I don't have
access to personal data about
individuals unless it has been shared
with me du during our conversation I can
browse or retrieve information from your
Google calendar or any other personal
documents or accounts however if you
have access to your Google calendar you
can easily check the number of meetings
blog today by opening your calendar and
looking at the schedule events for the
day the calendar interfaces should
display the number of meetings or events
you have scheduled and why this is
happening because we are using chat GP
open a okay but if we will use
API of open AI okay currently I'm using
the chat GPT but if we will use the open
AI API so we can connect to our Google
Drive Google Calendar and any
anything after that we can easily
retrieve our
information okay so this is where so as
you can see using this image what Lang
chain
does okay is it is going to connect
connect your AI models okay these are
the AI models open AI hugging
phases so what the langet does okay
using
llms it is going to connect to outside
sources like Google drive or Wikipedia
wallframe or you know Google cender
anything to the outside
sources and you can do some really cool
things without those outside sources
okay you can ask to the chat GPT and or
you can make your own model llm model
but without llm model and Lang chain you
can't connect with the outside
resources okay so all of a sudden you
can start to chain together commands
Okay that is why the Lang chain is used
chain okay these are the llm models open
air hugging faces and you can chain both
of them using L chain okay you can
change the outside sources and this llms
using Lang
chain okay uh after chaining llm and
outside sources using L chain you can
ask any question to them okay what is my
how many documents I wrote in the last
year and this month or you can say hey
chity what's the weather today to open
AI or anything you can ask these uh kind
of
questions and the application for the
Lang chain are the endless and we have
already seen some of of them okay so now
let's see the documentation part of the
langin official documentation part of
the langin so as you can see this is the
official documentation of the Lang chain
okay so here as you can see what is the
Lang chain Lang chain is a framework for
developing application powered language
models llm models it enables
applications that are dataware or agent
so as you can see there are the certain
modules and the example use cases as you
can see the chatbots
and you can create the M uh you know
chat BS using llms like open Ai and
there are the many things like
interaction with apis
autonomas okay you can check
anything these are some the uh modules
of the Lang change Lang CH provides
standard extendable interfaces okay so
these are the modules and the these are
the use
cases okay ecosystems and the support
API reference these are the API
differences how you can use the API and
as you can see this is the installation
part using pip you can use install the
Lin and the cond part is here the cond
install Okay so this is this you know
official document you can go through it
and you will learn you will definitely
learn something if you will go through
the official
document so that's all we had for this
