hey everyone welcome to simply loans
youtube channel
today we will be discussing one of the
interesting topics that is what is c
sharp
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you are a tech geek
in a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn
now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
first we will define the c sharp
programming language
followed by that we will take a look at
where c sharp is used after that we will
see some characteristics of c sharp
finally we will take a look at the
benefits of c sharp programming language
let's begin with our first topic and
attempt to comprehend what is c sharp
programming language
c sharp is a strongly typed object
oriented programming language c sharp is
an open source programming language that
is simple modern flexible and versatile
anders albert from microsoft created the
c programming language used to write
software programs in 2000
it was later approved as an
international standard by ekman 2002 and
iso in 2003.
followed by that let us learn where
exactly c programming language is being
used
c-sharp is a general purpose programming
language that can create a variety of
programs and applications while it is
heavily versatile it is mainly used for
three different fields
the first field in which c-sharp is used
is the web application development
second is the windows applications
and the third field in which c
programming language is used is game
development
we will see all the three fields where
c-sharp is being used one after the
other so the first and foremost we will
discuss the web application development
regardless of the platform you can still
use the c-sharp programming language you
can build dynamic websites and web apps
using the.net platform or other open
source platforms now we'll talk about
the second field where c-sharp is being
used that is windows applications
microsoft created c-sharp for microsoft
so it's no surprise that it's famous for
creating windows applications
it makes your development process run
smoothly and features like c sharp
garbage collector performs admirably
finally we will discuss the third field
that is games where c sharp is being
extensively used developers in the
gaming industry prefer the c sharp
programming language this language is
beneficial for creating fan favorite
games in addition the unity game engine
one of the most popular today is written
in c plus plus and c sharp
after understanding the field in which c
sharp programming language is used we
will realize some c sharp
characteristics
c sharp has the following
characteristics
so the first characteristics of c-sharp
is that it is modern and easy the second
characteristic is that it is fast and
open source the third distinguishing
feature of c-sharp is its cross-platform
compatibility the following feature is
security
the fifth characteristic of c
programming language is its versatility
and the last characteristic is the
evolution of c sharp programming
language it is still an evolving
condition so you can expect some major
updates in the coming near future
now we will go all over the
characteristics we have seen in detail
one by one
the first one is the modern and easy
characteristics of c sharp
c-sharp is a simple modern and
object-oriented programming language
c was created to create a programming
language that is simple to learn and
supports modern functionality of all
types of software development
second we have the fast and open source
characteristics of c sharp
c sharp is an open source and managed by
the dot net foundation which is
independent of microsoft
in comparison to the other high level
programming languages c sharp is fast c
version 8 has numerous performance
enhancements the third characteristic of
c-sharp programming language is its
cross-platform capability
c programming language works on multiple
platforms so you can create
applications that run on windows linux
and mac computers c-sharp apps can also
be deployed in the cloud and containers
the fourth characteristic of c-sharp
programming language is the safety
c-sharp is a type safe programming
language c-sharp does not permit type
conversions which may result in data
loss or other issues
c-sharp allows developers to write safe
code csharp also focuses on writing
efficient code
now the fifth characteristic
the fifth characteristic of cesia
programming language is its versatility
c functions as a swiss army knife unlike
almost all programming languages c sharp
was created with a single goal to do
c
can be used to create today's modern
software applications c-sharp can be
used to create a wide range of
applications such as windows client apps
components and libraries services and
apis web applications mobile
applications cloud applications and
video games
the last and sixth characteristic of c
programming language is its evolving
nature
c sharp version 8 is the most recent
version of c
if you look at the evolution of c
programming language you will notice it
is evolving faster than any other
programming language
c sharp is initially designed to write
windows client applications but it can
also now do almost anything including
console cloud and modern machine
learning software
finally we will look at some of the
important benefits of c programming
language
the first benefit of c programming
language is that all environments
plugins and library supports c-sharp
the next benefit is c-sharp can run
desktop mobile and web applications and
c-sharp offers cross-platform with
dependable performance
following by that the next benefit is
2019 stack overflow survey 31.9 percent
of the professional developers prefer
the c programming language and have the
third largest community
the last and fourth benefit of c
programming language is that c sharp
received 67 percent approval as the most
popular programming language globally
there are over 5000 c-sharp jobs
available in the united states alone now
with that we have come to an end of this
