as we know with the increasing demand in
the project requirements for different
companies we require new software along
with different operating system for
applications
which creates more data and we need more
processing power and more memory
but there's a way to overcome such
situations known as
virtualization
hi guys and welcome to another exciting
video by simply learn
but before we begin if you like watching
tech videos subscribe to our channel and
hit the bell icon to never miss an
update
to understand what exactly
virtualization is let's take a look at
an example
meet jake he works as a software
developer in an i.t firm
and he often has to work on different
projects involving multiple operating
system according to the requirements of
the project
during which he often come across cases
where the managing of data becomes
problematic due to the compatibility
issues with the different operating
systems which makes it hard for the
completion of the project
so what can jake do to overcome such a
problem
to overcome such a problem he decided to
use the way of virtualization
but what is virtualization and how do
they help us let's take a look
to begin with we'll take a look at what
exactly virtualization is and how to
help us
then we'll understand what virtual
machines are
after that we learn about the role and
different types of hypervisor that are
involved during the process of
virtualization
after that we learn what different types
of virtualizations are available and how
differently they affect our systems
and lastly we will see what benefits
virtualization provide us with
let's begin
to begin with we'll understand what
virtualization is
virtualization is nothing but utilizing
a software to create a virtual layer
over the hardware
which allows the system hardware to be
used more efficiently and allows
appropriate return for a hardware cost
the software hypervisor also allows the
elements of the system like storage
memory processor etc to be distributed
among multiple separate and secure
virtual computers known as virtual
machines
to understand the situation of
virtualization much better let's take a
look at an example
this is a system installed with the
windows operating system which is
officially known as the host os where
the virtualization software known as the
hypervisor will run
and then
using the hypervisor software we can
have multiple instances of different os
including unix
mac and linux which are known as virtual
systems or guest os
the working of the virtualization is
only possible by the using a software
known as a hypervisor
and later in the video we will also
learn about the working and different
types of hypervisor involved
now that we have understood what
virtualization is let's take a look at
what a virtual machine is
as the name suggests virtualization is
nothing but an emulation or a virtual
representation of a physical operating
system on a hardware device
the virtual machines are also known as
guest os whereas a physical system that
they run on also known as the host os
now let's take a look at the software
that makes the virtualization possible
hypervisor is a software layer that
manages the virtual machines it forms an
interface between the physical system
and the virtual machine which ensures
the proper access of the resources
it also manage the virtual machine so
that they don't interfere with each
other's resources
let's take a look at what different
types of hypervisors are there
the first type of hypervisor is known as
the type 1 hypervisor or the bare metal
hypervisor this type of hypervisor
directly interacts with the hardware
system and user resources
the other type of hypervisor is known as
the type 2 hypervisor
which runs as an application on the host
operating system
and the hypervisor also coordinates with
the virtual machine for resource
management
let's take a look at the type 1
hypervisor
they run directly on top of the host
operating system and utilizes the
hardware resources
that is why they are also known as the
bare metal hypervisor
they take up the place of the host
operating system and works as the own
operating system
since this type of hypervisor work
directly on the hardware system they are
highly efficient
now that we understand type 1 hypervisor
let's take a look at the type 2
hypervisor
this type of hypervisor doesn't directly
work on the operating system hardware
but instead it works as an application
in the host operating system
where they are suitable for running
individual system
users can also have different multiple
os installed in the physical system by
using this type of hypervisor
due to the application based working of
the type 2 hypervisor they are also
known as virtual machine monitors in
short vmms
now that we understand what different
types of hypervisor are let's take a
look at what types of virtualization are
present
the first type of virtualization is the
desktop virtualization
then the network virtualization
storage virtualization and lastly the
application virtualization let's take a
look at them one by one
for desktop virtualization as the name
suggests in this type of virtualization
we can run multiple operating systems on
a single hardware system
let's take a look at different types of
desktop virtualization
the first one is virtual desktop
infrastructure in short vdi
which runs numerous virtual machines on
a central server and then hosted to the
user according to the user's requirement
in this way the user can access any
operating system
without have to physically install the
particular operating system in its
hardware system
the second one is known as local desktop
virtualization as the name suggests it
uses a hypervisor software on a local
system which allows a user to run
multiple operating system simultaneously
without having to affect the host
operating system
the next type of virtualization is the
network virtualization in this type of
virtualization the software creates a
virtual instance of the network that can
be used to manage from a single console
and it also forms the abstraction of the
hardware components and functions
including switches routers etc
which simplifies the network management
different types of network
virtualization are
software defined virtualization
which virtualizes the hardware that
controls the network traffic routing and
the other one is network function
virtualization
virtualize is the hardware appliances
that provide network specific function
easier to configure and manage example
firewall
let's take a look at the third type of
virtualization known as the storage
virtualization this virtualization
enables all the storage devices on the
system to be accessed and be managed as
a single storage unit
the storage virtualization collects all
the storage into a single pool from
which they can allot
another virtual machine on the same
network as required and this makes it
easier to assign storage for multiple
virtual machines with max efficiency
the last virtualization that we'll
discuss is the application
virtualization in this type of
virtualization process the application
runs directly without the need of
installing it into the system as they
run on a virtual environment
different types of application
virtualization app
the local application virtualization and
this type of application runs on the
host device but runs in a different
virtual environment but not in the
hardware
the second one is application
virtualization in this the application
is on the server side and it sends some
of the components to the host device
according to the requirement
and last is the server-based application
virtualization
this application runs directly on the
server side and sends only the interface
to the client system
now let's take a look at the benefits of
virtualization
the first one is the resource efficiency
as the name suggests before
virtualization each application server
used its own hardware resources which
were being underused but with the having
multiple virtual machines maximum
utilization of the hardware capacity
occurs
then we have minimum downtime which
refers to the crashes of operating
system and application which can cause a
halt in the user productivity
by using virtualization the admin can
run multiple similar virtual machines
simultaneously alongside and change over
the working instances
in case of a crash instead of having
multiple dedicated servers
then we have the time management
buying installing configuring a new
system is not only costly but also a
waste of time
in such a case virtualization can solve
the problem
provided that the existing hardware
resources are sufficient
for running the virtualization software
otherwise it can be configured for the
same
now that we have reached the end of the
module in which we learn what is
virtualization what is the virtual
machine and how do hypervisor work
during the process of virtualization
we can use this process to ease a work
