venturing into the world of software
engineering we encounter a critical tool
that underpins approximately 70% of
major software projects the uml diagram
it's like a map for building software
and is used in about 70% of big software
projects these diagrams help turn Big
Ideas into plans that can actually be
made into software think of uml diagrams
like a guide book for software they help
prevent mistakes in fact a study shows
that using them can cut down errors in
plans by 35% that's a big deal because
it means making better software with
fewer problems uml diagrams comes in
different types each for a different
part of making software some show how
the parts of a system fit together while
others show how different parts talk to
each other they use a special kind of
picture language to show all this we're
going to see how these diagrams help
make ideas real which is why they are
used in more than half of the successful
software projects around the world
they're super important for building
strong flexible and and effective
software so let's dive in and learn how
they work and why they are so important
in making cool softwares and just a
quick info for you uml diagrams are like
a guide book for software so
professional who wants to switch careers
with software engineering by learning
from the experts can try giving a sh to

to the homepage where you can find a
complete overview of the program being
offered take action up skill and get
ahead so without any further Ado let's
get started so the first thing we will
learn today is uml uml or unified
modeling language it is a set of
graphical notation techniques to create
visual models of Software System systems
it helps in depicting the structure and
behavior of systems in systematic manner
it is developed in the 1990s and uml has
become a standard in software
engineering for visualizing and
documenting software systems so this was
about uml now moving to the importance
of uml in software engineering so the
first importance is that it plays key
role in software development uml
diagrams provide a clear and concise way
to communicate complex software designs
they facilitate better understanding
within teams and effective communication
with external stakeholders now the next
point is it enhances design and
documentation so uml AIDS in both the
design and documentation phase of
software engineering it provides a
standardized approach to visualize
system architecture and processes and
the next key role is improvising
efficiency and reducing errors so uml
diagrams help in identifying potential
issues early in the development process
and they contribute to a more efficient
workflow and reduced error rates now
moving to the next key role that is
facilitating collaboration and
understanding so by visualizing complex
systems uml diagrams enable easier
collaboration among diverse team members
they help in ensuring all stakeholders
have a common understanding of the
system and uml in action there's a key
role such as planning that explains how
uml was used in the initial planning
stages and the design that shows how uml
diagrams assisted in designing the
system architecture and the
communication uml facilit effective
communication among team members and
stakeholders so this was the importance
of uml diagrams across all the software
teams now we'll move to the types of uml
diagrams that are available in the
market so mainly uml has two types of
diagrams one is structural and other is
the behavioral diagrams so structural
diagrams contains class diagrams
component diagrams object object
diagrams and they represent instances of
classes at a specific Moment In Time an
object diagram showing various
instantane objects and their
relationships and there are package
diagrams also that illustrate how
different packages and their elements
are organized in a system and then comes
a package diagram so a package diagram
displaying the systems packages and
dependencies and then we have behavioral
diagrams that contains use case diagrams
sequence diagrams and activity diagrams
that show the dynamic flow of control
from activity to activity within the
system and an activity diagram depicting
the flow of activities in a process or
workflow is defined as behavioral
diagram and there are State machine
diagrams that represent the states and
transs of a system or its component so a
state diagram illustrating the various
States an object goes through and the
transition based on events and then
there are interaction diagrams as you
can see in the flow of the diagram that
is uml diagram type there are
interaction diagrams and below that only
there are communication diagrams that
focus on the interaction between objects
but highlight their organization and
relationships and a communication
diagram that shows objects their links
and the message is exchanged and then we
have timing diagrams so timing diagram
represent the behavior of objects
throughout a given period and the
interactions in terms of timing
constraints and a timing diagram showing
the state changes and interactions of
objects over time and then we have
deployment diagram that shows the
physical deployment of artifacts or
nodes a deployment diagram displaying
the configuration of runtime processing
elements and the software components
processes and objects that live on them
so this was all about the uml diagram
type so the main types are structural
and behavioral diagrams and below that
we have other class diagram profile
diagram package diagram object diagram
component diagram and under behavioral
we have sequence diagram timing diagram
State machine diagram and interaction
diagram so these are the main types now
we'll move to create a uml diagram so
this is a stepbystep process to create a
uml diagram so the first step is
identify main classes so we'll start
with the first step that is identify
main classes we'll start with
determining the primary classes in your
system then we'll Define attributes and
operations for these classes only
that is for each class we will Define
its attributes that is properties and
operations that are functions or methods
and then we will illustrate
relationships that is we will show the
relationship between classes such as
inheritance Association and dependency
and in uml that is Unified modeling
language associations represent the
relationships between classes they show
how objects of one class connect and
interact with objects of another class
so let's see the diagram so our first
diagram is book so book is the class
here and then we have attributes that is
title so what is the title of the book
and then we have press the colon and
then the data type of title that is
string and then we have author then
colon string and then the ISBN number of
the book and then we have the method
here that is check availability and here
in this method we will check whether the
book is available in the library or not
so here we will create the library
distribution system as a uml diagram so
we have created the class book and its
attributes and methods and now we will
create a class called member so the
member who is coming to the library to
borrow a book so now we will Define its
attributes and methods so the first
attribute we will Define is name and
it's of data type string and then we
have membership ID and then loan records
and we have defined a method here that
is borrow book and then we have another
class that is loan so we will Define its
attribute that is loan date due date
return date and the next is the column
for methods and here we will Define the
method that is renew loan and in this
you could see the plus signs and the
hashtag signs so here the plus sign
indicates that the attributes are public
to all the classes so they can be
inherited or associated with other
classes and the hash signs that is in
the member class so it is the protected
attribute that is loan records so
records can't be accessed by other items
or the other classes so now we will see
the association between these classes so
first we'll see the association between
member and book class so this
Association is represented by the borrow
book method so operation in the member
class it indicates that a member can
borrow a book and in the uml diagram
this would typically be shown as a line
connecting the member and book classes
and the nature of this Association can
be further detailed with multiplicity
which indicates how many instances of
one class can be associated with one
instance of the other class for example
a member can borrow multiple books and a
book can be Borrowed by multiple members
so for that we have Associated both the
book and the member class and then we'll
see the association between member and
Loan class so the loan records attribute
in the member class represents this
Association this shows that a member has
a relationship with loan that is a
member has zero or more loan records in
the uml diagram a line would connect
member and Loan often with multiplicity
indicating that one member can have
multiple loans and then we have
association between book and Loan so
this Association is implicit in the
context of a library system each loan
record would be associated with a
specific book indicating which book is
Unown in the uml diagram a line would
connect the book and Loan classes
typically with the multiplicity of one
that is each loan is for one book so the
associations are visualized as lines
connecting the classes and the ends of
the lines can have symbols or labels
showing the nature of the relationship
like arrows or multiplicity indicators
so the types of arrows you use to
represent an association depends on the
nature of the relationship between the
classes so Association without
navigation that is bidirectional or
unired when objects of both classes can
access each other and the direction of
the relationship isn't emphasized so a
plain line without arrows between member
and the book class in the case of boring
books you can see that this can be a
plain line as both the member and book
are aware of each other in the
transaction so this was the
unidirectional or bidirectional so both
can have a transaction between them and
then we have association with navigation
that is unidirectional so when objects
of one class can access objects of the
other class but not vice versa so for
this we will draw a line with a single
arroe head pointing towards the class
that is being accessed for example if we
see here if only members need to have
direct knowledge or access to their loan
records but not the other way around you
would use a line with a arrow pointing
from member to the loan class so this
was about this uml diagram that is
Library management system so now moving
to the next topic that is Association in
uml diagrams so here we will understand
association between the classes and how
we can access their methods and
attributes so certainly understanding
associations inl that is Unified
modeling language is crucial for
accurately modeling the relationships
between classes in a system now we'll
break down different types of
Association commonly used in uml
diagrams so the first is simple
Association so this represents a general
relationship where instances of one
class are connected to instance of
another class for this type of
Association we usually represent this
with a simple line without arrows
indicating a bidirectional or
non-directional relationship so customer
class associated with an order class so
customer can order one order or a order
is associated with a customer so this
was about the simple associ
now moving to the next that is
association with navigation that is
unidirectional so it indicates that one
class can navigate to or access another
class but not vice versa so to indicate
this type of navigation we use a line
with an arrow pointing towards the class
that is being accessed now moving to the
next that is bidirectional Association
so both classes are aware of each other
and can navigate to each other so to
represent this we'll use a line with
arrow heads on both ends or no
arrowheads at all so this was about the
bir directional Association now moving
to the next that is aggregation so a
special form of Association that
represents a whole part relationship but
without strong ownership the parts can
exist independently of the whole and for
this aggregation we will use a line with
a hollow Diamond at the whole class end
so this was about aggregation now moving
to the next that is composition so
stronger form of aggregation implying
strong ownership if the whole is
destroyed the parts are destroyed too so
to represent them will use a line with a
fill Diamond at the whole class end for
example a house class that is whole and
a room class that is a part if the house
is destroyed so the rooms cease to exist
so the rooms will also be destroyed so
this is about the composition
Association and there are also other
associations that is reflexive
multiplicity but these are not generally
used in drawing uml diagrams so in
conclusion when creating a uml diagram
understanding these associations helps
in accurately modeling how objects in
the system interact and depend on each
other they also assist in designing the
systems architecture and are critical
for developers to understand the
Dynamics of object interactions within
the system so each type of Association
in uml diagrams it's a unique way to
represent different kinds of
relationships that can exist between
classes contributing to a comprehensive
and clear model of the system structure
and behavior and with this we have come
