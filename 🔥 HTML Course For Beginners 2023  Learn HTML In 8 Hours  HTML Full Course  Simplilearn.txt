what exactly is the basic web
architecture now web architecture is
made up of three Essential Elements
that's the web weite that is the front
end of a web application that is visible
to the user then there is the server
which constitutes the back end of a web
application and holds and manages all
the data and finally there's the IP
address that is the address assigned to
a website in order to be accessible on
the internet first up let's have a look
at what website is so your browser
starts by loading the main HTML file and
then the CSS and JavaScript the user
interacts with the website and is not
concerned with the back end of an
application now secondly we have the
server once you've developed your
website you'll have to host it on your
server to make it accessible on the
internet server along with the database
contains all the data of a website and
facilitates user
interaction lastly there's IP address
which is the third element of the web
architecture now website is hosted on an
IP address we put a domain name over
that IP address the same way we put
names over people's phone numbers when
you type a domain name in the browser it
will give you the server call the server
will then send over the website to
you next what is HTML HTML is the most
widely used markup language for
developing and structuring web pages on
the internet it defines the structure of
websites and formats these web
pages
so what exactly is CSS then now CSS is a
simple design language used for making
web pages look more beautiful and
presentable it can be attached to any
HTML element to style it or even
position it according to the developer's
Choice then you must be wondering what
exactly is Javascript now JavaScript is
a powerful interpreted language targeted
for web development it is used for
making web page Pages interactive and
bringing the web pages to life so now
let's create your first
website now HTML short for hypertext
markup language is the coding standard
for documents designed for web browsers
consisting of a series of elements or
tags and which can be used to structure
a web page right so these elements can
include headings paragraphs uh div
containers tables and more HTML tags are
nested meaning there there are opening
and closing tags with the content in
between those
tags so now let's write a simple HTML
code that will help you understand the
basics of the language so for this I'm
using the text editor that is Visual
Studio code you can go ahead and
download this text editor from their
official website so here I've created a
simple HTML file in my vs code and I've
added the initial HTML files now let me
explain to you uh one by one now Doc
type is not so much of a tag but it is
more of an instruction now this
indicates the browser that the document
type to be served to the user is in fact
an HTML document now this dock type
instruction should always be included at
the very top of your HTML page next up
you have the HTML tag that is used to
contain all the web pages HTML code
right so it contains an opening and
closing tag with contents in between
them the HTML tag can also Al have
attributes now for example there's the
Lang attribute allowing you to specify
the spoken language of the contents of
the page followed by the HTML tag
there's the head tag now this is the
first section of the code that contains
all of the information about the web
pages properties links and more it could
have Pages title description additional
meta tags and CSS code so here I've used
the title tag and let's give a title say
HTML in Tex 10
minutes all right you can also add CSS
to the Head tag by using the style tag
and change the display styles of HTML
elements that are being used the next
section is the body tag now the body tag
contains all the displayable contents of
your web page including headings
paragraphs div containers tables and
more now the HTML header tags are used
to add headings to a web page there are
several types of headings available for
developers to add to a web page right so
first up let's have a look at them I'm
going to create a simple H1 heading tag
and the message I'm displaying is this
is the first
heading all
right after this I'm going to add a
paragraph tag which creates padding in
the top and bottom of the element to
help separate the text between each
paragraph right so I'm going to to add a
P tag and
save this is the paragraph
[Music]
tag after this let me add a simple h2
tag which
is another heading tag and say this is
the second
heading you can also add line breaks
which are helpful from time to time if
you want to provide a single line break
in your content you can do so by adding
the BR tag so here let me just add one
for better understanding now the HTML
div tag defines a division or a section
in an HTML document that is used as a
container for other HTML elements now
these elements can include content areas
sidebars page bars page headers Footers
Etc this tag is used to apply styles to
HTML elements that cannot be add it
otherwise we can also make use of the
HTML image tag to add images to a web
page now these images in a web page are
a very common site and they can make the
website look more attractive so for that
we can use the image tag so let's say
IMG within which I mention the
source I'm adding the HTML logo so let
me just mention that
here
and then I'm going to provide width for
it and then a specific
height all right so when you save the
file and when you look at the
browser you can see that uh the first
heading is displayed then your paragraph
tag is displayed followed by the second
heading and then the image now uh let me
show you how you can add styles for some
of these uh headings and paragraph tags
so here in back in my first head heading
tag let me just say
Styles and let me change the font of the
content that is being displayed and I'm
going to change it to Career
new and for my paragraph tag let me
display the content in italics so I'll
say
font style and make it
italics so let me save this and when I
look at the
browser you can see that the font has
changed and so has the font style here
before we go through the different tags
present in HTML let's discuss what a tag
is a tag refers to a special word
wrapped in angular brackets which are
used to define a particular type of
content on a web page after using a tag
in an HTML file the browser decides how
to render or display the content on the
screen the list of tags present in HTML
is pretty huge we'll go through some
basic tags in today's video and we'll go
through the remaining tags while working
with them so let's start with the most
basic tag we have in HTML you can see
here we have a basic program written
over here all the tags mentioned over
here are mandatory for all HTML programs
the first thing we have here is the dock
type as HTML you can see it over here we
have written dock type HTML so this is
not an HTML tag but an instruction for
the system about the type of document
basically we are telling the system that
this is going to be an HTML document so
that all the browsers can know that this
particular document is an HTML document
and work
accordingly the next tag we have here is
the HTML tag you can see the HTML tag
starts from here and goes till add right
we have ended this HTML tag at the end
of a HTML
document now this tag is necessary for
all HTML documents if you are working on
an HTML document then this tag is what
we are going to need the HTML tag
represents the root and the end of the
whole document this is a container tag
that contains all the other tags within
it so this tag is pretty mandatory in
all HTML document now the next tag we
have here is the head tag you can see
the head tag over here and the ending of
this head tag is present over here we
have certain tags present inside this
particular tag now you can see that this
head tag contains meta tags and the
title tag right you can see the meta tag
over here we have three meta tags and
then we have a title tag as well now the
meta tags doesn't appear on the page
itself but only in the pages Source
codol metat tags are essentially little
content descriptors that help search
engines what a web page is all about now
the next tag we have here is the title
tag the title tag is used to define the
title of a web page basically we write
the name of a web page inside this tag
for example if we see here the title of
our web page is document for now if we
change the title of this HTML document
and write here something
like first document fine now save the
program open it with live server now you
can see it over here that the window
name is changed to first document
there's no change in the web page itself
so what we are going to do is we are
going to reduce the size of a vs code
and the browser we are going to keep
them side by side here
so that any changes we made in this HTML
document are reflected in the web
browser other tags we can use inside the
head tag are the style tag the script
tag and the link tag now the link tag is
used to link any external CSS file to a
HTML page we have to provide the source
of that file and then any styling
changes we make in that particular file
will get reflected in the web page for
that so let's create a c CSS file first
what we are going to do is we are going
to create another file over here let's
name it as style. CSS now this
particular file has CSS as extension
this will tell the browser that this
particular file is a CSS file and we are
going to use it for styling purposes
fine so we have this style. CSS over
here now we are going to link this with
our HTML document for that but we have
to do is we have to write here link so
this is the tag now we have to write
here Rel and we have to write
here
stylesheet fine now the next thing we
have to do is to provide the source code
of this particular file so for that we
are going to use href href is going to
be style. CSS now close this link tag
now this ra tag over here specifies the
relationship between the current
document and the link document now you
can see it over here we have this Rel as
stylesheet this means that this
particular file is a stylesheet and we
are going to use this for styling
purposes another important tag we have
inside the head section is the script
tag this tag is used to declare or use
any script within the HTML document
basically used for JavaScript so it's
not necessary to use this tag within the
head section only we can use it anywhere
but for now we are going to use it
inside the head tag the syntax is also
easy we have to write it like script SRC
now SRC is going to be the file name so
let's add another file over here we'll
write first. JS so this will tell the
browser that this particular file is a
Javascript file so we are going to write
here inside this now we are going to
write first dot yes now we have to
define the type as well so type is going
to be text and the file is a Javascript
file so we'll write here JavaScript fine
now close this tag and the script tag
will closes automatically you can see it
over here fine the script tag is
close keep one thing in mind that we
have to close the script tag every time
but the link tag is not necessary to
close the next tag we are going to
discuss is the body
tag the body tag defines the document's
body now you can see it over here if we
go back to HTML page you can see the
body tag over here now the body element
contains all the content of an HTML
document such as headings paragraphs
images hyperlinks tables list
Etc there can only be one body element
in an HTML document any tag we are going
to use within the body tag is going to
define the structure of a web page now
the next tag we are going to use is the
heading tag there are six different
types of heading tags starting from H1
and goes to H6 H1 refers to the most
important heading and H6 refers to the
least important the font size of H1 is
the largest and the font size of H6 is
the smallest EST among all so let's use
them all here what we'll do is we'll
write here H1 now inside this H1 we'll
write this is heading one save the
program and you can see it over here we
have a heading in our web page which
says this is heading one similarly we
have the h2 tag as well so if we write
here H2 and inside this if we write this
is heading two save the program you can
see the change in the font size you can
see the difference over here the font
for H1 is greater and the font for H2 is
a bit smaller than H1 similarly we have
H3 and for H3 we are going to write here
this
is heading c three fine then we have H4
as well so we are going to write here H4
and inside this we are going to write
this is
heading four fine similarly we have H5
and H6 as well so we are going to
mention them first here so we'll write
here this
is heading five and finally we have
H6 which is used for heading six so we
are going to write here this is
heading six fine save the program and
you can see the difference in all the
headings over here the size for H1 is
the largest and the size for heading six
is the smallest we can use any of these
headings according to our
similarly we have the paragraph tag as
well in HTML it is used to write a
paragraph or any content within the web
page the syntax is simple we have to use
the P tag for that so if we write here p
and now inside this paragraph tag
whatever thing we'll write so let's say
we are writing here this is a first
HTML document fine now save this program
and you can see it over here we have
some text present in the web browser
right so these are the most basic HTML
tags we discussed in today's video as we
said the list of tags is large and we'll
discuss them while working with them a
simple definition of tags states that a
tag refers to a special word wrapped in
angular brackets which are used to
define a particular type of content on a
web page after using a tag in an HTML
file the browser decides how to render
or display the content on the screen
right now keeping this definition in
mind the definition of an element in
HTML states that an HTML element is the
collection of a start tag its attributes
an end tag and everything in between the
tags right so an HTML element is
basically a collection let's understand
this with the help of an example what
we'll do is we'll write over here inside
the body of this HTML document we'll
write P fine now this paragraph tag over
here is an example of a tag it has
opening tag and a closing tag so this
whole thing is a tag this paragraph is a
tag over
here now if we add an attribute to this
tag like an ID or a class so what we'll
do for that we'll write here let's say
ID is equals
to par fine this tag now has an
attribute within it ID makes this whole
tag unique we can access the content of
this tag with the help of ID attribute
we'll discuss attributes in detail in
the upcoming video for now let's add
some content inside this tag so what
we'll do is we'll write inside this tag
we'll write over here let's
say this is
a paragraph fine so we'll write here
paragraph
so this is the content of a paragraph
tag now we have four different parts
present over here we have the starting
tag over here so this is the starting
tag this whole thing over here is the
starting tag then we have attribute so
ID here is the attribute then we have
the content of this tag so this is the
content present inside whole tag and
then we have the end part of a paragraph
tag so this represents the end part
right so the combination of these four
things is known as the HTML
element now let's talk about the case
sensitivity of HTML tags so HTML tags
are not case sensitive so you can see we
have paragraph tag over here with small
P present inside angular brackets what
we can do is we can write here capital P
as well so these two things are pretty
same so let's write something inside
this as well so let's say we are writing
here this
is paragraph 2 fine so this is the
content present inside this paragraph
tag with capital P inside angular
brackets now save the program and you
can see we have two paragraphs over here
the first one says this is a paragraph
and the second one says this is a
paragraph two so what we have to do is
we have to remove a from here save it
now and now it says this is paragraph 2
fine so I hope you guys got that HTML
tags are not case
sensitive fine now let's move ahead and
we'll now discuss empty elements in
HTML most HTML elements have a start tag
and an end tag that indicate where the
element begins and where it ISS for
example we have this paragraph tag over
here this is the start of this paragraph
tag and this is the end part right so
this indicates that this paragraph tag
ends over
here now there is a group group of
elements that are exceptions to this
rule so these elements are called empty
or vo and only have a start tag since
they have no content present inside the
tag so they must not have an end tag in
HTML example of empty elements are like
the Break Tag we have we have image link
and many more such tags the list is
quite long so what we'll do is We'll add
an image using the image tag so image
tag is basically an empt El so we'll use
that particular element and you guys
will understand what empty elements are
so as mentioned earlier that empty
elements do not require any closing tag
so what we'll do is we'll write here
inside angular brackets IMG is the tag
name then we'll write your SRC so SRC
over here is attribute we'll discuss
attributes in upcoming videos so inside
this we'll provide the path of our image
so let's say we have this image present
inside
images folder which is a folder present
in a system so where we are saving all
our HTML programs so the next thing
we'll write here is alt alt stand for
alternate so if the image is not shown
over the browser then the alternate text
will be shown so let's say we are
writing here image one now we'll close
this image tag so that's all we don't
have to close this particular image tag
we don't have to write here like this so
you can see we don't have to write here
like this anything so if we not write it
over here that's fine because image
element is an empty element so let's
save the program and you can see we have
an image over here in the browser so the
image size is quite large what we'll do
is we'll reduce the site so we'll write
here this for
now we'll discuss all these things in
the upcoming videos so don't worry about
it for now you can see that we have an
image over here so this is our image
this particular image is what we have
added using the image tag so this is
done now the last thing we'll discuss in
this video is the nesting of elements
nesting means we can use the tag or
element within another element for
example you can see we have a paragraph
over here so this is a paragraph which
says this is paragraph 2 let's add some
more things over here so let's say we
are writing over
here HTML stands
for hyper text workup
language
fine and save the program so this is the
paragraph over here you can see let me
increase the size of our browser a bit
so now I think you guys can see it much
better now what we'll do is we'll use a
particular element or Tex within this
paragraph tag so let's say we want this
HTML to be cursive and bold in nature so
what we'll do over here is we'll use the
B tag over here so b stands for Bol so
what we'll do next is we'll cut HTML
from here and we'll paste it inside this
BTE now save the program and you can see
HTML is bold in nature now right
similarly what we can do is we can Nest
one more tag inside this bold tag so
what we can do is we'll write here I now
we have to put this HTML inside both
these texts save this program and you
can see the HTML is cursive in nature
now so you can see we have three
different tags or we can say we have two
different tags inside a particular Tex
this is known as nesting of elements so
we can do it with HTML as well I hope
you guys must have got an idea about
what HTML elements are and how elements
are different from tags in
HTML now that we already have an idea
about elements let's discuss what
attributes are let me write the basic
syntax of an HTML element over here
first so what we'll do is we'll write
over here let's use the paragraph Tex so
we are writing over here this is
a basic
example of elements in HTM fine I hope
you guys must have got an idea about
what this is this is actually a basic
HTML element we have nothing else over
here just a simple example of HTML
element an element consist of start tag
an ending tag and the content within the
tag right so this particular thing is an
element now attributes in HTML refer to
the additional Properties or
characteristics of an element for
example if we write here let's suppose
we are writing over here let's say we
are writing over here ID
as par1 fine now save this program and
you can see over here that we have a
paragraph which says this is a basic
example of elements in HTML now we have
this whole element with ID as par or we
can give any ID of our choice now this
ID is unique for this particular element
for now you don't have to worry much
about this ID or any other attribute
just focus on what attributes are we are
going through the working of attributes
basically so we can use the ID of this
attribute to style this particular
element so basically this ID attribute
defines what this HTML element is we
have to use the style tag element or we
can say we have to use use the style
element for styling this particular
paragraph you will understand it once we
go through the text so let's do it over
here what we'll do is we'll use the
style tag over here so we'll write Here
style you can see this is a style
element basically it has start tag it
has ending tag now we'll write some
content inside this particular Tex so
let's say we are writing over here
hash par one now inside this what we'll
do is we'll Define some styling
properties so let's say we are writing
over here back ground color is red and
we'll write here color so this color
here refers to the font color basically
so we'll write here blue now save this
program and you can see the paragraph in
a browser is changed so what we did here
is inside this style element we access
this particular ID so ID is unique for
each element we'll discuss it later on
so basically this particular paragraph
tag has an ID named par so we are using
that part particular ID then we have
some CSS properties so these properties
are used to style a particular element
so we have used it over here you can see
it over here if I zoom out a bit in the
browser you can see the background color
of this whole paragraph is red and the
font color is blue fine what we want to
say here is this ID over here is
basically an attribute it is used to
identify or change a particular element
we have many attributes present in HTML
so we'll go through some of them let's
say we are adding an image over here so
let's add an image and you guys will
understand about HTML attributes here as
well so we'll write here IMG so this is
basically an empty element we have
discussed it in the previous part
wherein we went through HTML elements
now what we'll do is we'll write here
SRC now SRC is also an attribute this
attribute is used to provide the system
with the source of a image so if we go
back to this particular HTML folder so
here we have a HTM folder you can see we
have a folder here named as images and
we have an image present inside this
particular folder right so what we have
to do is we have to provide this path
inside a HTML file so what we are going
to do here is we are going to get back
to vs code and inside here we'll write
images so this is our folder name and we
have a file Nam html.png present inside
that particular folder so SRC is the
attribute and this particular thing is
the value of her attribute right now the
next thing we are going to do here is we
are going to write here alt now inside
this alt let's say we are writing HTML
over here now this alt attribute is used
when we add an image on so basically
what happens is when we add an image to
a web browser sometimes what happens is
the image is not shown over the browser
so in that case the alternate text will
be shown so if this particular image is
not shown in the browser then this
particular text will be shown so let's
save this program we'll open a web
browser here side by side as well you
can see that this particular image is
present over here in our web browser the
size of this image is quite large we can
change the size in two different ways we
can either use the ID attribute here as
well and then use that particular
attribute in The Styling tag or css file
to change the size of this image or we
can simply use the height and width
attribute in the image tag over here so
that's the simple one so what we are
going to do is we are going going to
write here height height is an attribute
we have to define the height in pixels
so we have written over here 300 pixels
save the program and you can see the
height of this image is 300 pixels same
thing goes for width as well if we write
here width and if we Define the width as
300 pixels as well save the program and
you can see now the height and width of
this particular image is 300 pixels
right so guys this is all about the
basics of rutes in HTML I hope you guys
understood this today we'll be taking a
look at formatting in HTML we'll go
through some basic HTML elements used
for formatting an HTML document before
we begin if you haven't subscribed to
our YouTube channel already make sure to
subscribe to our Channel and press that
Bell icon to never miss any updates on
programming videos so without any
further delay let's get started before
we move on and discuss the different
form formatting tags in HTML let's
understand what formatting is formatting
refers to the process of making the text
present on a web page more appealing to
the user for example let's say we want
to add a heading in a HTML document and
for that we want a specific font size
let's say we want to add a heading with
a bigger font size for this purpose we
have the heading tag present in HTML
which provides us with six different
font sizes with H1 being the tag with
the greatest font size and H6 with the
smallest one we have already discussed
in in the previous videos as well now we
need to make sure which font size we
want and we can use the heading tag
accordingly let's understand this with
the help of an example let's suppose we
are working on a web page wherein we
want a heading so let's say the heading
is what is HTML we want the font size to
be bigger so simply we'll write here H1
where we have already mentioned it that
H1 has the biggest font size of all the
six heading tags right so inside this
we'll write what is HTML so let's
suppose this is the heading now on
saving the program you can see here on
the browser that we have a heading with
larger font size so what we can do for
now is we'll remove this heading from
here now save it and you can see we have
only one heading as of now we have the
heading as what is HTML we can also
write a paragraph after this heading tag
that will explain what HTML is using the
paragraph so let's do it over here as
well and you guys will understand it
much better so here we are going to use
the break element so this is basically
an empty element used in HTML for line
break so what we are going to do is we
are going to put it over here so this is
the tag BR tag or Break Tag we can say
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write here inside the paragraph
tag h HTML stands
for let's write it in capitals we'll
write here hyper
text
markup language
fine so here we have paragraph that says
HTML stands for hypertext markup
language now what we want to do is we
want to add another heading to this web
page which will Define the uses of HTML
so basically what we are doing is we are
going through the sizes of heading tags
so we want another heading let's say
over here now the main heading of our
web page was what is HTML and we want it
to stand out among all the headings
present in our web page that's why we
use the H1 tag for that heading now for
the next heading or for the new heading
we'll have a little bit smaller size
than the main heading so what we are
going to do is we are going to use the
h2 tag or the H3 tag for that so let's
use the H3 tag for now we'll write over
here H3
so basically we are going to write it
after a br tag so we are going to use
the BR tag over here or the Break Tag we
can say now we are going to write here
uses of HTML fine now save the program
and you guys can clearly see the
difference in font size of both the
headings let me zoom in a bit here in
the browser so now you guys can see it
much better the there's a difference in
the size of heading one and heading
three right so this difference is what
we are talking about
there are six different sizes for a
heading tag in HTML we can use any of
these heading tags according to our need
figure out which one of these six tags
is best suitable for your web page and
use them simple and easy let's move
ahead and we'll now discuss some more
formatting tags present in HTML let's
move ahead and we'll now discuss some
more formatting tags present in HTML the
next tag we are going to discuss is the
Bold tag this tag is used to make the
text B bold or strong so there are two
different tags for the same task for
making the text bold we can either use
the Bold tag or simple B tag we can say
the other tag we can use is the strong
tag the functionality of both tags is
similar so we'll use them side by side
so that you guys can see the difference
or they are basically same so what we
are going to do is we are going to write
here after this BR T we are going to
write here B so b stand for bold T now
we are going to write some something in
here so let's say we are writing over
here
HTML now again after BR tag we are going
to use the strong tag fine we'll write
same thing here the content will remain
the same so we are going to write HTML
over
here now here we used both tags with
similar content present inside the save
the program and you can see we have two
similar outputs here on our web page the
outputs are exactly similar the working
of both the tags is the same right right
now let's recall the nesting of elements
in HTML from the previous video we have
said earlier that we can use an element
within another element in HTML we are
going to Nest this bold tag inside a
first paragraph tag it means that we are
going to Nest this bold tag over here so
what we are going to do is we are going
to use bold tag inside the full form or
we are going to put the full form of
HTML inside the Bold tag fine so save it
and you can see we have hypertext markup
language written over here in the
browser in bold right it looks better
than the previous one just like the Bold
tag we have two more tags present in
HTML to make the text on screen look
more appealing to the user the italic
tag and the underlined tag now you guys
must be thinking that these three
formatting techniques are also present
in Microsoft Word you are right these
three tags are present in both msword
and htl the working is also same so
let's use these tags here once what we
are going to do is we are going to use
this tags over here only so we are going
to put this hyper text markup language
inside three different tags so we are
going to put them inside italic we are
going to put them inside bold and we are
going to put them inside underliners so
we are going to do this over
here now you can see the nesting of
elements over here if I zoom in a bit on
Visual Studio code you can see we have a
paragraph tag then we have three tags
present inside it so we have bold tag we
have italic and underline so this is
called nesting of elements now save this
program and you can see the text over
here we have hyper text markup language
in italics it is underlined and it is
bold in nich right the next tag we are
going to use is the delete tag we have
two different tags present for this task
as well let's say we want to put a line
through the center of any text Crossing
it out basically let's say that this
text is not relevant fine so let's go
through an example first what we are
going to do is we are going to use the
break tag over here and now after this
Break Tag we are going to use a
paragraph tag we are going to write a
paragraph
so let's say we write here I would
like to have a cup
of
okay cup
of coffee fine save it and you can see
we have this paragraph or sentence over
here on the browser now what we want is
we want to delete this particular word
or we can say we want to put a line
through it fine so what we are going to
do is we are going to write
here
strike fine we are going to put coffee
inside this strike TCH because we want
this particular word to cut and then
let's say we are writing over here D
fine so save it now and you can see it
over here it says I would like to have a
cup of coffee has a line over it and
then we have written tea so you guys can
understand the meaning of this sentence
by yourself I guess can use this tag
anywhere according to our needs we can
achieve this same thing with the help of
the delete tag as well what we have to
do is we have to write here in place of
strike what we are going to do is we are
going to copy this piece of code from
here we are going to paste it here now
instead of strike we are going to write
here delete so D this is the TCH and we
are going to close this tag as well now
we are going to write coffee inside it
and save the program and you can see we
have the exact same output with this tag
as well fine another tag we have in HTML
for formatting is the mark tag now the
mark tag in HTML is used to Mark any
particular text the text will be
highlighted with yellow color for
example let's say we are writing
something over here or we can just paste
this again and we are going to remove
this part now we want to Mark the word
coffee let's say so what we are going to
do is we are going to write here mark
this is the tag and inside this tag we
are going to write coffee let's say fine
save the program and you can see it over
here we have this sentence which says I
would like to have a cup of coffee and
coffee is highlighted over here right so
this is the mark tag and we can use this
tag for
formatting now the last tag we are going
to discuss in today's video is the font
tag the font is an inline element used
to change font sizes font colors and
font styles of the text in a web page
this element has a its own attributes so
the three attributes we can use are size
color and phase fine size is used to
change the font size of the text we can
write values between 1 and seven with
one being the smallest and seven being
the largest font exactly opposite to The
Heading T so you can learn it that way
color refers to the font color we can
simply write the name of the color or we
can use the hexadecimal values for
colors the hexadecimal numbers are
specified according to to the RGB value
for each
color the last thing we have is face
face refers to the font style the
default HTML font is Times New R we can
use any font style of our choice using
this attribute so let's use this tag
over here and you guys will understand
it much better I guess so what we'll do
is we'll write
here let's say we are using a paragraph
Tech so we'll write something over here
let's say I
prefer now we are going to use the font
tag over here so this is a tag you can
see it in red color now we have three
different attributes right so the first
attribute we have is size so we'll write
here inside size let's say the size of
this font is four then we have color so
color defines the font color so let's
say the font color we want is red and
then we have the face so let's say we
want the font style to be
Wana and we'll
write something over here let's say we
are writing this over red fine now save
the program and you can see it over here
it says I prefer red fine so let's
complete this sentence what we are going
to do is we are going to write something
after this font tag as well so let's say
we are writing over here red over blue
save the program and you can see it over
here that we we have this particular
sentence which says I prefer red over so
let me increase the size of vs code so
that you guys can see it clearly so here
you can see we have this paragraph tag
then we have written inside it I prefer
and we have kept this red word inside a
particular element font element
basically this font element has three
different attributes size color and
phase now let's change the size of this
to six for
now and
will check the output save the program
and you can see red over here is quite
large in size right it looks different
so I hope you guys got this formatting
an HTML document is mostly done using
CSS but now HTML also allows us to
format our documents using different
tags basic formatting we can say so
formatting is making the web page more
appealing using these particular tags so
the list of formatting Texs present in
HTML is quite long we can't discuss all
of them here but if you use any of those
tags in the upcoming videos then surely
we'll discuss them over there on now the
task for you guys is to use these
formatting tags and let us know if you
find any difficulty in using them we'll
be taking a look at phrase tags in HTML
we'll go through what phrase tags are
and the syntax of some basic phrase tags
present in HTML but before we begin if
you haven't subscribed to our YouTube
channel already make sure to subscribe
subscribe to our Channel and press that
Bell icon to never miss any updates on
programming videos so without any
further delay let's get started in HTML
a phrase tag is used to give structural
meaning to a block of text what does
that mean let's try to understand this
with the help of an example we'll first
take a paragraph for this example a
small one maybe so let's do it here what
we'll do is we'll write
here P so we are going to use the
paragraph tag let's write something over
here so let's say we are writing over
here hello everyone then I'll write this
is caual and let's suppose we are
writing over
here please subscribe to
a YouTube Chanel
fine save this and you can see here that
we have the same paragraph here on the
browser now what we said earlier about
the phrase tags is they are used to give
structural meaning to a block of text
right so here we have a paragraph and we
want to provide meaning to a block of
text let's say we want to put some
emphasis on the word YouTube over here
fine we want this word to stand out
differently from the rest of the
paragraph for this task we have the
emphasized tag in
HTML the syntax for this tag goes like
this so what we'll do is we'll cut this
sentence into two different parts so
that it will be easy for you guys to
understand now we have the emphasized
tag in HTML the syntax is pretty simple
what we have to do is we'll write over
here so we are going to make changes
inside this particular paragraph tag
only so we are going to use the emphasis
tag over here so what we have to do is
we have to cut the word YouTube from
here and we have to paste it here now
the syntax is so simple we have a two
word tag so it says em it stands for
emphasis now save the program and you
can see here in the browser you can see
the difference basically the word
YouTube stands out from the rest of the
words present in the paragraph to lay
some more emphasis on the word YouTube
we can use the title attribute now title
attribute will be used inside the
emphasis tag so let's do it here once so
what we are going to do is we are going
to use the title attribute over here so
let's say say the title says check
a
YouTube channel fine so let's break it a
little more so here you can see we have
these three lines so inside this
paragraph tag what we are doing
is we are using the emphasis tag and
inside that emphasis tag we are using
the title attribute fine on saving the
program you can see nothing changes over
over here on the browser to witness the
change here we have to take our mouse
cursor over YouTube and you can see we
have a small popup here that contains
the value of a title attribute let me
zoom in a bit here so here you can see
on taking the mouse cursor we have this
small popup with the value of a title
attribute right another thing we can do
for this task is we can add a link over
here on the word YouTube we'll discuss
it in the upcoming videos when we'll go
through text links in HTML so so you
guys will understand it much better then
now you guys may have a question in your
mind that we can do this exact same
thing with formatting text as well right
yes of course we can do that but
formatting refers to the process of
molding the text for a better look and
feel of the text while phrase tags are
used to provide meaning to a block of
text it's not necessary that if a tag
falls under the category of formatting
text then it can't be a phrase Tex the
difference lies in the purpose of using
that particular tag I hope you guys are
getting it the next tag we are going to
discuss is the mark tag we have already
discussed this tag in the formatting
tags as well so let's discuss it one
more time the mark tag in HTML is used
to Mark any particular text the text
will be highlighted with yellow color so
we have discussed it previously now what
we are going to do is we are going to
copy this piece of
code so we are going to copy the whole
paragraph from here and then we'll paste
it here now instead of using the
emphasis tag we are going to use the
mark tag over here fine so we are going
to change the tag name from emphasis to
mark for the opening and closing tag
save it now and you can see we have
another paragraph over here which is
almost the same or which is exactly the
same it says hello everyone this is
kosel please subscribe to our YouTube
channel now the thing to notice here is
the word YouTube it is highlighted in
yellow color right so the title will
work same over here as well if we put a
mouse cursor over the word YouTube you
can see we have this popup with the same
title value right so one thing to notice
here is the title attribute is basically
the differentiator between the
formatting tags and the phrase tags it
means that the tag Remains the Same but
the way of using it defines the purpose
so let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss the abbreviation tag in HTML the
word abbreviation in general terms
refers to the short form of a word
that's it we have the answer here if
you're using any abbrevation for any
word we want the user to know that this
particular word has a special meaning
then we can use the abbreviation tab so
the syntax goes like this what we'll do
is we'll again use the same
paragraph and
we'll paste it over here
again so what we are going to do
is we are going
to remove this empty space from here so
that you guys will be able to see the
whole code or as much code as possible
so what we are going to do now is we are
going to use the abbreviation tab fine
so we'll remove this piece of code from
here we have to put this over the word
YouTube so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here abbreviation and
inside there we are going to write YT so
this is the short form of YouTube
basically now save the program and you
can see that we have another paragraph
but there's no difference over here as
of now the word is simple there's it's
not standing out basically right so this
is because while using the abbrevation
tag we must necessarily use the title
attribute along with this T so let's do
it here we have to write here title and
we have to write Here YouTube because YT
stands for YouTube so we are going to
write Here YouTube now save the program
and you can see here that the
abbrevation YT is now underlined with a
dotted line fine this indicates that the
word YT is used as an abbreviation here
and the user will know that something is
different over here on taking the mouse
cursor over it you can see we have the
value of a title attribute you can see
it says YouTube so this is basically the
short form of YouTube YT over here now
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the address tag this tag is used to
display the address add in the web
browser the content is written within
the opening and closing address tag is
considered as an address in HTML so this
is the address we generally use fine not
an IP address or nothing else the
general address we use for our location
or for a address so let's use this tag
over here we'll write
here address and this is the tag now
inside this tag we are going to
write YouTube office letter let
say then we
have 1 2
3 street so this is going to be the
street name for our address then we have
let's say sector so let's say the sector
is
456 and then we
have the place name is NOA and the
country name is India
fine so this is an address and let's
save the program you can see here the
difference in the browser the address
tag over here has a different font this
tag is used to indicate that this
particular block of text is an address
so you can see it over here this is our
address now if you want see it clearly
let me remove these three paragraphs
from here save the program now and you
can see we have address over here so if
you want to write it in different lines
so what we can do is we can use the
break tag over here then over here again
save the program and you can see we have
the address over here the font is
different that's the only difference
between address tag and other
tags the next tag we are going to
discuss is the short quotation tag this
tag is used to add double quotes within
a sentence the syntax is simple so what
we'll do is we'll write something over
here let's say we are writing over here
paragraph We are writing over here let's
say again
please
subscribe to a now we want the word
YouTube inside double Cotes right so for
that we are going to use the quotation
tag this is the syntax we have to write
simple q and we have to put the word
YouTube inside it fine then we'll write
here Channel and we have to put a space
over here save the program and you can
see it says please subscribe to our
YouTube channel with YouTube present
inside double code
fine so the last tag we are going to
discuss in today's tutorial is the code
tag in HTML this tag is used to
represent programming code in HTML the
text will look like we have any code
from a programming language for example
we'll write here code this is the tag
now inside there we'll write let's say
we are using a for Loop in JavaScript so
we'll write here for I is equal to
0 then we have
I Less Than 3 so let's give some spaces
over here and then we have
i++ fine then after this we have inside
here console. log and we are going to
print high fine so if you are new to
this language just ignore it it's just a
simple piece of code from JavaScript so
save it now and you can see we have this
code over here now what we are going to
do next is we are going to use Break Tag
over here first then
we'll understand it fine so we are going
to use the BR tag here again and here
again fine save it now and you can see
the code
now you can see we have the same output
on the browser as the text present in vs
code the font is exactly the same so
this represents a piece of code in HTML
we can use the code tag for that
so Guys these are some of the basic
phrase tags we discussed in today's
video as we mentioned earlier that the
list is quite long for all these tags
we'll discuss them in future whenever we
use them I hope you guys got it so
that's all for this video guys see you
in the next one where we'll go through
meta tags in HTML till now we came
across certain types of tags in HTML we
have a good idea of how and when to use
any particular tag while working with
HTML now let's imagine a situation where
we are working on the front end of any
web page which contains more than a
thousand lines of code we are almost
finished with the front end but suddenly
we realize that we made an error
somewhere previously or we want to
change a particular piece of code let's
say in that case we can't go back
checking each line to find that
particular piece of code right that's
where comments can help us and save our
time a comment is common for almost all
programming languages the syntax May
differ in different languages but the
usage Remains the Same it is a line in
programming that does not affect the
output of the program it stays there in
the code but does not affect the output
by any means in HTML the way of writing
a comment is quite simple we have been
working with text for some time now the
Syntax for comments also remains similar
to them all we have to do is we have to
write here like we want to add a comment
here let's say so what we have to do is
we have to put an exclamation mark and
then we have to put this now this is the
Syntax for comments in HTML now whatever
thing we'll write inside it will be
treated as a comment fine so one thing
to notice here is that there is an
exclamation mark at the start of every
comment we use but not at the end fine
just keep this thing in mind and we are
good to go with comments in HTM let's
save our program and you can see there
is no change in the browser so for your
convenience what we are going to do is
we are going to add a paragraph over
here so let's say we are writing over
here we are going through comments in
HTML let's save the program and you can
see that particular paragraph in the
browser so the comment won't affect the
outcome of any program by any means
fine another use of comments is they can
be used to hide content now hiding
content means we can temporarily hide
any tag from the HTML document according
to our needs so let's say we have an
image over here and we want to see if
the web page will look good with the
image or without it so let's add an
image first what we'll do is we'll write
after this paragraph
tag IMG let's say the source
is inside images we have html.png this
is the image then we'll write here
alternate alternate will be let's say
HTML now save the program and you can
see the image over here but it's quite
large so let's fix this first we are
going to write here height and width so
we are using attributes basically so
we'll write your width width is going to
be 250 pixels again save the program and
here you can see we have a image
fine now to remove this image
temporarily what we have to do is we
have to put this whole image tag inside
the Comm what we'll do is we'll write
over here the Syntax for commment now
this is the commit what we'll do is
we'll copy this image tag we'll cut it
from here and we'll paste it
inside this comment
fine now save the
program and the image is temporarily
removed from the browser right simple
and easy now a comment can be a single
line comment or a multi-line comment no
change in the Syntax for that anything
we put inside these tags will be taken
as a comment by the browser so what we
are trying to say here is comments are
very useful in programming it's just a
note for the programmer to remember what
they did at that particular part of the
program or we can simply say with
comments we can place notifications and
reminders in a HTML code if you guys
remember when we came across empty
elements in HTML there we saw the Syntax
for image tag in HTML actually the image
tag falls under the category of empty
elements in HTML that's why we saw it
there as well it means that this
particular tag in HTML does not require
any closing tag to work it has
attributes we'll go through them in a
moment before that let me clear this one
thing to you guys any image we see on a
web page is not inserted into that page
instead it is linked to a web page what
the image tag does it holds a space for
the referenced image you will understand
it much better in a while so let's go
through the syntax of adding an image or
attaching an image we can say to a web
page using the image tag is not at all a
task for the user it's the easiest thing
to do in HTML we can say that so what
we'll do is we'll write here inside the
body tag what we are going to do is we
are going to write here IMG so this is
the tag and we already know that this is
an empty element so it does not require
any closing
tag now inside the image tag we have to
add attributes so we'll write here
SRC so let's discuss some important
things before we move ahead you can see
over here that we have used the SRC
attribute inside the image tag this is a
necessary attribute while using the
image tag in HTML why this attribute
specifies the path to the image any
image we want to attach to a web page
needs to be stored somewhere either in
the system or it can be anywhere on the
internet as well so let's move back to
the main folder so what we are going to
do is we are going to move back to our
main HTML folder so here we are inside
the HTML folder now what we are going to
do is we are going to make large icons
over here so here we are in the HTML
folder you can see we have all the HTML
files over here right here we have an
image named python so if we double click
on it you can see this is an image and
the name of this image is python right
so what we are going to do is we are
going to click on it right click
basically go to properties and here you
can see we have the name of a file and
then we have the type type here is PNG
PNG means portable Network Graphics it
is basically an extension for images and
pictures so HTML do support other
extensions like jpeg GF SVG and many
more other extensions so we can use any
of those files with those extensions now
to attach this image to a web page we
need to provide the path to the system
through which the system can understand
that this particular image is stored in
this part of the system or the drive
fine so the path you can check here is
at the top of this window click on it
and you can see the path over here so
this is the path so this python file is
present inside the C drive user then we
have a name this folder name as Cal Bas
then we have desktop and HTML fine so
this is the path of a image let's move
back to vs code and we don't need the
whole path as of now because the current
HTML file we are in right now is present
inside the HTML folder so we don't need
to specify the whole path as of
now all we have to do is we have to
write the file name here inside the SRC
attribute what we'll do is we'll write
here the file name so our file name is
python. PNG fine so this is a file name
save the program and you can see we have
an image over here on the browser the
size is quite large as of now we'll see
how to manage this thing after some time
for now let's reduce the size of the
whole web page what we are going to do
is we are going to reduce the size and
you can see the whole image over here
fine
another possibility is we can store all
the images inside a single folder so
here if we go back to a HTML folder here
you can see we have a folder named
images Right double click on it and you
can see we have different images present
over here we have three different images
basically HTML CSS and JavaScript we can
use any of these images so let's get
back to vs code again and the next thing
we are going to do is we are going to
access any image from that particular
folder fine fine so what we are going to
do is we are going to write here after
this IMG then SRC now inside SRC we have
to write the folder name first fine so
we'll write here images then we'll use
slash and then we'll write the file name
so we have three different files over
here this is the benefit of using vs
code we have all the three files we can
use over here so let's use css.png as of
now close the image tag save the program
and you can see the image over here so
let's do one thing we are going to
use the BR te use it now save the
program and let's use it once again so
that it will be easy for us to
understand so here we have two different
images the python one and the CSS one so
basically what we have to do is we have
to give the correct path of that
particular image fine so the next
attribute we'll discuss is the alt
attribute or we can say the alternate
attribute let's write it over here first
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here alt press enter and write
something over here let's say we are
writing over here CSS so this alt
attribute we have here provides an
alternate text for an image if the user
for some reason cannot view it so
basically it can happen because of slow
connection and error in the source code
or in the source we can say or if the
user is using a screen reader so it can
be any of these reasons but if the user
is not able to see that picture then an
alternate text will come at Place fine
so the value of the alter attribute
should always describe the image so
that's why we have written over here CSS
so that the user can understand that
this particular image over here is a CSS
image or it can be basically anything
that describes the image fine so let's
do one thing here what we'll do is we'll
make an error over here in the SRC
attribute let's change the file name
name over here let's say this is the
file name that's a simple error right
nothing major over here let's save the
program and you can see the image is not
here anymore
fine so I believe you guys might not be
able to see because I have to increase
the size for
that
so you can see here now there's no image
present at this particular part of a web
page because the source is wrong so the
file name is wrong basically
instead of that we have text present
over here which says CSS fine so this is
how the alt attribute works in the image
tag further and talking about the actual
size of these images over here we can
change the size of these images in two
different ways so let's start with the
easier one first what we'll do is we'll
use the height and the width attribute
just like the source and Alternate
attributes we have these attributes are
also used within the image tag all we
have to do is we have to write here
here height height is let's say 250
pixels and then we have width as well so
width again is let's say 250 pixels save
the program and you can see the image
height and width is now 250 pixels we
can do the same thing for this file as
so what we'll do is we'll write here
width as let's say 100 pixels
and height as again 100 pixels save the
pro program and you can see the size of
this image is 100 pixels in width and
height now fine another way of using
these attributes is to use them within
the style tag we can use this tag
anywhere in the program although this
tag is related to CSS and we can also
Define these things in CSS files but as
of now we are not talking about that
concept so we'll stick to HTML only so
what we'll do is we'll write here to use
the style tag what we have to do is we
we have to write
Here style now what we want to do is we
want to access the image tag so we have
to write here IMG curly braces now we
have to define the properties inside
here fine so what we'll do is we'll
Define the width over here as 500
pixels and the height as well fine
height is again going to be 500 pixels
now one thing to notice here is this
image tag or these properties will be
applied on both tags because we are
using tag over here fine so we are
changing the properties of a tag so both
the image tag will be affected save the
program and you can see the image size
are now changed both are 500 pixels so
let's do one
thing let's remove it from here and this
as well now change the size to let's say
200 pixels and 200 pixels save the
program and you can see we have both the
images over here
both are 200 pixels in width and height
so this tag is also working
fine what we summarized from this is we
can use these attributes within the
image tag itself or we can use the style
tag to change the style of the image so
these are some of the basic attributes
we can use within the image tag in HTML
I hope you guys got it try it by
yourself and let us know if you face any
problem a table is a set of data
elements that allows us to store or
represent data into rows and columns
just like we create tables in normal
life for representing the data the same
table we create in HTML as well a table
consists of rows and columns we can
arrange any kind of data like text
images links other table Etc into rows
and Columns of cells fine the table tag
in HTML is used to create a table so
let's do it here side by side and you
guys will get a better idea of what we
are talking about here so let's create a
simple table first we'll discuss each
step here so what we'll do is we'll
write here inside the body tag we'll
create a new tag so this table tag this
is a table tag whatever data we want to
put in the table will go inside this
table tag only now save the program and
you can see we are not able to see any
table here so we'll see it in a while
now let's add some data here first we
know that a table consists of rows and
columns right the table row tag defines
any Row in HTML or in a table we can see
the Syntax for it goes like this what
we'll do is we'll write over here inside
the table tag only we'll write TR now
this TR represents table room fine one
thing to notice here is we are nesting
one tag inside another tag the table tag
is responsible for creating a space for
the table the table row tag is used to
add a row to that particular table now
the next step is to add columns inside
the table each row can contain one or
more than one column the table data tag
is used to add data in columns so it
might sound a bit confusing at the
moment but let's do it over here and you
guys will know how easy it is to add
data in column what we have to do is we
have to write here simply TD TD stands
for table data and we have to put the
data inside this TD tag TD means table
data tag and this tag represent a column
in the table fine so let's write it over
here
R1 comma C
fine let's give some space over here as
well then again we are going to use the
TD
tag so we'll write R1
comma
fine now here we are we have added two
columns inside the first row so let's
check the output now save it and you can
see we have the data over here this is
basically the table data R1 means Row
one C1 means column 1 and similarly R1
means Row one C2 means column so this is
a single row with two different columns
fine now we are not able to see the
structure of the table right in order to
get the structure of the table we have
to include an attribute inside the table
tag what we have to do is we have to
write here inside the table
tag we have to write here border and
inside border we have to mention the
Border width so which is basically one
pixel right now save the program and you
can see this border attribute will show
the Border all around the table and the
S
fine we can change the width of this
border by changing the value of border
over here so for example if we write
here 10 pixels and now if we save the
program you can see the Border
changing so this looks nice right so for
now we'll write here one pixel only so
this is the table border moving ahead
let's add another row over here first
what we'll do is we'll use the table row
tag again and the rest HTML will take
care of we can add a row in a table
anywhere in the HTML keep this thing in
mind until the table row tag is nested
inside the table tag HTML will manage to
add the row in the table fine what we'll
do is we'll write here after this table
row T we are going to add another row so
we are going to write here TR now inside
this we have to write some data or we
can say we have to include some columns
so this is going to be the row two so we
are going to write here R2 C1 for column
1 and then we'll write here TD again
we'll write here R2 then we have C fine
now save the program and you can see we
have another row over here which says R2
and C2 and R1 and C1 obviously so adding
rows and columns seems an easy task now
right I hope you guys got it moving
further we'll now discuss the table
heading type so every time we arrange
some data in the table we need some
reference to that data right let's say
we are creating a bill for a restaurant
what we need in that bill are the name
of the product and the price
fine so we need to mention it at the top
of each column to do so we need to use
the table heading tag the Syntax for
this tag is pretty easy what we have to
do is we have to write here after the
first table rot tag the Syntax for this
tag is pretty easy what we have to do is
we have to write here before for the
first table rot so we have to write here
only because this is going to be the
heading so it has to be present at the
top of the table before any row and
column we have to add another row over
here now inside this row we have to
mention headings fine so we have to use
the table heading tag so the syntax is
this now we have to write here the first
heading so let's say first heading is
item
and then we have the second heading
as price fine save the program and you
can see we have two headings over here
now let's change the tables data first
and we'll create a bill for some
restaurant let's say so what we are
going to do is we are going to add
another column over here in each row so
we are going to add a column let's say
it's Sr number so it's going to be the
serial number then we have to change the
data here only fine so we'll remove the
data from
here from each row basically so we'll
remove this as
well and we'll remove this as well fine
now this is going to be the first row
after let's save the program once and
you can see over here we have empty
cells present over here we have three
headings serial number item and price
let's work on the first row now we need
another table data tag so the serial
number is going to be one for first row
let's say the item name is t then we
have the price so let's say the price is
going to be rupees 20 save the program
and we have our first row over here now
for the second row we have to put the
serial number as two then we
have coffee or let's say
black coffee then we have to use another
table data tag now we have to mention
the price the price is let's say 34
black
coffee and we are good to go with this
as well we are going to copy this whole
row from here we're going to paste it
here the serial number is going to be
three the item name is let's say
capuccino so we'll write
here
capucino and the price is going to be a
little higher than black cfee let's say
60 for
cappuccino and then we are going to add
another item over here fine so the
serial number is going to be four
instead of capuccino let's write
here espresso then let's change the
price to
90 save the program and you can see the
table over here it looks nice
right now we have three columns the
procedure is the same and you just saw
it right just like we added the table
heading here in this table similarly we
can give a caption to the table as well
like here we can write the restaurants
names or we can write the bill or
anything we want so that particular
caption will be present at the top of
the table so what we have to do is we
have to write here at the top before
this
table row tag before the first row we
have to write here caption caption is
another tag now we have to write here
let's say the resturant name is XY Z
Resturant save the program and you can
see the caption over here as XY Z
Resturant fine now the next thing we are
going to discuss in this video is the
Rose span and the call span attributes
suppose we want to merge two cells and
create a single merging two cells means
let's say we want to merge these two
cells fine this one and this one so for
that we can use the column span
attribute or the rose span attribute
fine so for example let's suppose we
want to print the grand total of all the
items for that we don't need the serial
number so what we can do is we can merge
the first two columns of this row with
the help of call spin so we are going to
create another row over here and we are
going to merge these two columns fine in
the new R so what we have to do here
is we have to write here after this row
we are going to add another row so for
that we have to write here table row tag
now inside this table row tag we have to
mention the table data tag and then
we'll write here call span call span is
going to be two because we want to merge
two cells fine now what we'll do is
we'll write
here grand total and we are going to add
another cell so we are going to write
here TD again so let's add it and the
total price is I guess 200 so we'll
write here 200 save the program and you
can see we have two columns merged over
here
fine similarly we can also use the row
span attribute whenever we want to merge
two rows one thing to keep in mind is we
can use these attributes within the
table data tag only not in any other tag
for
example if we want to merge two rows
fine so what we can do is we can write
here row pen and we are going to write
here to save the program and you can see
these two rows are now merged
fine so let's remove it for now and save
the program again so this table looks
nice
now the next attribute we have in tables
is the background color attribute we can
use this attribute to change the
background color of the whole table or
of any particular row or column fine we
just have to use the BG color attribute
as per our requirement for example if we
want to change the background color of
the first row which contains all the
headings what we have to do is we have
to write here inside this first table
row Tye we have to write here BG color
and this is an attribute now let's say
we want to color it as red fine save the
program and you can see the out the
whole row is red in color now fine
similarly we can change the Border color
of the whole table with the help of
Border color attribute we have to write
here inside the table tag so this is the
main tag and we have to write
here border color is equals
to let's say
yellow fine save the program and you can
see the border is now yellow in color
one thing I want to tell here is we can
change the background color of any
particular set fine so let's say we want
to change the background color of
espresso fine let's do it let's change
this background color to Brown fine so
here we have espresso inside this table
data type what we have to do is we have
to write here BG color and we have to
mention here Brown save the program and
you can see it's brown in color fine so
guys this is basically how we can create
an add data in a table in HTML before
discussing text links in HTML let's
understand what a link is any website we
go through in today's world must contain
a link a link in HTML is an object that
allows us to a new location when we
click on it provides a simple way of
navigation between different pages is
present on the web these links in HTML
are known as hyperlinks and hyperlinks
allows us to navigate between websites
by clicking on Words emails and images
thus we can create hyperlinks using text
or images available on a web page so
let's go through an example of what
links are and how they make it easier
for the user to navigate within web
pages here we have a sample web page we
created it when we went through jQuery
on this website you can see we have
words present over here like home about
categories top rated and content fine if
we click on any of these word it takes
us to that particular section of the web
page what actually happens is when we
mention these words on the HTML file we
provided them with specific links so
that it will be easier for the viewer to
get to any particular part of the
website without much hassle I hope you
guys now now have got an idea of what
links are let's see how these links are
added to a web page now in this
particular video we'll go through text
links in HTML we'll cover image links
and email links in the upcoming videos
so don't worry about them now in HTML
the anchor tag is used to specify a link
anything present between the opening and
closing anchor tag becomes the part of a
link and we can click that part to reach
to the linked web page or document so
the Syntax for the anchor tag goes like
this inside the body tag we have to
write here e so this is a anchor tag and
anything goes in between there will be
considered as a part of the link
fine now the next thing we'll do is
We'll add the link to a website here to
specify a link in HTML the HF attribute
is used this attribute specifies the URL
of the web page or website or document
the link goes to so HF is basically a
attribute fine so what we have to do is
we have to write here inside the anchor
tag we have to mention the HF attribute
and now we have to write the URL of
website over here fine so let's say the
URL of a website is
www.g
google.com fine and the text will be
let's say Google fine
now save the program and you can see
here we have Google written over here on
the web page in blue color it is purple
for now you will get to know about it
later on in this video
only so the URL we mentioned over here
inside the anchor tag will take us to
the homepage of Google search engine
click on it and you can see here we are
on Google's homepage right so moving
ahead let's discuss the two different
types of URLs we have in H HTML the two
types of URLs are absolute URL and
relative
URL the URL we used here in this example
which navigates the user to Google's
homepage is an example of an absolute
URL basically when a full web address is
mentioned in the HF attribute it refers
to an absolute URL on the other hand the
relative URL refers to a local link a
link to a page within the same website
or without the https and www part fine
the Syntax for this is also a bit
different so let's go through it what
we'll do is we'll first create another
web page for this so let's create one
here we have to name it so let's say we
are writing over here about.
HTML so let's write some code over
here let's say we are writing over here
this is the about section of our website
so we'll write here
H2 and about
us and let's write a paragraph here as
well we'll write here
welcome to
a YouTube channel fine so we are done
with it let's save this and let's open
it with live server once and you can see
it's working totally fine this is let's
say the about a section of a website now
what we'll do is we'll move back to our
original file so we have this original
file over here and we'll create a link
over here fine basically what we are
doing is we are linking these two HTML
files fine now in here what we'll do is
we'll create another link which will
redirect us to that about us page so for
that we have to write here a hre and we
have to close the anchor tag fine so in
here we have to write the file name so
we'll write here about. HTML and we'll
write here about us fine
fine save the program now and you can
see we have the word about us present
over here click on it and it will take
us to the About Us section of our
website or to the about us page of our
website you can see it over here now the
reference to adding a local page is the
same as attaching an image to a web page
we can provide the path of that
particular page inside the HF attribute
moving ahead let's discuss the target
attribute in Anchor tag
whenever we click on a link it opens a
web page in the same window by replacing
the current web page this happens by
default in HTML fine we can change this
to either within the same window or in a
new window the target attribute can have
four different values the four values
can be self blank parent and top so self
is used to open the related document
within the same window for example if we
use this particular attribute over here
inside this anchor tag we'll write here
Target then we'll write here underscore
sell and save this program and we'll
refresh this page once again one thing
to keep in mind is we have to write the
value like this only with the underscore
present before the value fine now save
the program and now if we click on the
link over here the about us link the new
document will be opened in the same
window only this is the default value as
well in any web page so if we want to
change the document to open in a new
window we have to write
here instead of self so let's do it for
this link now what we'll do is we'll
write Target over here Target will be
set to blank with ancore save the
program move back to the web page and
click on Google over here you can see
this link is opening in a new window now
fine similarly we have the top and
parent values as the parent value opens
the document in the parent frame and the
top will open it in full body of the
window we'll discuss them later when we
go through HTML frames in the upcoming
videos one more thing we can do with
links is to change the color of a link
for that we have three different
attributes a link We Link and
Link a link refers to an active link we
link on the other hand refers to a
visited Link and Link refers to the
color of the normal link we can mention
these three attributes inside the body
tag only if we want to make similar
changes to all the links present on the
website if you want to do it for one
single link what we have to do is we
have to mention these three attributes
inside the anchor tag of that particular
link only fine the syntax goes like this
for now we'll mention them inside the
body Tex
so we'll write
here link link is going to be yellow in
color then we have a link so a link is
going to be let's say brown and then we
have we link fine so we link is going to
be let's say green fine save the program
and you can see Google and about us are
now green in color because they are
already visited so what we'll do is
We'll add another link link over here
we'll write a hre so let's use
any HTML file from here so let's use the
meta HTML B so we'll write here metah do
HTML Target will set to let's
say blank fine we are going to open it
in a new window so let's say we are
writing over here meta save the program
and you can see Meta over here which is
also in green color because these all
these three links are visited click on
it and you can see the color changing to
Brown fine because it states that these
links are active as well
fine now let's talk about the default
color of an HTML link as well so an
unvisited Link in HTML is underlined and
blue in color a visited link is
underlined and purple in color that's
why this particular Link at the start
was in purple color an active link is
underline and red in color so this is
the task for you guys you have to use
these attributes to change the color of
a link present on a web page so I hope
you guys must have got an idea by now
about the anchor tag in HTML try doing
it by yourself and let us know what you
learned now that we know enough about
links in HTML and we saw previously how
to use it with a specific word or
phrases in HTML we'll do the same thing
but this time we are going to do it with
images only
now a link in HTML is an object that
allows us to a new location when we
click on it it provides a simple way of
navigation between different pages
present on the web just a quick revision
of what links are in HTML so we already
know how to attach an image to a web
page in HTML the image tag is used for
it now to add a link within an image we
have to Nest one tag inside the other
it's not as hard as it sounds so let's
do it here and you will understand it
much better we'll use the image tag
within the anchor tag first of all we'll
write here inside the body tag of HTML
document we'll write a then this is the
anchor tag we have to write here hre
href is an attribute we came across this
in the previous video so now what we'll
do is we'll write inside here the
reference to a web page so we'll let's
say WR here https
then we have to write here
this let's say we are writing here
www.google.com fine now the anchor tag
is ready let's recall what we did with
text in the last part we simply wrote
the text between the anchor tag and the
browser treated that text as a link fine
now what we have to do is to add an
image in place of that text so we'll
simply Nest the image tag here what
we'll do is we'll write here inside the
anchor tag inside the body of anchor tag
basically so we'll write here image so
this is our tag now we have to add an
image over here fine so let's say we are
writing over here SRC now we have this
image present inside the images folder
so let's use one image from this and we
have to write here alt alt is going to
be HTML for this that's it we have used
the image over here save the program and
you can see we have an image over here
on the browser the size is quite large
right so let's fix it first so what
we'll do is we'll use the height and the
width attribute within the image tag so
we'll write here height height is going
to be 200 pixel then we have the width
as well width is again going to be 200
pixel save the program and here you can
see the image size is fine now if we
click anywhere on the image then the
homepage of chrome will open because the
image is attached to that link only we
have written over here
www.google.com fine so it will take us
to the homepage of Google search engine
click on the image and you can see it
takes us to the homepage of Google so
attaching a link to an image is shortly
one of the easiest tasks to perform in
HTML we have used an absolute URL over
here in this particular image we can
also use a relative reference the syntax
will remain the same so let's do that as
well what we'll do is we'll write over
here inside the body tag again we'll use
another image so let's use the break tag
over here then we'll write here a href
href is going to be a relative reference
so let's say we have this about. HTML
file in a system so let's use it for now
so we'll write here about.
HTML then we Nest the image tag inside
here so we'll write here
IMG now we have to close this tag we'll
write here SRC SRC is going to be inside
the images folder again we are going to
use css.png
we'll write here alt alt is going to be
CSS then we
have height height is going to be 200
pixel and width width is again going to
be 200 Piel the same thing we did with
this IM image as well save the program
and you can see we have another image
over here which ISS CSS 3 and we have
used a relative reference or we can say
a relative URL over here for this image
so this image will take us to about.
HTML we can do many such tasks using
images in HTML so let's click on the
image first you can see the image over
here click on it and you can see we are
in the about us page right it says
Welcome to our YouTube channel so this
is how we can use images within anchor
tag in HTML the attributes for both the
tags Remains the Same we can still use
the target attribute within the anchor
tag for the new web page to open either
in the same window or in a new one so I
hope you guys must have understood by
now adding an image and attaching a link
to it is quite easy I want you guys to
give it a try and learn something new
out of it what is an HTML class an HTML
class attribute is used to specify a
single or multiple class name names for
an HTML element the class name can be
used by CSS and JavaScript to do some
tasks for HTML
elements you can also use this class in
the CSS with a specific class with a
period character followed by the name of
the class for selecting
elements so let's jump onto the demo to
understand the classes and ID better so
we are on our Sublime Text tror let's
add the standard boiler plate of HTML
we'll give the title as
classes and ID in
HTML let's start with the basic
example we'll see how to define an HTML
class so inside the body tag We'll add
one
H1 and we'll give this a class name
of head
one we'll add some text here this is the
heading
one now you can copy this part because
we'll need it in our further
lines
so for the
H2 this will be the heading
two for
H3 this will be heading
three and let's add one more
H4 this is the heading
four so so as you can see we have used
the same class name in all our H1 H2 H3
and
H4 so if you save the file and go to the
page and
refresh you'll see the headings are
there on the page this is the heading
one heading two heading three and
heading
four
now let's learn how we can use this
class name for our styling
purpose so we'll open the style tag
here and you will mention the class Name
by period followed by the class name so
head
one open the
parenthesis and let's set the color to
lightan and we'll set the font family to
set to it
cursive keep the background color to
Black okay so you can see we have
mentioned the class name do head head
one for our styling purposes and we have
given the color font family and
background color for it so just save the
file and go
back
refresh now you can see we have designed
this H1 H2 H3 and H4 using a class
tag now let's use another example with a
different class
name so here only we'll make the changes
let's name this class as H2 this H3 and
let it be
H4 now you can style them separately for
the head
to we can set the color
to say light pink and we can set the
font background color
to Red okay
now similarly for the
H3
dot head three I'll set the color
[Music]
to
I don't know what color this is let's
say
Pisa and set the background color to
let's say
blue okay save the file and go back to
the
page now you can see we have designed
our H1 H2 H3 and H4 using the different
class name this is the example of using
the multiple classes on the same code
and one thing you should note that the
these class name must be separated by
the
space there are few points you should
know while working with the class so the
first one will be the class attribute
can be used on any HTML element like any
HTML element can have a class name the
second point will be the class name is a
case sensitive head
one and if we change here to
say
we'll keep this H as cap capital so this
will be wrong the style won't be
implemented on the page now if you
refresh you can see the style is not
implemented so the class name is a case
sensitive let's change this
back refresh and now you can see our
design is
back so this was all about HTML classes
now let's move on to the
attribute so the HTML ID attribute is
used to specify the unique ID for an
element of the HTML
document it allocates the unique
identifier which is used by the CSS and
the JavaScript for performing certain
tasks in cascading stylesheet that is
CSS we mention an element with a
specific ID by using the hash symbol
followed by the ID so let's work on an
example to understand this
better
so we'll use the same previous example
we'll mention the H1 and this time we'll
use the ID so ID and we'll name it as
head
one this is the first
heading for H2 also we mention mention
the ID name as head one
only head
one this is
the second
heading now to style The Heading we'll
go back here we'll open the style
tag and we'll use the hash symbol to
mention the ID so
hash head one open the
parenthesis we'll set the color
to light green green we'll set the font
family to
cursive and we'll set the background
color to
Black okay now save the file and go back
and
refresh so you can see this works in a
similar manner to the class apart from
it that we use the hash symbol to
mention the ID name so now let's change
the example and use the different ID
names for different H1s so this can be
H1 this can be
H2 let's add one more uh we'll name it
as
ID head
three okay so we'll start
the head
two we'll set the color to
Red for head
three we'll set the color to
Yellow let's use green yellow okay
save the file go back and
refresh now you can see we have the
different style for different IDs so in
this way you can use the different IDs

development program that fits your
experience and areas of Interest CSS
stands for cascading style sheet it is a
rule based language us used to describe
the formatting and looks of a web page
CSS stands one among the top three basic
languages required for front and web
development there are three languages
which are HTML CSS and JavaScript HTML
as we all know is used to create the
layout or structure of a web page while
CSS is used to format that web page it
means to make changes in the style of
elements of a web page JavaScript on the
other hand is used to make a web page
more responsive to a user all three
languages together are used for basic
front and web development let's not go
deep into that and we'll now go through
the different ways of adding a CSS file
to a web page we can use CSS in three
ways in a HTML document external
stylesheet define stylesheet rule in a
separate CSS file the CSS files
extension is going to be CSS and then we
can include that file in a HTML document
using the link tag another method we
have is the internal style sheet Define
style sheet rules in the header section
of the HTML document using style tag
another one we have is inline stylesheet
in this method we define stylesheet rule
directly along with the HTML elements
using the style attribute remember the
difference in internal stylesheet we use
style tag and in inline stylesheet we
use style as an attribute so let's go
through each of them practically you
guys will understand it much
better we'll use an external CSS file
first we'll attach it to a HTML document
for that let's write something over here
on the web page first so that we can
then style that particular element so
what we'll do is we'll move to the body
of a HTML document and we'll use a div
tag over here so we'll write here div
and inside inside this let's write
something over here so let's say we are
writing over
here styling
using external CSS file or we can say
styling using external
stylesheet so this is a basic example of
creating a division save the program and
you can see here we have some text
present over here right the next thing
we'll do is we'll attach a CSS file to
this HTML document using a link tag then
we'll style this div tag in that file
only so let's do one thing first we'll
create a CSS file first so we'll go to
this section We'll add a file and let's
name it as style. CSS CSS is the
extension for external CSS files
remember this guys press enter and you
can see we have another stylesheet
present over here so this is empty for
now we just created this stylesheet now
let's move back to the HTML file for now
now what we'll do is we'll link this
stylesheet to a HTML document for that
the task is simple we use the link tag
so we'll move to the Head section of a
HTML document and we'll write here link
fine so after link what we'll do is
we'll write here Rel and Rel is going to
be stylesheet then we
have type so this defines the type of a
document so we'll write here text SL CSS
and then we finally write here href and
a sheet name is style. CSS fine so we'll
write here style. CSS close it now the
Rel attribute here signifies the
relationship between these two documents
which means the HTML document and the
CSS document
fine the type is CSS and the HF refers
to the source offers CSS file save the
program and you can see nothing happened
over here on the browser now what we'll
do is we'll style this D tag in the
external CSS file we just created so
let's move on to the CSS file and what
we'll do here is we'll write over here
so we are going to style a div tag fine
so for now we'll write over here div
this is the Syntax for styling any HTML
element fine so let's style it so let's
say we are writing over here background
color as blue fine save it now and you
can see the background color is changed
to
Blue next thing let's change the font
color as well so let's say we are
writing over here antique white as font
color save it now you can see the font
color is also changed let's add some
more CSS properties so let's say we are
writing over here font weight so font
weight is going to be bolder then we
have let let's say font style so font
style we are going to write here itan
fine save the program and you can see
the text is bolder and italic in nature
fine next thing let's add a border as
well so we'll write here border border
is also a CSS property so we'll write
over here 3 pixel this is the thickness
of our border then we'll write here
solid this is the nature of a border and
let's say we are writing over here the
color name so silver is going to be the
color name save it now and you can see
this div tag or division we can say now
has a silver border with some background
color and font color as well the last
thing we are going to write here is text
align we are going to align this text at
the center of a division save it now and
you can see the text present at the
center of a division fine you can see
the change over here on the browser we
created the layout here with HTML and
then we styled div tag using CSS we can
style any HTML tag here either with the
help of tag name or the ID and class
attribute fine the second way of styling
an HTML tag is with the help of inline
CSS this method is used to apply a
unique style to a single HTML element
for inline CSS what we need to do is we
need to move to the HTML file first and
here what we are going to do is we are
going to create another division now
fine we don't need any special tag or
external CSS fire for inline CSS or we
can say inline style sheet so what we'll
do is we'll write over here let's use
the break tag first to make it look more
tidy so we'll use Break Tag twice and
then we'll write here div fine so this
is going to be another Division and we
are going to write here P so let's write
here
styling a
document
using inline CSS fine save it now and
you can see this division has the same
styling as the previous one this is
because we have used the tag name over
here inside this style. CSS and both the
tag names are same both have div tags
right so what we'll do is we'll remove
this line for now now save it and you
can see both of them don't have any
style right now fine so what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here again now we are going to style it
with the help of inline CSS for that we
need the style attribute so we'll write
Here style then we are going to define
the background color as let's say
Aqua then we
have so let's make it tidy so we'll
apply the font color as well so let's
say the font color is going to be black
for this one then we have
let's say font style font style is going
to be
italic and then we have font weight font
weight is again going to be Boulder we
have discussed all these properties in
the external CSS part as well so let's
mention all of them here so we are going
to use the Border as 3 pixel again let's
say dashed for now so we'll write here
dashed and then we'll write
here the color name so let's say the
color name is
gold and we have the Border as well so
at the end we'll write here text align
at the
center fine so the style attribute plays
a significant role in this type of
styling and you can see it over here on
the browser the moment we say we have
another division over here so you can
see it over here this division has Dash
border which is also three pixel th and
it looks different from the previous one
right so let's mention the link over
here as well again so we'll write here
link re is going to
be
stylesheet type is going to be text SL
CSS and then we have href href is going
to be style. CSS I close it save it now
and you can see the difference between
both the divisions right the first one
uses the external CSS file and the
second one uses the inline style sheet
okay
the output is almost the same as the
previous one apart from the colors and
all so inline CSS is easy to use but it
can make an HTML document look more
confusing and we need to style each
element separately if we use this method
to apply a style to an HTML document it
doesn't matter if we want to apply
similar styling to more than one element
inline CSS can be tricky and lengthy in
such task moving ahead let's talk about
the last method we are left with for the
HTML style Chet sheet the internal
method so it uses a style tag inside the
head section of a HTML document so for
that what we are going to do is we are
going to remove both these divisions
save it now and we are going to remove
this link as well we are going to remove
the link for a external stylesheet as
well save it now and you can see we have
nothing over here on the browser so what
we are going to do is we are going to
create another division now inside this
we are going to use a paragraph so let's
say
we are writing over here styling a
document
using
internal sheet fine save it now and you
can see we have a paragraph over here
nothing else now this method is used to
style elements of a single web page we
can apply the same styling to a bunch of
elements simultaneously with the help of
internal CSS the task is simple so let's
do one thing let's create another
division over here so we are going to
create it after the Break Tag
and let's paste it here and let's write
something over here as well so let's add
Here style cheet two and you can see we
have two paragraphs now these two are in
different divisions so what we are going
to do is we are going to style both the
divisions at the same time or
simultaneously we can say so for that
what we are going to do is we are going
to move to the Head section of our HTML
document and we are going to use the
style tag so style can be used as a tag
or as an attribute as well if we using
inline CSS then we are going to use
style as an attribute and if we are
going to use internal CSS then we are
going to use style as a tag fine so
let's write it over here so we have a
div tag now what we'll do is we'll style
both of them so we are going to write a
background color
as let's say red for both of them then
we have color which refers to the font
color so let's say we have the font
color as black again then we have font
weight font weight is going to be bolder
then we have font style font style is
going to be italic save it now and you
can see the difference in the browser
both the div tags have same styling as
of now now the next thing we are going
to write here is border fine so we are
going to write your border let's make it
five pixels this time we are going to
write here solid again and let's change
the Border color
to let's say we have yellow fine so
we'll write here yellow save it now and
you can see the Border color is yellow
now so the last property we are left it
is text align we are going to align it
at the center save it now and you can
see the difference on increasing the
browser size you can see the difference
the text is aligned at the center of
both the divisions
fine this method is also good to use if
you want to style any particular web
page only I hope you guys must have
understood all the three methods of
using CSS by now the question that
arises now is which method we should use
to keep the whole document neat and
clean the answer to this question is
external CSS this is because external
CSS allows us to style multiple document
at once it keeps a HT ml document clean
and less prawn to error as well so I
want you guys to use all the methods and
then let us know in the comments which
method you like the most or which method
you are more comfortable working with
JavaScript is a lightweight scripting
language used to make a web page more
interactive and livelier to the user it
is one of the most popular scripting
languages present in world today it's
almost impossible to cover the whole of
JavaScript in one small video because
JavaScript in itself is is an
interesting topic in this video we'll go
through the ways to attach JavaScript
with HTML and some basic examples of
what this language can do so to include
JavaScript in an HTML document we can
either keep the JavaScript code in a
separate file and then include it
wherever it's needed or we can just
Define functions inside the HTML
document itself using the script tag
let's go through both the cases one by
one firstly we'll create an external
Javascript file the benefit of using an
external Javascript file is if we are
going to define a functionality which
will be used in various HTML documents
then it's better to keep that
functionality in a separate Javascript
file and then include that file in your
HTML documents it will help us keep the
HTML document neat and organized as well
so a Javascript file always has ajs
extension and the script tag is used to
attach a Javascript file to an HTML
document let's move on to the
programming part directly and then we'll
see what we can do with JavaScript let's
create a Javascript file first so we'll
go here and we'll click on create a file
now we'll create a file let's say the
file name is going to be new.
jsjs is the extension here and we have
this Javascript file
now now it's time to attach the
Javascript file to a HTML document we'll
use the script tag after the body so
what we'll do is we'll move here and
we'll write
here script now inside the script tag we
need two attributes first one is going
to be SRC SRC is going to be new. JS as
this file is saved in that same folder
the next attribute we need is type so
we'll write here type type is going to
be text SL JavaScript
fine so SRC here defines the path where
a file is actually saved and type
defines the type of file that is
Javascript in this case so we are done
with attaching the file now let's move
on and make our web page a bit
interactive to the user fine we can
write small functions known as event
handlers and then trigger them using
HTML only adding responsiveness to a web
page means defining an event that will
tell the system to perform a specific
action upon calling sounds a bit
confusing right so let's understand it
with the help of an example we are all
aware of adding buttons to a web page
right so if the user clicks on a button
then what should happen we can either
create a popup alert on the button click
or we can do whatever we want so let's
create a button here first and we'll
then add functionality to it fine so
here we are in a HTML document we'll
create a button over here so we'll write
over here here button and let's say the
button name is going to be external for
external F save it now and you can see
we have a button over here on the
browser fine now click on it and you can
see nothing is happening as of now so
let's add some functionality to this
button now for that what we'll do is
we'll write here inside the button tag
we'll Define an event first so let's say
we are writing over here on click and
we'll call a function on button and
click fine so let's say a function name
is going to
be
message and save it now fine what we are
doing here is we are asking the system
to call the message function on clicking
this particular button let's define this
message function in a Javascript file
now so here we are in a Javascript file
now we need to create a function named
message fine so we'll write here
function message and this is the Syntax
for creating a function in JavaScript
now we'll write over here alert inside
alert we'll write
button clicked fine so here we have this
message over here now this alert is a
method present in JavaScript for
creating popups save the program and now
click on the button over here you can
see we have a popup here which says
button click you can see the message
right over here now the number of such
things we can do with JavaScript is
uncountable let's move ahead and we'll
see another method of using JavaScript
with HTML the internal script method we
can use for this this method is useful
if we want to use JavaScript for a
particular file or a particular tag we
can write a script code directly into a
HTML document usually we keep the script
code in the header section of the
document using the script tag otherwise
there is no such restriction and we can
put a source code anywhere in the
document but inside the script tag so
we'll move back to a HTML file and we'll
create another button over here this
time we'll use the internal script tag
to add functionality to it fine so we'll
move to the body section and here we are
going to create a button so we'll use
The Brak tag
first again A Break Tag now we are going
to create a
button then the button name is going to
be internal save it and you can see we
have this internal button over here as
well click on external and you can see
we are getting a message click on
internal you can see nothing is
happening as of now now to add
functionality to this button we need to
add an event first so we'll move inside
the button tag and we'll write here on
let's say mouse over so this is another
event we have in JavaScript we'll see
what this event can do in a while so
we'll write over here the function name
so let's say the function name is going
to be internal for this particular
button save it now and now what we are
going to do is we are going to define
the JavaScript part fine we'll move to
the Head section of HTML document and
we'll write here script the script tag
will remain the same in both the cases
here you can see we have defined the SRC
and type but here what we are doing is
we are using it internally so we'll
create the function over here only so
we'll write over here
function internal and this is going to
be the body of this function and we'll
write something over here inside the
alert box so let's say we are writing
over
here
internal script tag
fine save this program and move back to
the browser now you can see the moment
we take a mouse cursor over this
internal button a popup will appear with
the message internal script tag you can
see the message over here fine this is
because of the on Mouse over event we
used so guys we went through both the
methods of adding JavaScript to an HTML
document I hope you guys got it although
JavaScript is a very long topic to
discuss it is a language and if you want
to learn it then you can go through our
Channel and find the JavaScript playlist
here before we move on and start
creating the layout of any web page
let's discuss what a layout is a layout
refers to the arrangement of things in
HTML a layout refers to the arrangement
of elements in a way to make the web
page look more neat and clean to the
user creating a layout also allows us to
manage the content present on our web
page more effectively and efficiently
you can think of it right a well planned
website is easier to manage and edit if
we have an an idea about all the
sections present on a web page we have
used the header and footer Texs before
along with some more tags like nav and
section to create the layout of a web
page this time we are going to use the
table tag to create a layout and then
we'll use the div and span tags as well
for the SE so we are going to use two
different methods for creating the
layout of a web page we'll use a bit of
CSS as well to differentiate between the
different sections of the web page so
let's move on to the programming part
directly and we'll create a first layout
a question May pop up in your mind why
are we using tables for creating the
layout it is because tables are already
arranged in columns and rows so we can
utilize these rows and columns in
whatever way we like so let's understand
it with the help of an example if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know
more so what we'll do is we'll move to
the body tag of HTML document directly
we'll remove this H1 tag from here and
now we'll write here table so we are
going to use the table tag first now
let's style this table a bit we'll write
over here width width is going to be
let's say
100 and then we'll Define the Border as
zero
fine so we have used these two CSS
properties for this table tag here now
close the table tag and you can see we
have the whole table element here now
inside table tag we need the table row
fine TR tag we can say so we'll write
here TR now inside TR we need the table
data tag to mention the data inside the
table so what we'll do here is we'll
again style this table data column or we
can say table data tag so we'll write
call call span call span is going to be
two and then we'll write style fine we
are going to style the background color
over here so let's say the background
color for this is going to
be green fine so let's use green yellow
instead of
green and now inside the table data we
need to mention a heading so we'll write
over here
H1 and inside this will
write this is
the title of
a
web page fine now save this and you can
see over here we have this division or
we can say block with the heading this
is the title of a web page so if I
increase the size of a browser you can
see this is the title of a web page we
have this over here fine
now what we are going to do is we are
going to come out of this table data and
table row tag because we are going to
use another table row tag for another
section of the web page so we are going
to write here
TR now close this TR tag let's style
this as well so we'll write here V
align and we are going to align It To
The Top fine save it now now we have
another table row so we'll write over
here table data again so we'll write
here table
data now inside table data we need to
style this table data tag so we'll write
over here
tile and we'll write width again so
width is going to be 100% for this and
then we'll write over here background
color so so background color
is going to
be let's say Aqua let's change this
background color a bit from here you
know we can do it in visual code so
let's change it to this the RGB value
will change for this background color
now we have to close the table data tag
as well so the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to put the content
inside this so we'll write over here
inside
the Bol Tech so we'll mention B over
here let's say this is going to be the
main
menu so we have this bold over here now
we are going to use the break tag again
so we'll write over here this save it
now and you can see we have this main
menu present over here fine so you can
see now let's do one thing what we are
going to do is we are going to mention
here 100% the width and save it now
let's see if this makes a change and you
can see now both the divisions have full
width of the web page fine so the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to do
HTML and then of course we are going to
put a break over
here then we'll write here CSS again a
break we
need then we'll write here
python let's write each of them in
capital letters so BR again for this as
well then we'll write
here
JavaScript BR again so this is basically
the content of our web page save it now
and you can see we have this main menu
present over here fine now we are done
with this table data tag as well so
let's move on and we'll create another
table data data tag inside this same
table row so what we are going to do is
we are going to cut this section in two
different parts the left part is for the
main menu and the right part is for the
other things fine so let's Zoom it out
again and we are going to use the table
data tag here
again so we have this table data tag and
now what we are going to do is we are
going to style it we are going to write
here inside the style so let's say
background color we are going to mention
so let's mention any color over here
we'll write here purple and then we'll
change the color from here let's make it
light purple and save it you can see
nothing is happening over here on the
browser or you can see this purple color
over here it's smaller in size as of now
right so let's do one thing mention the
height and width as well for this
particular block so we are going to
write here after
this width is going to
be 100 pixels and then we'll write
here height as well height is again
going to be let's say 200 pixels fine
for this box and we are done with it so
let's mention over here something so
let's say we are writing over here
tutorials present in the website fine
all this thing refers to the content we
have in our website so save it now so
you can see we have two sections present
over here in a website for this
particular section we have the main menu
sections and then we have the tutorial
section as well so now let's do one
thing let's move back here again and now
what we are going to do is we are going
to add another table draw for the footer
section for the bottommost section of a
web page so we are going to write here
DD again then we need call span call
span is going to be two again then we'll
write here Style Style we'll mention the
background color background color is
going to be let's say red this time
let's change the color a bit because we
want light colors so let's use this
color over here and you can see it over
here it's not completely visible but it
is here so let's do one thing let's
mention something inside this box as
well now what we are going to do is we
are going to write
here this and now inside this table data
we are going to use a paragraph tag so
inside the paragraph tag let's write
something so let's write copyright
because this is always mentioned over
here so let's say we are writing over
copyright a a b c d save it now and here
you can see we have copyright written
over here let's put it in the center for
that we need to move back to the style
attribute and we have to write here text
align at the center save it now and you
can see the text is aligned at the
center now you can see the layout of
this web page we designed this layout
using the table tag and we have all the
T tags present within the table tag we
have the table row table data tag and we
have the table tag as well so this is
the complete layout of a web page fine
let's move ahead and we'll create
another layout this time we'll use the
div and span tag for creating the layout
we'll create a new file for that layout
we'll create a file so we'll move here
and we'll write here out to.
HTML save it now and you can see we have
another file over here fine
let's do this and we have the HTML code
over here the basic HTML code now we'll
move to the body section
directly and what we'll do is we are
going to use the div tag and the span
tag for creating a layout fine so let's
open it with live server once and here
you can see we have this document so
let's write the code now so we'll use
the div tag for creating divisions so
we'll write here div style is going to
be the width width is going to be 100%
fine so let's write over here 100% now
this is the main division fine so we are
going to create the layout inside this
particular division only so we'll use
another div tag inside this particular
div tag we'll write here
div Style style is going to be the
background color we have to set so we'll
write here
background color so background color is
going to be
let's a blue Viet let's change the color
from
here save it now and you can see nothing
is happening as of
now so the next thing we are going to do
is we are going to mention the width
over here as well it will take the 100%
width of whole div tag so we'll write
here
100% and we'll close this div tag fine
so we have this D tag now we have to
mention our content inside this tag so
we'll use the H1 tag again and we'll
write here this is
the title of
a web page
fine so we have this save it now and you
can see we have this division present
over here it says this is the title of
our web page and you can see we have
this
whole section present over here which
basically refers to the navigation bar
of any website so this is the layout
first now what we need to do is we are
going to create the whole layout so we
need different sections right so we are
going to use the div tag again for
creating another section present in a
web page so we'll write here div now
inside this dip what we are going to do
is we are going to use style first so we
need to mention the background color
again so the background color is let's
say this this is the gray color and and
then we'll write here height of
this section so height is we are going
to write here
200 pixels then we have width as well so
we'll write here width width is going to
be 100 pixels
fine and we'll write here float as well
float is going to be
left now let's mention the data inside
this so that you guys will be able to
see it now what what we'll do is we'll
create another division inside this
Division and we'll write here
in block letters or we can say Bard
letters
main menu fine we did the same thing in
the previous layout as well now after
this we'll write here all the languages
we have so we'll write here
HTML then we'll put a Break Tag over
here then we have
CSS then we'll put a Break Tag again
here then we have python so we'll write
here break again and then we
have JavaScript
fine so we have this D tag over here
it's almost done now save the program
and you can see float left means the
whole division will float at the left
side of the whole web page so it's
basically we are taking the division and
we are putting it in the left hand side
of a web page if we write your float as
right the whole division will move to
the right hand side of the web page you
can see it over here it's on the left
hand side we can also put it at the
right hand side as well so let's create
another section now so for that what we
are going to do is we are going to use
another div tag so we'll write here
div now we need background color height
width and Float properties again fine so
basically what we are going to do is we
are going to copy it from
here we are going to paste it here close
the D tag and that's it fine now what we
are going to do is we are going to
mention something inside here so let's
take the text from the first layout we
had so let's write tutorials present in
the website here copy it from here paste
it
here and that's it fine let's put it
inside the paragraph TCH so that it's
not confusing for you
guys save it now and here you can see we
have tutorials present in the website
present over here fine so before we move
ahead let's change the style of this
particular section so for that what we
are going to do is we are going to
change the height and width so height
will remain 200 pixel but the width we
are going to change let's skip it 350
pixels save it now and you can see it
over here
fine so you can see we have this whole
section present over here so we have put
a main menu at the left hand side then
we have tutorials at the center and then
we can keep something at the right hand
side as well so let's do one thing let's
move here and we will create another
section now so what we are going to do
is we are going to copy this D tag from
here we are going to
paste it
here again now we are going to change
some style so this time we are going to
write here float
as
right
fine then we'll change the width and
height as well width is going to be 100
pixel and height is going to be 200
pixels save it now and let's see the
change over here you can see we have
this layout or we can see say this
section present over here
and I guess it looks fine now at 175% we
can also use this space as well fine so
let's do one
thing let's create the bottom side of
this layout first and then we'll discuss
what we can do fine so here we are we
need another D tag now for the bottom
side or we can say for the footer
section so we'll write here div Style
style is going to be again the
background color we are going to mention
so we'll write here background
[Music]
color background color is going to be
let's
say blue blue is good and then we'll
write here clear clear is going to be
both and then we'll write here text
align text align at the center for
aligning the text to the center of a
division now inside this we are going to
use the paragraph tag again and we are
going to write
here copyright AB c d save it now and
move back to the browser you can see
it's present over
here now you can see many things are
wrong in this particular layout so how
we can correct them what we can do is we
can increase the size according to our
needs so let's increase the size of
these sections a bit and we'll see if it
works or not so let's change the color
for this section first let's make it red
and now we are going to change the width
of this
particular section save it
now and you can see it's greater and
width so it went down now what we need
to do is we need to remove the width by
a bit so let's write here 350
pixels save it now let's see and it's a
bit more
again and now we'll write here 300 let's
see if it's working and you can see it
works fine now it looks fine now right
so what we can do is we can change the
width of each section according to our
needs that's how we can create the
layout of any web page so guys here we
have seen two different methods of doing
the same thing we created two layouts
one with the table tag and the other
with the div and span tags in my opinion
the lettera method we went through is a
bit simpler because the only thing we
need to keep in mind while working with
the div and span tag is the area fine we
need to keep the width and height of any
division in mind if we are clear with
that then we can create the layout very
easily so that's why we prefer the
letter method to create layouts for a
web page responsiveness of a web page
May refer to different scenarios let's
go through the meaning of responsiveness
first in web designing adding
responsiveness has two different
meanings one is done with the help of
JavaScript whenever we go through a
website and we see something happens on
a button click it refers to
responsiveness as well we use events for
it right let's suppose we go through an
e-commerce website and try to purchase a
product whenever we click on the buy now
button something happens right it either
takes us to a different web page or
opens any kind of popup regarding the
scene
this phenomena is called the
responsiveness of a web page and we use
JavaScript for that this was for your
reference that if someone says
responsiveness then you should not get
confused we are not going to discuss it
in today's video responsiveness in HTML
means creating a layout in such a way
that it will be adjusted automatically
to different screen sizes and view ports
let's take an example here to make it
easier for you guys let's say we have a
website opened on a desktop what we want
to do is we want to open the same
website on a mobile device as well but
at the same time we want all the content
to adjust automatically according to the
Mobile screen in that case we need to
design a website in such a way that it
automatically adjusts itself to such
devices we can achieve this task using
two different methods we can use CSS
media queries or we can do it with the
help of HTML and basic CSS as well we'll
be discussing the later method in this
video which is the HTML method and in
the upcoming video we'll discuss media
queries as well so don't worry about it
guys let's move on and start using HTML
to make the content of a web page
responsive to different device screens
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more for reference let's add an image to
our browser first so what we'll do is
we'll move to the body section of a HTML
document and we'll write here IMG so we
are going to add an image over here so
let's write here Source the image is
present inside the images folder and
let's say we are using space.png now we
need the alt attribute as well so let's
say we are writing over here alt and
space fine now save the program and you
can see here that we have an image
present on the
browser the image size is larger here
right let me zoom in a bit for you so
you can see this is a image so you can
see the size is quite big according to a
browser now we want this image to adjust
itself accordingly if we reduce the size
of a window for this we need to make
some changes to this picture so what
we'll do we'll add a class here first so
let's say we are using class as
responsive fine so here we have our
class now we'll make certain style
changes in this image so we'll use the
style tag now inside it we are going to
access a image so we have a class is
responsive and inside here we'll
write width width is going to be
100% and let's say the height height is
going to be O2 fine save the program and
you can see here the image adjusts
itself according to a window size so if
we increase the size of a browser you
can see this whole image over here the
width of this image is 100% of the
screen and the height is automatic fine
now the moment we decrease the size of
this window or we can say if we increase
the size the image is adjusting itself
accordingly right on increasing or
decreasing the size of a window the
image is adjusting fine we don't need
anything else to make it look more
responsive fine another thing we can do
here is we can use the max width and
minwidth properties to make an image
responsive to the window so what we can
do here is we can write here inside this
mwidth Min width we are going to write
here as 500
pixels and we are going to Define Max
width here as well Max WID is going to
be let's say 1,000 pixel save the
program now and you can see the image
size is 1,000 pixel over here go to
inspect element and here you can see if
you take your cursor over here on the
image source button you can see the
rendered size is 1,00 into 469 pixels
now try decreasing the size of this
image so you can see it over here we
have this size of our window now take
your cursor over here you can see the
rendered size is 719 pixels now decrease
the size completely now you can see the
rendered size is 500 pixels the image is
not going below 500 pixels in this case
fine it means that the image will adjust
itself down to 500 pixels only fine now
let's write here 400 pixels for your
efforts save the program now decrease
the size of this window so it's at the
lowest and take your cursor over here
you can see the rendered size is 423
pixels it can't go below that because
this is the
maximum size we can go with a browser
window fine so this is how we can make
an image responsive to the Windows
screen using HTML and basic CSS we are
not using any advanced CSS for making an
image responsive as of now I hope you
guys got it so in this video we are
going to create something like this this
is a Content box with the icon and the
description of the content
box icons they used is from the font
awesome
CDN so let's start
creating so I have my two files open
which is HTML and CSS let's add the
standard boiler
plate We'll add the
content boxes in
HTML as the
title let's link our CSS
file
now inside the body let's add a div
class
container inside the div class container
I'll create another div
box I will require three such boxes so
we'll copy paste this three
times on the style
sheet let's set the margin to zero and
padding also to
zero we'll set the font
family to
Sans
SF now for the container
class we'll set the position to
relative and we'll set the width to 1200
pixels which is the whole width of the
content
box we'll set the height to 300
pixels and we'll set the
margin to 240 pixels and
Auto
for the boxes inside the
container we'll add the
position
relative and we set the width
to let me explain you what this
is this CSS C function is used to
perform a calculation to be used as the
property
value this is specifically used for the
width of the div
classes it requires a mathematical
expression the result will be used as a
value so we'll be using lot of this Cal
function here in this
code we'll set the height
to 300 pixels minus 30
pixels one property of C function is
that it takes single expression as its
parameter the expression can be any
simple expression combining the
following operators plus sub that is
addition minus that is substraction
multiplication and
division we'll set the background 2 #
0000 we'll set it to float
left
and we'll specify the margin to 15
pixels U we'll set the Box sizing to
border
box overflow will be
hidden and Border
radius let's set it to 10 pixels say
just save the file and let's go back to
the page to see how it currently
looks so you can see our boxes are in
the proper places we have the background
black with the proper margin between
them okay so we have the
structure let's code
more now we need the icon for that we'll
require icon from the font awesome TDM
so we'll add the font aen CDM to our
page so we'll search font aen CDN
4.7.0 we are using the older version
because it is more
stable so go to this point aome
libraries here select the version and
copy the link
tag go back to the page and add it
here delete this Integrity
part now here inside this class
box add one div which will be named
class
icon and inside here we'll add the link
of the icon so search
here font AES some icon
4.7 go to the first
one here you can search the any icon you
want uh let me search
for
say information so I'll go to the
information and I'll copy
this go back to the code and add it
here now inside this I'll create another
div which will be for used for content
so we'll name it class
content and inside this I'll add one
H3
info and inside it I'll add
some text uh copy this much from
here
here I'll delete this whole part
and put it
inside P tag so inside the P
tag add them
yeah so let's go back to the file and
see how it looks right
now okay so you cannot see the icon here
because it is black let's try to change
the color here so that you can see the
icon so let's set it to
ff0 okay so you can see I have the icon
in place this is and this is the text
that we have added to this content box
now let's style this content box
first C it back to
0
now container dobox
do
icon we'll set the position to
Absolute we set the top to
Z left to
Z and we'll set the width to
100% we'll set the the height also
100% background will be #
f00 and we'll set the
transition to 0.5
seconds and we'll keep the Z index as
one so that the icon will be
visible
okay
refresh yeah you can see the icon
here
okay
now let's add the H effect on that so
container
dot box do
over
icon we'll set the top to 20
pixels we calculate the left
[Music]
to 50% - 40
pixels withd 80
pixels height keep it to 80 pixels as
well and let's set the Border
radius
50% okay so now that we have repeat so
now that we have added the whole effect
let's save and go back to the page now
let's design the icon so container
dot box.
icon
FAA
okay also set the position to
Absolute top will be
% left
50% transform let's translate it
to minus
50% -
50% and keep the font size
to 80
pixels
transition. 5
seconds and we'll set the color
to save the file and let's go back to
the
page yeah so you can see our icon has
now bigger size and with the H effect it
shrinks for text to be visible
okay now we need to add the H effect to
the icon so that the font size
increases for that we'll add
container box.
over we'll keep the font size
two
okay now it's time to design the content
inside the container box so we'll set
container
dobox do
content all the positions are absolute
we'll set the top to
100% so that when the icon shrinks the
whole text Will visible to the text box
we'll set the
height to we'll calculate
it
100% - 100
pixels text align
Center uh keep the padding to 20 pixels
for proper
spacing box sizing as border
box transition to 0 0.5
seconds and we'll keep the opacity to
zero okay save the file and let's go
back yeah now you can see the icons are
in the center of the shrinking
circle now let's add the hover
effect now when you set the opacity to
one another
text okay we have not designed yet S3
and P so let's start designing it so
container
boox content
H3 and pixels
keep the padding to
zero
color and let's keep the font size to 24
pixels now you'll see the text Will
visible inside the box so
refresh yeah you can see this is the
heading of our this content box in four
now similarly let's style the paragraph
tag so container
boox do
content
P margin will be
zero padding will be also
zero and color will be FFF as
usual
save y we are almost there now we will
Design these two boxes with some spacing
and effect over
here now uh inside
this delete them we'll copy paste the
above code
here
yeah
so copy from here diff CL
container we'll change the icon classes
here so for this let's keep search s a r
c h instead of copying the CL
by going back to the font CDM you can
directly add the class search here if
you know the name of the
class and here we can
add
location so the class name for location
is map
marker save the file and let's go
back yeah now you can
see these things are here with the good
content box when you hold over this box
the this whole thing shrinks and you can
see the text
visible now add We'll add some Styles
we'll change the color and we'll add one
background here so that when this
shrinks the background color of the
black
changes okay so we'll go back to our
code
so to change the color of the Box We'll
add here do
container dot
box and we'll use the nth child property
so n
child one because first box do
icon so we'll keep its background
to
Pink okay and Dot
container box and
child one
it color will be when it shrinks let's
keep it to
Orange
yeah so save the
file go back and
refresh okay so you can see we have the
icons in places and when you go click on
here so the H effect shrinks this and
this is the pink in color we have the
background orange with some text here
you can see smooth
transitions
so this is all for the content boxes in
HTML you can use different icons here
using this font as awesome icon uh there
are several icons here you can use any
of them uh just make sure that the
padding and the text are aligned in the
proper places in L will look something
like this we have the background image
and this images that I have taken for
example purpose we have this videoo
buttons and we click on the radio
buttons we can go through our images one
by one also the images will change
automatically after some times as you
can see so let's see how we can create
this image
slider so here in the desktop I have
created one file where I have the
required
images and HTML and CSS
file so first in the htl sty let's add
our r
butons so we'll create one
div and name it a div class
slider inside this D I'll create another
D which will be named as this class
SL inside this D flashl We'll add the
radio buttons
so input the input type will be
radio and let's give this name radio
button and we'll tag them with ID radio
one so as you can
see we'll need four buttons here so
we'll add four radio buttons
here
so just copy paste this four
times here change the ID to Radio 2
radio 3 and radio four so we can disting
between our four radio
buttons so after the creating of radio
buttons We'll add our required images so
we'll create another div and name it
class slide
first inside this D I'll create an image
tag and specify the PA of the
image in a similar manner we'll create a
four D tags for four
Images so just we'll do it simply
another D with class
name
slide inside this
image to.
jpj
so just save the file and let's recheck
our code we have the radio buttons we
have the images so let's just go back to
our file and see how it looks so if we
refresh we'll see we have the four radio
buttons here and some disported
images so let's just fix this images in
the
CSS so inside our CSS
file we'll add the body and we'll set
the margin to 0er
[Music]
pixels adding to
zero we'll set the height to say 100
vertical
height we'll set the display to
flex uh we'll justify the content to
Center we'll set the Align items to
Center and we set the background to
Black so
just refresh this
file so we still need to fix this images
so
just set the slider with
to 800 to
12 okay there's an error we set this B
not
R we set the height to 500
pixels we'll set the Border
Rus 2 10
pixels and overflow we keep as
hidden for the slice
part will set the width to 500
% High to 500
pixels and this play to
flat so let's save the file and see how
it looks on the
page so yeah you can see the images now
in the proper size we have to fix this
radio button we have the background
black so let's fix the things
so for the slide
input okay before styling this let's add
some more HTML content
here so after adding up the image we
have to create the automatic navigation
button and the manual navigation
button so after this
add another
D the class
name
navigation Auto let's
see and inside this navigation Auto will
add
Dev
class Auto button
one we need the four button so we'll
copy it four
times and this will be my button
two this will be button three and this
will be button
four
outside this D we'll create another div
which go for the manual navigation
button so we'll name this
navigation make sure you spell it right
naviation
manual and inside
this B we'll add our radio buttons which
will
manual
we'll name it class manual button m
m we need the four button so we'll copy
it
times we change the label to radio two
radio 3 and Radio
4 so I think this will work enough so
here we have the
navigation okay we have a spelling
mistake
here
class and navigation man bu a class
here so let's recheck our code it's a
good practice recheck your code so that
you don't encounter any error so okay we
have a d class slider
here and inside the class slider we have
the four radio buttons radio one 2 3 4
we have added all
images inside the div tags with the name
slide okay we have created a navigation
Auto the four buttons and navigation
manual with the four buttons okay so
let's save the file and go back and
refresh it to see how it
looks okay we have to add some CSS here
so inside the
slides input you get the display to
done for do slide will set
the to
20% and we set the transition to 2
seconds now
we'll add the style for
image we'll set the WID to 800
pixels and we'll set the height to take
500
pixels okay so let's save the file and
let's go back to see how it looks right
now okay so you can see the images are
properly aligned here we have to style
our radio buttons for here so let's go
back to our
CSS now the code we going to write here
will for the manual slide navigation so
just add here commment manual slide
navigation so repeat for that we will
remember the
code so we'll add the
first class navigation
manual
we'll set the position to
Absolute then set the withd to 800
piels we not have the height here we'll
set the margin so the margin top will
be- 40
pix and display will keep it as
black and the justify
content will be
Center so let's just sa and go back to
the page to see how it looks right
now
okay the images are in the center you
can see now you cannot see a radio
buttons just as now we have to add some
color to it so that the radi buttons
will be visible so we go back to the
CSS add the manual
button we'll set the
border to sh three
pixels solid and red you can take any
color you want we'll set the padding to
5
pixels U we'll set the Border radius to
say 9
pixels we set the cursor to point
pointer so that when but the cursor will
look as a pointer and we'll set the
transition to 1
seconds
save go back and
refresh so now you can see the buttons
are here not properly spaced but yeah
they here so let's add the spacing and
everything
else so we'll set the manual
button
we'll set the
margin right to 40
pixels now it's time to add the whole
effect so for the
manual
button the H will be um save
background the
color
so just save the file and go back and
refresh yeah so you can see our manual
buttons are in place when you go over it
you can see the blue effect and when you
click nothing happens right now because
we don't have any JavaScript to response
to this dat button We'll add them in the
end first let's design these buttons so
this are for the manual
button now we'll add one code which will
be used when you want to select the
radio button by default so let's
understand how this radio buttons work
in this file so the radio buttons is use
where two or more options are identified
which are mutually exclusive and the
user has to do exactly one choice in
other words KCK on a non- selected radio
button will erase any other button that
is selected on the list previously RS
include lower cognitive load as they
permanently keep all the options visible
such that users can easily analyze them
R are also simpler to use for users who
have difficulty in making effective
Mouse
movements so we'll add hash radio do
check so the sign that we have added
here is no sing
combinator
it combines two sequence of simple
selectors having the same parent and the
second must come immediately after the
first so we'll add DOT
first and for this we'll set the margin
left
zero
okay so this will be Radio
One the label T we added in our manual
buttons we'll need four
such buttons so we'll copy this four
times one two three and four this will
be my for radio button
two and we'll set the margin left here
to minus 20
pixels for radio button 3 we set it to
say minus 40
pixels forget to add
pixels and for the last button we'll set
it to minus 60
pixels so all this scod is for the
manual navigation button now let's
design for automatic navigation
button so we'll open do
navigation
set the position to
Absolute then set the display to
flex we'll set the width to 800
pixels let's justy the content to
Center and we set the margin top
to set 40
pixels set 460
pixels
now so I add the St to navigation
Auto so
navigation
D then set the
border to same B that used
here shape ex solid
red make sure you keep this three solid
in same in both the navigation Auto and
navigation manual because if you change
the color here you will see the two
manual buttons there so for this example
let's change this to
Green so when you save and go back and
refresh
yeah you can see the two buttons here
this is a green and this is red so in
there two colors the both the buttons
will overlap will not look good so we'll
just keep it here
red set the pad into five
pixels
we'll set the Border radius to 9
pixels and we set the transition to 1
seconds
now same code AS here which I added for
checking of the radio buttons so we'll
just copy this whole
code and paste it here we have to twak
some things
here so the class was navigation. Auto
so we add
here navigation
Auto auto button
one we set here some
background so we'll delete this
code
um background let's
say any color
pink copy this Cod contr
C delete this whole thing V and just
change the radio buttons here this will
be radio button two
this will be
three and this will be
four now we have all the designing in
place now we have all the designing in
place let's go back to the code and
refresh
so now you'll see everything is in place
the background is black the images is
perfectly aligned we have this button so
let's
click so when you click you see the
images slides this is the four image
third second and first so your beau
image letterer is ready all that now is
left is to add the JavaScript code for
this image to function in automatic
manner so now we'll go back to this HTML
file and below this Dev
tag we open one script
tag and inside the script
tag we create
one variable named
counter we set it to one
open we create one function set
interval
yeah
for
so what do part specifically does is we
have created one variable named counter
and it will check against the ID that we
have created at Radio then the radio
button is checked and it encounters the
counter will be plus plus that counter
will increase by one so after the
counter has reached the
four so it we get back to the starting
point that is one so the whole point of
this code is to make the images slide in
in know Loop so just
save and go back now when you
refresh you'll see the images will move
after some
times that's 2
seconds now when the images reach the
last page it go back to the first
first you can also change it by clicking
here manually whenever we go through a
website or fill out a form we see that
there are certain ways of filling a form
right sometimes we use radio buttons to
select one option from a group of
options we use passwords emails
checkboxes and many more such things
while going through a form the input
element in HTML is responsible for
adding different input types to a web
page the type attribute within the input
element determines what the user will
input in that particular input area so
let's go through the syntax of input
element first and then we'll go through
the different input types we can get
from a user now the input element in
HTML specifies an input field for the
user to enter data so let's say if we
want the user to enter his username in
that case we'll need an input field
right so what we'll do is we'll write
here inside the form tag we have the
form tag already present here so we'll
write here first let's say first name
fine now we are going to use the input
element the input element in HTML is an
empty element so we don't need any
closing tag for that save the program
and here you can see on the browser that
we have this input field present we can
write anything over here inside this
input field so you can see we are able
to write anything over
here now let's create a small form form
and you guys will be able to understand
the concept of type attribute in the
input element we'll create a form
wherein we'll include different types of
input areas for the user so first of all
we'll write
here first name and input so we already
have this written on a program we use
the label here as first name however we
use the label tag for this task but
right now I don't want you guys to get
confused so we'll keep it like this only
here we have used the label name as
first name so the type attribute will
hold the value as text over here anytime
we want the user to input values like
name or any sort of text value we use
the type attributes as text so what
we'll do is we'll move to our input
element and we'll write over here type
type is going to be text first fine save
the program and you'll see nothing
happening over here as of now you won't
find any difference and this is the
default value of the type attribute as
well so we can write anything over here
like we can write any text value or we
can write numbers here as well so it's
making no difference over here on the
browser now the difference we'll see
when we'll go through other input types
so let's move ahead and we'll now go
through the button type first or we can
say the submit button first so what
we'll do is we'll create a submit button
first fine so we'll write over here we
are going to use the break tag for two
times and we are going to write here
input type is going to be submit for a
submit button and we'll write over here
value
as submit fine now save the program and
you can see the submit button present
over here on the browser so this submit
button generally submits the form like
if you're are writing anything over here
like we writing any first name submit it
and you can see the page gets refreshed
and there's no other value now because
the submit button is on work and it
submits the form fine now similar to a
submit button there's one more input
type that also creates a button but the
task is a bit different the value of the
type attribute as reset we'll do some
important things for us for example if
we write here the same thing so we are
going to use the input tag again and
here we'll write type as reset and let's
give the value
as reset once again fine close the input
element and save the program so here you
can see we have this reset button
present over here now write something
over here like any value or any name
click on reset and you can see the value
of that particular field gets reset fine
are done with the buttons now the next
input type we are going to see is the
password so passwords are confidential
right so we need something which can
hide the user's password HTML has an
input type as password so let's go
through it what we'll do is We'll add a
label over here like we'll write your
password first let the user know what he
or she needs to do so then we'll write
here input type as password fine now
save the program and here you can see we
have another input box over here so
let's do one thing let's use the break
tag here to keep the form neat and clear
so here you can see we have password
over here if we try to write anything
over here you can see that particular
text or number whatever we are using in
password is encoded so we can write
write any name here and here we have the
password click on submit and here you
can see it says check your password so
there's an error over here so you can
see the password Here is encoded and
HTML provides us with this feature
moving ahead the email input type this
type of input is used for emails it
validates the email address whenever the
user clicks on the submit button for
example we'll write here email so we are
going to create another input field
we'll use the input tag or input element
we'll write here Type S email fine save
the program and here you can see we have
another input box over here we'll copy
these break text from here and we'll
past then save it and here you can see
it looks fine now now write an email
over here or just try to write a single
word so let's say we are writing over
here Ram we'll provide the first name as
well so we'll write here Ram then we'll
write here here any password let's say
fine so click on submit and here you can
see it says please include an at theate
sign in the email address Ram is missing
an at theate so we'll include at theate
over here click on submit again and here
you can see please enter a part
following at theate so it will not allow
the user to move ahead until the user
enters a correct email ID so let's say
we are writing over here at the
gmail.com submitted and here you can see
the form gets
submitted fine we have been through some
important inputs till now all of them we
discuss till now are commonly used in
every form we create now we'll discuss
radio buttons so radio buttons allow the
user to choose a single option from a
number of options available for example
what we'll do is we'll go through the
example directly so we'll write over
here let's
say
input type is equals
to radio and then we'll write over
here value fine value is going to be
let's say HTML and here we'll write
HTML okay so here we are we have our
first radio Buton so we'll write here
once again input type is equal
to radio so we have done a mistake over
here we'll write over here value again
value is going to be CSS and we'll write
CSS here as well now save it and here
you can see we have two options HTML and
CSS let's do one thing let's include one
more over here so we'll write here input
type is equals to radio fine then we'll
write here value and let's say value is
going to be
JavaScript and save it and here you can
see we have three radio buttons present
over here we are going to use The Brak
tag here as well and here you can see we
have three radio buttons HTML CSS and
JavaScript now if you guys remember we
already said that we can choose any one
option out of all the available options
right so we are not able to do it here
because of the name attribute so for
that we have to include the name
attribute here so let's say we are
writing over here name as
language
for each of them so let's try here name
as L save it now and now try to click on
these radio buttons and you can see we
are able to select only one out of all
the available options we have fine so
the name attribute plays a vital role
while using radio buttons in an HTML
form checkboxes also do similar tasks
but we can select more than one option
at a time with checkboxes so what we'll
do is we'll use checkboxes as well so
let's say we are using the label tag
over here we'll write here label and
let's say we are writing over here
choose
your V fine now we'll move ahead and
we'll write over here we'll use the
break tag first and we'll write over
here let's
say input type is equal to checkbox and
then we have write here name name is
let's say vehicle
one and that's it so let's use the value
attribute as well so value we are going
to write here bike fine so we'll write
bike over here then we'll use
input type is equals to checkbox then
we'll again
mention name here so we'll write your
name
as vehicle so let's do one thing we'll
write here vehicle again and we'll write
your
value car and we have to mention car
here as
well do it one more time we'll write
here
type type is going to be checkbox again
and name is going to
be vehicle and value is going to be
let's say
scooter fine so we'll write scooter over
here and save it now so here you can see
we have three different options for
checkboxes what we'll do
is we'll put the brake tag over here
save it now and here you can see now we
have b car and scooter although the name
attribute in this case holds the same
value for all the three checkboxes it
has vehicle for all of them so but still
we can choose you can see more than one
option at time so this is the difference
between checkboxes and radio buttons in
HTML the next input type we are going to
use is the date type this type is mainly
used for date of birth but you can use
it for other specific dates as well it
allows the user to select a specific
date along with the month and year so
what we have to do is we have to write
here let's write it over here let's
create an input box for date of birth
for of the user so we'll write over here
input type as date fine save it and here
you can see we have this date of birth
input box present over here we can
choose date from this calendar so we can
use any month or we can say any year as
well so let's say the date is 17
February 2016 we can choose the date
from this calendar over here so HTML
gives us
this feature of choosing date and and if
you want to select time as well so then
we have to write here date time local
fine save it and here you can see now we
are able to select date along with the
time so you can see we can choose time
as well along with the date so here you
can see the date is 57 2022 which is 5th
of July 2022 and the time is 10:43 so it
follows 24hour format in case of time
now the next type we are going to
discuss is numbers this input type
describes a numeric input for the user
it does not allow the user to input any
value other than numbers so what we'll
do is we'll go through the syntax
directly we'll write it over here after
the break tag let's say we are writing
phone
number and for this we are writing input
type is equals to number and that's it
save it and here you can see we have
this option of one number so let's make
it a bit cleaner and now we'll try to
write any text over here so you can see
we are not able to write any text now
we'll try to write numbers and here you
can see it allows us to put numbers
inside this particular input box we are
not able to print text over here so this
is why the input type as number is used
for in HTML the last input type we'll
discuss is the file type sometimes we
need to upload a file while filling out
a form like a CV or something in HTML we
can use the input type as file for this
task so what we'll do is we'll take you
through the Syntax for this as well so
we'll write over here
select file and we'll
write
input type is equals to file fine save
the program and here you can see we have
this choose file option present here on
the browser we can use it to choose a
file from our system so this is how the
file attribute or you can say file input
type Works in HTML now apart from all
these input types we have discussed we
have some more input types present in
HTML like range week month and many more
we can't discuss all of them in a single
video but whenever we'll go through any
of them we'll definitely take a look at
each of the input types we use so HTML
is not only used for creating the
structure of a web page anymore but it
also provides interactivity to a web
page up to some extent so I hope you
guys will learn something from this HTML
tutorial back friends so just like my
previous example this time I would like
to also introduce you the another very
interesting application which is called
navigation look when we talk about HTML
based development so in HTML based
development navigation is very important
where you have a called multiple Pages
attached to so that when you click on
this page or click on any hyperlink it
will take you to the new page now so
that you can move back and forth so this
navigation is very essential part of any
web development so that you can offer
the navigation so this simple
application of HTML we would like to
start from scratch so let's go and
create a new folder now and give the
name called
navigation and inside this navigation we
want to create some new pages
so here I'm going to create
index
HTML the CSS name will be app. CSS and
along with this we would like to also
create some new folder inside this I'll
keep all the navigation files inside
this so I can save pages inside this
Pages let me have total number of three
pages with me one is called
about
HTML then we
create
contact HTML then we create one more
that is called services.
HTML do HTML so these three links we
will create it one by one but first
let's start with the
index.html so what's there in my
index.html file so first thing I would
like to start with my same HTML syntax
here well this is my basic construct so
I will start with my link Ariel from
here so that I can have my style Chet
with me link Arial to style Chet hfal to
app do CSS though I have not written
anything but I just left it as a blank
in my body tag I would start with the
navigation so HTML 5 brought you some
new tags known as called a nav tag which
is once
again won't change anything drastically
in your browser however they are called
semantics which will help you for the
SEO that stand for search engine
optimization so I'll start with my nav
inside my nav I will start with my
div div I'll say navigation bar so but
before that I say class equal
to
heading there is my T tag and inside my
T tag I want to bring my heading so I
say H4
and I
say navigation R and after the div tag I
will start with my Ur tag which is the
unordered list inside my unordered list
I can say Li that stand for list items
and I can offer lot many links inside
this so you will I just offer the class
equal
to nav
hyphen links and inside this my ER right
tag I say a which is the anchor
tag
so a link HF equal
to now here I offer the name I say
index HTM and uh that's it and this will
be by default active so we say class
equal
to
active a
class equal to active and H equal to
index. HTML file and here we offer
home for homepage I'll copy this
line and paste it for other three
URLs so here the active won't be there
instead we say HF equal to the location
called
Pages under this page es we say
about about. HTML and here we say
about okay copy
this paste it and a part of this about
we always say services. HTML and here we
say
Services insert this we
offer contact
contact okay and once the N tag is over
I will offer the
d d
CL equal to just give the name body
hyphen text I just say H1 tag inser this
and this is the
homepage
that's it so that's my homepage which is
ready with me and along with this
whichever the other pages are also
available those pages I also want to use
so first of all let me check how this
page looks like
in well it looks like in pretty basic
page so once this page is ready what I
will do is here I copy the
content and paste it it here and above
and let's see what's there in my above
see few things will change number one
here this app.
CSS no here we have to just
use dot dot there's an app.css for me so
you have to offer some title too so
after this link are here you
offer title this title I can
say
about okay so rest everything is fine so
H4 navigation bar n links here I have to
offer the links for my base HTML page so
when I talk about index. HTML file
okay it won't come
so index HT F so I won't say it is an
active anymore I just remove this
line class equal to active it's just an
normal HF but about would be active in
this case so
a class equal to
active h this Services
contact is as usual same but I would not
be having any Pages
anymore because we are in the same
location that's why and here I say this
is
a about this is about
page about page so that's it I'll go
back and check F all fine home is active
right now about you can see it is an
about page right now the about page is
just appear as it is same contents are
more or less looks like and same that is
why you are able to see now just like
that I will just go back and copy the
others now here app CSS navigation bar
active
it is in contact so make contact as an
active so text file remain same this
is contact
page so that's how it is and uh it will
say about my other properties which is
my services me copy
sorry copy this
contact and
here I'll be activating
my service in this case
so class equal to active I remove it
from
here make it available here this
is service page navigation index pages
about active yeah all looks good heading
about okay here I
change
service there I change
to content so looks fine let's
see okay service contact
about
so for about we need to check where we
need to
go so we have got pages about HTML pages
also there
so all there so we would like to see how
the about page will be activated here
index.html file also contains and about
so
here
I
refresh
well call index. HTM
page talk about called
about where is about page
now
services so like this it is happening
for
you okay so that's how exactly my thing
is so so they're all good and
uh Services contact home all good well
my page is now ready and going forward
we would like to beautify my pages by
offering the CSS well let's get started
with our CSS file so in my CSS file I
will start with my common properties
which is
margin I'm saying 0 pixel followed by
padding I'm making it a zero pixel
again again we want box
sizing this I say
border hyphen
box okay well going forward this is my
standard settings for all different type
of properties now I want the other
properties to be get introduced that is
called box body text
Dot box body
hyphen
text inside this body text I said
display
Flex now when I see where the body text
is available go to my text. HTML
file body text is available here div
class so here in my CSS file I can say
body text display Flex I say font
family
font family I can give
anything just giving called mod sh
it
f these two we are offering it later on
align
items ANL item
Center followed by justify
content and we is
Center then margin
[Music]
top 250
pixels these are the properties are
there followed by okay first let's check
what is an
effect here see it looks better now now
we would like to go ahead with the NV I
already have this NV with me NV display
Flex then justify
content space
around followed by align
item align items I want to make
Center and then we want to say Min
height so we say Min hyphen
okay so Min height we are giving 8
VH followed by background
color just set teal same color and uh
same font family I just copy this form
trly and make it available here well
let's
check there we go so Navar looks awesome
but I still feel the links needs to be
justified we want to make it even more
better but before that I offer the nav
links so here I
say nav links so do
nav hyphen
links this nav links will have
display
Flex
display flex and then justify contain
that I want to make it space around
again followed by
width
[Music]
so width so width would be
30% perfect and now NV link Li dot NV
links
Li
this list
style none
let's see how it is
changing there we go that it looks
really nice so nav links are ready and
uh I want to make it a heading heading I
want to make it more organized so let's
see about a heading so here I say
dot heading and uh inside this heading I
say
color which is white
followed by text
transform text text transform
uppercase followed by letter
spacing this letter spacing will be 5
pixels and followed by last font size
and this font size is just 20
pixel that's it and let's see how is
difference here here awesome so this
navigation bar is now looking great and
uh it is giving me all the basic
operation whichever we have expected now
this nav links whichever we have created
okay they are working fine but I just
want to make it even more beautiful and
how I can make it more beautiful to make
it I would like to go ahead with the nav
links
again
dot nav Links of type anchor tag now I
would like to activate my anchor tag by
making it
color
white okay followed by text
decoration text decoration
none and uh followed by letter
spacing letter spacing three
pixels and then font
fit font we
bold and uh font
size 14
pixels and
padding 14
pixels and 16
pixels both the
options that's it and uh followed by we
want to use the nvx when I will over it
so the color should change so we are
saying dot nav links and here with
Li followed by a
do active when the anchor tag is active
then in that case I want to change the
background
color to Lights light C green I can
say
lights
so we have this option called light C
green
this one light that looks beautiful and
followed by saying I copy
this and this active so nav links la.
active background color we are using but
if it is not active then in that case
what you will use so I can just change a
small thing here I've changed this
color uh now let me try to copy this
first I tell you about what I want copy
this and I paste it as usual here what I
see is when it is an active Okay when it
is an active I will change the color
to I think the spelling is wrong active
it should
be active background color I want to
change it to Green so for that we just
using the color
hash this a green color
when it is an active and when this is
not active so we can just say a colon
active which you've used now now La
colon active or we can say a colon h a
colon
over a colon over and here we say colum
not
DOT active that's it let's see how it
works awesome this looks beautiful home
home is active right now is say it is on
a hom page now you can see it is an
about page it is service page it is a
Conta now you can see it looks even more
awesome in the most basic definition a
form is something we use to take the
user's data for example if the user
wants to register on a website then they
have to give us their names email and
some more info about them a form takes
input from the user and then posts it
into the backend application for further
processing and other stuff like
validation and all the HTML form tag is
used to create a form it's quite simple
to create a form in HTML we'll move to
the programming part directly and create
a simple form to start with so the first
and foremost part is that we need to use
the form tag to create a form so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body of a
program and we'll write here form so
this is the form tag in HTML save the
program and you can see here nothing
happened on the browser so this form tag
created an area for a form it basically
worked like the div tag we used in the
previous videos now to include data in a
form we need text areas or we can say
input boxes in our form there are
various form elements available like
text field text area Fields drop down
menus radio buttons checkboxes Etc so
let's start using them in the form here
first of all we'll create a text box for
the user name for that what we have to
do is we have to write here inside the
form tag so we'll write here first name
and then we have to write here input so
input is another tag so we have to write
here
input and then we have to use the type
attribute so the type is going to be
text for this text box and we'll write
here name name is going to
be first name
fine now save this and you can see here
we have an input box for the first name
the same code we can use for the last
name as well what we have to do is we
have to copy it from
here we have to paste it here so we'll
use the BR tag before using it again now
we have to change first here with last
we will write here last and in name as
well we'll
write last fine so we have this last
name over here save it and you can see
we have first name and last name we have
two different text boxes present over
here we'll use the BR tag one more time
save it now and you can see it clearly
now right so here we are done with the
first text box of us now this input tag
over here is used to create these text
box and the name refers to the text
Box's name fine another thing we can do
here is we can write
here placeholder and inside placeholder
we can write something let's say we are
writing over here first name and you can
see first name over here it's permanent
until we write something inside the Box
the placeholder value will appear on the
text box same thing we can do here as
well we have to write here
placeholder so we have placeholder for
last name as well save it now and you
can see the value of placeholder over
here the moment we start writing
something over here you can see the
placeholder value is not here anymore
fine if getting your learning started is
half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know
more now there are different types of
form controls that we can use to collect
data using HTML form they are text input
controls we can use checkboxes radio
buttons we can use select box controls
and we can also use file select boxes so
we can use radio buttons in our form for
that what we need to do is we need to
change the type in our form so that's
the only thing that will change no
matter what controls we are using so
what we have to do is we have to write
here let's say we are using Break Tag
first so we'll use two Brak tags over
here in order to make the the whole web
page clear and easily understandable for
you guys so next thing we'll do is we'll
write
here gender so let's write here gender
then we'll use Break Tag again and after
this we'll
write
input type is equals to radio and we can
write here name name is going to be
let's say male and the value for this is
going to be male again
fine we can use the value attribute here
as well so we'll use it later now the
next thing we'll do is we'll write
here input again we'll add another
gender so let's say we have type here
as radio again and then we have name
as female and we'll write
here so save it now and you can see two
radio buttons over here we can check
them in and you can see we have radio
buttons working totally fine we can use
these values later on as well similarly
we can use checkboxes as well in our
form we'll see how in the upcoming video
where we'll create something like a
login or a sign up form using HTML only
so there are three different types of
text inputs used on forms we can use
single line text input controls so this
control is used for items that require
only one line of user input such as
search boxes or names they are created
in HTML using the input tag we discussed
them till now so these all are the
example of single line text input
controls which we discussed till now the
next are password input controls this is
also a single line text input but it
masks the character as soon as a user
enters it they are also created using
the HTML input tag so the syntax goes
like this we have to write here after
this so we'll use the BR Tex again over
here and now we'll write
here input so before that let's
write password so this password is going
to be the user password for a website
for login or maybe for sign in so this
is the password so we'll write here
input type is equals to password and
then we'll write here name
as password fine save it now and you can
see pass password written over here with
a text box fine write inside here will
get masked so if we write anything over
here you can see it in the form of
password it will get masked as soon as
we enter it so this is done to make the
password a
secret now we can also set the maximum
length of a password using the max
length attribute so what we have to do
is we have to write here max
length and max length is going to be
let's
say8 fine save the program and now if we
write something over here you can
see and now we are not able to use more
than eight characters inside this
particular text box right because we
have defined the max length as eight and
it will allow only eight characters
inside the text box fine the last one we
have are multi-line text input controls
this is used when the user is required
to give details that may be longer than
a single sentence so multi-line input
controls are created using html text
area tag the Syntax for a multi-line
input is simple we have to write here
after this so we'll use the BR te again
for two times and then we'll write here
let's say description fine so after
description we'll
use the BR tag to make it more clear and
then we'll write here text area so this
is the tag and then we have to Define
rows and columns here so rows are going
to be five and we'll write here calls so
these two are the attributes we'll write
here 50 this basically we are defining
the area acquired by this text area fine
then we'll write your
name and we'll write here
description then we'll write something
over here so let's say we'll write over
here enter
description
here and that's it save the program and
you can see we have a text area present
over here it's bigger in size than the
normal text boxes we had earlier so what
we can do is we can remove it from here
and we can use the placeholder attribute
inside the text area tag to write such
thing
fine the last important thing in a form
is the submit button so this button is
used to submit the form form data we can
either use the input tag or the button
tag for a submit button fine so let's
use the input tag for creating a button
first what we'll do is we'll write here
after
this we'll write here the Break Tag and
then we'll
write input type is equals to button and
then we have value is equals to submit
fine save the program and you can see
the button over here on the browser so
here's the
button we can further make this button
work with the help of JavaScript but we
are creating the layout only for now so
let it be this way only the next method
we can use for creating a button is by
using the button tag so what we have to
do is we have to write here just use the
BR tag once and write here button so
this is the tag and write here the name
of button fine so we'll write here
submit save the program and you can see
here another button fine so here's the
button you can see both the buttons are
exactly same no difference between the
buttons just a quick info for you if you

whenever we go through the login or sign
up portal of any website we see that on
the login page we use credentials like
ID and password sign up page on the
other hand refers to the form we need to
fill in order to be a part of that
particular website so what we'll do is
we'll create a login page and a sign up
page in today's video and we'll see what
we can learn from this video so without
wasting any more time let's move on to
the programming part directly we'll
start with the login page first so first
of all here we are in the HTML file
we'll start using the form tag but
before that we are going to provide a
heading for this login page so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body Tab
and we'll write here H1 so H1 stands for
heading one I hope you guys already know
this particular element so what we'll do
is we'll write here login form fine so
we have written login form over here
save it and you can see we have login
form return on the browser the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to style it a bit using the style
attribute we have been through it
already so we'll write Here style now
inside style what we'll do is we'll
align this text at the center of our web
page so we'll write here text align and
we'll text align it to the center fine
so here we are we are done with text
aligning save it now and you can see it
moving in the browser so it's in the
middle of the web page now you can see
it over here clearly the login form is
present at the center of a whole web
page fine now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to use the
form tag over here fine so we'll write
here form and this is a form tag so we
are going to create the form inside this
particular tag only now let's style this
as so what we'll do is we'll write here
Style again the style attribute comes
into play so we are going to use the
Border attribute now we are going to
keep the Border three pixel thick solid
in nature and let's use this particular
color so we'll write here fub1 F1 F1 so
so this is white color basically so here
you can see it's not completely white
off white or a bit grayish we can say so
here you can see the form body so I hope
this is visible for you guys so the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to use a container now so what we'll do
for that we'll use the div tag we'll
style it and then we'll move on further
so we'll write here div now inside D we
are going to use the style attribute
again obviously so we are going to
provide padding over here now we'll
write here 25 pixels so what is padding
you guys repeat so what is padding you
guys might be wondering about it padding
provides the space between the border
and the content of an element fine so
the space between the border of that
element and the content is known as
padding so padding is going to be 25
pixel for all the sides so pedding is
basically four S from top right bottom
and left fine so we can provide all the
values or we can provide a single value
for all fine so here padding is 25 pixel
now we are going to set background color
for this and the background color is
going to be let's say light blue fine
save it now and here you can see we have
a container which has a border of gray
color and the background color
is sky blue or we can say light blue
fine now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to start start
creating
a form so here we are inside the div tag
so you can see we have the form tag
first and inside the form we have a
particular division now fine so what
we'll do now is we are going to create a
login form so we'll use the label tag so
label tag stands for the label of any
form so you will see it over here so
we'll write here user
name and we'll
put colon over save it now and and here
you can see we have username present
inside the container or we can say
inside the form fine so let's put a
space over here save it now and now I
guess it looks
fine the next thing we are going to do
is we are going to create a text box now
so for that we are going to use the
input tag so we'll write input type is
equals to text for this username and
then we'll write here placeholder
placeholder will write
enter username fine now after this we
are going to write here name name is
going to be let's
say username again and then we'll write
here let's say required so required is
another attribute we have so what will
happen now is if we leave this box empty
and if we don't write anything over here
and if we try to submit a login form
then a popup will appear which says
credentials required or something like
that only so HTML provides us with this
feature so save it now and here you can
see we have a label username and a text
box which says enter username fine
similarly we'll create a label for
password and text box for password fine
so we'll write here label again and
we'll write here
password save it now and here you can
see we have a label for password as well
now what we'll do is we'll write
here again we are going to use the input
tag so we'll write here input type is
equals to password you guys are already
aware of this type and then we'll write
your placeholder and we'll write here
enter password fine so we'll write here
enter password then we have the name for
password we'll write here name is
equals to password and then we'll write
here a required again fine save it now
and here you can see we have another
text
box now so let me make it a
little more here for you guys so here we
are done with the username and the
password the next thing we need is the
submit button now fine so we'll write
here button type is going to
be submit or we can use the input tag as
well as we did in the last video so
we'll write
here login fine so this is the button
name save it now and here you can see we
have the login Button as well now what
we are going to do is we are going to
create a checkbox or we can say a
remember me function fine so for that
what we'll do
is we are again going to use the input
tag for that so we'll write here input
then we'll write here type type is
equals to
checkbox and then we'll write here after
this checked checked is a property again
so we'll write
here check as checked so then we'll
write
here remember me fine save it now and
here you can see we have a check box and
a remember me option fine the next thing
we are going to do is we are going to
create another button the cancel button
fine so we'll write here button button
and type is going to be button again
then we'll write
here id id is going to be let's
say cancel button why we are using this
ID because we need this ID in the CSS
part we'll see it later then we'll write
here the name of button is cancel
fine save it now and here you can see we
have a cancel button as well now the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to put some links over here so for
that we are going to use the anchor tag
again we'll write here a hre hre is
going to be let's say hash because we
are going to write here forgot password
so we'll write
here forgot
password or we can write here forget
password
fine save it now and here you can see we
have a link present over here now what
we are going to do is we are going to
use a break over here and then we'll add
another link for the sign up page fine
so we'll write here a hre again
reference is going to be sign in. HTML
so this is going to be the signin file
or the HTML file for the signup page
then we'll write
here register fine save it now and here
you can see register written over here
on the browser so we are already done
with the login form the next thing we
are going to do is we are going to use
CSS for that so we are almost done with
the HTML part for this login page all of
you guys are well aware of the style
attribute till now right this attribute
is used to change the style of any
particular element let me tell you guys
another way of using this style letter
attribute in HTML we can use all these
styling properties inside the style tag
as well for that what we need to do is
we need to move to the Head section of a
HTML file and we have to write Here
style fine so here we are we are here
with the style tag so what we are going
to do is we are going to style a HTML
document inside this style tag
on
fine what we'll do here is we'll write
here body first fine so what we are
doing here is we are styling the body
tag the whole body tag now fine so what
we'll do is we'll use the font family
first so we'll change the font family
we'll write
here okay we are going to use Gil sense
we are going to use this then we'll
write here the background color so we'll
change the background color of this
pitch we'll write here RGB the RGB
values are we have to write it in small
letters the RGB values are 13 4 comma
132 comma
133 fine we are done with it save it and
here you can see the change so the RGB
values are not working because we have
written RBG over here instead of RGB
save it now and here you can see the
background color is green now fine so it
looks nice now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to style the
button so the button tag we have used
here you can see it over here we have
used the button tag for cancel button
and for submit button fine or we can
save for login but so we are going to
style both of them at once so we'll
write here button we'll write here the
tag name basically so button is the tag
name now we'll change the background
color of this button which is going to
be like say
h150 5 FM so guys I'm already aware of
these colors and you can do what we did
in the background color video or you can
change the background color according to
you you can use the color name you can
use the Hax values or the RGB values the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to provide here the width width is
going to be 100% of the whole tag fine
then we'll write here color color is
going to change the font color of this
button so we'll WR write here RGB
again and we are going to write here 248
comma 248 comma 248 fine let's see what
it is so here you can see the login and
cancel button are changed now so the
font color is white the button color is
blue and next thing we are going to do
is we are going to write here padding
padding again is going to be 15 pixels
for all the sides then we'll write here
margin fine so we'll write here margin
margin is going to be 10 pixel
and 0 pixel fine so what is margin guys
margin provides the space between the
border and the outer element there's a
difference between padding and margin
padding provides the space between the
border and the content of element so
here in this case this is the content
and this is
the pad fine margin on the other hand
refers to this space between this
element and the next element fine so
margin as 10 and 0er pixel means 10
pixel from top and bottom and zero pixel
from left and right fine the next thing
we are going to do here is we are going
to write here B fine so border will
Define as
none save it and you can see the button
here now the next thing or the last
thing we are going to write here is we
are going to change the cursor to
pointer on taking over these buttons you
can see the cursor change now
fine the next thing we are going to do
is we are going to style the
input tags so we'll write here
input and we are going to style it so
we'll write here type is equals
to we have used a lot
of put tags right so we'll write it type
is equals to text and then again we are
going to write here
input then we'll write here type is
equals
to password fine so we have two input
tags for username and for password so we
are going to style them at once side by
side we are going to style them so the
next thing we are going to write here is
we are going to set the width as 100%
and then we'll write here margin again
so we'll write here margin as 8
pixels and zero pixels fine save it now
and here you can see the login form is
looking more and here you can see the
login form looks much better now the
next thing we are going to do here is we
are going to define the padding as well
pedding is going to be 12 pixel and 20
pixel fine
then we'll write here display display
as inline block and we have border over
here border is going to be 2
pixel solid in nature and we are going
to define the RGB value again so RGB is
going to be
109 for green we
have eight and for blue we
have
and for blue here we have let's say
240 and save it now and here you can see
the borders over here now what we are
going to do is we are going to remove
pixel from here and here you can see we
have the input boxes or we can say the
text boxes working totally fine now what
we are going to do last is we are going
to write
here box sizing you can see these boxes
going out of a so we'll write your box
sizing
as border box save it now and here you
can see the login form is almost done
fine so let me close it
once now the next thing we are going to
style is the button tag again so we'll
write here button and then we'll write
here a property it totally depends upon
us if we are going to use this
Properties or not so we have to remove
from here we have to write your hover
and on hovering the opacity will change
so the opacity will change to 0.7 now
look it carefully and here you can see
when we take our mouse cursor over any
button there's no change right now save
the program try to take the mouse cursor
again you can see it's still not working
as of
now have to remove this and here you can
see now it's working totally fine on
taking the mouse cursor over any button
it HS now the opacity will change fine
the last thing we have to do is we have
to style the cancel button so we are
going to use the ID over here so here
you can see in the HTML part of cancel
button so we have used the ID as cancel
button over here so we are going to use
this ID to style this particular button
fine we'll write here inside this cancel
button width width is going to be Auto
then we have padding ping is going to be
10 pixel and 18 pixel for top bottom and
for left right fine then we have the
margin as well and margin is going to be
10 pixel for top bottom and five pixel
for Left Right save it now and here you
can see the login form is completely
done fine now that we are done with the
styling part let's check the final
output save the program and you can see
here
so here you can see on the browser we
have this basic login form it looks fine
right we can make it more attractive but
we need CSS for that with HTML we can do
this only so let's move ahead and we'll
now create the registration form or the
sign up page so let's move ahead to
another HTML file so here we are in the
HTML file so this file is for sign up
page here you can see the title for sign
up so we'll remove this form tag from
here it's a mistake save it now now and
now what we are going to do is we are
going to open it with live server again
so here you can see this HTML file has
no output as of so let's create the sign
up form now if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scaleup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so what we'll
do first is we are going to write here
the style tag and we'll finish it later
on now move mov to the body part what
we'll do is we'll style the body first
so we'll use the style attribute now we
are going to define the font family here
font family is going to be this one
again let's say we have used this in the
sign up form or we can say the login
form as well so the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to change
the background color for this whole body
now what we are doing here is we'll
write here
RGB then we'll Define the values as 134
comma 132 2 comma 133 the same one from
the previous login form save it now and
here you can see the change in the
background color of the whole body tag
fine next up what we'll do here is we
are going to use the H1 tag
again we'll style it as well so we'll
write a style we are going to align it
to the center we'll write a text
align and we'll write here text align at
the
Center fine so here we are then we'll
write
here registration
form save it now and here you can see we
have registration form written at the
center of a web page fine next thing we
have to include a lot of text boxes and
a lot of labels in this particular
registration form because for login form
we need only two text boxes or two
labels right the username and the
password but the sign up form is
different we need a lot of information
about the user so for that we are going
to use a lot of input tags first thing
we are going to do is we are going to
use a break over here then we'll use the
form
tag and that's it inside the form tag we
are going to change the style over here
only so we'll write Here style and we
are going to use the border border is
going to be three pix
[Music]
solid in color and or we can say solid
in nature and off-white or gray in color
fine so here you can see the border on
the
browser now what we are going to do next
is we are going to use the div tag
again so we'll write here
div here we have the div tag so let's
style this div tag over here only we are
going to use the style attribute for
that we are going to define the padding
padding is going to be be 25 pixel for
this as well background color we are
going to use light blue save it now and
here you can see the container on the
browser so it's similar to the login one
now what we are going to do is we are
going to use label first so we'll write
here label then we have the label
as first
name and save it you can see we have our
first level over over
here the next thing we need is the input
area or the text box for this first name
so we'll write here
input type is equals to text then we
have name name is going to
be first name then we have size or we
can say the length so we'll write here
here max length max length let's define
it as
15 and we are done with the first text
box use the break tag again over here
and that's it so we are done with first
name similarly we have to mention the
middle name last name as well so let's
define them here so we'll write here
label
again this time we have the label
for middle name
and that's it save it and here you can
see we have middle name written over
here we'll copy this piece of code or we
can say the input tag from here we'll
change the name to last name and save it
here you can see we have another text
box present over here fine so one thing
we forgot to mention here is the
placeholder so we can write here
placeholder enter
first name fine save it now and here you
can see the placeholder on the browser
so we'll copy it from here we'll paste
it here we'll mention for last name or
for middle name as well save it now and
here you can see something is wrong save
it
again and there's something wrong
fine hey so there's a problem with the
live server so what we'll do is we'll
open it again with live server and here
you can see it's not working as of
now okay the Break Tag we
have something wrong over here let me
check
guys okay we forgot to mention this over
here save it now and it's still not
working with live server again and it's
working now
fine so it's working as of now we'll do
the same thing
for last name as well so we'll copy this
piece of code from here we'll paste it
here we'll change middle to last
everywhere so we'll write enter last
name over here then we have name as last
name and we have to write here enter
last name or we can say last name over
here save it now and here you can see we
have another text box and another label
present over here for last name as well
now what we are going to do is we are
going to select or we can say we are
going to use options or we have to
mention them over here so for that we'll
write
here label so we are going to mention
course over here and for course we are
going to provide drop- down menus so for
that what we need to do is we need to
use the select tag in HTM so inside the
select tag we have to provide options
options let's say the value of option is
first value is going to be course and
then we have to write here course it is
going to be a drop- down list so we have
to mention a lot of options over here so
we'll write your option
again and then we'll write here
value value is going to be
BCA then we have to write here BCA save
it now and here you can see we have
course over here so here you can see
till now it has two values let's add
some more values over here for options
or we can say let's add some more
options over here we'll add let's say
three four more options we'll write here
BBA instead of BCA for this then we have
let's
say
BTE and we'll change the value over here
as well we'll write here btec then we
have MBA as well let's say so we'll
write here
MBA then finally we have let's say mtech
as well so we'll write here
mtech save it now and here you can see
if we click on this code you can see we
have different options available we have
BCA BBA btech MBA and mte so the select
tag or we can say the option tag and
select tag both are used for drop- down
menus so here is a drop down menu so we
have to put a colum over here save it
now and I guess it looks fine
now so the next thing we need to do is
we need to use the radio buttons for
gender fine so what we are going to do
is we are going going to
use the break
tag and then we'll write
here gender so gender is going to be the
label so we have to put it inside label
tag so we'll write here
label and we have to put gender inside
fine save it now and here you can see we
have gender present over
here now what we are going to do is we
are going to put a break again over here
and then we have to use the input tag so
we'll write input type is equals
to radio for radio buttons when then we
have to write your name name is going to
be male and the first value is going to
be male fine then we have to put the BR
tag

save it now and here you can see we have
three radio buttons over here for gender
we have male female and other fine now
next thing we have to include is we have
to include the phone number for phone
number we need two input boxes one for
the country code and the another one for
phone number fine so we need to write
here and we'll put another break over
here then after this break we need the
label for four fine so so we'll write
your
phone and after phone we have to write
here
input type is equals to text for phone
number then we'll write here name name
is going to
be country
code then we have to write here the
value as well value is going to be + 91
this is the country code of India then
we'll write
here max length max length is going to
be three so that the user cannot write
anything inside here fine save it now
and here you can see we have phone as
label and we have a text box if we try
to write anything you can see we are not
able to
write so what we'll do next is We'll add
another input box or we can see the text
box for phone number so we'll copy it
from
here will paste it again we are going to
use the name as phone for phone
number the value is going to
be none so we'll remove value from here
and then what we'll do is we'll change
the max length to 10 digits fine save it
now and here you can see we have another
text box over here so what we'll do is
we'll change the type here so you can
see we are able to write
characters here as well what we'll do is
we'll change the type as number fine
save it now and now you'll be able to
see that we are not able to write any
character over here but we are able to
write a number fine so here
is the text box for phone number fine so
we are going to use the break tag again
so we'll write here
break let's use it twice
and after this Break Tag what we need is
the address so we'll write
here label label is going to be
address so we have to write here address
we have to put a column over here and
after this address we have to put the
Break Tag and a text area so we are not
going to use this text box for this now
we are going to use the text area
attribute so we'll write here text area
text area columns are going to be 80 for
this area and rows is five
fine value is going to
be let's say address over
here and we are almost done so save it
now and here you can see on the browser
we have a text area for address fine so
what we need to do next is we need email
we need password and retype password we
need three more options right so let's
start with email so what we are going to
do is we are going to use break over
here twice so that it will be clear for
you guys to see now what we'll do is
we'll write
here inside label we'll write
email so we have the label as email then
we'll write
here
input type is equals to email then we
have ID
as email then we can write here name as
well name is going to be email again so
save it now and here you can see we have
a text box for email as well now what we
need to do is we need another box for
password so we are going to use the
break tag
twice and now we are going to to use the
label tag again label is going to be
password save it now and here you can
see we have label as password now we'll
write here input type is going to be
password then we have ID is equals to
pass in case we need them in the CSS
part that's why we are using the ID
attribute here name is going to be pass
again and that's it fine so we have text
box for pass password now what we are
going to do next is we are going to use
the break tag
again next up we need to retype password
because this is a registration form the
user needs to retype the password he
choose fine so we'll write here label
label is going to
be re-enter
password and that's it we need an input
box for this as well so we are going to
use this one only so we'll copy it from
here we'll paste it here and we are
going to use the brte again
fine save it now and here you can see we
have another text box for a re-enter
password
fine the next thing we need is the
submit button the last thing so we we'll
write here
input type is going to be button then we
have value value is going to be
submit so save it now and we are done
with the registration form as so here
you can see we have everything we need
in a registration form so here we are
done with the HTML part only let's style
this page a bit now we'll move on to the
Head section again and we'll write here
inside the style attribute or we can say
the style tag basically so we'll write
here we are going to
use
input input for type
as text so basically we can do one thing
we can remove it we can go back to HTML
and we have this input one over here
we'll copy it from here we'll come back
to sign up page and we'll save it so
here you can see it looks fine now so
some of them are not working obviously
because here for email we have used the
input as email so for that to work what
we need to do is we need to write here
again after a comma we need to write
here input then inside these brackets we
need to write here type is equals to
email and for one more we need to write
here
input type is equals to
number fine save it now and here you can
see these two are also working the text
area we can also use over here so what
we can do is we can write here text area
only and it will work as well so we need
to change the Box sizing for this
address attribute or we can say for the
text area attribute so one thing we are
going to do here is we are going to
write
here text area as well
let's see if it works you can see we
have written text area over here and it
works completely fine now fine so here
you can see we have both the pages now
if we move back to our login form you
can see this is a login form and this is
a registration form so it looks nice so
what we can do is we can go over here
login form and we can click on register
and it will take us to a registration
form because these two pages are linked
together fine
so this is how we can create a HTML
login or sign up page using HTML and a
bit of CSS we can say I hope you guys
got it try doing it by yourself and let
us know what extra you did so without
further Ado let's get started with the
interview questions based on HTML it's
the first
question what is HTML HTML stands for
hypertext markup language and it is the
language of the internet it is a
standard text formatting language used
for creating and displaying pages on
internet HTML documents are made up of
the elements and tags that format
properly and display it on
pages so we have our next question now
what are HTML TXS so the answer for this
question is HTML TXS are used for
placing the elements in a proper and
appropriate format TXS use the symbols
greater than and less than to set them
apart from the HTML content the HTML
taxs need not to be closed always for
example in case of images the closing
taxs are not not required for an image
tag now followed by the second question
we have our third question what are HTML
attributes the attributes are the
properties that can be added to an HTML
tag that change the way the tag behaves
or displayed for example an image tag an
image tag has SRC attribute with which
you can use the source from which you
have to display the image
from now the attributes are added right
after the name of the HTML tag inside
the brackets the attributes can only be
added to opening or self-closing tax but
never in closing taxs now followed by
third question we have our next question
what is Maru in HTML Maru is used for
scrolling text on a web page it Scrolls
the image or text up down left or right
automatically to apply for a Mau you
have to use Mau TX now we have our fifth
question how do you separate a section
of text in HTML we separate a section of
text in HTML using the below TX which
are the Break Tag paragraph tag and
block code The Break Tag is used to
separate a line of text it breaks the
current line and shifts the flow of the
text line to a new line followed by that
we have the paragraph line the paragraph
line is used to write a paragraph of
text and third one the blog code the
block code tag is used to define large
qued sections now we have our sixth
question Define the types of lists in
HTML so we have the three types of list
in HTML which are the ordered list
unordered list and definition list so
first will discuss the ordered list the
ordered list uses o tag and displays
elements in a numbered format next we
have the unordered list the UN audited
list uses UL tag and displays elements
in a bulleted format thirdly we have the
definition list the definition list uses
DL DT and DD tags and displace elements
in the form of definition like a
dictionary next we have our seventh
question how do you align list of
elements in an HTML file we can align
the list elements in an HTML file by by
using indents if you indent each nested
list in further than the parent list
then you can easily align and determine
the various list and the elements that
it contains now we have our eighth
question differentiate between ordered
list and unordered list so the answer
for this question is and unoted list
uses UL tags and each element of the
list is written between Li tags the
items are displayed as bullets rather
than numbers now coming into ordered
list so for creating an ordered list
you'll be using o tags and each element
inside the list is written using Li tags
the list items are displayed using
numbers rather than bullet points now we
have a sample on the screen right now so
the first three elements are a set of
unordered list which are represented
using bullet tax and the second set
which is the coffee tea and milk is an
ordered list which is represented using
numbers now moving ahead we have the
ninth question how do you display a
table in HTML web page so the table in
HTML can be created or displayed using
the table tag so it also uses to manage
the layout of the page for example
header section navigation bar body
content photo section etc etc so given
below are a list of HTML tags used for
displaying table in an HTML web page so
we have table TR th etc etc table is
used to define a table TR is used to
define a row in a table th for header TD
for a cell caption is used to define a
caption and we have the call group which
is used to specify a group of one or
more columns in a table for formatting
next we have call which is used with
call group element to specify column
properties for each column next we have
t body which is used to group The Body
content in the table next we have t head
TF footer which are used for header
content and footer content respectively
moving forward we have our 10th question
how do you display the given table in an
HTML web page so the answer for this
question is written on the right side
part of my screen this is the sample
code which you can use to represent or
display a table which is given in this
particular format over here now followed
by this we have our 11th question how do
we insert a comment in HTML so the
answer for this question is we can
insert a comment in HTML by beginning
with lesser than sign and ending with a
greater than sign for example as shown
in the right side part of my screen
which is hello world now moving ahead we
have our 12th question how do you insert
a copy symbol in HTML so you can insert
a copyright symbol by using ampon copy
semicolon or ENT # 169 semicolon in an
HTML file now moving ahead we have our
13th question so what is a whitespace in
HTML so the answer for this question is
an empty sequence of space characters is
called as whites space in HTML this
whites space is considered as a single
space character in HTML whites space
helps the browser to merge multiple
spaces into one single space and and so
taking care of indentation becomes
easier wides space helps in better
organizing the content and TXS making
them readable and easy to understand
with this let's move into the 14th
question how do you create links in
different sections within the same HTML
web page so the answer is Anor TXS we
can use anchor tag along with
referencing through the use of hashtag
symol to create several links to
different sections within the same web
page moving ahead we have the 15th
question question how do you create a
hyperlink in HTML so the answer is we
can use Anor Tac again here the same
thing we can use Anor Tac to create a
hyperlink within the HTML that links to
another web page the hyperlink can be
added to images too now moving ahead
into our 16th question if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more
Define an image map so so the answer for
this question is an image map in HTML
helps in linking with the different
kinds of web pages using the single
image it can be used for defining spaces
in the images that are made part of the
image mapping
process moving ahead we have our 17th
question why do we use stylesheet in
HTML a stylesheet helps in creating a
well-defined template for HTML web page
that is both consistent as well as
portable a single stylesheet template
can be linked to various web pages which
makes it easier to maintain and change
the look of the website now the 18th
question what is semantic in
HTML so the answer for this question is
semantic HTML is a coding style it is
the use of HTML markup to reinforce the
semantics or the meaning of the content
for example the semantic HTML B tag is
not used for bold statement as well as I
tag which is not used for italic instead
we use strong and EM tags now followed
by the 18th question we have a 19th
question what is SVG in HTML so the HTML
SVG is used to describe the vector or
rasor Graphics SVG images and their
behaviors are defined in XML text sheets
it is mostly used for Vector type
diagrams like pie charts two dimensional
graphs in an XY coordinate system now
moving ahead we have our 20th question
what would happen if there is no text
between the HTML tags so the answer for
this question is really simple there
would be nothing to form matter if there
is no text present in between the tags
therefore nothing will appear on the
screen some tags such as the tags
without closing tag like image tag do
not require any text between them now
followed by the 20th question we have
our next question how do you create
nested web pages in an HTML so nested
web pages basically mean a web page
within a web page we can create nested
web pages in HTML using the buil-in
iframe tag the HTML iframe tag defines
an inline frame for example which is
displayed on the right side part of my
screen you can see the iframe source
which redirects the user to Simply
learns official web page now followed by
that we have our 22nd question how do
you add buttons in HTML so we can use
the built-in button tag in HTML to add
buttons to the HTML web page so on the
right hand part of my screen you can see
the implementation of button to an HTML
web page now followed by 22nd question
we have our 23rd question
what are the different types of headings
in HTML so the answer for this question
is there are basically six types of
heading tags in HTML which are defined
with H1 to H6 tags each type of the
heading tag displays different text size
from another where H1 is being the
largest and H6 is being the smallest so
on the right hand part of my screen you
can see the implementation of heading TX
from H1 to H6 now the output for this
particular code segment is the H1 H2 H3
H4 H5 H6 so you can see that H1 is being
the biggest one and H6 is being the
smallest one now moving ahead into our
24th question how do you insert an image
in the HTML web page so the answer for
this question is you can insert an image
in the HTML web page by using the
following code which is displayed on the
right side part of my screen you can see
we have a image source is equals to tb.
jpeg which is used for inserting an
image into your HTML web page
now our 25th question what is the alt
attribute in HTML now the answer for
this question is the alt attribute is
used for displaying the text in place of
an image whenever the image cannot be
loaded due to any technical issue so
basically when you have poor internet
connection and you're trying to load an
image you can see some sort of text in
place of an image so that particular
text is nothing but the alt attribute
now moving ahead we have our 26th
question how are hyperlinks inserted in
the HTML web page you can insert a
hyperlink in the HTML web page by using
the following code which is present on
the right side part of my screen you can
use the anchor tag along with hedge
reference and inside that particular tag
you can use the URL to which you want
your users to redirect to now followed
by this we have our 27th question how do
you add color to the text in HTML so the
answer for this question is you can add
color to the text by using the following
code which is present on the right side
part of my screen where you can add a
red color and blue color green color to
this particular paragraph and headings
now followed by 27th question we have
our 28th question how do you add CSS
styling in HTML so there are three
particular ways to add CSS to your HTML
there are inline CSS external Styles
sheet and internal stylesheet we'll
discuss each of these methods in a bit
more detail first we have the inline CSS
so it is used when less amount of
styling is needed or in cases where only
a single element has to be styled to use
inline styles add the style attribute in
the relevant tag now moving ahead we
have the external stylesheet this is
used when the style is applied to many
elements or HTML pages each page must
link to the stylesheet using the link
tag now we have the last one which is
the internal stylesheet it is used when
a single HTML document has a unique
style and several elements need to be
styled to follow the format internal
stylesheet is added in the head section
of the HTML Page by style tag now
followed by this we have our 29th
question what hierarchy do the
stylesheets follow the answer for this
question is if a single selector
includes three different style
definitions the definition that is
closest to the actual tag takes
precedence inline style takes priority
over embedded stylesheets which takes
priority over external stylesheets now
our last question for the session today
how do you add JavaScript to an HTML web
page so the answer for this question is
we basically have three methods to add a
JavaScript to our HTML web page they are
inline script block and external
Javascript file first we'll discuss the
end line you can add JavaScript to your
HTML elements directly whenever a
certain event occurs JavaScript code can
be added using attributes of the HTML
tax that support it now the next one
that is the script block you can define
a script block anywhere inside the HTML
code which will get executed as soon as
the browser reaches to that part of the
document this is why script blocks are
usually added at the end part of the
HTML documents now the last one that is
the external Javascript file you can
also add or import the JavaScript code
from a separate file and keep your HTML
code clutter-free this is especially
useful if there is a large amount of
scripting added to the HTML web page
this mini project will help you to
understand how we can align our
content to display to my end user so lot
things are there we have a got CSS in
place we have HTML in place and using
some CSS 3 based effects using some HTML
5 based effects we will be creating our
mini website having some single HTML
page and a CSS and lot of images will
help you to understand in case if I want
to develop a website how to Kickstart
them okay so let's get started so this
is my folder I've created called Web Pro
and in a similar folder I'll be creating
some of the files so my first file will
be called
styles. CSS so in this styles.css first
of all I need to import some of the
fonts which I will be using it
throughout my development so I'm saying
atate import URL and here I'll be
offering the location by
saying
https
fonts Dot
Google
apis. okay
google.com/
CSS okay question mark we have to use
family equal to here we can use
Alura Alura and with using this pipe
symbol we using Jo
F Jo fil Plus
sense so that is the URL for me in case
if you want to verify whether this URL
does exist or not so what you can do you
can just copy this and go to your
browser and uh try to paste this and
check if it does exist yes it does exist
that means this URLs are available to us
so this is a URL which I'll be using it
for my development after that I'll be
using this asck and providing some of
the core features like a
margin colon 0 followed by other details
okay like I'm saying margin colon 0
n adding once again zero followed by box
sizing this we saying bot
box followed by
outline okay
none okay and uh post this we be
offering list Style
here we are also saying
none after that text
decoration text decoration once again
none uh after that font
family font family so we are using
this this option which you're saying

fil okay SS the one which you have used
comma we're using one more called
sense hyph s so this would be a first
set of the style which will be Global to
all I'll be using this well earlier we
have given the common style to all now
I'll be giving a style to my paragraph
so here in my paragraph you're trying to
say

is coming up now okay which is used now

you the idea of like saying like hey
you're going somewhere wrong that's why
the suggestions were not given to us so
till here we've added furthermore we'll
be adding few more Styles into my code

display
block that's a
condition okay so so far we have written
this much of CSS we would like to go
ahead and try to implement some of the
HTML behavior and we'll be back to our
CSS to make this possible okay everyone
so we have developed a lot about CSS
it's time for us to move towards the
next UI that is called the HTML part
okay so
here I've already kept it just for the
kind information I've just downloaded
few of the
images okay from the internet just to
utilize into my
application and going to create the
another file and give the name called
index.html okay this index. HML file let
me have this template with me okay so I
have got template with me now here uh we
want to use some of
the awesome CSS styles for of my usual

Styles sheet and HF equal to now I'm
going to give the location so this CSS C

the location
actually okay now I want to just check
what this location does exist or not so
I'll just copy this and paste it in my
browser to
verify well yes this style does exist so
we would like to go ahead and continue
well I would like to give some title in
case if you want so this a called
document I can just give the name
call

okay just keep this cap to website
development coming to my body tag here I
just want to give a

okay now along with this I want to give
some other type of div tags too where I
want to use it now here within this D

I want to provide a na bar so
D equal to

to use another D tag which
says class equal to

tag the D tag is getting closed and we
would like to start another div tag and
in this div tag we would like to say

like to use this ul and within this UL I
would like to use this lii okay and in

which is there like this I can provide
some other list items too like I can
talk about called about we saying
hash about and here we
say about here so this anchor tag is
getting
closed okay and uh here before I close
this list item here we would like to
take another UL
tag
okay in this UL tag we would like to
paste this list item again and here with
this hash we can just give the name
call something whichever you want to
give

[Music]
again
blank and
20 so after that UL is also getting
closed Li is also getting closed
here okay after this we can provide few
more lii tags here okay so HF equal to
here we would like to provide a real URL
now remove the hashtag and say
https simply
r.com
slash corporate
pyph training okay and here we will be
giving the option called
Services This falls into the category of
what services like this we would like to
provide one more anchor tag for contact
us let's see
contact one more for call our
team okay and here we
say our
T okay let me go back to my index.html
file and check the
status well it looks pretty nice now
here we have got simply learn solution
with
and right inside you can see now here in
about you see how the things are working
for me this links are coming up
automatically it came because here if
you remember in my code when I was
saying this about okay this was a part
of our current code and due to that it
is now making it possible for us and
that is possible because here in y
style.css if you remember we were using
this a kind of of naar
UL okay so the moment I try to
hover okay so this was giving me the
complete details and due to that I was
in position to get all the details so
looks pretty
nice okay so going forward what I would
like to do is within my program as I
could see in my index.html file we have
provided this tag so UL is getting
closed this div is getting closed this
div is also getting closed
okay now here we would like to start
another
table we say Dev class equal to Banner
image Banner
uncore image okay now within this div I
would like to use one more div dag
within this div we
say class equal
to Banner
uncore
content
okay Banner _ content now within this
div class we would like to use this
H1 here we can say welcome
to welcome to Simply learn okay after
this Break Tag as you know that is a for
break
now this is pan tag you can say words
okay
words number one boot
cam okay here the H1 tag is getting
closed after that the paragraph tag
within this paragraph We can
say get certified
get ahead this value after this the D
tag is getting closed the second D tag
is also getting closed let me
check okay so that we need to organize
it uh in a better way so but initially
we have a got welcome to Simply learn
words number one boot Gap now how my
look and feel is really going to help
because this Banner part I want to
organize it because I do not have a CSS
for this clear so certainly I need a CSS
to organize this particular Banner
getting it because when we talk about
called Banner content so I need to tell
where it needs to go because I also
would have some Banner image also too so
I'll go back to my CSS now and in my
style CSS here let me say Banner
content Banner
content and here we can
say text align Center and say
color you can
say white
smoke okay and also within this Banner
content we want to use the H1 tag within
this H1 tag you have to just say text
transform upper
case and line
height line height 38
pixels okay and margin
bottom this margin bottom we want to use
15
pixels okay so that's when we have it
let me close this
sorry and here we want to use one more
property called Banner content with H1
and the span tag so that I can change
the color so
here Banner
content H1 we also want to use span tag
within this I want to
say color and you can just
say tomato and let's check does it
effect in my application yes exactly it
does AFF now you can see it is somewhere
coming down the line like
this okay so I can further change
it to my
application like if I talk about about
and and all so this I can change it for
sure because if I have some images also
those images I also want to change
towards my application but it is just a
simple part we are talking about called
Banner
and we have also have to take some
images through for this Banner
image so let's go back and talk about
our index.html file and see what some of
the banners I want to utilize it
here okay now when we talk about called
get ahead I certainly need some of the
banner image to but Banner image is not
available so let me go back and try to
use some Banner image whichever we have
to Define under my CSS okay so here in
my style CSS let me go here and say
dot Banner
uncore
image in this Banner image we have to
say background
URL background colon now you have to say
URL and in this URL we have to use this
image called
images
slash
p4.
jpg that will be my image and also we
would like to use one very common option
that is called No repeat so that it
should not repeat it and I want to fix
it to the top and in a
center okay now let's
check perfect it is coming up but it is
not looking as good as it looks like in
so we want to use few more important
things this background
size background size cover and I also
want to use
width width I want to use
100% and
height we want to use it call
600% okay
display we want to use it
Flex
and uh justify
content we want to use it called
Center and align
items Center let's check this
out okay now you can see it looks pretty
better compared to the previous version

[Music]
now now you can see we have got these
three properties are coming up at the
end but certainly we can go back and try
to fix those images which are there
behind the scene okay using what the
style so first important thing is we
have got this images with us what those
images are if we just check here we were
called def service
item okay we have a called what Dev
service item so that we want to change
it but before that I will go back to my
style and after this H1 span we want to
use for
DOT
about okay
dot service me press
enter
service or I can say
Services here we talk about

we say
dot services with the services we can
say

same in this div Services
item so we want to
use image part that is the most
important area here we say
width 100
% okay and margin
button okay margin bottom 25
pixels
okay okay now you can see this images
looks pretty
nice yeah looks better so that's how you
see your websites are really creating
some difference compared to the previous
one now they are aligned properly and
you can see here these images are really
nice okay that's the benefit so we have
this let me go
this yeah and uh on this image part is
closed we would like to talk about H3
part let me copy
this
item and with this item we say
H3 in this H3 we say
color tomato and margin
bottom this 15
pixels okay for this H3 and when it
comes to this text boxes certainly you
can change the look and feel how you
really want it so for this you can say
dot form
underscore
rapper
formore
input okay form rapper form
input we say margin hyph and
bottom 15
pixels okay for form input now in a
similar line uh form input we may have a
for text
area

text area and in this text area
we want to offer some of the details
like I'm talking about like in width we
talk about padding let's talk about like
in width I'm saying 250
pixels okay we say
padding we say 12
pixels
and 20 pixels we talk
about height
80 pixels we talk about
resize we talk about none we say
border this border we say one
pixels
solid
and white this is for this and in a
similar one I can use it for the text
box so form colon input whatever we have
used it form repper form input so let me
copy
this okay form input and uh here we say
input equal
to type of
text so
what combination you'll be using so I'll
be using width padding and
Border copy
I need with pic and Border height and
three size we removing it
and awesome so they look pretty nice
okay so we have this uh three text boxes
with us and uh all are looking nice the
way we are expecting from our
application okay so that's the one which
my application is offering about this
text area and all so that looks really
nice the way we are expecting right now
okay
so what are the areas we have seen diff
Services
item and everything whichever we were
saying like this so let's go back and
check to my index.html
file so we have a
call form rapper which is the
outermost okay you see now here it
contains lot many things so here in
my program when I see like form
rapper okay formore rapper do form input
and uh talk about like the other details
talk about input type equal to
text you see like the border is like
that so if you want to have this border
some different
color and certainly use
black now you can see it looks pretty
nice because earlier it was looking like
pretty much different now at least I can
see here the location has been
given okay uh so going back towards the
previous HTML page so we had a call a
submit button with us okay after this
the all three div tags are getting
closed and now onwards we would like to
start working with Team
details so we are saying
div so div plus equal
to our T and uh ID equal
to team
again okay and now we want to use this
H1 tag here this H1 tag we
say
class class equal to title and here I
say our in a H1 tag now once it is over
we will use again another div tag which
having class equal to our team rapper
our
teamore
rapper now within this D
tag uh we want to use one more D tag
here in this class equal
to teamore or Team hyph
1 base
team that is the D tag now here we will
be using a lot lot of other div tags
inside this like I say
div class equal to team
members team
members okay and uh data H name equal to
you can give any name like let's give
the name
call it's space k okay and within this I
want to use one image
tag IMG space SRC equal
to images SL team
one.
jpeg okay so that's the first thing we
have it so this div tag is closed now uh
I copy the
same so total I want to use this three 1
2 three and here team members I would
like to change the name here rather than
kle let me give the name
called abijit and uh one more that is
called okay and change the name to
two 45
okay so this is the first div we have
used it so this D tag is getting closed
right over here along with this there a
second D tag is getting closed so after
having this two D tags closed we want to
use another one so for team
two okay so I just copy the
same okay
uh I would like to go ahead
with Team to team so team
members and uh here I would like to say
4 five
4
5 6 and change the name like you can
give anything I just give the name
called
suppose
Arian
others
and so these names we using it now let's
go back and see how it really
looks so these images are coming like
that okay so we want to use those images
in somewhere not like this or horizontal
or vertical so this for fix that issue I
have to once again look back to where to
my
Styles okay where this option can be
used in better way I like to go back to
my
style.css and want to use the first
option called
ourd
background
sorry background now here we
say white smoke now again our
team
rapper so in this I would like to say
display
flex and flex
direction space
between
oh sorry
column let's check how it really looks
like it there's no much change but
certainly few more classes can really
make a difference so our
team okay underscore
rapper let's check this the same name we
have used
it yes our team now in the same way we
want to use this team so again our team
rapper okay dot team
display flex and justify
contents space
between
okay now here when we talk about team we
also want to say uh our
teamore raer DOT
teamore
[Music]
members here we would like to give
withd how much
30% and
height this will be
Auto and uh here will be having
cursor pointer for sure and
overflow
hidden and
position relative this is what team
members now you can see it looks better
now now we have to basically divide
those because we have got separate team
members are available so we have to also
divide them too so here after this we
want to
say
dot our team rapper and again
dot team
members space
IMG these images we say
display
block
width
100%
okay
height Auto
okay
transition transition or transition I
can say or type
all like
this okay and uh in a similar
way copy this team and we'll say
members over image then we can
say
transform
scale
1.1 that's
it okay so we have
this look and feel appeared okay width
transition image h so they're all ready
with us okay everybody so after writing
all those the only difference I made it
like I had used hyphen but I'm using
underscore here finally when I see my
look and feel of this I can see now it
is moving you can see now it is all
moving okay so that gives me the
confidence of like yes exactly the code
is working the way it was expected
earlier in my index.html file okay so
once this portion is over okay we want
to go ahead so three D tages are getting
closed 1 2 and three and
here we would like to start working with
the footer so here we start

Ali closing this Ur and
Al well
simply.com or else we can just give the
name called

okay twitter.com
SL simply
Lear okay so we can offer the user to

can/ simply
learn we remove this values whichever we
have it so inser we use this
I okay and in this I I
say equal
to
F hyph
Twitter okay anchor tag is closed so in
case if you want to talk about like an
typical uh you know Instagram that
Instagram also you can use it now so
here we say HTTP
www.
insta we say instagram.com okay
slash simply
learncore underscore
e-learning okay and I want to use the
same option there
also
I and with
this remove this okay so here just give
the name called fa hyen
Instagram now let's go back and
check okay so you can see now we have
got this links coming up for Facebook as
well as what of this Instagram so that
looks really nice that gives us a
feeling of yes exactly the code the way
we are looking forward for it is working
the way it was expected
okay and uh if you want to offer any
other type of details that also you can
offer but this is the first thing which
we have taken so this is the navigation
links are available these navigation
links you can also change the way they
always look forward for so I'll be
providing some links which we can later
on use it okay everyone so finally we
all ready so I have basically added some
of the additional styles to my code you
can see here from from this point
onwards we added this image URL this is
for body this is for Star container row
UL this is for footer this is for foter
column so because we're also using some
footer portions into my code as you can
see what call photo column and photo
class equal to what photo so implemented
this photo background color Cod to Black
we have used it padding 70 pixels photo
column photo column because we using
this H4 tag also you remember like we're
using this H4 tag also so for all H4
tags this would be the basic
setting for footer column H4 before we
would like to give the contents like
this by giving this background color
height box sizing width and and all
photo column UL Li not last side we're
going to give this margin bottom and
this is the style for photo column UL Li
and list
items clear and here you can see this
font size we're giving it this for hover
this is for photo column where we have
all Social Links whichever we have
created it is showing me that display in
line block margin border radius and this
is for Social Links when I try to click
on or over it so the color will change
to this white color and the media this
is for responsiveness to make sure like
in case if I reduce the size of my
browser they look better the way it is
expected so when the line size will
change to 720 pixels so this color will
be changed and this is the styles for
Arrow photo one these all we have
implemented and finally my application
when I refresh it actually looks like
that see now this is the photo area of
my
application so I'm sure that this looks
even more better and convenient because
when I try to reduce the size you see
now it's still going to give you the
responsiveness can you see this now this
is going to give you the responsiveness
reason because here we are using this
Logic for media when the change of width
will to 720 pixels if it is going to 767
pixels so like that you implement that
so guys our project is now ready I'm
sure that you enjoyed thank you very
much for enjoying this project so
finally our application is set and our
application is working the way it is
supposed to work for us just a quick for

a software development program that fits
your experience and areas of
trust in this session we'll cover the
HTML and CSS part of creating a quiz
application the JavaScript part we'll
cover in one of the upcoming sessions so
there's a specific reason for not
discussing the JavaScript part because
it may happen that many of you guys will
not get what we try to do so this
specific video is for HTML and CSS and
in some other session we'll complete the
whole application using JavaScript so
let's move on and let me show you guys
what we'll create in this session we'll
create the front end of our quiz
application using HTML and CSS so here
you can see on your screen that we have
the start quiz button present on the
screen right click on it and you will
see the quiz starting this was
interactive right all this
interactiveness comes with the inclusion
of JavaScript
that's the reason JavaScript is so
important now you can see these rules
for playing the quiz right we have five
rules for playing the quiz and two
buttons are present here for different
tasks one button is for exit and the
other one is for continuing click on
continue and you can see our quiz starts
we have several questions here for the
user to play the question will feed from
a Javascript file and the user will
answer them to see the score at the end
let's answer some of the questions over
here so let's say this is the correct
answer for this
question you can see the answer is
correct for now we have only two
questions present here we'll add as many
questions as we want
so we'll do it in some other video let's
move on to the next question for now
here's a second question so click on
next question over here and here you can
see it's a second
question and if you guys know the
correct answer for this question then
put it in the chat chat section I
clicked on the wrong answer
intentionally so that it will be marked
as red so here you can see that it is a
wrong answer 2001 is the wrong answer
that's why it is marked as red the
correct answer for this question is 1995
JavaScript was actually developed in the
year 1995 by Brendan IE when he was
working for Netscape Communications so
click on next question and a result box
tells the user about their performance I
hope you guys must have got an idea
about what we'll do in this video so
let's hop into the programming part
directly we have all the required files
present here so if you can see here we
have this HTML file we have this CSS
file these two files are of utter
importance and the script part or we can
say the JavaScript part we are not going
to cover in this particular section but
we have these JavaScript files here as
well so let's do the structural and
styling part of this whole quiz
application we'll create the start quiz
button first followed by the info box so
let's create them first move to the body
section of HTML document so here we are
going to create a button first the start
quiz button if you can see here we have
this button over here which is the start
quiz button we are going to create this
one first so we are going to write over
here inside the body tag we are going to
use the div tag with a class attribute
so we are going to write here the class
name as let's say start underscore
button then we are going to use a button
tag within this so we are going to write
here button and then we are going to
write
a button name so a button name is start
quiz and save it and here you can see
the button present over here on the
browser now the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to create the info
box so for creating the info box what we
need to do is we need to use another div
tag fine so this time we are going to
use Dave tag for creating the info box
so by info box we mean this particular
box so this rules box we have to keep
these things in mind
fine now what we'll do is we'll write
over here after this let's put a comment
over
here and we are going to write over
here rules box or rule box or info box
whatever you guys want to write you guys
can write over here let's say we are
going to write over here rule box and
now we are going to create
a info box so we are going to use again
div class is equals
two info uncore box so within this div
tag we are going to use
the div tag again so we'll write over
here div class is equals to info
underscore title fine now this
particular div tag this info title this
div tag with classes info title we are
doing creating this div tag for this
some rules of this quiz area fine so
this is why that's why we are using this
some div tag over here so now what we
are going to do is we are going to write
something over
here so we are going to write over here
rules
and regulations fine now we are done
with this part as well the div tag is
closed so we are going to do one more
thing we are going to put it within the
span tag fine rules and regulations we
are going to put within the span tag so
we'll cut the span tag from here we'll
paste it here and then we have this div
tag closed now within the same Dev tag
we are going to create another Dev tag
this time we are going to create for
this section so we are going to put Five
Points within this particular div tag
the one we are going to create right now
so let's write over here here we are
going to write
div class class is going to be it's a
list of elements so let's say we are
writing over here info
list and then it's fine so we'll write
over here div
class we'll write as info for a
information so here we are going to
Define our rules so we'll write over
here let's
say you will get
within the span tag we are going to
write 15
seconds for
every question
fine now we are going to use the div tag
again with the same class so we are
going to write here div class as
info and we are going to write a second
rule over
here there is
no
point
of going
back once
you start the quiz
fine now we are going to write another
rule over here so we are going to write
Dev class is equals to info it takes a
lot of time guys to write these rules
and regulations
so let's go ahead and and we'll write
over here you can't
choose more than one option at a
time this is a third rule for the quiz
and then we are going to write here div
class is equals to info again and we'll
write over here this is going to be our
fourth point we are going to write
here let's say you will get one point
point for
each correct answer
fine so that's done with this we are
going to write a fifth Point as well so
let's say we have this class as info we
are going to write over here five and
now let's say we are writing over here
enjoy your quiz
fine so let's
not make it too long say it and here you
can see we have all the rules and
regulations present over here you can
see we have this these five rules 1 2 3
4 five each of them is working fine now
the next task for us is to create the
two buttons we have and we have two
button the exit quiz button and the
continue button so if you can see here
we have this exit quid and the continue
button so let's create them as well what
we are going to do is we are going to
create another D tag after this
so we are going to create a div tag for
buttons now we are going to write here
div class is equal to
buttons and we are going to write here
button so then we are going to create a
button class is equals to let's say quit
for the quid button and we are going to
write over here
exit
quiz and we are going to create another
button so we are going to
write name and is restart the class name
is restart basically and the button name
is going to be continue fine we'll move
to the body section of a HTML document
so we'll design this button first we
have this start quiz button we'll do it
first and then followed by a other
things like then we have to design this
one as well so let's start writing the
HTML code for this so what we'll do
is we'll start writing over here now the
first first thing we need to do is we
need to add a div tag over here so for
that we are going to write here div
class class is going to be let's say
start button fine then we have to write
over
here we have to create a button for this
so we'll write button over here and then
we'll name a button as start gools save
it and here you can see we have this
button present over here on the browser
let me this just zoom it out so here you
can can see we have to create this
button let me just show you guys so this
is the button we are going to create now
we are done with this let's move ahead
and we'll design the other info box
basically so we'll write the code for
this as well now we'll move back to a
HTML document and we'll write over
here this is the start quiz button so
let's put a comment over here we'll
write start quiz
button
and that's it fine so the next thing we
are going to do is we are going to
create a rules button or we can say info
button so we'll write over here in the
comment
box rules and so let's create it for
that again we are going to create a div
tag so we'll write over here div
followed by the class name so the class
name is let's say going to
be info box so we'll write over here
info box close this D tag now anything
we write here will be considered within
this particular box so let's write over
here the code we are going to write over
here we are going to take another D tag
basically so we are going to write
the design the title so we'll write over
here info
title and this is our class name so
let's move ahead
we'll write over here within the span
tag
[Music]
rules and
regulations fine so this is what we are
going to do now we are done with the
title now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to write the rules
over here so for that we are going to
use another div tag with
classes let's take any class of your
choice we can take like let's use info
list so it is a list basically so we are
going to write over here classes
info uncore list fine we are done with
the class then we have to take another D
tag
for all the separate points so we are
going to write here info fine so this is
our class okay it's a mistake over here
we are done with the div tag save it and
here you can see it says rules and
regulations fine so the next thing we
are going to do is we are going to write
over over here other things so we have
to close this div tag
first and let's create all the div tags
first so what we are going to do is we
are going to copy this from here
basically we have five rules right so we
are going to paste it five times now we
need to write the rules over here so for
that what we are going to do is we are
going to write the rules over here so
the first rules ISS you will have only
15 seconds for each question
so let's write it over here you will
get so we have 15 seconds written
differently over here you can see it's
blue in color so what we are going to do
is we are going to use the span tag over
here so we'll write over here span 15
seconds we are going to write within
this span
text and then we'll continue writing
over here for
each question
fine so this is our first point you can
see it says you will get 15 seconds for
each
question now we need to do one more
thing just reduce the size of this vs
code and that's it fine we are good to
go now we'll write a second point over
here so second point
is there's no
way of
going back once you
start the quiz
fine the third point we have
is can't select more than one option at
once so let's use it we are going to
write here you can't select more
than
one
fine we are done with the third point
let's give them the numbers as well we
are going to write one here two over
here and three over here save it and
here you can see we have three points
present over here now we are going to
write okay we have the div tag here so
we'll write a fourth Point within this
div
tag let's use anything let's say we are
writing over here you can't quit the
game quit the quiz
in
between fine then finally we have the
fifth Point fifth point is you
will get one
point for
each correct answer and so we have our
Five Points over here now the next thing
we need is these two buttons right we
need the exit button and the continue
button so let's add them as well for
that what we are going to do is we going
to leave this div over here and after
this div tag we are going to write over
here div class as
buttons and then we have to write over
here
button class and let's say the first
class name is
quit this is
for exit quiz fine we are done with the
one button the same thing we'll do for
the second Button as well we are going
to use the
classes restart because we are going to
need this class later on as well so
we'll write over here
exit what exit quiz we are going to
write over here
continue fine save it and here you can
see we have two buttons present over
here let me remove this save it and here
you can see we have two buttons present
over here we are done with the HTML part
we have the start quiz button then we
have the rules and regulations present
over here and finally we have two
buttons right if you can see here we
have these two buttons exit and continue
button so we have all the five rules
written over here on the browser for
this one now let's move ahead and we'll
now style these elements so the first
thing we are going to do is we are going
to write over
here body let's define the body color on
the whole background color we are going
to Define so we'll write over here
background background is going to be
let's say gray save it and here you can
see the gray background so one thing we
are going to do is we are going to
change the color from
here okay this one is a little bit
dark lighten it up save it and here you
can see we have a background
color now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to style the start
button first so this is a start button
this button we are talking about uh this
button we are going to style it so let's
do it we are going to write here start
uncore button this is a class name I
guess let's check so this is our class
name start button then we are going to
write over here position position is
going to be
absolute and then we have top top is
going to be 50% because we want this
button to be present at the center of
the screen right save it and here you
can see we are going to Define left as
well for this
so left is going to be 50%
again and here you can see the start
quiz button at the center of our screen
now we are going to write over here
transform transform we are going to
write
translate minus
50%
50% fine okay we have to write here
minus 50% again so save it and here you
can see the button at the center center
of our
browser now the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to style this
button so for that we are going to write
over here dot start uncore button and we
have to style the button tag fine so
we'll write over here
font size font size is going to be 25
pixels then we have the font WID so
we'll write over here font weight font
weight is going to be let's say
500 and let's see the color the font
color is different so it's blue in
shade guys I have no idea about the font
color so let's do one thing we can use
any color of our own CH fine so we'll
write over here color color is going to
be black in this case let's say we are
going to use black color only then we'll
Define padding padding is going to be 15
pixel and 30 pixel followed by the
outline fine we'll write outline over
here outline is going to be none for
this this then we have the border border
is going to be none
again and after this we'll Define the
Border radius border radius is going to
be 5
pixels and then we have the background
color or we can say the background so
let's do one thing let's choose any
color and we'll write the background
color as let's keep it white fine for
this time we are going to keep it white
after background color we are going to
write over here cursor cursor will
change to pointer on taking the mouse
over this particular button and you can
see it's working totally fine the button
looks decent fine now the next thing we
need to do is we need
to over effect to this button so what
we'll do is we'll copy this piece of
code from
here we'll paste it here we'll put over
in front of it and now we'll start
writing the code so we'll change
the font color to white so let's say the
font color is going to be white this is
the hash code and we'll change the
background color as well so the
background is going to be red let's say
let's change the Border color as well so
we'll WR border color as red again save
it and you can see it's working totally
fine on taking the mouse cursor over
this start quiz button fine so we are
done with the start quiz button now the
next thing we need to do is we need to
style a info box or we can say the rules
and regulations box so what we'll do for
that is we'll move to the in
index.html we'll copy this infobox class
from
here we are going to paste it here with
the start button and that's it okay we
have to write here do info box we can
copy it so that we can use it every time
we need it I guess it's fine you can see
the content at the center center of a
browser so it's working totally fine now
the next thing we need to do is we need
to style this info box so before that
let me
change the background color a bit so we
are going to write over here

48 48 I heard this somewhere that this
color is nice this 49 48 48 you can see
I didn't find any difference if you find
any you can let me know in the comment
section so let's move ahead when we'll
write do info box over here this is the
class name we are going to define the
width for this info box which is going
to be 540 pixel and then we'll Define
the background
color and then we'll Define the

define the Border radius border radius
is going to be 5 pixel in this case you
can see the border is curved now now
what we are going to do next is we are

and in the footer section basically now
the next thing we are going to do
is going to write over

so everything is working totally fine
then we'll write over here after this
background we are going to
write let's see border radius border
radius is going to be 5
pixels and then after after this what we
are going to do
is we are going to write over
here color so let's define the font
color as well so for font color we have
to write here font or we can say just
color color is going to be let's say
white then we have font size font size
is going to be 16
pixels and then we have font weight as
well font weight is going to be 500
let's
suppose and then we'll write over here
cursor
as Point save it now and here you can
see these buttons look
good now these buttons are done the next
thing we need to style let's see what we
have here for styling
now and we have two buttons left the
quit button and the start button so
we'll move back to CSS file and we'll
write over
here dot button
and just a second let me check we'll
write over here do buttons not do button
then we'll write over here
button then we'll style each button fine
so we'll write over here
quit and we have to style the continue
Button as well so for that we'll write
over here dot
buttons button
dot
restart now we have to check the colors
for both the buttons so for the continue
button the color is the background color
is blue basically fine so what we'll do
is we'll change the background color
over
here and we'll write over here inside
the restart we are going to write
background background is going to be
blue or just let's do one thing we are
going to copy this background property
from here we are going to paste it here
and and we are going to do the same for
Border as well fine so we'll write over
here
this it looks good we are going to
remove it from
here save it now and for this exit
button we need to write over
here border color border color is going
to be let's
see gray I am not sure and then we have
to
mention we can say is the font color as
well so for that we are going to write
here color color is going to be black
save it and here you can see it looks
nice
now so we are done with these buttons
now the next thing we are doing is we
are going to do is we are going to add
hover effect in these buttons fine so
till now what we did is we did the
buttons part now what we'll do is is we
are going to use the hor effect over
these buttons so what hor effect will do
is on taking a mouse pointer to these
buttons over these buttons the H effect
will change these buttons like it can
change its Styles and all that things
right so what we are going to do is we
are going to add a property here first
we are going to add the transition
property here to write here transition
before we add the H effect so we'll
write over
here transition
and we are going to write over here all
at 0.3 with ease fine so our transition
is done now the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to copy this from
here we are going to paste it
here and we are going to mention the H
property here so we'll write over here H
and now we'll see what we can do
while using the the hover property so
what we are going to do is we are going
to change the color to Red so we are
going to write
here background color is
red save it let's see if it's working so
it's working we are going to change the
Border color as well so we'll write over
here border color is going to be red
again border is going to be of same
color you can see it's red
and we are going to do the same thing
for the quid button
so we are going to write over
[Music]
here quit so we'll copy it from
here we'll paste it here and we are
going to use the hover effect we are
going to write here inside this color we
background color we are going to change
to
red same goes for the Border color
border color is again going to be red on
taking the mouse cursor over this part
particular button and we are going to
change the what we can say font color as
well so we are going to change the font
color to white now it looks good right
so on taking the mouse cursor over this
exit button you can see the font color
is changing to White you can see the
background color is changing to Red fine
so we are all done with this part so it
looks similar right not similar though
now we need to change
these box so what we are going to do is
we are going to write here let's say 640
let's try so the resolution it changes
okay for now we
are done with it
and you can see the box is fine so we
have all the rules and regulations
present over here one thing we can do is
we can put this space after this fifth
point so we are going to write over
here like this and you can see it's
fine
fine let's check it out if everything is
correct the class name is info for
all of them then we have the div tags
closed perfectly fine then we have the
infest tag Clos perfectly fine we have
these buttons present over here
and that's it right so the next thing we
are going to do
is we are going to get back to our CSS
file and we are going to write something
over here which
is display is going to be
none save it once and here you can see
we are at the initial stage of work so
here you can see we have this start quiz
button and if we remove this display you
can see we have this rules and
regulations box fine it is working
totally fine so for now we are going to
use this
only so now let's move to a HTML file
and we are going to write the code for
quiz box so we'll write after this
particular div tag before the body tag
basically so we are going to write over
here
div class is
equals to quiz uncore
box this is the division for creating
the quiz so let me put a comment over
here we are going to write here qu box
now we are what we are going to do is we
are going to use the header
tag within the header tag we are going
to use a div tag again so we are going
to use the class as title so we have to
write the title over here title is going
to
be use application so let's change the
title in this particular code so we are
going to write
here C
code quiz
application
fine save it I think you guys are not
able to see it but if you can see here
clearly we have the simply code quiz
application written over here on the
browser so let's Zoom it out again now
what we are going to do is we are going
to add the timer so we are going to
write over
here
div class is equals to
timer and within this we are going to
write div class is equals to timer
underscore
text and we are going to write here
time
left fine so we are going to use another
div tag now we are going to write div
class is equal to
timer underscore
seconds and we are going to write over
here 15 because we are going to give 15
seconds to the user we are done with the
header section so the next thing we are
going to
do before we move further let me show
you guys that what we are going to
create so this is the part we just
created we have the simply code quiz
application written over here then we
have time left for this time left and
then we have seconds return return over
here save it now and here you can see
time left 15 and all of these things
written over here so we have to write it
here like this the next thing the next
part we are going to design is this
particular part so we have to add a
question over here for that so let's do
one thing we are going to write over
here or we can say we are going to use
the section tag over here fine so we'll
write over
here
section and close the section tag then
we are going to write
div class is equals to
quore text let's say then we are going
to close this then we are going to write
a question write a single question
basically just for the front end part we
are not we are going to add questions
through JavaScript but this time only we
are going to use a simple question for
the front end part just to let you guys
know how the front end actually work so
our question is which one of the
following is the latest version of HTML
so let's add it
what we'll do is we'll copy it from
here and we'll paste it
here
fine so we are done with the span tag
and this div tag as well this is the
question tag X now we have to Define
these four options HTML 4.0 5.0 3.0 and
2.0 all of them we are going to Define
anyways let's move ahead and we'll write
over here
div again so we are going to write over
here
div class is going to
be option underscore
list and then we have to give the
options here basically so we'll write
all the four options over
here we have four options as HTML 4 3 2
and
five then we have to add the
this icon here as well just to let you
guys know that this particular question
is correct and we have to add two icons
right so one is this let me show you
again with the other
icon these are the two icons we need to
add so the cross sign add the correct
sign the correct sign will show that the
answer is correct and the cross sign
will show that the answer is wrong fine
so we need to add them what we are going
to do is we are going to write over here
the options so inside the option list
basically inside the div tag with
classes option list we need to add
another div tag so we'll write over here
div last class is going to be option
only now we are going to add our first
option so we'll write over here span our
first option is
HTML
4
0 and we are
done with this now we are going to write
over here div class is equal to
Icon we have to write here icon and tick
and there's no underscore so we'll write
over here icon tick then we have to
write over
here I we are going to write over here
class as f
for times or we can say fast checks for
the correct one so we'll write over here
fast far
check we are going to close the it tag
over here and we are going to close the
division as well fine so The Division is
closed what we are going to do is we are
going to copy it from
here and we are going to paste it here
for another then we have four options so
we are going to paste it for four
times and we are going to change the
options here from HTML 4.0 to 3.0 then
from here we are going the last one is
the correct answer keep this thing in
mind so we have to write over
here so all these answers are wrong
instead of this one so for this we are
going to use fast far check otherwise we
are going to use a different class over
here the class name is fast far wrong I
guess let me check fast far times for I
icon cross so we are going to write here
icon
cross this one we are going to write as
icon
cross uh we don't need to add all of
them in each option so let's do one
thing let's remove it from here let's
remove it from here as well because we
don't need it in these two options it's
just the front end so we are going to
show you how to do it we have to write
here F far times so it's fast far times
it's not fast far check it's fast far
okay whatever it is so we are going to
write your fast for times and we are
going to write over here fast for check
fine let's see you can see we have two
icons present over here one is cross and
the other one is correct so this is the
tick and this is the cross it means that
HTML 4.0 is the wrong answer and HTML
5.0 is the correct answer fine
now let's do one thing let's create the
quiz box footer now so we are going
to write it over here after this section
tag so the quiz box is taking a lot of
time let me put some comments over here
so that you guys can understand
it we'll write over
here
let this is is the quiz box header so we
are going to write over here quiz boox
header then we have the section tag over
here here will
write box what we are going to say is
questions let's define it like this then
we have after this the footer section so
let's define the footer section as well
we are going to write over here quiz
boox footer fine so we are done with
this as well now what we are going to do
is we are going to define the footer
section so we'll write over
here the footer tag so within the footer
tag we are going to
write div class we have to write it here
like this class is going to
be total underscore questions and then
we have to write
here after this this pan So within the
span tag we are going to use P within
the P tag we are going to use
two then we are going to use off then we
are going to use the P tag
again so we'll write over here like
this okay so we have
to two questions we have till now so
we'll write here two of
two we we have to write
here questions
fine so we'll write over here like this
save it now and here you can see it says
two of two questions over here on the
browser fine now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to add the
buttons so if I take you here so here
you can see we have this one of two
questions we have this simply code logo
present over here and then we have this
next question Buton so what we are going
to do is we are going to add this button
first and then we'll add this logo as
well fine so don't worry about it we'll
add the logo as well now let's continue
we are going to write it after this div
tag we are going to
write
button we have the button class
is next n
and we have the button name as let's say
next question
fine we are going to add the simply code
image over here after some time because
let's style everything first then we'll
add the simply code image fine so what
we'll do
is with the next button so let's move
ahead and save the program and let's see
if this thing works or not you can see
the next button present over here it
says next question it is present over
here so now the next thing we need to do
is we need to style this quiz box so for
that we are going to use the first class
so the first class is what's the rule
box quiz box fine we are going to copy
it from here we'll move to a CSS file we
are going to
one thing first we are going to paste it
here first after a comma we are going to
paste it here and we have to put a dot
over here save it and here you can see
it is present at the center of the
spring now we are going to do one more
thing we are going
to go down at the bottom and we are
going
to S the quiz box now so we are going to
paste it here we are going to write here
Dot
right over here inside
this width is going to be 540 pixels or
we can say
550 pixels is going to be the width then
we are going to write here background
color or we can say just background we
are going to Define so we'll write over
here background
as H FFF which is white save it and here
you can see our background is here now
we are going to write here
border radius border radius is okay so
we have to write here border radius so
we'll write over here
border radius border radius is going to
[Music]
be let's say 5 pixel let's try five
pixel and save it you can see the quiz
box looks fine now we are going to style
the head this part so we'll write over
here quiz
boxcore we have to put here then we have
to write here header fine now we are
going to
write height as 70 pixels then we have
padding as 0 and 30 pixels then we
have let's do one thing let's check it
out if it this thing is working or not
see and here you can see it looks fine
point we
are styling this particular section the
header section basically so we are going
to write
here background background is going to
be black save it and here you can see
the back black background now we are
going to align these items align items
at the
center justify content justify content
at
the space between so we'll write over
here space between save
it we have to write here display as well
so we'll write display as
Flex save it and here you can see it
looks fine
now and we are going to change the
obviously we are going to change the
background color and this font color for
both simply code quiz application and
for time left for now we are going to
write over
here border radius so border radius is
going to to be five pixels 5 pixels 0
and 0 five pixels 5 pixels 0 and 0 and
we have box shadow box Shadow is going
to be 0
pixel 3
pixel 5 pixel and one pixel we are going
to use the rgba value for this one we
are going to write here 0 comma 0 comma
0 comma
0 1 fine
that's it we are done with this save it
and here you can see it looks fine now
we are going
to what now we are going to style the
title so this is our title simply code
quiz application and this is a timer
fine so what we are going to do is we
are going to get back to the
index.html and here you can
see let me show you so this simply code
with application it has the classes
title and for this uh timer so this
timer we have the classes timer timer
text timer second they are three
different classes so what we are going
to do is we are going to style the title
first fine so we'll move back to a CSS
part and we'll write over here dot quiz
uncore
box space header
space title and we'll write over here
font size font size is going to be 20
pixels then we have
font weight font weight is going to be
600
pixels and we are going to write over
here we going to write over here color
color is going to
be Che FF save it
now and here you can see
the
whatever we can say it says simply code
quiz application and the font color is
white we are going to do the same thing
for timer as well so we'll write over
here dot quiz boox
space header space dot
timer and we'll write over here display
is flex and we will align the items at
the center we'll justify them as well
justify
content at space between we have the
width width is going to be let's see 145
pixels for this timer and we
have height as 45
pixels let's
see okay it's not visible because the
font color is what we can say black what
we are going to do is we are going to
change the background color so we are
going to write here background color
as and it looks fine now let's diminish
it a
bit little
dark so what we are going to do is we
are going to put this color over here
save it now and it looks fine now
right so the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to give the
border so border we are going to write
over here border border is going to be 1
pixel solid
and let's use the same color we are
going to copy this RGB value from
here we are going to paste it here save
it and you can see it looks fine there's
no issue now the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to define the
Border radius so the Border radius is
going to be 5
pixels and the padding is going to be 0
and 8 pixels save it here you can see it
says time left 15 it looks somewhat same
although the colors are not same because
I don't actually remember the color for
this one the actual color code basically
so it looks fine right now the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to style this particular timer box so
what we have to do for that is we have
to write here dot quiz uncore box space
header
space timer then we have the timecore
text class if you can see here in the
HTML part if I can show you here is
a okay let me see where it is so it says
timer text timer text is for time left
and then we have timer set for 50 so we
are going to do what we are going to
write over here
font font weight font weight is going to
be 400 then we have the font size the
font size is going to be let's say 17
pixels and then we
have user select as
n fine save it and here you can see this
is the time text class let me check
timer
text okay we have to write here timer
text save it and here you can see it
looks fine
now timer underscore text let me check
once timer
text
timer yeah it's
fine
let's do one
thing we'll write over here time text so
that it won't confuse you guys so we'll
write over here time text save it
now and I guess it's working
let's try to change the
size okay we have this timer class then
we have class as time text
next
okay user select none we have the font
vest
400
okay I guess so let's move ahead and
what we are going to do next is we are
going to write here dot quiz boox then
we have header then we
have timer then we have
timer
underscore F we are going to write here
font size font size is going to be let's
see 18 pixel then we have the font
weight font weight is going to be 500
again and then we have background so
background we have
to mention so we will write over here
background background is going to be
let's see black once again black on
black hellow black basically so that's
not the point right here so we'll write
over your height
as 30 pixels then we have width as 45
okay we are in the wrong track we have
to write your width
as 45 pixels
something wrong okay we forgot to put
semicolon over here so with width we are
done with the width as
well now we
have to save it once and here you can
see we have this box present over here
now we have to do one thing we have
to color it so color is going to be
white the font color basically then
we'll write over here text align at this
Center then we have line
height line height is 30 pixels then we
have border radius so we'll write
border radius as 5 pixels then we
have border so border is going to
be 1 pixel solid in nature
and of course black and
color user select we are going to Define
as n
again that's it save it and here you can
see your timer box is complete it says
15 for seconds and we have time left as
well here so it says simply code quiz
application it looks good though right
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to style the section so by
question we mean this section or we can
say by section we mean we are going to
style this question ofers so this this
particular section basically the other
part comes in the photo section so this
is a section with these two logos what
we are going to do is we have the parent
classes
quore box then we have the section class
so we'll write section over here and
let's define the padding first padding
we are going to let's say right here 25
30 20 and 30 again
save it you can see there's a
change ground color we are going to
Define so let's see what's the
background color the background color is
white so we are going to write here
background color
as HH FF okay so
it's cursor is not here hash FFF it is
white let me see if there's anything
wrong are going to see okay so we have
to do two things we have to keep the
background as white but we have to keep
the foter background as black fine so
we'll write over
here we are going to do one thing before
that we are going to go to the header
section and we are going to define the Z
index
and position fine so we'll write over
here po position
as relative and we are going to write
here Z index as
99 it and here you can see it looks
fine me check once okay position we have
defined as relative and Z index we have
defined
as here we
are this part let's see if everything is
going correct or not let me check the
code
once we have added the position
as relative and we have the Z index
is 99
fine oh it looks
good okay now the next thing we are
going to do is
we are going to move back to the section
we are going to style our section again
so we
have this Q text present over here so
here you can see we are going to style
this question text fine so we'll write
over
here after this section we are going to
write
dot quiz boox
space section
space qu
okay just a second we have to remove
this from here save it now and here you
can see it looks fine fine so we are
going to style
the footer section as well that's not an
issue so we'll write over here. Q text
now we are going to define the font size
font size is going to be 25
pixels and then we have the
font weight font weight is going to be
let's see
500 or let's do it 600 fine because this
is the question text right so we are
going to save it and here you can see
the question text is bigger in size then
we have to modify these options for that
we are going to check the class name is
option list and option fine we have two
classes over here so we'll write over
here dot quiz
box within the section tag we have this
dot option underscore list
class and we are going to
put padding here padding is going to be
20 pixels and zero then we
have else so we need something like we
are going to write
here display display as block F okay now
the next thing thing we are going to do
is we are going to style every option so
we'll write over
here
section do option uncore
list space dot option option is the last
class for each option we have remember
this guys now we are going to write here
background background is going to be
it's the
background okay it's sort of pink okay
that's a different background maybe save
it we are going
to save it and let's do one thing we are
going to write over
here border border is going to be one
pixel
solid
and ink
fine okay it's not
working let me check if everything is
fine or
not go back to
index.html and here we'll see we have
this div classes option underscore list
and the other classes
option so we have this option list and
okay so here's the issue we have to
write it like this and now you can
see okay let me change the Border
color border color we are going to keep
it a
bit here you can see now you can
differentiate between the Border color
right okay so moving ahead let's define
the Border radius so we'll write over
here
border radius border radius is going to
be 5 pixel again then we are going to to
write here padding padding is going to
be 8 pixel and 15 pixel fine then we'll
write over here
margin bottom margin bottom is going to
be 15
pixels and we have the display again
display is going to be
Flex then we have to align items at the
center and we have to justify content as
okay space
between save it and here you can
see okay there's a mistake over here we
have three options which
are correct and the last one is coming
here inside HTML
2.0 let me see this is because we forgot
to close the Dev tag over here our
mistake my mistake basically so you can
see we have four
options and we have the cross mark and
the correct Mark present over here it
looks good I guess so now we are going
to write over here cursor cursor is
going to be
pointer you can see the cursor is also
working
fine now what we need to do
is we need
to use the last child property so what
we have going to do
is we are going to use it here just for
the foot section basically so we are
going to put it like option
list the last child of option is this
HTML 5.0 fine so we'll write over here
last child so we'll write last child
last child is going
to take
margin bottom margin bottom as zero
pixel save it and let's do one thing
let's
add font over here so we are going to
change the font size inside here so we
are going to keep the font size as 17
pixels save it and here you can see the
font looks
good we will copy this from here now and
we are going to put the hover
effect will look nice I
guess so
let's do one
thing we are going to write here color
as
okay so we have to change the color
value save
it okay we forgot to mention
H we are to change the background color
on hovering as well so we are going to
change the background color
to I don't know let's do it
br
cool so what we are going to do is we
are going
to do it
black looks
right
looks fine not the best but fine let's
settle on this so what we are going to
do next is we are going to use the
transition property over here inside
this so we'll write from
position as all at 0.3 seconds with
ease you can see the
transition it looks
cool so let's move ahead
and going to style these icons as well
so we are going to write
here
dot option underscore list
dot option okay we have to write here
option and then we have to write here do
icon we are going to define the height
height is going to be 26
pixels then we have the width as 26
pixel
again then we have the Border
as let's say 2 pixel solid
and
transparent save
it and here you can
see we are going to change the Border
radius as
well so we'll
write radius
is 5
pixels
in let me check what the class name for
these tick and okay so we have one as
ion icon tick and the other one as icon
cross so what we are going to do is we
are going to copy it from here we are
going
to paste it here and we are going to
write
here the color border color is going to
be let's use this
one
okay looks odd so let's change the color
let's change it to this one save it I
think it looks good now or maybe I don't
know you guys can let me know in the
comment section or in the chat section
as well if you
are going through the video live so we
have to write here okay we have used
color twice
so let's do one thing let's make it
color color is not visible
as I thought it will
not let's change the
[Music]
color okay so we have to change the
color
for take
only so we'll write over here
tick save
it check we have to write here dot
basically
it we write here like
this and it looks fine so here you can
see it's green in color not the green V
wanted
all of you guys know
the color code for Green let me know
it's hard so here you can
see the green color is
here
we need to make some changes over here
first so
let's copy this border color from
here paste it
here visible okay we have to copy
RGB so we'll write it over here save it
now and here you can see it's visible
now one thing we need to do is we need
to move back
here transparent we are done with the
Border radius we are going to align the
text at
the center save it looks good we have to
change the font
size font size is going to be 13 pixels
save
it it looks fine we have to change the
line
height line height is going to be 2 4
pixels save it cool we will position
as okay it looks fine I
guess let's change the background color
to white right over
here down let's see if it works or
not okay so here you guys can see it's
working
fine now we have to do the same thing
for wrong answer so we have
the
classes save
it okay let me check what the class was
what was the class I don't know it was
cross not wrong
so we'll write cross over here save it
cross looks fine we need to change the
color and background
color so here we are with red color make
it bright red let's see if it
works okay I guess I need to change the
background color for this
section to be honest so the background
we are going to
keep this
one
I have no idea about the colors so if
you guys are facing any issues regarding
colors then do let me
know okay looks fine I guess I don't
know so now we have to do one thing we
have to change the RGB value here we are
going to make it red Okay cool so we are
going to copy this RGB value from here
we are going to paste it
here we are going to save it so it looks
fine
guys let me check if the code is
correct
okay it looks fine
here we need to make it circular right
so for that what we can do is we can
give the Border radius
as 50 let's try save the program and
here you can see let me change this
green color
once let's save
it copy it from here we are going to
paste it here save it now and that's it
we are done with it right the right and
wrong are doing great not great but
they're fine as of now so basically we
are done with the questions part what
you can do is you can put the question
number over here and that we have to
write over
here one dot save it and here you have
your
question so these are the four options
we are done with the options as well now
the next part we are going to do is we
are going to do is footer so we are
going to write here do
tbox then we are going to write over
here
height it is going to be 60 pixels then
we

whatever width it is then we have the
display display is going to be Flex in

we'll paste it here we are going to
write over
here
[Music]
first okay first okay first child this
is what we are going to write over here

as we are going to mention the font
color as well font color is going to
be white I guess let's check
okay it looks quite big for
now font color is white and the
background color
is
red so we are going to write your
background background is going to
be
red we have return 130 pixel it looks
fine now we have to provide the B radius
as well so we'll write over here
border let's provide the Border first so
we are going to write here one
pixel solid and red the same color
border fine we are going to write here
border
radius order radius is going to be 5
pixels and we have to write
here
cursor cursor as pointer then we have to
write
here
transition okay we have to write here
all
0.3 seconds and
E now we have to put the H effect as
well so what we are going to do is we
are going to okay copy it from here my
bad we are going to paste it here we are
going to use the hover effect so we'll
write hover over here and we'll change
the color on hovering the mouse cursor
over this particular button so we'll
write over
[Music]
here
background background we are going to
put red first and we are going to change
the red color up to a bit that's it
nothing we else we are going to
do make it a little bit darker
because it's not
evident the color we have to change so
we'll
write
border so let's write over here one
pixel solid and we are going to copy
this color from here F save the program
and you can see it looks good now fine
may be good but I'm not sure about this
background color and Border color on
Hover effect so you guys can create it
on your own you guys can use better
colors than me of course so let's move
ahead and now what we are going to do is
we are going to create the result box
but before that let me check if
everything is right or
not next button is done right we need
to see we need to color it as black
that's the thing we
have we forgot on basically we forgot
this this box
footer quiz box footer we have to write
here background is
black okay now we need to change the
color for
this what we can
say question numbers so we are going to
write your
colors
okay within the span tag maybe then it
will work so one of two questions you
can see we need to add an image over
here first of the simply code logo
basically we are going to add or you can
add any other logo as
well so let me check if everything is
fine or
not everything else is fine there one
thing where is this quiz
box right here
display in
line changes nothing but here you can
see that's the change it will get so
basically we are done with this part as
well now the next thing we are left with
is the result
section fine so let me show you what the
result section is
is choose anyone so this is a result
section this is is completed and sorry
you got only this is because of the
JavaScript part how many questions I got
correct or how many questions the user
got correct is because of the JavaScript
part basically we are going to do the
HTML and CSS part right now so let's
move back to our HTML file and we'll put
a comment over
here so basically we are
done this D tag now yeah so we'll write
over
here comment so let's say we are
writing result box so that I
can remember it next time I'll use so we
are going to write here div
class is result uncore
box now within this div tag you can see
we have all these images like we have we
have this Crown icon we have this icon

two more buttons so we are going to use
these buttons now what we can do is
first of all the div tag is closed fine

Crown it and here you can see the crown
at the top right so what we are going to
do is we are going

with this the only thing is remaining is
we need to add the photo over here fine
so let's add the photo first and then
we'll see
we can do so we have to add the photo
over here so we are going to write here
div class
is
one and within this div tag we are going
to write
image IMG SRC is equals to images SL
simply code.png Alt
to write simply
code that's it you can see the image
over here the image
is too big to handle right so what we
are going to do is we are going to style
this image we'll move to this
section okay we are going to write
here
footer now I forgot the class name for
this image the class name was image
one right
here going to be 20 pixels save
it okay the
image

tag or just to use it not an issue so we
have to reduce the height of this image
as
well height we are going to put let's
say 100
pixels it 100 pixels is Big so we are
going to put it 5050
and we need to reduce

button with classes what was the other
class let me check the other class
was uh quit okay it's going to be a new
class basically I guess we haven't used
the quit quit class
yet right so yeah we have the quit class
as well one class is quit and the other
class is restart so we'll write over
here
quit and what's the other button we
had quit qu
so we'll write over
here
quiz
fine let's check it out okay both of
them are here we have to write here quit
save it now okay both of them are here
both are working
fine now it's time to style
them so basically we are going to style
the
whole a result box
fine so this is buttons everything is
fine we are
going here now we are going to style a
result box we'll write the first thing
we are going to write here
is
dot let me check the class name once the
class name is result uncore
box so we have to write here okay _ box
we have to copy it from
here we have to mention this class here
as well at the initial where we
mentioned all the class
names just to bring it at the center
save it now and here you can
see let's move down
and so the next thing we have going to
do is we are going to put the background
color as white now you can see it's
completely visible now we are going to
put the width width is going to be let's
say 450 pixels then we have the padding
padding is going to be 25 pixels and 30
pixels then we have the Border radius
border radius is going to be five pixels
then we have the display as Flex
and we have align item
set
enter and then we have to justify the
content here as well so we'll write here
justify content as space
between we have to mention Flex
direction as well so we'll write over
here Flex direction
as
column see it looks fine so we'll align
the text text as well so let's say we
are going to write your text line at the
center okay my bad text line at the
center now we have
to manage this icon fine so this icon we
are going to manage this icon we are
taking talking about so we'll write over
here result uncore box do
icon on side
100
pixels and then we have
color color is going to
be margin bottom margin bottom is going
to be 10
pixels save it and here you can see it
looks
okay next thing we are going to do is we
are going
to style this text whichever text we
have like you have completed the quiz
and sorry you got only one out of two
questions or one out of five or one out
of three whatever it is it's not our
concern for now so let's do this we are
going to write
here okay do result uncore box
dot complete uncore
text font size font size is going to be
20
pixels and we have to mention font
weight as well so font weight is going
to be 500 save it it looks fine now we
are going to write here
dot result box do
score underscore text
space pan we are going to write here
display
as
Flex okay now we are left
with what we are left with the paragraph
and that's
it dot
score
put margin over here as well so we'll
write over
here margin margin is okay this mistake
we are going to write margin over here
margin is going to be 10 pixels
and
zero save it let's
see let's change the font size as well
we are going to write here font size
font size is going to be 18 pixel and we
have have the font weight which is going
to be 500 pixels again now we can say
500 again so it looks
fine okay now we have to write here
doore uncore text
space span space
p we are going to write here
font weight
as 600 then we
have font we we have let's go back and
let's see whatever things we have so we
have one and two within the paragraph
tag right so we are going to write here
padding padding is going to be 0er and 4
pixels sove it you can see you got only
one out of
two not an issue but let's move ahead
and we are going to write here do
result
the score box P dot buttons we are going
to do we are going to write here display
as
Flex
margin is 20 pixels and
zero result underscore
box do buttons
please
button margin margin is going to be 0
and 10
pixels height height is going to be 40
pixels
and save it once so here you can see
looks fine
right padding we are going to give ping
we are going to give let's see 18
pixels let's do one thing let's not give
padding as like this we are going to do
it zero space 20
piels it now the text is at the
center border we are going to remove we
are going to write
here there is none
outline we are also going to write here
as
none font weight we are going to change
font weight we are going to put it as
500 font looks
good border
radius order radius we are going to
write as 5
pixels border we are also
so let's see what's the Border in this
particular it's solid and blue so it
looks fine I
guess we have to change the cursor as
well so we'll write over here cursor
as pointer
fine we are done with
it
almost done and we have to write
here
transition 0.3 second with
e
these buttons have the same class name
so if you can see here the class name is
restart for replay quiz and quit for
quit quiz and the class name is the same
for exit quiz and continue quiz fine so
that's
why let's do one thing
let's find the other code for buttons
button
restart
so here are the buttons what we are
going to do is we are going to copy
this buttons from here and we are going
to past them together so that you guys
won't face any difficulty or even I also
don't face any have to face any
difficulties so this
is the last part now we are almost done
with the quiz right so what we are going
to do is we are going to write
here the last thing we are going to
write here
is let's write over
here so we have to write here inside the
result
box we'll
write transform
translate
from -
50%
%. we have write here minus
50 and then we have to mention scale

well so we'll write over
here scale so first scale we are going
to write here what
0.9 save
