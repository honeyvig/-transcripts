hi this is basically to explain how
simply you can handle this website okay
so this website is so sensitive first of
all means it is prepared in such a way
it should be so sensitive that's the
first when I compared with the old
website which is very free and very good
in like from the side of the student the
old website is very very good because
you can give it same exam multiple times
you can share the credentials with your
friends and you can ask them to give the
exams you can download everything far
whatever thing and everything but this
website is very very good for ambience
content because you can give exam only
once you cannot download anything you
cannot share your credentials with any
of your friends and this website is so
so sensitive and very very good ok so
how to handle this or how to use this in
a very simple way I am just going to
explain first of all you have to open
this that is double double new W dot MDS
exam calm okay very simple okay make
sure that don't go for any high fighting
just go for your Google Chrome that's
that that will be very simple and easy
rather than going for all other browsers
second thing is preferably I want you
guys to view on the laptop if not then
you can go for any other option and make
sure make sure if you are planning to go
for example this is the site and if you
are planning to add one more page like
this okay so your while doing
examination we will get a message that
do you want to submit because for
example old website few students and not
all but few students they have a habit
of searching some questions on the
Google by opening a separate pace okay
this website is not going to allow you
okay so this course our profits course
so even if you get it out and if you're
planning to open a new pace this website
is not going to permit it's going to
automatically submit for example if
you're giving
this exam on the phone by mistake if we
got a call okay if we got a call and if
the pace is out the score will be
automatically submitted if you if you
open to your what self if you just want
to open your whatsapp another folder it
will automatically submit so this
website is an examination hall in
examination hall you cannot use what sir
in examination hall you cannot call the
friends in the middle it's not any other
thing right it's an exam make sure if
you are planning to give them this side
you get prepared that it should be like
your examination hall I hope it is very
clear thing is first you need to enter
your okay most and preferably I am
generating your passwords basing upon
the email address so just you need to
type your email letters make sure that
whether you have given a starting letter
capital are small when you submit your
email address to us see whether you are
clearing whether you're giving a capital
letter means yes starts with a capital
or small you decide you decide and you
give according to that will generate
password so few people coming with a
capital letter
typing small letter and telling that
password is incorrect so please and this
is a micro-level observation by me most
of the people first time they go with
the right password second time third
time fourth and fifth time they come out
and the users come up with a complaint
that the password is not working and on
micro observation we got to know that
the care you are using some small
letters in the middle of capital letters
they're here in there so be clear
whether you're giving spacings or
everything for every email address and
then goes with the password then just
click on stop it so you'll go to the
next level okay so next level according
to me as we have very limited time I am
nowhere bothered about this pace that is
- pace I may know where bothered whether
whatever may be your gender whatever may
be your category whatever may be your
expired I don't bother okay because it
doesn't matter
much right so the next level is taking
self so next is take exam you have one
block that is neat so you have two grand
exams so now I am planning to take the
second grand exam so I'm pressing not it
started clearly you can see not yet
started if if it is already done you can
see it is already completed I'm going to
