hey everyone i am viva khandalwal and i
welcome you all to our simply learned
youtube channel today we'll be going
over the ado.net and its architecture
but first let me remind you that we have
our daily updates on numerous
technologies so if you are a tech geek
looking for the latest technological
innovation then try subscribing to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
the bell icon so you never miss an
update on simply learn
so now without any further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
we will begin a session with the
discussion on what is ada.net
then we will have a brief discussion on
ado.net architecture following that we
will go into more practical explanation
of ada.net with the help of a demo
finally we will end this session with a
few pointers on ado.net
so now let's get started with the
discussion on what is ado.net
first
ado.net which stands for activex data
object is a database access technology
developed by
microsoft as a part of its.net framework
that can connect to any type of data
source
next it is a collection of object
oriented classes that provides rich data
set assets for the development of high
performance table
and expandable databases
systems for client server application as
well as distributed environments across
the internet and internet
then we have adio.net reads writes
updates and deletes data from a data
source using sql queries and stored
procedures
at last we have sql queries are executed
using the ado.net command object
which yields data in the form of either
data reader or dataset objects
next let's go over an
architecture
now this is what an adr.net architecture
would look like it comprises of two
parts a data provider and a dataset
then the data provider then gets divided
into four classes
they interact with the database
we have
a connection class
a command class a data reader class and
a data adapter class
let's go over them in detail
first connection class
we utilize these connection classes in
area.net to access the database
transaction and collection
cooling are also managed by these
connection types a connection object
connects a data source to a data adapter
via command class
when you make a connection you need to
provide a data provider and a data
source
next we have command class
the command class has methods for
storing and implementing
sql statements as well as stored
procedures sql queries
can be executed to return data to a data
set and a data reader object
then we have the data reader
to retrieve data we utilize the data
reader
it works with the command class run a s
sql
select query and then retrieve the
results
the data reader object delivers a robust
read-only forward-only approach
for retrieving data from a data store
as a
data stream
while remaining connected to the data
source
then at last we have the data adapter
the data adapter object is a link
between the data source and this data
set
the data adapter is aware of the data
set and how to update it
the adapter is also aware of the data
source connection
it may also be used to manage the
connection between your application and
the underlining database table
views and stored procedures
now
let's address the next part of the
ado.net architecture
the data set let's address the next part
of adr dotted architecture a data set
this comprises of a data table
collection and a data relation
collection
let's discuss them in detail
adio.net heart is a dataset the data set
is nothing more than a collection of
data table object each object in turn
comprises of collection of data column
and data row object
the data set additionally has a relation
collection for defining the
relationships between data table and
object
now
let's go to our visual studio and try to
create one of these entity data models
now let's start by creating
a new
project we will select an asp.net web
application
we hit next
we will name it
adio.net
demo
make sure to select
dotnet framework 4.7.2
and create
we will choose mvc
and click create
now let's start connecting to a database
we'll go here
then for server name we will use
local
db
um sql
local
tv
and for the database name
i will use
simply
adiod net
demo
and i'll click ok
now it is asking us to attempt to create
it
because it thinks either it does not
exist or i don't have a permission so
let's create it
and now here is our data
if you look closely we don't have any
table yet
so let's
make a table
so
let's right click
and select add new table
let us name this table as student
we can also use this side
so
let's name this a student id
since it is it will be our primary key
this key represent primary key
so we won't allow any nulls
next we will have a student name
it can be a null
as for the person we can use
nvr care 50
then we can have student fees
peace
we will give it
at last let's have a student city
this will also be nvr care 50.
these are all gonna be a null
so now let's update this
yes
this will create
everything now update was successful
next
let's add a and you get package
so i will right click here and just
select manage and you get packages
now i will go to browse
and search
for entity framework
here it is
i will use
5.0.0
and i'll hit click
click ok
i accept
and it's installed
let's build this one
okay it's built
now add an adr.net data entity model
for which what we are gonna do here
so we will
let's close this first
now we will right click on our project
name
we will go to add
then new item
here we will go to data and we will
select ado.net entity data model
we can name it
adio net
demo
model
now click add
we will use ef designer from database
because we are already creating the
database
so we'll click next
we'll select this
we can keep this as is or we can
name it
anything
let's keep it as is
since we are using 5.0 so 5.0 next
we will go ahead and select all of all
these tables
okay
then
we will click on finish
this will create an area.net
data entity
let's wait a minute
and here it is this is our area.net data
entity model
if we had created more
uh tables then this navigation
properties will have another table here
now let's get back to our slides
finally let's conclude this session with
some pointers on ado.net
first
ado.net provides a unified collection of
object oriented classes
there are several data providers that
operates with various data sources but
the programming methodology for all of
these data providers is the same so if
you know how to deal with one data
supplier you should have no trouble
working with others
it's as simple as modifying the class
names with connection strings
next we have ato.net which provide a
coherent collection of object oriented
classes
there are several data providers that
operate with various data sources but
the programming methodology for all of
these data providers is the same so if
you know how to deal with one data
supplier then you should have no trouble
working with others it's as simple as
modifying the class names and connection
string
next
data is cached and sent in xml format
via ado.net
this data may be shared by all
components and apps and it can be sent
via various protocols such as http or
https
at last when designing a web-based
application
and service to significant consideration
of performance and scalability because
of connection capacity restriction and
continually rising traffic transferring
data from one source to another via the
internet is an expensive process
using disconnected cache data in xml
solves both of these issues
and this was all for today's session
