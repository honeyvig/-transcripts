1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:02,580
solo there and welcome to the tutorial

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,770
my name is Hannah Bakshi and this time

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,029
we're going to be going over a new

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,370
playlist which is called Tammy's tips

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,950
and this time as by the name suggests

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm going to be telling you tips about

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,809
tutorials I have done previously or I am

8
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,810
yet to do and so these tips will include

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,140
stuff like frequently asked questions

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,760
questions that I got that are really

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,130
small but they are significant actually

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,300
lots of people do ask this question and

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,669
just basic stuff like that so let's get

14
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,540
started and so today my question comes

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,750
from VIN so actually he's working on a

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,780
bigger project which I might create a

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,890
part two on maybe but actually his main

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,860
question for this specific time was

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,050
first of all he can't that he doesn't

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,340
want to buy a hosting provider so

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,149
instead he wants to host locally and

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,789
because he's hosting locally how do I

23
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,170
make a DRI our testing device actually

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,700
connect to that local server so first of

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,140
all let's get started and let's just see

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,570
how a basic network would have worked if

27
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,369
we were to connect so first of all this

28
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,650
is your laptop or actually let's just

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,030
draw a desktop because it's easier to

30
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,310
draw um actually so we have a bit more

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,840
space because I'm going to be drawing

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,460
something here I'm going to erase this

33
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,369
you all know his name now and so yeah so

34
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,930
this is the desktop it's just saying

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,689
something here a power button okay so

36
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,790
this is our a specific level the desktop

37
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,119
here now that we have this desktop let's

38
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,210
just say we have our router here our

39
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,479
there

40
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,250
now that we have a router oh we can say

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,580
that this ah desktop is connected to

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,100
this router so now let's just do

43
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,750
something like okay we have another

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,800
iPhone testing device here now there are

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,630
a few exceptions to this rule that I'm

46
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,770
about to tell you and so this is your

47
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,380
iPhone and this is connected to your own

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:43,570
router and so on your other end however

49
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,630
you have some other users and these

50
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,900
users are users over here and so let's

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,910
just say this is number one user number

52
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:05,750
one user number 2 and user number 3 so I

53
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,680
can give you some examples now first of

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,650
all what would happen usually is first

55
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,360
of all you are running a server here on

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,860
your ah desktop here ah

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,800
and so this is connected to your router

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,959
and this means that if you were to

59
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,590
access from this I device of completing

60
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,570
work however before I continue let me

61
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,040
just tell you there are two different

62
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,709
types of IP addresses there's the public

63
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,830
and there's a private the private IP

64
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,590
address is the IP address that only you

65
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,660
and devices within your local network

66
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,920
can see and access however a public IP

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,500
address as the name suggests is an IP

68
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,800
address that both you locally and people

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,560
outside can access only if it's port

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,750
forwarded I'll explain what that means

71
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,180
in just a second so this means that this

72
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,640
specific um what you call it your server

73
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,660
has a private IP address and let's just

74
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,440
say it's 0.0.0.0 and this is like a

75
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,660
desktop local service local servers sort

76
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,840
of thing and so this has an IP a private

77
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,360
IP address of zero point zero point zero

78
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,919
point one now let's come over here again

79
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,630
these are not real IP addresses these

80
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,389
are just fake so you get the point and

81
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,490
let's just say our public IP address now

82
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,169
let me just tell you all devices will

83
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:38,210
have the same public IP address as long

84
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,199
as they're connected to the same router

85
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,889
because this router assigns them this IP

86
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,710
address so let's just say it's one point

87
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,970
one point one point one now of course a

88
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,290
private IP addresses would start with

89
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,540
something like 192.168 and stuff but I'm

90
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,030
just giving this as a little example for

91
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,389
now and so just to give it as a little

92
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,030
clearer demonstration so now as you can

93
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,800
see we have the phone we have the server

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,300
and we have our router all with

95
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,510
respective IP addresses and so now let's

96
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:19,880
just say that our iPhone over here wants

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,570
to access 0.0.0.0 now first of all we

98
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,630
have seen that this is a private IP

99
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,440
address what this means is that it's in

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,289
its our it's in it it's sorry it is in

101
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:38,840
our own local network we do not need to

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,169
go searching for it elsewhere and so

103
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,070
this iPhone will send a request to the

104
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:53,630
router over here then what's going to

105
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,580
happen is the router will process this

106
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,360
and it will send a request to your

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,500
desktop or local server and it will go

108
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,380
through the server then your server will

109
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,610
process and get whatever is required and

110
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,830
then continue back then again your

111
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,590
router will process this and this will

112
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,650
go back again I'm not exactly telling

113
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,810
you like point by point whatever is

114
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,599
happening inside this is not exactly

115
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,560
what's happening for for sure but this

116
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,780
is just a simple demonstration of how

117
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,900
this works

118
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,520
just go through the router as a little

119
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,210
bridge come back and go back it's that

120
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,600
simple and so now let's just say our

121
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,030
user number one wanted to access our

122
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,150
server how would we do this

123
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,970
well first of all as we know how the

124
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,560
internet works let's just say there's a

125
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,919
few nodes here here here here here here

126
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,810
here here you don't need to really care

127
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,510
about these these are just little dots

128
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,270
where some nodes are and these all have

129
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,430
IP addresses then these will link us to

130
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,130
get to this router so let's just say

131
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,960
user number 2 I'm not going to start

132
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,270
with user number 1 yet

133
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,210
goes and tries to access this server to

134
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,870
get some information first of all he's

135
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,720
going to need this public IP address and

136
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,039
there's one major flaw with this which

137
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,289
I'll tell you so he's trying to connect

138
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:40,740
to one point one point one point one now

139
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,900
how will he do this first of all of

140
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,400
course this DNS will take care of

141
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,169
everything and stuff and then he's going

142
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,389
to start to connect from here to here to

143
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,810
here they here to here to here and then

144
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,510
finally to the router again this is not

145
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,250
a cure just a random depiction of this

146
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,900
and so what would happen is now this is

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,030
accessing the router

148
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,180
however our router first of all it does

149
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,479
not know where it needs to go it doesn't

150
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,370
know if it needs to go to this iPhone it

151
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,900
doesn't need to know if it needs to go

152
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,220
to the server doesn't need to know if it

153
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,139
goes if it needs to go to another device

154
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,970
it doesn't know this because we haven't

155
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,070
given a port which I will talk about

156
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,099
later but let's just assume that it knew

157
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,990
that it had to go to the server then it

158
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,669
would actually try it's best to go

159
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,459
however it has a little wall in between

160
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,560
which will prevent us from going forward

161
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,829
and so our connection is invalid and

162
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:47,270
user number 2 is not able to

163
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,310
however there is something called port

164
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,029
forwarding what is port forwarding mask

165
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,440
let's take this little blank area to

166
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,779
explain first of all let's just draw a

167
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:07,579
router here okay and this is draw a few

168
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:14,070
boxes maybe for now there are actually

169
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,019
actually first let me explain there's

170
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:22,260
ports 1 2 3 & 4 and so what's happening

171
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,180
now uh is that first of all ports go

172
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,540
from a few hundred a few ten thousand to

173
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,820
a few utter hunt at ten thousand these

174
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,510
are not accurate ports just as a

175
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,070
demonstration again and again port

176
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,810
forwarding varies from router to router

177
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,709
it doesn't strip set of rules that you

178
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,420
can follow for every single router to

179
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,370
port forward so unfortunately you can't

180
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,079
do that however this is the basics of

181
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,560
how it works so let's just say someone

182
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,959
tries to access port 1 this will be

183
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,310
denied because port 1 is closed port 2

184
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,639
is also closed port 3 is also closed and

185
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,829
4 4 is also closed now let's just say we

186
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:10,350
were to send requests to each one they

187
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,660
would all deny it and we would get no

188
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,199
result now let's just say we were

189
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:22,380
unblock number 3 now if we were to send

190
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,079
a request it would go through on to our

191
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,620
router our router will process this and

192
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,160
it will say ok 4 3 is open on this

193
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,670
server and so what that means is I have

194
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,970
to go to the server make it process send

195
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,000
it back through this entire network so

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,420
how do we make this work well let's see

197
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,320
first of all what we're going to do in

198
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,410
order to make this work and so this is a

199
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,270
example without port forwarding without

200
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,500
port forwarding this is a complete

201
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,310
message jumble however if I were to port

202
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,310
forward and if a more smart number one

203
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,920
user were to access for example okay

204
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,500
let's just go over here and for this

205
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,960
specific computer we have unlocked port

206
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,530
number I don't know eight zero zero one

207
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:17,150
dot so now what we're going to do is

208
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,530
we're going to come over to user number

209
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,230
one and let's just say he tries to

210
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,590
access one point one point one point one

211
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,170
but wait how do we tell it that we have

212
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,830
to access port eight zero zero one well

213
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,270
to do that we just write a colon eight

214
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:41,180
zero zero one or the port number and so

215
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,410
what this is going to do is it's going

216
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,960
to tell us exactly where we need to go

217
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,840
and exactly how to get there and how to

218
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,250
come back and so since eight zero zero

219
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,590
one has been opened the router will

220
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,150
actually allow this connection so let's

221
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,490
just say number one goes from here to

222
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,780
here to here to here and then to here

223
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,910
and then here and then it reaches the

224
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,910
router actually let me just erase number

225
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,130
twos path so that you can actually see

226
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,040
number ones path it's a bit confusing

227
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,250
isn't it confusing for me as well

228
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,250
okay

229
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,079
okay

230
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,769
so now

231
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,650
as you can see not only one has made its

232
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,970
way to the rubber no surprise however

233
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:44,830
there is still a wall but within that

234
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,130
wall there is a gap and this gaps name

235
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:57,340
is eight zero zero one and so what this

236
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,290
means is that eight zero zero 1

237
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,810
corresponds to specifically this server

238
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,150
and so since we have sent a request from

239
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,930
user number one over here with port 8 0

240
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:20,290
0 1 where we've sent the request with 4

241
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,100
8 0 0 1 and what this means is it will

242
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,210
travel all the way to our router and it

243
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,310
will find the gap in the wall that says

244
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,260
8 0 0 1 and so once it finds this little

245
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,320
gap it's going to go through it's going

246
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,060
to go through this little server it's

247
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,260
going to process its information go back

248
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,290
through this little tunnel back this

249
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,710
entire path and user number 1 will have

250
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,630
gotten his data that's exactly how that

251
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:00,070
works now let's see user number 3 why

252
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,860
did I choose 3 users you may ask well

253
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,000
let's just see why it's actually quite

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,910
interesting why it's because I wanted to

255
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,170
show you something which is if you were

256
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,100
to access a different port for example

257
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,930
maybe if we were to access port number

258
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,680
oh I know 80 which is actually most

259
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,080
actually not 80 that's a really common

260
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,840
port let's just go with um 3000 okay

261
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,090
let's go with for 3000 we're trying to

262
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,670
access port 3000 and so let's just say

263
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,520
for 3000 is right here

264
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,560
that's the gap that's the part of the

265
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,980
wall that is labeled 3000 so when to

266
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,589
happen user number 3 is going to start

267
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,260
he's going to connect he's going to go

268
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,410
through this entire map and he reaches

269
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,300
our router now what's going to happen is

270
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,660
since their quest was sent from 2 to

271
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,660
access port number 3000 it's going to

272
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,890
search for 3000 ok 3000 Oh 3000 now see

273
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,140
this is blocked it cannot break through

274
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,050
this wall so it goes back and says that

275
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,600
sorry the request was not able to be

276
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,120
handled

277
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,270
however user number three's problem can

278
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,660
be solved either by also opening the

279
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,700
port 3000 but also it can be sold and

280
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,350
are not exactly sure if all routers have

281
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,029
this but there is an option where you

282
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,660
can forward all ports actually open all

283
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,600
ports at once which actually does he'll

284
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,209
help in some situations if you're trying

285
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,620
to open all your ports at once if you're

286
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,029
having trouble with port forwarding or

287
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:50,440
something which is actually quite common

288
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,300
thing with Balor's then you can just

289
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,910
open up all your reports at once and

290
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,850
then it will do exactly what it says

291
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,709
open all the ports at once and no matter

292
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,010
which port you access it will always go

293
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,260
to this computer however you can only

294
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,060
turn that mode on for one computer at a

295
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,190
time or else of course the router won't

296
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,649
know whether whether to direct you to

297
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:15,459
this or this doesn't know pretty simple

298
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:20,800
and yeah that was pretty much the video

299
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,470
bin I hope that's really helped I really

300
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,839
hope this helped all of you as well

301
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,100
again if you have any questions leave it

302
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,630
