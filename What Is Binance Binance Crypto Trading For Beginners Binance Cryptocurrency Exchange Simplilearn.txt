hey everyone there are several projects
and assets in the bitcoin and blockchain
industries that are aimed towards
diverse aims
that's not uncommon to come across
programs that try to address comparable
problems for example there are number of
cryptocurrency exchanges despite the
fact that each exchange's structure and
functionality differ
they all attempt to provide crypto
traders with a venue to trade their
assets in a large sense
a cryptocurrency exchange may have its
own asset that is utilized for specific
purposes on its connected exchange such
as trading platform fee discounts and
etc
and the binance exchange binance coin
bnb is one such crypto exchange asset
and that's what we are going to talk
about in this video so hello welcome to
this new video of simply learn on what
is binance
but before starting with the video do
hit the like button and subscribe to the
youtube channel of simply learn and do
press the bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
so let's start the video
let's have a look at the topics that we
are going to cover in this video
first we will explore what is binance
coin
following that we will understand how it
works
then we will dive down deeper and
explore a very interesting concept
followed by binance which is bnb burning
then we will look at the uses of the
binance coin
followed by its benefits
after that we will come across some
important factors to consider before
investing in the binance coin
and at the end
we will see the pricing dynamics of the
binance coin
the first thing that we are going to
explore is what is binance coin
so binance coin or bnb is a
cryptocurrency that may be used on the
binance cryptocurrency exchange to trade
and pay fees
as of january 2018 the binance exchange
was the world's largest cryptocurrency
exchange conducting over 1.4 million
transactions
every second
this coin is limited to
200 million bnb tokens and runs on the
ethereum blockchain using the standard
erc 20 protocol
as an incentive binance coin
users receive a reduction in transaction
cost on the finance exchange
other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin
ethereum litecoin and others can be
exchanged or traded for bnb
now let's move on and see
how it works
bnb is a crypto asset that fluctuates in
value as individuals use and trade it
similar to other digital assets on the
market
bnb can be stored in suitable wallets
obtained from crypt exchanges
and sent directly to others for payments
and other purposes
but there is a whole working initiative
behind this process
binance layer 1 blockchain is merged to
form the bnb chain previously the
binance smart chain and the binance
chain
binance design the blockchain for best
performance when it comes to trading
on-chain when building the bnb chain and
binance dex
it is also based on this newly developed
chain furthermore bnb chain transactions
are powered by the bnb gas token which
stands for build and build previously
also known as binance coin
now bnb beacon chain and bnb smart chain
make up the bnb chain the former is
concerned with bnb chain governance
which allows bnb holders to vote and
stake their coins then it's a consensus
layer that's compatible with the
ethereum virtual machine and has
multi-chain hubs
now moving on let's have a look at the
bnb burn concept
binance uses 20 of its profit each
quarter to buy back and burn
binance coins completely destroying them
finance has consistently performed
quarterly burns the most recent been on
october 17 2020 which was 13th quarterly
burn
binance will continue to burn bnb coins
every quarter until it has purchased and
destroyed 100 million binance coins or
half of the total supply
finance coins supply is reduced as a
result of the procedure and its rarity
is affected which could affect the
assets value
binance also has a program called the
bnb pioneer burn program which as is
cases when bnb holders have
unrecoverably lost bnb and compensate
them them by reducing the amount from
the next bnb burn
now let's have a look at some of the
uses of the binance coin

cryptocurrencies has a variety of
applications outside of the binance
