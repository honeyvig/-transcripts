HTML and CSS are the unsung heroes
shaping the web providing structures
Aesthetics responsiveness and
accessibility for optimal user
experiences mastering these Technologies
is a necessity if you want to become a
successful web developer and we are here
to help you master them hey everyone and
welcome to Simply learns YouTube channel
I hope you guys are doing well today
will take you through the two most basic
yet essential aspect of web development
HTML and CSU both these web development
Technologies are so important that you
can't start your journey as a web
developer if you don't know about them
so in this video we'll cover everything
you need to know and understand about
HTML and CSL but before we begin if you
haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to press the Subscribe
button and hit the Bell icon to never
miss any updates from Simply learn also
if you want to become a full stack web
developer then the postgraduate program
in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with boot
camp level intensity and gain all you
need to be a full stack technologist
this program will give you the
foundation for building full stack web
apps using Java you'll begin the basics
of JavaScript and then Venture into some
of the most advanced concepts like
angular spring boot hibernate jsps and
MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer so let's go through the
agenda for today's video we'll start
this video with an introduction to HTML
followed by basic HTML topics like tags
elements attributes and images and
tables in HTML then we'll move ahead and
cover topics like classes content boxes
and HTML forms once we are done with
this we'll move ahead and cover CSS
topics we'll start with the basics of
CSS like CSS selectors CSS Box model CSS
grid layout and flexbox we'll also see
the difference between grids and flexbox
then we'll cover CSS background images
and colors after that we'll move ahead
and create a navigation bar with the
help of HTML and CSS once we are done
with this we'll move on to Advanced CSS
tutorial
finally we'll create a responsive design
using CSS and once we are done with all
this we'll cover the interview questions
we'll cover HTML and CSS interview
questions and it is rightly said that
you can Master any language just by
programming in it so towards the end of
this video we'll work on a project where
we'll create a job application form
using HTML and CSS so before we start
with the topic let's take a minute to
hear from our Learners who have
experienced massive success in their
careers learning is growing and we not
only decided to grow together in life
but learn and succeed together as well I
successfully switched my career to post
a Java domain with a 15 salary hike and
I was able to grab new opportunities in
my current organization and also receive
a 10 salary hike hey I am swamijit Basu
I am a senior QA engineer at Encore Inc
show me
and Skilling Journey together which
simply learned and certainly we made the
right choice after our marriage I had to
relocate to Bangalore
five years
start my career again and make a switch
to software domain so I enrolled myself
in full stack Java developer program
from Simply learn seeing my wife's
passion for learning every day inspired
me to take up a course on simply learn
as well I've always been passionate
about technology and learning devops was
always in my bucket list when I saw
simply learns collaboration with Caltech
ctme I decided to take a course on PG
devops after the course I not only
switched my career to post that Java
development with a 15 increment in the
salary but now also I can work from home
since it's a software domain and being
the new mom that's the best thing one
could ask for to spend time with little
one during these early years
for me learning devops was fun and
fulfilling at the same time earlier I
had to rely on others at work but after
upskilling myself I single-handedly can
set up the entire blueprint on my code
base alone and get the desired output
and because of that I could grab new
projects in my organization with a 10
percent salary high we enrolled to
upskill ourselves when we were expecting
our first child so upskilling Journey
with simply learn would be undoubtedly
very special to both of us while doing
the course we did come across a lot of
challenges due to the pregnancy but my
wife show me was a great inspiration for
me as she was handling it all together
and she kept motivating and inspiring me
all the way moreover the recorded
classes and the weekend class helped us
maintain the balance between work and
learning apart from work we love to
spend time with our little ones learning
with simply learn was quite a fulfilling
experience for both of us we believe
that growth doesn't happen overnight
rather it's a journey of several
downstairs and upskilling is one of them
so without any further delay let's get
started
now what exactly is the basic web
architecture now web architecture is
made up of three essential elements
that's the website that is the front end
of a web application that is visible to
the user then there is the server which
constitutes the back end of a web
application and holds and manages all
the data and finally there's the IP
address that is the address assigned to
a website in order to be accessible on
the internet
first up let's have a look at what
website is so your browser starts by
loading the main HTML file and then the
CSS and JavaScript
the user interacts with the website and
is not concerned with the backend of an
application now secondly we have the
server once you've developed your
website you'll have to host it on your
server to make it accessible on the
internet
server along with the database contains
all the data of a website and
facilitates user interaction
lastly there's IP address which is the
third element of the web architecture
now website is hosted on an IP address
we put a domain name over that IP
address the same way we put names over
people's phone numbers
when you type a domain name in the
browser it will give you the server call
the server will then send over the
website to you
next what is HTML HTML is the most
widely used markup language for
developing and structuring web pages on
the internet
it defines the structure of websites and
formats these web pages
so what exactly is CSS then
now CSS is a simple design language used
for making web pages look more beautiful
and presentable
it can be attached to any HTML element
to style it or even position it
according to the developer's choice
then you must be wondering what exactly
is Javascript
now JavaScript is a powerful interpreted
language targeted for web development it
is used for making web pages interactive
and bringing the web pages to life
so now let's create your first website
now HTML short for hypertext markup
language is the coding standard for
documents designed for web browsers
consisting of a series of elements or
tags and which can be used to structure
a web page right so these elements can
include headings paragraphs div
containers tables and more HTML tags are
nested meaning there are opening and
closing tags with the content in between
those tags
so now let's write a simple HTML code
that will help you understand the basics
of the language so for this I am using
the text editor that is Visual Studio
code you can go ahead and download this
text editor from their official website
so here I've created a simple dot HTML
file in my vs code and I've added the
initial HTML files
now let me explain to you one by one
now doctype is not so much of a tag but
it is more of an instruction now this
indicates the browser that the document
type to be served to the user is in fact
an HTML document
now this doctype instruction should
always be included at the very top of
your HTML page next up you have the HTML
tag that is used to contain all the web
pages HTML code right so it contains an
opening and closing tag with contents in
between them
the HTML tag can also have attributes
now for example there's the Lang
attribute allowing you to specify the
spoken language of the contents of the
page followed by the HTML tag there's
the head tag now this is the first
section of the code that contains all of
the information about the web pages
properties links and more it could have
Pages title description additional meta
tags and CSS code so here I've used the
title tag and let's give a title say
HTML
in 10 minutes
all right you can also add CSS to the
Head tag by using the style tag and
change the display styles of HTML
elements that are being used the next
section is the body tag now the body tag
contains all the displayable contents of
your web page including headings
paragraphs div containers tables and
more
now the HTML header tags are used to add
headings to a web page there are several
types of headings available for
developers to add to a web page right so
first up let's have a look at them I'm
going to create a simple H1 heading tag
and the message I'm displaying is this
is
the first heading
all right
after this I'm going to add a paragraph
tag which creates padding in the top and
bottom of the element to help separate
the text between each paragraph
right so I'm gonna add a P tag and Save
this is the paragraph tag
[Music]
oh
after this let me add a simple h2 tag
which is
another heading tag and say this is the
second heading
you can also add line breaks which are
helpful from time to time if you want to
provide a single line break in your
content you can do so by adding the BR
tag so here let me just add one for
better understanding
now the HTML div tag defines a division
or a section in an HTML document that is
used as a container for other HTML
elements now these elements can include
content areas sidebars page bars page
headers Footers Etc
this tag is used to apply styles to HTML
elements that cannot be added otherwise
you can also make use of the HTML image
tag to add images to a web page now
these images in a web page are a very
common site and they can make the
website look more attractive so for that
we can use the image tag so say IMG
within which I mentioned the source
foreign
[Music]
logo so let me just mention that here
and then I'm going to provide width for
it and then a specific height
all right so when you save the file and
when you look at the browser
you can see that uh the first heading is
displayed then your paragraph tag is
displayed followed by the second heading
and then the image now let me show you
how you can add styles for some of these
uh headings and paragraph tags so here
in back in my
first heading tag let me just say styles
and let me change the font
of the content that is being displayed
I'm going to change it to Career new
and for my paragraph tag let me display
the content in italics so I'll say font
style and make it italics
so let me save this and when I look at
the browser
you can see that the font has changed
and so has the font style here
before we go through the different tags
present in HTML let's discuss what are
TAG is a tag refers to a special word
wrapped in angular brackets which are
used to define a particular type of
content on a web page after using a tag
in an HTML file the browser decides how
to render or display the content on the
screen the list of tags present in HTML
is pretty huge we'll go through some
basic tags in today's video and we'll go
through the remaining tags while working
with them so let's start with the most
basic tag we have in HTML you can see
here we have a basic program written
over here all the tags mentioned over
here are mandatory for all HTML programs
the first thing we have here is the
doctype as HTML you can see it over here
we have written doctype HTML so this is
not an HTML tag but an instruction for
the system about the type of document
basically we are telling the system that
this is going to be an HTML document so
that all the browsers can know that this
particular document is an HTML document
and work accordingly
the next tag we have here is the HTML
tag you can see the HTML tag starts from
here and goes till n right we have ended
this HTML tag at the end of our HTML
document
now this tag is necessary for all HTML
documents if you are working on an HTML
document then this tag is what we are
going to need the HTML tag represents
the root and the end of the whole
document
this is a container tag that contains
all the other tags within it so this tag
is pretty mandatory in all HTML
documents
now the next tag we have here is the
head you can see the head tag over here
and the ending of this head tag is
present over here we have certain tags
present inside this particular tag now
you can see that this head tag contains
meta tags and the title tag right you
can see the meta tag over here we have
three meta tags and then we have a title
tag as well Now The Meta tags doesn't
appear on the page itself but only in
the pages source code meta tags are
essentially little content descriptors
that help search engines what a web page
is all about now the next tag we have
here is the title the title tag is used
to define the title of a web page
basically we write the name of our web
page inside this tank for example if we
see here the title of a web page is
document formula if we change the title
of this HTML document and write here
something like
first document
fine now save the program open it with
live server now you can see it over here
that the window name is changed to first
document there is no change in the web
page itself so what we are going to do
is we are going to reduce the size of a
vs code and the browser we are going to
keep them side by side here
so that any changes we made in this HTML
document are reflected in the web
browser
other tags we can use inside the head
tag are the style tag the script tag and
the link tag now the link tag is used to
link any external CSS file to HTML page
we have to provide the source of that
file and then any styling changes we
make in that particular file will get
reflected in the web
for that so let's create a CSS file
first what we are going to do is we are
going to create another file over here
let's name it as
style dot CSS now this particular file
has dot CSS as extension this will tell
the browser that this particular file is
a CSS file and we are going to use it
for styling purpose
fine so we have this style.css over here
now we are going to link this with our
HTML document for that what we have to
do is we have to write here
link so this is the tag now we have to
write here run and we have to write here
style sheet fine
now the next thing we have to do is to
provide the source code of this
particular file so for that we are going
to use href href is going to be style
dot CSS now close this link tab now this
rail tag over here specifies the
relationship between the current
document and the link document
now you can see it over here we have
this Rel as style sheet this means that
this particular file is a style sheet
and we are going to use this for styling
purpose
another important tag we have inside the
head section is the script tab this tag
is used to declare or use any script
within the HTML document basically used
for JavaScript so it's not necessary to
use this tag within the head section
only we can use it anywhere but for now
we are going to use it inside the head
the syntax is also easy we have to write
it like
script
SRC now SRC is going to be the file name
so let's add another file over here
we'll write first dot JS so this will
tell the browser that this particular
file is a Javascript file so we are
going to write here inside this now we
are going to write first dot yes now we
have to define the type as well so type
is going to be text and the file is a
Javascript file
so we'll write a JavaScript fine now
close this tag and the script tag will
closes automatically you can see it over
here fine
the script tag is close
keep one thing in mind that we have to
close the script tag every time but the
link tag is not necessary to close
the next tag we are going to discuss is
the body tag
the body tag defines the document's body
now you can see it over here if we go
back to HTML page you can see the body
tag over here now the body element
contains all the content of an HTML
document such as headings paragraphs
images hyperlinks tables lists Etc
there can only be one body element in an
HTML document any tag we are going to
use within the body tag is going to
define the structure of a web page
now the next tag we are going to use is
the heading tag there are six different
types of heading tags starting from H1
and goes till X6 H1 refers to the most
important heading and H6 refers to the
least important the font size of H1 is
the largest and the font size of H6 is
the smallest among all so let's use them
all here what we'll do is we'll write
here H1 now inside this H1 we'll write
this is
heading 1. save the program and you can
see it over here we have a heading in
our web page which says this is heading
similarly we have the h2 tag as well so
if we write here H2 and inside this if
we write this is heading
2 save the program you can see the
change in the font size you can see the
difference over here the font for H1 is
greater and the font for H2 is a bit
smaller than H1 similarly we have H3
and for H3 we are going to write here
this is
heading 6. 3 fine then we have H4 as
well so we are going to write here H4
and inside this we are going to write
this is heading
4. fine similarly we have H5 and H6 as
well so we are going to mention them
first here so we'll write here this is
heading 5 and finally we have
H6
which is used for heading 6 so we are
going to write here this is heading
6. fine save the program and you can see
the difference in all the headings over
here the size for H1 is the largest and
the size 4 heading 6 is the smallest we
can use any of these headings according
to onions
similarly we have the paragraph tag as
well in HTML it is used to write a
paragraph or any content within the web
page the syntax is simple we have to use
the P tag for that so if we write here
p and now inside this paragraph tag
whatever thing will write so let's say
we are writing here this is a first HTML
document
fine now save this program and you can
see it over here we have some text
present in the web browser right so
these are the most basic HTML tags we
discussed in today's video as we said
the list of tags is large and we'll
discuss them while working with them a
simple definition of tags states that a
tag refers to a special word wrapped in
angular brackets which are used to
define a particular type of content on a
web page
after using a tag in an HTML file the
browser decides how to render or display
the content on this screen right
now keeping this definition in mind the
definition of an element in HTML states
that an HTML element is the collection
of a start tag its attributes and antec
and everything in between the tags right
so an HTML element is basically a
collection let's understand this with
the help of an example
what we'll do is we'll write over here
inside the body of this HTML document
we'll write
P fine now this paragraph tag over here
is an example of a tag it has opening
tag and a closing tag so this whole
thing is a tag this paragraph is a tag
over here
now if we add an attribute to this tag
like an ID or a class so what we'll do
for that we'll write here let's say ID
is equals to
Paragon fine this tag now has an
attribute within it ID makes this whole
tag unique we can access the content of
this tag with the help of ID attribute
we'll discuss attributes in detail in
the upcoming video for now let's add
some content inside this tab so what
we'll do is we'll write inside this tag
we'll write over here let's say
this is a
paragraph fine so we'll write your
paragraph
so this is the content of a paragraph
tag now we have four different parts
present over here
we have the starting tag over here so
this is the starting Tech this whole
thing over here is the starting time
then we have attribute so ID here is the
attribute then we have content of this
tag so this is the content present
inside whole tag and then we have the
end part of a paragraph tag so this
represents the end part
right so the combination of these four
things is known as the HTML element
now let's talk about the case
sensitivity of HTML tags so HTML tags
are not case sensitive so you can see we
have paragraph tag over here with small
P present inside angular brackets what
we can do is we can write here capital P
as well so these two things are pretty
same so let's write something inside
this as well so let's say we are writing
here this is
paragraph two fine so this is the
content present inside this paragraph
tag with capital P inside angular
brackets now save the program and you
can see we have two paragraphs over here
the first one says this is a paragraph
and the second one says this is a
paragraph two so what we have to do is
we have to remove a from here
save it now and now it says this is
paragraph two fine
so I hope you guys got that HTML tags
are not case sensitive
fine now let's move ahead and we'll now
discuss empty elements in HTML
most HTML elements have a start tag and
an end tag that indicate where the
element begins and where it ends for
example we have this paragraph tag over
here this is the start of this paragraph
and this is the end part right so this
indicates that this paragraph tag ends
over here
now there is a group of elements that
are exceptions to this rule so these
elements are called empty or void and
only have a start tag since they have no
content present inside the data so they
must not have an N tag in HTML example
of empty elements are
like the Break Tag we have we have image
link and many more such tags the list is
quite long so what we'll do is we'll add
an image using the image tab so image
tag is basically an empty element
so we'll use that particular element and
you guys will understand what empty
elements are
so as mentioned earlier that empty
elements do not require any closing text
so what we'll do is we'll write here
inside angular brackets IMG is the tag
name
then we'll write a SRC so SRC over here
is attribute we'll discuss attributes in
upcoming videos so inside this will
provide the path of our image so let's
say we have
this image present inside
images folder which is a folder present
in a system so where we are saving all
our HTML programs so the next thing
we'll write here is alt alt stand for
alternate so if the image is not shown
over the browser then the alternate text
will be shown so let's say we are
writing here image one
now we'll close this
image tag so that's all we don't have to
close this particular image tag we don't
have to write here like this
so you can see we don't have to write
here like this anything so if we not
write it away that's fine because image
element is an empty element so let's
save the program and you can see we have
an image over here in the browser so the
image size is quite large what we'll do
is we'll reduce the side so we'll write
here
just for now
we'll discuss all these things in the
upcoming videos so don't worry about it
for now you can see that we have an
image over here so this is our image
this particular image is what we have
added using the image tag
so this is done now the last thing we'll
discuss in this video is the nesting of
elements nesting means we can use the
tag or element within another element
for example you can see we have a
paragraph over here so this is a
paragraph which says this is paragraph
two let's add some more things over here
so let's say we are writing over here
tml stands for
hybrid text
backup language
fine
and save the program so this is the
paragraph over here you can see let me
increase the size of our browser a bit
so now I think you guys can see it much
better now what we'll do is we'll use a
particular element or tag within this
paragraph text so let's say we want this
HTML to be cursive and bold in nature so
what we'll do over here is we'll use the
B tag over here so b stands for Bool so
what we'll do next is we'll cut HTML
from here and we'll paste it inside this
B Tech now save the program and you can
see HTML is bold in nature now right
similarly what we can do is we can Nest
one more tag inside this bold text so
what we can do is we'll write here I
now we have to
put this HTML inside both these texts
save this program and you can see the
HTML is cursive in nature now so you can
see we have three different texts or we
can say we have two different tags
inside a particular text this is known
as nesting of elements so we can do it
with HTML as well I hope you guys must
have got an idea about what HTML
elements are and how elements are
different from tags in HTML
now that we already have an idea about
elements let's discuss what attributes
are
let me write the basic syntax of an HTML
element over here first so what we'll do
is we'll write over here
let's use the paragraph tag so we are
writing over here
this is a
basic example
of elements in
htu fine I hope you guys must have got
an idea about what this is this is
actually a basic HTML element we have
nothing else over here just a simple
example of HTML element an element
consists of start Tech and ending Tech
and the content within the day right so
this particular thing is an element
now attributes in HTML refer to the
additional Properties or characteristics
of an element for example if we write
here let's suppose we are writing over
here let's say we are writing over here
ID as
para one fine now save this program and
you can see over here that we have a
paragraph which says this is a basic
example of elements in HTML now we have
this whole element with IDs Parable or
we can give any idea of our choice now
this ID is unique for this particular
element for now you don't have to worry
much about this ID or any other
attribute just focus on what attributes
are we are going through the working of
attributes basically
so we can use the ID of this attribute
to style this particular element so
basically this ID attribute defines what
this HTML element is we have to use the
style tag element or we can say we have
to use the style element for styling
this particular paragraph you will
understand it once we go through the
text so let's do it over you what we'll
do is we'll use the style tag over here
so
we'll write yes type you can see this is
a style element basically it has started
it has ending now I will write some
content inside this particular text so
let's say we are writing over here hash
now inside this what we'll do is we'll
Define some styling properties so let's
say we are writing over here background
color is
red and we'll write here
color so this color here refers to the
font color basically so we'll write here
blue now save this program and you can
see the paragraph in a browser is
changed so what we did here is inside
this style element we access this
particular ID so ID is unique for each
element we'll discuss it later on so
basically this particular paragraph tag
has an ID named parallel so we are using
that particular ID then we have some CSS
properties so these properties are used
to style a particular element so we have
used it over here you can see it over
here if I zoom out a bit in the browser
you can see the background color of this
whole paragraph is red and the font
color is blue fine what we want to say
here is this idea over here is basically
an attribute it is used to identify or
change a particular element we have many
attributes present in HTML so we'll go
through some of them let's say we are
adding an image over here so let's add
an image and you guys will understand
about HTML attributes here as well so
we'll write here IMG so this is
basically an empty element we have
discussed it in the previous part
wherein we went through HTML elements
now what we'll do is we'll write here
SRC now SRC is also an attribute this
attribute is used to provide the system
with the source of a image so if we go
back to this particular HTML folder so
here we have a HTML folder you can see
we have a folder here named as images
and we have an image present inside this
particular folder right so what we have
to do is we have to provide this path
inside a HTML file so what we are going
to do here is we are going to get back
to vs cool and inside here we'll write
images so this is a folder name and we
have a file name html.png present inside
that particular folder so SRC is the
attribute and this particular thing is
the value of our attribute right now the
next thing we are going to do here is we
are going to write here alt now inside
this alt let's say we are writing HTML
over here now this alt attribute is used
when we add an image only so basically
what happens is when we add an image to
a web browser sometimes what happens is
the image is not shown over the browser
so in that case the alternate text will
be shown so if this particular image is
not shown in the browser then this
particular text will be shown so let's
save this program we'll open a web
browser here side by side as well you
can see that this particular image is
present over here in our web browser the
size of this image is quite large we can
change the size in two different ways we
can either use the ID attribute here as
well and then use that particular
attribute in The Styling tag or css file
to change the size of this image or we
can simply use the height and width
attribute in the image tab over here so
that's the simple one so what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here
height height is an attribute we have to
define the height in pixels so we have
written over here 300 pixels save the
program and you can see the height of
this image is 300 pixels now same thing
goes for width as well if we write here
width and if we Define the width Test
300 pixels as well save the program and
you can see now the height and width of
this particular image is 300 pixels
right
so guys this is all about the basics of
attributes in HTML I hope you guys
understood this if you guys remember
when we came across empty elements in
HTML there we saw the Syntax for image
tag in HTML actually the image tag falls
under the category of empty elements in
HTML that's why we saw it there as it
means that this particular tag in HTML
does not require any closing tag to work
it has attributes we'll go through them
in a moment before that let me clear
this one thing to you guys
any image we see on a web page is not
inserted into that page instead it is
linked to a web page what the image tag
does it holds a space for the referenced
image you will understand it much better
in a while so let's go through the
syntax of adding an image or attaching
an image we can say to a web page using
the image tag is not at all a task for
the user it's the easiest thing to do in
HTML we can say that so what we'll do is
we'll write here inside the body tag
what we are going to do is we are going
to write a ime so this is the tag and we
already know that this is an empty
element so it does not require any
closing tag
now inside the image tag we have to add
attributes so we'll write here SRC so
let's discuss some important things
before we move ahead you can see over
here that we have used the SRC attribute
inside the image tag this is a necessary
attribute while using the image tag in
HTML voice
this attribute specifies the path to the
image any image we want to attach to our
web page needs to be stored somewhere
either in the system or it can be
anywhere on the internet as well
so let's move back to the main folder so
what we are going to do is we are going
to move back to our main HTML folder so
here we are inside the HTML folder now
what we are going to do is we are going
to make large icons over here
so here we are in the HTML folder you
can see we have all the HTML files over
here right here we have an image named
python so if we double click on it you
can see this is an image and the name of
this image is python right so what we
are going to do is we are going to click
on it right click basically go to
properties and here you can see we have
the name of a file and then we have the
type type here is PNG
PNG means portable Network Graphics it
is basically an extension for images and
pictures so HTML do support other
extensions like jpeg GIS SVG and many
more other extensions so we can use any
of those files with those extensions
now to attach this image to a web page
we need to provide the path to the
system through which the system can
understand that this particular image is
stored in this part of the system or the
drive fine
so the path you can check here is at the
top of this window
click on it and you can see the path
over here so this is the path so this
python file is present inside the C
drive users then we have a name this
folder name as caution based then we
have desktop and HTML fine so this is
the path of a image
let's move back to vs code and we don't
need the whole path as of now because
the current HTML file we are in right
now is present inside the HTML folder so
we don't need to specify the whole path
as of now
all we have to do is we have to write
the file name here inside the SRC
attribute what we'll do is we'll write
here the file name so a file name is
python Dot speed fine so this is a file
name save the program and you can see we
have an image over here on the browser
the size is quite large as of now we'll
see how to manage this thing after some
time
for now let's reduce the size of the
whole webpage what we are going to do is
we are going to reduce the size and you
can see the whole image over here fine
another possibility is we can store all
the images inside a single folder so
here if we go back to HTML folder here
you can see we have a folder named
images Right double click on it and you
can see we have different images present
over here we have three different images
basically HTML CSS and JavaScript we can
use any of these images
so let's get back to vs code again and
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to access any image from that
particular folder fine so what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here after this IMG then SRC now inside
SRC we have to write the folder name
first fine so we'll write here images
then we'll use slash and then we'll
write the file name so we have three
different files over here this is the
benefit of using vs code we have all the
three files we can use over here so
let's use css.png as of now close the
image tag save the program and you can
see the image over here so let's do one
thing we are going to use
the BR Tech use it now
save the program and let's use it once
again
so that it will be easy for us to
understand so here we have two different
images the python one and the CSS one so
basically what we have to do is we have
to give the correct path of that
particular image fine
so the next attribute we will discuss is
the alt attribute or we can say the
alternate attribute let's write it over
here first
what we are going to do is we are going
to write a alt press enter and write
something over here let's see we are
writing over here CSS so this alt
attribute we have here provides an
alternate text for an image if the user
for some reason cannot view it so
basically it can happen because of slow
connection and error in the source code
or in the source we can say
or if the user is using a screen reader
so it can be any of these reasons but if
the user is not able to see that picture
then an alternate text will come at
Place fine
so the value of the alt attribute should
always describe the image so that's why
we have written over here CSS so that
the user can understand that this
particular image over here is a CSS
image or it can be basically anything
that describes the image fine
so let's do one thing here what we'll do
is we'll make an error over here in the
SRC attribute let's change the file name
away let's say this is the file name
that's a simple error right nothing
major over you let's save the program
and you can see the image is not here
anymore fine
so I believe you guys might not be able
to see because I have to increase the
size for that
so
so you can see here now there is no
image present at this particular part of
a web page because the source is wrong
so this file name is wrong basically
instead of that we have text present
over here which says CSS fine so this is
how the alt attribute works in the image
tag
for the end talking about the actual
size of these images over here we can
change the size of these images in two
different ways so let's start with the
easier one first what we'll do is we'll
use the height and the width attribute
just like the source and Alternate
attributes we have these attributes are
also used within the image stack all we
have to do is we have to write here
right height is let's say 250 pixels and
then we have width as well
so width again is let's say 250 pixels
save the program and you can see the
image height and width is now 250 pixels
we can do the same thing for this file
as so what we'll do is we'll write here
width as let's say 100 pixels and
height as again 100 pixels save the
program and you can see the size of this
image is 100 pixels in width and height
now fine
another way of using these attributes is
to use them within the style tag we can
use this tag anywhere in the program
although this tag is related to CSS and
we can also Define these things in CSS
files but as of now we are not talking
about that concept so we'll stick to
HTML only so what we'll do is we'll
write here to use this style tag but we
have to do is we have to write here
style now what we want to do is we want
to access the image tag so we have to
write a IMG curly braces now we have to
define the properties inside here fine
so what we'll do is we'll Define the
width over here as 500 pixels
and height as well fine
it is again going to be 500 pixels now
one thing to notice here is this image
stack or these properties will be
applied on both the tags because we are
using tag over here fine so we are
changing the properties of a tag so both
the image tag will be affected save the
program and you can see the image size
are now changed both are 500 pixels so
let's do one thing
let's remove it from here and this as
well
now change the size to let's say
200 pixels and 200 pixels save the
program and you can see we have both the
images over here both are 200 pixels in
width and height so this tag is also
working fine
what we summarize from this is we can
use these attributes within the image
tag itself or we can use the style tag
to change the style of the image
so these are some of the basic
attributes we can use within the image
tag in HTML I hope you guys got it try
it by yourself and let us know if you
face any problem a table is a set of
data elements that allows us to store or
represent data into rows and columns
just like we create tables in normal
life for representing the data the same
table we create in HTML as well a table
consists of rows and columns we can
arrange any kind of data like text
images links other table Etc into rows
and Columns of cells
fine the table tag in HTML is used to
create a table so let's do it here side
by side and you guys will get a better
idea of what we are talking about here
so let's create a simple table first
we'll discuss each step here so what
we'll do is we'll write here inside the
body tab
we'll create a new text so this table
tag this is a table tag whatever data we
want to put in the table will go inside
this table tag only
now save the program and you can see we
are not able to see any table here
so we'll see it in a while now let's add
some data here first we know that a
table consists of rows and columns right
the table row tag defines any Row in
HTML or in a table we can say the Syntax
for it goes like this what we'll do is
we'll write over here inside the table
tag on we will write PR now this PR
represents table row fine
one thing to notice here is we are
nesting one tag inside another tag the
table tag is responsible for creating a
space for the table the table row tag is
used to add a row to that particular
table
now the next step is to add columns
inside the table each row can contain
one or more than one column the table
data tag is used to add data in columns
so it might sound a bit confusing at the
moment but let's do it over here and you
guys will know how easy it is to add
data in column what we have to do is we
have to write here simply
TD TD stands for table data and we have
to put the data inside this TD tag TD
means table data Tech and this tag
represents a column in material fine so
let's write it over here
R1
comma civil fine
let's give some space over here as well
then again we are going to use the TD
tag
so we will write a R1 comma
fine
now here we are we have added two
columns inside the first two so let's
check the output now save it and you can
see we have the data over here
this is basically the table data R1
means Row 1 c 1 means column one and
similarly R1 means Row 1 c 2 means
column so this is a single row with two
different columns fine
now we are not able to see the structure
of the table right in order to get the
structure of the table we have to
include an attribute inside the table
tag what we have to do is we have to
write here inside the table tag
we have to write here border and inside
body we have to mention the Border width
so which is basically one pixel right
now save the program and you can see
this border attribute will show the
Border all around the table and the same
fine
we can change the width of this border
by changing the value of Border over
here so for example if we write it 10
pixels and now if we save the program
you can see the Border changing
so this looks nice right so for now
we'll write here one pixel only so this
is the table border moving ahead let's
add another row over here first what
we'll do is we'll use the table row tag
again and the rest HTML will take care
of
we can add a row in a table anyway in
the HTM keep this thing in mind until
the table row tag is nested inside the
table tag HTML will manage to add the
row in the table fine
what we'll do is we'll write here after
this table root X we are going to add
another row so we are going to write a
TR
now inside this we have to write some
data or we can say we have to include
some columns so this is going to be the
root 2
so we are going to write a R2 C1 for
column one
and then we'll write here TD again
we'll write here R2 then we have
C
Phi now save the program and you can see
we have another row over here which says
R2 and C2 and R1 and C1 obviously
so adding rows and columns seems an easy
task now right I hope you guys got it
moving further we'll now discuss the
table heading tag so every time we
arrange some data in the table we need
some reference to that data right let's
say we are creating a bill for a
restaurant what we need in that bill are
the name of the product and the price
fine
so we need to mention it at the top of
each column to do so we need to use the
table heading tag the Syntax for this
tag is pretty easy what we have to do is
we have to write here after the
first table rotate the Syntax for this
tag is pretty easy what we have to do is
we have to write here before the first
table rooting so we have to write here
only because this is going to be the
heading so it has to be present at the
top of the table before any row and
column we have to add another row over
here now inside this row we have to
mention headings fine so we have to use
the table heading
text so the syntax is this now we have
to write here the first heading so let's
say
first heading is item
and then we have the second heading as
price fine save the program and you can
see we have two headings over here
now let's change the tables data first
and we'll create a bill for some
restaurant let's say so what we are
going to do is we are going to add
another column over here in each row so
we are going to add a column let's say
it's
as our number so it's going to be the
serial number
then we have to change the data here
only fine
so we'll remove the data from here
from each row basically so we'll remove
this as well
and we'll remove this as well fine now
this is going to be the first row after
let's save the program once and you can
see over here we have empty cells
present over here we have three headings
serial number item and price let's work
on the first row now we need another
table data tag so the serial number is
going to be 1 for first row
let's say the item name is t then we
have the price so let's say the price is
going to be
rupees 20 save the program and we have
our first row over here
now for the second row we have to put
the serial number as two then we have
coffee or let's say
black coffee then we have to use another
table data tag now we have to mention
the price the price is let's say
34 black coffee
and we are good to go with this as well
we are going to copy this whole row from
here
and to paste it here the CLM is going to
be three the item name is let's say
cappuccino so we'll write here
cappuccino
and the price is going to be a little
higher than black coffee let's say 64
cappuccino
and then we are going to add another
item over here fine so the serial number
is going to be 4
instead of cappuccino let's try it here
espresso then let's change the price to
90.
save the program and you can see the
table over here it looks nice right
now we have three columns the procedure
is the same and you just saw it right
just like we added the table heading
here in this table similarly we can give
a caption to the table as well like here
we can write the restaurants names or we
can write the bill or anything we want
so that particular caption will be
present at the top of the table so what
we have to do is we have to write here
at the top before this
table rotate before the first row we
have to write here caption caption is
another tag now we have to write here
let's see the restaurant name is
x y z
restaurant save the program and you can
see the caption over here as Xyz
restaurant fine
now the next thing we are going to
discuss in this video is the row span
and the call span attributes suppose we
want to merge two cells and create a
single merging two cells means let's say
we want to merge these two cells find
this one and this one so for that we can
use the column span attribute or the row
span attribute fine
so for example let's suppose we want to
print the grand total of all the items
for that we don't need the serial number
so what we can do is we can merge the
first two columns of this row with the
help of call spec so we are going to
create another row over here and we are
going to merge these two columns fine in
the new room so what we have to do here
is
we have to write here
after this row we are going to add
another row so for that we have to write
here table row tag and now inside the
stable rotor we have to mention the
table data tag and then we'll write a
call spend call spend is going to be 2
because we want too much
two cents fine now what we'll do is
we'll write here
grand total and we are going to add
another cell so we are going to write a
TD again
so let's add it and the total price is I
guess
200 so we'll write here 200 save the
program and you can see
we have two columns merged over here
fine
similarly we can also use the rowspan
attribute whenever we want to merge two
rules
one thing to keep in mind is we can use
these attributes within the table data
tag only not in any other type for
example
if we want to merge two rules fine so
what we can do is we can write here
Rose pen and we are going to write it to
save the program and you can see these
two rows are now merged fine
so let's remove it for now and save the
program again so this table looks nice
now
the next attribute we have in tables is
the background color attribute we can
use this attribute to change the
background color of the whole table or
of any particular row or column fine
we just have to use the BG color
attribute as per our requirement for
example if we want to change the
background color of the first row which
contains all the heading what we have to
do is we have to write here inside this
first table rotor we have to write here
BG color and this is an attribute now
let's say we want to color it as red
fine save the program and you can see
the the whole row is red in color now
fine similarly we can change the Border
color of the whole table with the help
of Border color attribute we have to
write here inside the table tab
so this is the main tag and we have to
write here
border color is equals to
let's say
yellow fine save the program and you can
see the border is now yellow in color
one thing I want to tell here is we can
change the background color of any
particular cell fine so let's say we
want to change the background color of
espresso fine let's do it let's change
this background color to
ground fine so here we have espresso
inside this table data Tech what we have
to do is we have to write here BG color
and we have to mention here Brown save
the program and you can see it's brown
in color
fine
so guys this is basically how we can
create and add data in a table in HTML
also if you want to become a full stack
web developer then the post graduate
program in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with boot
camp level intensity and gain all you
need to be a full stack technology this
program will give you the foundation for
building full stack web apps using Java
you'll begin the basics of JavaScript
and then Venture into some of the most
advanced concepts like angular spring
boot hibernate jsps and MVC now is the
perfect time to get started on your
career as a full stack web developer so
what is an HTML class an HTML class
attribute is used to specify a single or
multiple class names for an HTML element
the class name can be used by CSS and
JavaScript to do some tasks for HTML
elements
you can also use this class in a CSS
with a specific class with a period
character followed by the name of the
class first selecting elements
so let's jump onto the demo to
understand the classes and ID better so
we are on a Sublime Text Trader
let's add the standard boilerplate of
HTML we'll give the title as classes
and ID in HTML
let's start with the basic example
we'll see how to define an HTML class
so inside the body tag
will add one H1
and will give this
the class name of
head one
we'll add some text here this is the
heading one
now you can copy this part because we'll
need it enough for the lines
so for the H2
this will be the heading 2
for H3
this will be heading 3.
and let's add one more H4
this is the heading 4.
so as you can see we have used the same
class name in all our H1 H2 H3 and H4
so if you save the file and
go to the page and refresh
you'll see the headings are there on the
page this is the heading one heading to
heading 3 and heading 4.
foreign
how we can use this class name for our
starting purpose
so we'll open the style tag here
and you will mention the class Name by
period followed by the class name so
head one
open the parenthesis
and let's set the color to
like sand
and we'll set the font family to set to
it cursive
keep the background color to Black
okay so you can see we have mentioned
the class name dot head head one for our
styling purposes and we have given the
color of Point family and background
color for it so just save the file and
go back
refresh
now you can see we have designed this H1
H2 H3 and H4 using a class tag
now let's use another example with a
different class name
so here only we'll make the changes
let's name this class as H2 this H3 and
let it be H4
now you can style them separately for
the head to
we can set the color
to say light
pink and we can set the font background
color to
red okay
now
similarly for the H3
Dot
H3 set the color to
I don't know what color this is let's
say fujisa
and set the background color to let's
say blue
okay save the file and go back to the
page
now you can see we have designed our H1
H2 H3 and H4 using the different class
name
here's the example of using the
multiple classes on the same code
now one thing you should note that the
these class name must be separated by
the space
there are few points you should know
while working with the class
so the first one will be the class
attribute can be used on any HTML
element
like any HTML element can have a class
name the second point will be the class
name is a case sensitive
head one
and if we change here to say
we keep this Edge as cap capital so this
will be wrong the style won't be
implemented on the page now if you
refresh you can see the style is not
implemented
so the class names are case sensitive
let's change this back
refresh and now you can see our design
is back
so this was all about HTML classes now
let's move on to the idea attribute
so the HTML ID attribute is used to
specify the unique ID for an element of
the HTML document
it allocates the unique identifier which
is used by the CSS and a JavaScript for
performing certain tasks
in cascading stylesheet that is CSS we
mentioned an element with a specific ID
by using the hash symbol followed by the
ID
let's work on an example to understand
this better
so we'll use the same previous example
we'll mention the H1 and this time we'll
use the ID
so ID and will name it as head one
this is the first heading
foreign
only
head one
this is the
second heading
now to style The Heading we'll go back
here
will open the style tag
and we'll use the hash chamber to
mention the ID so hash
head one open the parenthesis
we'll set the color to
light green
we'll set the font family to cursive
and we'll set the background color
to Black
okay now save the file and go back and
refresh
so you can see this works a similar
manner to the class apart from it that
we use the hash symbol to mention the ID
name
so now let's change the example and use
the different ID name for different Edge
funds
so this can be H1 this can be H2
let's add one more uh we'll name it as
ID
3
okay
so we'll style the
head to
we'll set the color to red
for head 3
will set the color to Yellow
let's use green yellow okay save the
file
go back and refresh
now you can see we have the different
style for different IDs so in this way
you can use the different IDs to design
your HTML page
CSS stands for cascading style sheet it
is a rule based language used to
describe the formatting and looks of a
web page
CSS stands one among the top three basic
languages required for front-end web
development there are three languages
which are HTML CSS and JavaScript HTML
as we all know is used to create the
layout or structure of a web page while
CSS is used to format that web page it
means to make changes in the style of
elements of a web page JavaScript on the
other hand is used to make a web page
more responsive to a user all three
languages together are used for basic
front and web development let's not go
deep into that and we'll now go through
the different ways of adding a CSS file
to a web page we can use CSS in three
ways in a HTML document external
stylesheet Define style sheet rule in a
separate CSS file the CSS files
extension is going to be dot CSS and
then we can include that file in our
HTML document using the link tag another
method we have is internal style sheet
Define style sheet rules in the header
section of the HTML document using style
tag
another one we have is inline style
sheet in this method we Define style
sheet rule directly along with the HTML
elements using the style attribute
remember the difference in internal
style sheet we use style tag and in
inline style sheet we use style as an
attribute so let's go through each of
them practically you guys will
understand it much better
we'll use an external CSS file first
we'll attach it to a HTML document for
that let's write something over here on
the web page first so that we can then
style that particular element so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body of a
HTML document and we'll use a div tag
over here so we'll write here div and
inside this let's write something over
here so let's say we are writing over
here
pending using
external CSS file or we can say styling
using
external style sheet
so this is a basic example of creating a
division save the program and you can
see here we have some text present over
here right the next thing we'll do is
we'll attach a CSS file to this HTML
document using a link tag then we'll
style this div tag in that file on so
let's do one thing first we'll create a
CSS file first so we'll go to this
section We'll add a file and let's name
it as style dot CSS dot CSS is the
extension for external CSS files
remember this guys press enter and you
can see we have another style sheet
present over here so this is empty for
now we just created this style sheet now
let's move back to the HTML file for now
now what we'll do is we'll link this
style sheet to a HTML document for that
the task is simple we use the link tag
so we'll move to the Head section of a
HTML document and we'll write here link
fine so after link what we'll do is
we'll write here a ring and well is
going to be
style sheet then we have
type so this defines the type of a
document so we will write here Text
slash CSS and then we finally write here
href and a sheet name is
style dot CSS fine so we'll write here
style.css close it now
the real attribute here signifies the
relationship between these two documents
which means the HTML document and the
CSS document fine
the type is CSS and the hdf refers to
the source of a CSS file save the
program and you can see nothing happened
over here on the browser now what we'll
do is we'll style this div tag in the
external CSS file we just created
so let's move on to the CSS file and
what we'll do here is we'll write over
here so we are going to style a div tag
fine so for now we'll write over here
dip this is the Syntax for styling any
HTML element fine so let's style it so
let's say we are writing over here
background color as blue fine save it
now and you can see the background color
is changed to Blue
next thing let's change the font color
as well so let's say we are writing over
here
antique white as font color save it now
you can see the font color is also
changed let's add some more CSS
properties
so let's say we are writing over here
font weight so font weight is going to
be
bold then we have let's say font style
so font style we are going to write here
the tank fine save the program and you
can see the text is bolder and italic in
Niche fine next thing let's add a border
as well so we'll write your border
border is also a CSS property so we'll
write over here 3 pixel this is the
thickness of our border then we'll write
here solid this is the nature of our
body and let's say we are writing over
here the color name so silver is going
to be the color name save it now and you
can see this div tag or division we can
say now has a silver border with some
background color and font color as well
the last thing we are going to write
here is text align we are going to align
the this text at the center of a
division save it now and you can see the
text present at the center of word
division fine
you can see the change over here on the
browser we created the layout here with
HTML and then we style the div tag using
CSS we can style any HTML tie here
either with the help of tag name or the
ID and class attribute fine
the second way of styling an HTML tag is
with the help of inline CSS this method
is used to apply a unique style to a
single HTML element
for inline CSS what we need to do is we
need to move
to the HTML file first and here what we
are going to do is we are going to
create another division now fine we
don't need any special tag or external
CSS file for inline CSS or we can say
inline style sheet so what we'll do is
we'll write over here
let's use the brake tag first
to make it look more tidy so we'll use
Break Tag wise and then we'll write here
div fine so
this is going to be another Division and
we are going to write here p
so let's write here styling
a document
using
inline CSS fine save it now and you can
see this division has the same styling
as the previous one this is because we
have used the tag name over here inside
this style.css and both the tag names
are same both have Dev text right so
what we'll do is we'll remove this line
for now now save it and you can see both
of them don't have any style right now
fine so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here again now we are
going to style it with the help of
inline CSS for that we need the style
attribute so we'll write yes type then
we are going to define the background
color as let's say aqua
then we have
so let's make it tidy so we'll apply the
font color as well so let's say the font
color is going to be black for this one
then we have
let's say font style font style is going
to be italic
and then we have font weight onto it is
again going to be bolder we have
discussed all these properties in the
external CSS part as well so let's
mention all of them here so we are going
to use the Border as 3 pixel again
let's say dashed for now so we'll write
here dashed and then we'll write here
the color name so let's say the color
name is gold
and we have the Border as well so at the
end we'll write a text align at the
center
fine so the style attribute plays a
significant role in this type of style
and you can see it over here on the
browser the moment we save we have
another division over here so you can
see it over here this division has
dashboard which is also three pixel
thick and it looks different from the
previous one right so let's mention the
link over here as well again so we'll
write your link
trell is going to be
style sheet type is going to be Text
slash CSS and then we have href href is
going to be style dot CSS fine close it
save it now and you can see the
difference between both the divisions
right the first one uses the external
CSS file and the second one uses the
inline style sheet
okay
the output is almost the same as the
previous one apart from the colors no so
inline CSS is easy to use but it can
make an HTML document look more
confusing and we need to style each
element separately if we use this method
to apply as time to an HTML document it
doesn't matter if we want to apply
similar styling to more than one element
inline CSS can be tricky and lengthy in
such tasks moving ahead let's talk about
the last method we are left with for the
HTML style sheet the internal method so
it uses a style tag inside the head
section of HTML document
so for that what we are going to do is
we are going to remove both these
divisions save it now and we are going
to remove this link as well we are going
to remove the link for our external
style sheet as save it now and you can
see we have nothing over here on the
browser so what we are going to do is we
are going to create another division now
inside this we are going to use a
paragraph so let's say
we are writing over here styling a
document
using
internal
shield fine save it now and you can see
we have a paragraph over here nothing
else
now this method is used to style
elements of a single web page we can
apply the same styling to a bunch of
elements simultaneously with the help of
internal CSS the task is simple so let's
do one thing let's create another
division over here
so we are going to create it after the
Break Tag and
let's paste it here and let's write
something over here as well so let's add
Here style sheet 2 and you can see we
have two paragraphs now these two are in
different divisions so what we are going
to do is we are going to style both the
divisions at the same time or
simultaneously we can see so for that
what we are going to do is we are going
to move to the Head section of our HTML
document and we are going to use the
style tag so style can be used as a tag
or as an attribute as
if we are using inline CSS then we are
going to use style as an attribute and
if we are going to use internal CSS then
we are going to use style as a tag fine
so let's write it over here so we have a
div tag now what we'll do is we'll style
both of them so we are going to write a
background color as
let's say red for both of them then we
have color which refers to the font
color so let's say we have the font
color as black again then we have font
weight font weight is going to be bolder
then we have
font style font style is going to be
italic save it now and you can see the
difference in the browser both the div
tags have same styling as of now now the
next thing we are going to write here is
border fine so we are going to write
your border let's make it 5 pixels this
time we are going to write you solid
again and let's change the Border color
to
let's say we have yellow fine so we'll
write a yellow save it now and you can
see the Border color is yellow
so the last property we are left it is
text align we are going to align it at
the center save it now and you can see
the difference on increasing the
browser's size you can see the
difference the text is aligned at the
center of both the divisions fine
this method is also good to use if you
want to style any particular web page
only
I hope you guys must have understood all
the three methods of using CSS by now
the question that arises now is which
method we should use to keep the whole
document neat and clean the answer to
this question is external CSS this is
because external CSS allows us to style
multiple document at once it keeps a
HTML document clean and less prone to
error as well so I want you guys to use
all the methods and then let us know in
the comments which method you like the
most or which method you are more
comfortable working with JavaScript is a
lightweight scripting language used to
make a web page more interactive and
livelier to the user it is one of the
most popular scripting languages present
in world today it's almost impossible to
cover the whole of JavaScript in one
small video because JavaScript in itself
is an interesting topic in this video
we'll go through the ways to attach
JavaScript with HTML and some basic
examples of what this language can do
so to include JavaScript in an HTML
document we can either keep the
JavaScript code in a separate file and
then include it wherever it's needed or
we can just Define functions inside the
HTML document itself using the script
tag
let's go through both the cases one by
one firstly we'll create an external
Javascript file the benefit of using an
external Javascript file is if we are
going to define a functionality which
will be used in various HTML documents
then it's better to keep that
functionality in a separate Javascript
file and then include that file in your
HTML documents it will help us keep the
HTML document neat and organized as well
so a Javascript file always has a DOT JS
extension and the script tag is used to
attach a Javascript file to an HTML
document
let's move on to the programming part
directly and then we'll see what we can
do with JavaScript let's create a
Javascript file first
so we'll go here and we'll click on
create a file now we'll create a file
let's say the file name is going to be
new DOT JS dot JS is the extension here
and we have the Javascript file now
it's time to attach the JavaScript file
to a HTML document we'll use the script
tag after the body so what we'll do is
we'll move here and we'll write here
script
now inside the script tag we need two
attributes first one is going to be SRC
SRC is going to be new DOT JS as this
file is saved in that same folder the
next attribute we need is type so we'll
write here type type is going to be Text
slash JavaScript
fine so SRC here defines the path where
a file is actually saved and type
defines the type of file that is
Javascript in this case so we are done
with attaching the file now let's move
on and make a web page a bit interactive
to the user fine we can write small
functions known as event handlers and
then trigger them using HTML only adding
responsiveness to a web page means
defining an event that will tell the
system to perform a specific action upon
calling sounds a bit confusing right so
let's understand it with the help of an
example we are all aware of adding
buttons to a web page right so if the
user clicks on a button then what should
happen we can either create a pop-up
alert on the button click or we can do
whatever we want
so let's create a button here first and
we'll then add functionality to it fine
so here we are in a HTML document we'll
create a button over here so we'll write
over here button and let's say the
button name is going to be external for
external file save it now and you can
see we have a button over here on the
browser fine
now click on it and you can see nothing
is happening as of now so let's add some
functionality to this button now for
that what we'll do is we'll write here
inside the button tag will define an
event first so let's say we are writing
over here on click and we'll call a
function on button click fine so let's
say a function name is going to be
message
and save it now fine
what we are doing here is we are asking
the system to call the message function
on clicking this particular button let's
define this message function in a
JavaScript file now so here we are in a
Javascript file now we need to create a
function named message fine so we'll
write here function
message and this is the Syntax for
creating a function in JavaScript now
we'll write over here alert
inside alert we'll write button
clicked fine so here we have this
message over here now this alert is a
method present in JavaScript for
creating pop-ups save the program and
now click on the button over here you
can see we have a pop-up here which says
button click you can see the message
right over here now
the number of such things we can do with
JavaScript is uncountable let's move
ahead and we'll see another method of
using JavaScript with HTML the internal
script method we can use for this this
method is useful if we want to use
JavaScript for a particular file or a
particular tag we can write a script
code directly into a HTML document
usually we keep the script code in the
header section of the document using the
script tag otherwise there is no such
restriction and we can put a source code
anywhere in the document but inside the
script tag so we'll move back to a HTML
file and we'll create another button
over here this time we'll use the
internal script tag to add functionality
to it fine so we'll move to the body
section and here we are going to create
a button so we'll use the break tag
first
again A Break Tag now we are going to
create a button
then the button name is going to be
internal save it and you can see we have
this internal button over here as well
click on external and you can see we are
getting a message click on internal you
can see nothing is happening as of now
now to add functionality to this button
we need to add an event first so we'll
move inside the button tag and we'll
write here
on let's say mouse over so this is
another event we have in JavaScript
we'll see what this event can do in a
while so we'll write over here
the function name so let's say the
function name is going to be internal
for this particular button save it now
and now what we are going to do is we
are going to define the JavaScript part
fine
we'll move to the Head section of a HTML
document and we'll write here
script the script tag will remain the
same in both the cases here you can see
we have defined the srcn type but here
what we are doing is we are using it
internally so we'll create the function
over here only so we'll write over here
function
internal and this is going to be the
body of this function and we'll write
something over here inside the alert box
so let's say we are writing over here
internal
script tag fine
save this program and move back to the
browser now you can see the moment we
take a mouse cursor over this internal
button a pop-up will appear with the
message internal script tag you can see
the message over here fine this is
because of the on Mouse over event we
used
so guys we went through both the methods
of adding JavaScript to an HTML document
I hope you guys got it although
JavaScript is a very long topic to
discuss it is a language and if you want
to learn it then you can go through a
channel and find the JavaScript playlist
here before we move on and start
creating the layout of any web page
let's discuss what a layout is a layout
refers to the arrangement of things in
HTML a layout refers to the arrangement
of elements in a way to make the web
page look more neat and clean to the
user
creating a layout also allows us to
manage the content present on a web page
more effectively and efficiently you can
think of it right a well-planned website
is easier to manage and edit if we have
an idea about all the sections present
on a web page
we have used the header and footer text
before along with some more tags like
nav and section to create the layout of
a web page this time we are going to use
the table tag to create a layout and
then we'll use the div and span tags as
well for the same so we are going to use
two different methods for creating the
layout of a web page we'll use a bit of
CSS as well to differentiate between the
different sections of the web page so
let's move on to the programming part
directly and we'll create a first layout
a question May pop up in your mind why
are we using tables for creating the
layout it is because tables are already
arranged in columns and rows so we can
utilize these rows and columns in
whatever way we like
so let's understand it with the help of
an example now if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
so what we'll do is we'll move to the
body tag of a HTML document directly
we'll remove this H1 tag from you and
now we'll write here
table so we are going to use the table
tag first now let's style this table a
bit well right over here with width is
going to be let's say 100
and then we'll Define the Border as zero
fine
so we have used these two CSS properties
for the stable tag here now close the
table tag and you can see we have the
whole table element here now inside
table tag we need the table rule fine PR
tag we can say so we'll write here Tia
now inside TR we need the table data tag
to mention the data inside the table
so what we'll do here is we'll again
style this table data column or we can
set table data tag so we'll write call
spend calls pen is going to be 2 and
then we'll write
time fine we are going to style the
background color over here so let's say
the background color for this is going
to be
agree fine so let's use green yellow
instead of green
and now inside the table data we need to
mention a heading so we'll write over
here H 1 and inside this we'll write
this is the
title of a
web
page fine now save this and you can see
over here
we have this division or we can say
block with the heading this is the title
of a web page so if I increase the size
of a browser you can see this is the
title of a webpage we have this over
here fine
now what we are going to do is we are
going to come out of this table data and
table root tag because we are going to
use another table row tag for another
section of the web page so we are going
to write here
TR
now close this TR tag let's style this
as well so we'll write here we align
and we are going to align it to the top
fine save it now now we have another
table row
so we'll write over here table data
again so we'll write here table data
now inside table data we need to style
this table data tag so we'll write over
here
Style
and
we'll write
width again so width is going to be 100
for this
and then we'll write over here
background color so background color is
going to be
let's say Aqua let's change this
background color a bit from here you
know we can do it in visual code so
let's change it to this the RGB value
will change for this background color
now we have to close the table data tag
as well so the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to put the content
inside this
so we'll write over here
inside the
bold text so we'll mention B over here
let's say this is going to be the main
menu
so we have this bold over here now we
are going to use the break tag again
so we'll write over here this save it
now and you can see we have this main
menu present over here fine so you can
see
now let's do one thing what we are going
to do is we are going to mention here
100 percent the width and save it now
let's see if this makes a change and you
can see now both the divisions have full
width of the web page fine so the next
thing we are going to do is
we are going to do HTML and
then of course we are going to put a
break over here
then we'll write here CSS again a break
we need
then we'll write here
python let's write each of them in
capital letters so we are again for this
as well then we'll write here
JavaScript
are again so this is basically the
content of a web page save it now and
you can see we have this main menu
present over here fine
now we are done with this table data tag
as well so let's move on and we'll
create another table data tag inside
this same table row so what we are going
to do is we are going to cut this
section in two different parts the left
part is for the main menu and the right
part is for the
other things fine so let's Zoom it out
again and we are going to use
the table data tag here again
so
we have the stable data tag and now what
we are going to do is we are going to
style it we are going to write here
inside this style so let's say
background color we are going to mention
so let's mention any color over here
we'll write you purple and then we'll
change the color from here
let's make it light purple and save it
you can see nothing is happening over
here on the browser or you can see this
purple color over here it's smaller in
size as of now right so let's do one
thing mention the height and width as
well for this particular block so we are
going to write here after this
width is going to be
100 pixels
and then we'll write here
height as well height is again going to
be let's say 200 pixels fine for this
box and
we are done with it so let's mention
over here something
so let's say we are writing over here
tutorials
present in the website fine all this
thing refers to the content we have in
our website so save it now so you can
see we have two sections present over
here in a website for this particular
section we have the main menu sections
and then we have the tutorial section as
well so now let's do one thing let's
move back here again and now what we are
going to do is
we are going to add another table Row
for the footer section for the bottom
move section of a web page so we are
going to write here t d
again then we need call span call span
is going to be 2 again then we'll write
here Style Style will mention the
background color background color is
going to be let's say
red this time
let's change the color a bit because we
want light colors so let's choose this
color over here and you can see it over
here it's
not completely visible but it is here so
let's do one thing let's
mention something inside this box as
well
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write here
this and now inside this table data we
are going to use a paragraph tag so
inside the paragraph tag let's write
something so let's write copyright
because this is always mentioned over
here so let's say we are writing over
copyright
ABCD save it now and
here you can see we have copyright
written over here let's put it in the
center for that we need to move back to
this style attribute and we have to
write here
text align at the center save it now and
you can see the text is aligned at the
center now you can see the layout of
this webpage we designed this layout
using the table tag and we have all the
tags present within the table tag we
have the table row table data tag and we
have the table tag as well so this is
the complete layout of a web page fine
let's move ahead and we'll create
another layout this time we'll use the
div and span tag for creating the layout
we'll create a new file for that layout
we'll create a file so we'll move here
and we'll write here how to dot HTML
save it now and you can see we have
another file over here fine let's
do this and we have the HTML code over
here the basic HTML code now we'll move
to the body section directly
and what we'll do is we are going to use
the div tag and the span tag for
creating a layout fine so let's open it
with live server once and here you can
see we have this document so let's write
the code now so we'll use the Dev tag
for creating divisions so we'll write a
div style is going to be
the width which is going to be 100 fine
so let's write over here 100 now this is
the main division fine so we are going
to create the layout inside this
particular division all
so we'll use another div tag inside this
particular div tag we'll write here div
Style style is going to be
the background color we have too set so
we'll write your background
color so background color is going to be
it's a blue wallet let's change the
color from here
have it now and you can see nothing is
happening as of now
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to mention the width over
here as well it will take the hundred
percent width of
whole div tag so we'll write you 100
percent
and we'll close this tip tag fine so we
have this ZIP tag now we have to mention
our content inside this depth so we'll
use the H1 tag again and we'll write
here this is the
title of a
back page fine
so we have this save it now and you can
see we have this division present over
here it says this is the title of a web
page
and you can see we have this whole
section present over here which
basically refers to the navigation bar
of any website so this is the layout
first now what we need to do is we are
going to create the whole layout so we
need different sections right so we are
going to use the Dev tag again for
creating another section present in a
web page so we'll write here diff now
inside this div what we are going to do
is we are going to use style first so we
need to mention the background color
again so the background color is let's
see
this this is the gray color and then
we'll write here height of this
section so height is we are going to
write here 200
pixels then we have with as well so
we'll write here width width is going to
be
100 pixels fine
and we'll write here float as well float
is going to be left
now let's mention the data inside this
so that you guys will be able to see it
now what we'll do is we'll
create another division inside this
division
and we'll write here in
block letters or we can say bold letters
Main
men fine we did the same thing in the
previous layout as well now after this
we'll write here all the languages we
have so we'll write here HTML
then we'll put a Break Tag over here
then we have
CSS
then we'll put a Break Tag again here
then we have python so we'll write here
break again and then we have
JavaScript fine
so we have this div tag over here it's
almost done
now save the program and you can see
float left means the whole division will
float at the left side of the whole web
page so it's basically we are taking the
division and we are putting it in the
left hand side of a web page if we write
your float as right the whole division
will move to the right hand side of the
web page you can see it over here it's
on the left hand side we can also put it
at the right hand side as well
so let's create another section now so
for that what we are going to do is we
are going to use another div tag
so we'll write here
div
now we need
background color height width and Float
properties again fine so basically what
we are going to do is we are going to
copy it from here
we are going to paste it here close the
div tag and that's it fine
now what we are going to do is we are
going to mention something inside here
so let's take the text from the first
layout we have
so let's write tutorials present in the
website here copy it from here paste it
here
and that's it fine let's put it inside
the paragraph there so that it's not
confusing for you guys
save it now and here you can see we have
tutorials present in the website present
over here fine so before we move ahead
let's change the style of this
particular section so for that what we
are going to do is we are going to
change the height and width so height
will remain 200 pixel but the width we
are going to change let's skip it 350
pixels save it now and you can see it
over here fine
so you can see we have this
whole section present over here so we
have put our main menu at the left hand
side then we have tutorials at the
center and then we can keep something at
the right hand side as well
so let's do one thing let's move here
and we will create another section now
so what we are going to do is we are
going to copy this div tag from here we
are going to
paste it here
again now we are going to change some
style so let this time we are going to
write your float as
right
fine
then we'll change the width and height
as well width is going to be 100 pixel
and height is going to be 200 pixels
save it now and let's see the change
over here you can see we have this
layout or we can see say this section
present over here
and I guess it looks fine now at 175
percent we can also use this space as
well fine so let's do one thing
let's create the bottom side of this
layout first and then we'll discuss what
we can do fine so here we are we need
another Dev tag now for the bottom side
or we can say for the footer section so
we'll write here Dev Style style is
going to be again the background color
we are going to mention so we'll write
here background color
background color is going to be let's
say
blue
blue is good and then we'll write here
here is going to be both
and then we'll write here text align
text align at the center for aligning
the text to the center of a division now
inside this we are going to use the
paragraph tag again and we are going to
write here
copyright ABCD save it now and move back
to the browser you can see it's present
over here
now you can see many things are wrong in
this particular layout so how we can
correct them what we can do is we can
increase the size according to our needs
so let's increase the size of these
sections a bit and we'll see if it works
or not so let's change the color for
this section first let's make it red and
now we are going to change the width of
this particular
section save it now
and you can see it's greater in width so
it went down now what we need to do is
we need to remove the width by F bit so
let's write here 350 pixels
save it now let's see and it's a bit
more
again and now we'll write here 300 let's
see if it's working
and you can see it works fine now it
looks fine now right so what we can do
is we can change the width of each
section according to our needs that's
how we can create the layout of any
webpage so guys here we have seen two
different methods of doing the same
thing we created two layouts one with
the table tag and the other with the div
and spend time in my opinion the letter
method we went through is a bit simpler
because the only thing we need to keep
in mind while working with the div and
span tag is the area fine we need to
keep the width and height of any
division in mind if we are clear with
that then we can create the layout very
easily so that's why we prefer the
letter method to create layouts for a
web page also if you want to become a

responsiveness of a web page May refer
to different scenarios let's go through
the meaning of responsiveness first in
web design adding responsiveness has two
different meanings one is done with the
help of JavaScript whenever we go
through a website and we see something
happens on a button click it refers to
responsiveness as well we use events for
it right let's suppose we go through an
e-commerce website and try to purchase a
product whenever we click on the buy now
button something happens right it either
takes us to a different web page or
opens any kind of pop-up regarding the
scene this phenomena is called the
responsiveness of a web page and we use
JavaScript for that this was for your
reference that if someone says
responsiveness then you should not get
confused we are not going to discuss it
in today's video responsiveness in HTML
means creating a layout in such a way
that it will be adjusted automatically
to different screen sizes and viewports
let's take an example here to make it
easier for you guys let's say we have a
website opened on a desktop
what we want to do is we want to open
the same website on a mobile device as
well but at the same time we want all
the content to adjust automatically
according to the Mobile screen
in that case we need to design a website
in such a way that it automatically
adjusts itself to such devices
we can achieve this task using two
different methods we can use CSS media
queries or we can do it with the help of
HTML and basic CSS as well
we'll be discussing the later method in
this video which is the HTML method and
in the upcoming video we'll discuss
media queries as well so don't worry
about it guys
let's move on and start using HTML to
make the content of a web page
responsive to different device screens
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more
for reference let's add an image to our
browser first so what we'll do is we'll
move to the body section of a HTML
document and we'll write here
time so we are going to add an image
over here so let's write here source the
image is present inside the images
folder and let's say we are using space
dot PNG now we need the alt attribute as
well so let's say we are writing over
here
all and space fine
now save the program and you can see
here that we have an image present on
the browser
the image size is larger here right let
me zoom in a bit for you so you can see
this is a image so you can see the size
is quite big according to a brown
now we want this image to adjust itself
accordingly if we reduce the size of a
window for this we need to make some
changes to this picture so what we'll do
is We'll add a class here first so let's
say we are using
class as
responsive fine so here we have a class
now we'll make certain style changes in
this image so we'll use the style tag
now inside it we are going to access our
image so we have a class is
responsive and inside here we'll write
width width is going to be 100 percent
and let's say the height height is going
to be
odd fine save the program and you can
see here the image adjusts itself
according to our window size so if we
increase the size of our browser you can
see this whole image over here the width
of this image is 100 of the screen and
the height is automatic fine now the
moment we decrease the size of this
window or we can say if we increase the
size the image is adjusting itself
accordingly right on increasing or
decreasing the size of a window the
image is adjusting fine we don't need
anything else to make it look more
responsive fine another thing we can do
here is we can use the max width and Min
width properties to make an image
responsive to the window
so what we can do here is we can write
here inside this
we are going to write here as 500 pixels
and we are going to Define Max width
here as well Max width is going to be
let's say 1000 pixel save the program
now and you can see
the image size is 1000 pixel over here
go to inspect element and here you can
see if you take your cursor over here on
the image source button you can see the
rendered size is 1000 into 469 pixels
now try decreasing the size of this
image so you can see it over here we
have this size of a window now take your
cursor over here you can see the
rendered size is 719 pixels now decrease
the size completely now you can see the
rendered size is 500 pixels the image is
not going below 500 pixels in this case
fine
it means that the image will adjust
itself down to 500 pixels only fine now
let's write here 400 pixels for your
reference save the program now decrease
the size of this window so it's at the
lowest and take your cursor over here
you can see the rendered size is 423
pixels it can't go below that because
this is the maximum
size we can go with a browser window
fine so this is how we can make an image
responsive to the Windows screen using
HTML and basic CSS we are not using any
advanced CSS for making an image
responsive as of now I hope you guys got
it so in this video we are going to
create something like this this is the
content box with the icon and the
description of the content box
icons here used is from the font awesome
CDN
so let's start creating
so I have my two files open which is
HTML and CSS
let's add the standard boilerplate
we'll add the content
boxes in HTML
as the title
let's link our CSS file
now inside the body let's add a div
clock container
inside that is class container I'll
create another div box
I will require three such boxes so we'll
copy paste this three times
on the tie sheet
let's set the margin to 0 and padding
also to zero
we'll set the font family
to
San serif
now
for the container
class
will set the position to relative
and will set the width to 200 pixels
which is the whole width of the content
box
we'll set the height to 300 pixels
and will set the margin
to
240 pixels and Auto
for the boxes inside the container
will add the position
relative
and will set the width to
let me explain you what this is
this CSS type function is used to
perform a calculation to be used as a
property value
this is specifically used for the width
of the div classes
it requires a mathematical expression
the result will be used as a value
so we'll be using lot of this type
function here in this code
we will set the height to
300 pixels minus 30 pixels
one property of cat function is that it
takes single expression as its parameter
the expression can be any simple
expression combining the following
operators
plus sub that is addition minus that is
subtraction multiplication and division
we will set the background
to Hash zero zero zero
we'll set it to float left
and we'll specify the margin to 15
pixels
and we'll set the Box sizing to border
box
overflow will be hidden
and Border radius
let's set it to 10 pixels
just save the file and let's go back to
the page to see how it currently looks
so you can see our boxes are in the
proper places we have the background
black with the proper margin between
them okay so we have the structure
let's code more
now we need the icon for that
will require a icon from the font
awesome CDN so we'll add the font
awesome CDM to our page
so we'll search font awesome CDN 4.7.0
we are using the older version because
it is more stable
so go to this font awesome libraries
here select the version and copy the
link tag
go back to the page and add it here
delete this Integrity part
now
here inside this class box
add one div which will be named class
icon
and inside here we'll add the link of
the icon so search here
font or some icon 4.7
go to the first one
here you can search the any icon you
want let me search for
see
information
so I'll go to the information
and I'll copy this
go back to the code and add it here
now inside this I'll create another div
which will be for use for content
so we'll name it class content
and inside this I'll add one H3
info
and inside it
I'll add some
text uh copy this much from here
to there
and delete this whole part
and put it inside
so inside the P tag
add them yeah
so let's go back to the file and see how
it looks right now
okay so you cannot see the icon here
because it is black let's try to change
the color here so that you can see the
icon
so let's set it to ff0
okay so you can see I have the icon in
place this is and this is the text that
we have added to this content box
now let's style this content box first
set it back to zero zero zero
now
antenna dot box
dot icon
will set the position to Absolute
set the top
to zero
left to zero
and we'll set the width to 100 percent
will set the height also to 100 percent
background will be hash f0000
will set the transition
to 0.5 seconds
and we'll keep the Z index as 1 so that
the icon will be visible
okay
it is fresh yeah you can see the icon
here
okay
now let's add the whole effect on that
so container Dot
box dot over
icon
will set that top to 20 pixels
look something like this you have the
background image and this images that I
have taken for example Focus we have
this video button and you click on the
radio buttons we can go through our
images one by one
also the images will change
automatically after sometimes as you can
see
where I have the required images
and HTML and CSS file
so first investment file let's add our
review buttons
class slider
inside this
slice
inside this class right we'll add the
radio buttons so input
the input type will be radio
and let's give this name
radio button
and we'll add them with ID radio one
so as you can see
what is here so we'll add three radio
buttons here
so just copy paste this four times
here use the ID to Radio 2 reducing and
video code so we can distance between
the four radio buttons
so after that we'll add required images
so we'll create another div and limit
class
slide first
inside I'll create an image tag
and special part of the information
we create a few div tags for four images
so just we'll do certainly another term
with class name
slide
inside this image
google.jpg
just save the file and let's view check
our code
we have the rebuild buttons we have the
images so let's just go back to your
file and see how it looks
so it will refresh
we'll see we have the four DD buttons
here and some distorted images
so let's just fix this images in the CSS
will add the body
and we'll set the margin to zero pixels
adding to zero
we'll set the height to say 100 vertical
height
will set the display to flat
uh we'll justify the content to Center
we'll set the Align items to Center
and we'll set the background to Black
so just
refresh this file
so we're starting to fix these images
so just
set the slide of it to
800 pixels
there's an L we'll say this bit not
Windows
this at the height to 500 pixels
they said the Border radius
to 10 pixels
and overflow will keep as hidden
for the slice part
we'll set the width to 500 percent
height to 500 pixels
and displayed to select
let's change the file and see how it
looks on the page
so yeah you can see the images now in a
proper size you have to click this video
button we have the background black
so let's existence
so for the slide input
okay before starting with let's add
common HTML content here
so after I remove the image we have to
create the automatic navigation button
and the manual navigation button
so after this
had another day
the class name
navigation Auto let's see
and inside this navigation Auto will add
Dev
class
or to button one
we need the phone button so we'll copy
it four times
this will be my button two
this will be button free and this will
be button 4.
foreign
outside this they will create another
manual navigation button so we'll name
this
navigation
make sure you spell it right now we
education
manual
and inside this
book we'll add our radio button which
will be manual
the limit class manual button
we need the core button so we will copy
it four times
we change the label to Radio 2
radio 3 and radio 4.
so I think this will work enough so here
we have the navigation
okay we have a spell mistake here
the class and navigation kind of
investor class here
so let's recheck our code
it's a group had to reset your code so
that you don't encounter any error so
okay we have a little class slider here
images
tags with the name slide
okay we have created a navigation Auto
the code buttons and navigation manual
for the four buttons okay
so let's save the file and go back and
refresh it and see how it looks
okay
we have to add some CSS here
so inside the slides
input
foreign
[Music]
effect of the to 800 pixels
and will set the height to say 500
pieces
okay let's save the aisle and let's go
back to see how it looks right now
okay so you can see the images are
properly aligned here
we have to style our radio buttons for
here so let's go back to our CSS
now the code we are going to write here
rule for the manual slide navigation
application
so that so that we will remember the
code
so we'll add the first
class navigation manual
will set the position to Absolute
then enter it to 800 pixels
will not have a height here will set the
margin
so the margin top will be minus 40
Pixies
and just leave it as black
and the justify content
will be sent out
so let's do a and go back to the page to
see how it looks right now
okay the images are in the center you
can see
so go back to our CSS
we'll add the manual version
will set the Border
to save cpix files
solid and red
you can take any color you want
I will set the padding to 5 pixels
now we'll set the Border radius to say
nine pixels
we'll set the cursor to point pointer so
that whenever buttons the personal Loop
has a pointer
and we'll set the transition to one
seconds
see
go back and refresh
so now you can see the buttons are here
not properly spaced but yeah they are
here
so let's add the spacing and everything
else
so we'll take the manual button
we'll set the margin
foreign
button
the Google will be
um save background
the color
blue
just save the file and go back and
refresh
yeah so you can see our manual patterns
are in place
when you hover over it you can see the
blue effects and when you click
nothing happens right now because we
don't have any JavaScript response to
this video button We'll add them in the
end
first let's design these buttons so this
is for the manual button
now we'll add one code which will be
used when you want to select the radio
button by default
so let's understand how this video
buttons work in this file so returns
where two or more options are identified
with some useful exclusive and the user
has to evacue one first previously
[Music]
derivatives
keep all the options visible inside that
user can easily analyze them indicators
are also simple to use for users to have
difficulty making effective mass
movements
so we'll add hash video
dot check
so the sign that we have added here is
more sibling combinator
must come immediately after the first
so we'll add DOT first
and for this we'll set the margin left
to zero
okay so this is your video one
the label that were added in our manual
buttons
foreign
buttons so we'll copy this four times
one one two three and four
this will be my for radio button
and we'll set the margin left here to
minus 20 pixels
or redo button three this is 32k
minus 40 pixels
and for the last button we'll set it to
minus 15 pixels
navigation button now let's design for
automatic navigation button
so we open Dot navigation
will set the position to Absolute
this set that displayed to select
will set the width
to 800 pixels
uh let's justify the content in the
center
and we'll set the margin top
two square for 60 pixels
now it's
so I'll add the file to navigation or
Twitter
so on navigation okay
then set the Border
to same model that we have used here
a little shape it's called solid red
make sure you keep this secret so
soluted and same in both the navigation
Auto and navigation manual because if
you change the color here you will see
the two manual buttons there so for just
example let's change this to Green
so when you see it and go back
and refresh
yeah
you can see the two button there is is
it green and this is red so if there are
two colors the motor buttons will
overlap will not feel good so we just
keep it here red
let the padding to type it first
of the Border radius to 9 pixels
okay
and we'll set the transition to one
seconds
now same code AS here which I've added
for checking of the radio buttons
so we just copy this whole curve
to paste it here
I'll have to tweak some in real
so the class was navigation dot Auto
so we'll add here
navigation or Pro
Auto button one
background
so we'll delete this group
um
background let's say
any color pink
copy this code Ctrl C
delete this whole thing and put new and
just change the radio buttons here this
will be radio button
this will be three
and this will be formed
now we have all the designing in place
now we are already designing in place
let's go back to the code and refresh
so now you'll see everything is good the
background is that the images is
properly aligned we have this button so
let's click
so when you click you see the images
slides this is a photo match
okay
second
and first so if it is ready all that now
is left is to add the JavaScript code to
this image character function in an
automatic manner
so now we'll go back to this HTML file
and below this div tag
and open once click tab
inside this group tag
we create one
variable name counter
set it to one
open we create one function set interval
foreign
you know
does is we have created a one variable
named counter and it will check against
the ID that we have created a radio then
the radio button says checked and it
encounters
the counter will be plus plus at
randomly increase by one
so after the counter has reached to flow
so it will get back to the starting
point that is one so
the whole point of this code is to
make the images slide in in the blue so
the same
and go back
now when you refresh
sometimes
specifically two seconds
now when the images become the last page
it goes back to the first
you can also change it like clicking
here
manually
also if you want to become a full stack
web developer then the postgraduate
program in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with boot
camp level intensity and gain all you
need to be a full stack technologist
this program will give you the
foundation for building full stack web
apps using Java you'll begin the basics
of JavaScript and then Venture into some
of the most advanced concepts like
angular spring boot hibernate jsps and
MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer whenever we go through a
website or fill out a form we see that
there are certain ways of filling a form
right sometimes we use radio buttons to
select one option from a group of
options we use passwords emails check
boxes and many more such things while
going through a form
the input element in HTML is responsible
for adding different input types to a
web page the type attribute within the
input element determines what the user
will input in that particular input area
so let's go through the syntax of input
element first and then we'll go through
the different input types we can get
from a user now the input element in
HTML specifies an input field for the
user to enter data so let's say if we
want the user to enter his username in
that case we'll need an input field
right so what we'll do is we'll write
here inside the form tag we have the
form tag already present here so we'll
write here first
let's say first name and now we are
going to use the input element the input
element in HTML is an empty element so
we don't need any closing tag for that
save the program and here you can see on
the browser that we have this input
field present we can write anything over
here inside this input field so you can
see we are able to write anything over
here
now let's create a small form and you
guys will be able to understand the
concept of type attribute in the input
element
we'll create a form wherein will include
different types of input areas for the
user so first of all we'll write here
first name and input so we already have
this written on a program we use the
label here as first name however we use
the label tag for this task but right
now I don't want you guys to get
confused so we'll keep it like this only
here we have used the label name as
first name so the type attribute will
hold the value as text over here
anytime we want the user to input values
like name or any sort of text value we
use the type attributes as text so what
we'll do is we'll move to our input
element and we'll write over here type
type is going to be text first fine save
the program and you'll see nothing
happening over here as of now you won't
find any difference and this is the
default value of the type attribute as
well so we can write anything over here
like we can write any text value or we
can write numbers here as well so it's
making no difference over here on the
browser now the difference we'll see
when we'll go through other input time
so let's move ahead and we'll now go
through the button type first
or we can say the submit button first so
what we'll do is we'll create a submit
button first fine so we'll write over
here we are going to use the braid tag
for two times and we are going to write
here input
type is going to be submit for a submit
button
and we'll write over here value as
submit fine now save the program and you
can see the submit button present over
here on the browser so this submit
button generally submits the form like
if you are writing anything over here
like we are writing any first name
submit it and you can see the page gets
refreshed and there's no other value now
because the submit button is onward and
it submits the form fine now similar to
a submit button there is one more input
type that also creates a button but the
task is a bit different the value of the
type attribute as reset will do some
important things for us for example if
we write here the same thing so we are
going to use the input tag again and
here we'll write type as reset and let's
give the value as
reset once again fine
close the input element and save the
program so here you can see we have this
reset button present over here now write
something over here like any value or
any name click on reset and you can see
the value of that particular field gets
reset fine we are done with the buttons
now the next input type we are going to
see is the password so passwords are
confidential right so we need something
which can hide the user's password HTML
has an input type as password so let's
go through it what we'll do is We'll add
a label over here like we'll write your
password first let the user know what he
or she needs to do so then we'll write
here input type as
password fine now save the program and
here you can see we have another input
box over here
so let's do one thing let's use the
brake tag here
keep the form neat empty so here you can
see we have password over here if we try
to write anything over here you can see
that particular text or number whatever
we are using in password is encoded so
we can write any name here and here we
have the password click on submit and
here you can see it says check your
password so this an error over here
so you can see the password Here is
encoded and HTML provides us with this
feature moving ahead the email input
type this type of input is used for
emails it validates the email address
whenever the user clicks on the submit
button for example we'll write here
email so we are going to create another
input field we'll use the input tag
or input element we will write here type
as
female fine save the program and here
you can see we have another input box
over here
we'll copy these break text from here
and we'll paste them here save it and
here you can see it looks fine now now
write an email over here or just try to
write a single word so let's say we are
writing over here
will provide the first name as the so
we'll write here Ram then we'll write
here any password let's say fine
so click on submit and here you can see
it says please include and at the rate
sign in the email address Ram is missing
it at that so we'll include at the rate
over here click on submit again and here
you can see please enter a part
following at delete
so it will not allow the user to move
ahead until the user enters a correct
email ID so let's say we are writing
over here at the red gmail.com
submit it and here you can see the form
gets submitted
fine we have been through some important
input still now all of them we discussed
till now are commonly used in every form
we create now we'll discuss radio
buttons so radio buttons allow the user
to choose a single option from a number
of options available for example what
we'll do is we'll go through the example
directly so we will write over here
let's say
input
type is equals to radio and then we'll
write over here
value fine value is going to be let's
say HTML and here we'll write HTML
Okay so
here we are we have our first radio
button
so we'll write here once again input
type is equal to
radio so we have done a mistake over
here we'll write over here value again
value is going to be
CSS and we'll write
CSS here as well now save it and here
you can see we have two options HTML and
CSS let's do one thing let's include one
more over here so we'll write here input
type
is equals to read fine then we'll write
here value and let's say value is going
to be JavaScript
and save it and here you can see we have
three radio buttons present over here we
are going to use the break tag here as
well and here you can see we have three
radio buttons HTML CSS and JavaScript
now if you guys remember we already said
that we can choose any one option out of
all the available options right so we
are not able to do it here because of
the name attribute so for that we have
to include the name attribute here so
let's say we are writing over here name
as language
for
each of them so let's write here name as
language save it now and now try to
click on these ready buttons and you can
see we are able to select only one out
of all the available options we have
fine so the name attribute plays a vital
role while using radio buttons in an
HTML form check boxes also do similar
tasks but we can select more than one
option at a time with checkboxes so what
we'll do is
we'll use check boxes as well so let's
say we are using the label tag over here
we will write here label and let's say
we are writing over here choose here
quick fine now we'll move ahead and
we'll write over here
we'll use the brake tag first and we'll
write over here let's see
input type is equal to check box and
then we have to write here name is let's
say
y equal 1
and that's it so let's use the value
attribute as well so while you are going
to write it bye fine we will write bike
over here then we'll use
input
type is equals
to check box manual
again mention
name here so we'll write your name as
vehicle so let's do one thing we'll
write here vehicle again and we'll write
your value
car and we have to mention car here as
well
do it one more time we'll write your
type
type is going to be check box again and
name is going to be
vehicle and value is going to be let's
say
fine so we'll write scooter over here
and save it now so here you can see we
have three different options for check
boxes what we'll do is
we'll put the Break Tag over here
save it now and here you can see now we
have buy car and scooter although the
name attribute in this case
holds the same value for all the three
check boxes it has vehicle for all of
them so but still we can choose you can
see more than one option at a time so
this is the difference between
check boxes and radio buttons in HTML
the next input type we are going to use
is the date type this type is mainly
used for date of birth but you can use
it for other specific dates as well it
allows the user to select a specific
date along with the month and year so
what we have to do is we have to write
here
let's write it over here let's create an
input box for date of birth for of the
user so we'll write over here
input
type as date fine save it and here you
can see we have this date of birth input
box present over here we can choose date
from this calendar so we can use any
month or we can say any year as well so
let's say the date is
17 February 2016. we can choose the date
from this calendar over here so HTML
gives us this
feature of choosing date and if you want
to select time as so then you have to
write here date time look fine save it
and here you can see now we are able to
select date along with the time so you
can see we can choose time as well along
with the date
so here you can see the date is 5 7 20
22 which is 5th of July 2022 and the
time is 10 43 so it follows 24 hour
format in case of time now the next type
we are going to discuss is numbers this
input type describes a numeric input for
the user it does not allow the user to
input any value other than numbers
so what we'll do is we'll go through the
syntax directly we'll write it over here
after the break tag let's say we are
writing for number
and for this we are writing input
type is equals to number and that's it
save it and here you can see we have
this option of phone number
so let's make it a bit cleaner and now
we'll try to write any text over here so
you can see we are not able to write any
text now we'll try to write numbers and
here you can see it allows us to put
numbers inside this particular input box
we are not able to print text over here
so this is why the input type as number
is used for in HTML the last input type
we'll discuss is the file type sometimes
we need to upload a file while filling
out a form like a CV or something in
HTML we can use the input type as file
for this task so what we'll do is
will take you through the Syntax for
this as well so we'll write over here
select
file and we'll write
input
type is equals to 5. fine save the
program and here you can see we have
this choose file option present here on
the browser we can use it to choose a
file from a system so this is how the
file attribute or you can say file input
type Works in HTML now apart from all
these input types we have discussed we
have some more input types present in
HTML like range week month and many more
we can't discuss all of them in a single
video but whenever we'll go through any
of them we'll definitely take a look at
each of the input types we use so HTML
is not only used for creating the
structure of a web page anymore but it
also provides interactivity to a web
page up to some extent so I hope you
guys will learn something from this HTML
tutorial so just like my previous
example this time I would like to also
introduce you the another very
interesting application which is called
navigation look when we talk about
adjustment based development so in HTML
based development navigation is very
important where you have called multiple
Pages attached to so that when you click
on this page or click on any hyperlink
it will take you to the new page now so
that you can move back and forth so this
navigation is very essential part of any
web development so that you can offer
the navigation so this simple
application of HTML we would like to
start from scratch so let's go and
create a new folder now and give the
name called navigation
and inside this navigation we want to
create some new pages so
here I'm going to create index
dot HTML
the CSS name will be
app.css and along with this we would
like to also create some new folder
inside this I'll keep all the navigation
files inside this so I can save pages
inside this Pages let me have total
number of three pages with me one is
called about
dot HTML
then we create
contact
dot HTML
then we create one more that is called
Services dot HTML
dot HTML so these three links we will
create it one by one but first let's
start with the index.ht
so what's there in my index.html file so
first thing I would like to start with
my same HTML syntax here
all right
well this is my basic construct
so I will start with my link Ariel from
here so that I can have my Starship with
me link audio style sheet href equal to
app Dot see it says go I have not
written anything but I just left it as a
blank
in my body tag I would start with the
navigation so HTML5 brought you some new
tags nodes call a nav tag which is once
again
won't change anything drastically in
your browser however they are called
semantics which will help you for the
SEO that stands for search engine
optimizations I'll start with my nav
inside my nav I will start with my tip
div I'll say navigation bar so but
before that I said
class equal to
headache
this is my Dev tag and inside my tip tag
I want to bring my heading so I say H4
and that's it
navigation bar and after the div tag
I'll start with my URL tag which is the
unordered list inside my
on audit list I can set a like that sent
for list items and I can offer not many
links inside this so you will I just
offer the class
equal to
nav hyphen
and inside this is my array tag I say
okay which is the anchor tag
so
a link href equal to
now here I offer
the name I say index
table and that's it and this will be by
default active so we say class equal to
active
a
class equal to it
active and HTTP equal to index.html file
and here we are from home
for home page I'll copy this line
and paste it for other three urls
so here
the active won't be there instead we say
HTTP code to
the location called pages
under these pages we say about
.html and here we say about
okay copy this
paste it
and all of this about we always say
services.html and here we say
services
you offer
contact
product
okay and once the nav tag is over
I will offer the tip
div class
equal to let's give the name body hyphen
text
I just say H1 tag inside this
and this is the home page
that's it so that's my home page which
is ready with me and along with this
whichever the other pages are also
available
those pages I also want to use so first
of all let me check how this page looks
like it
well it looks like a pretty basic page
so all this page is ready what I will do
is here I copy the content
and paste it here and above and let's
see what's there in my above see few
things will change number one here
this app dots users
now here you have to just use
dot dot
there's an app.cs for me
so you have to offer some title too so
after this link are here
we offer
title this title I can say
okay
so rest everything is fine
so H4 navigation bar Naval links here I
have to offer the links for my base HTML
page so when I talk about index.html
file
okay it won't come so
index or external file so I won't say it
is an active anymore I just remove this
line
plus equal to Vector it's just an normal
hrf but about would be active in this
case so
okay
class equal to
active instead of this
Services contact
is as usual same but I would not be
having any
Pages anymore
because we are in the same location
that's why and here I say this is a
about this is about page
about page
so that's it
I'll go back and check
fatal fine
home is active right now about you can
see it is an about page right now about
page is just appeared as it is saying
contents are more or less looks like and
same that is why you are able to see
now just like that
I will just go back and copy the others
now here
of CSS navigation bar
active
it is in contacts or make contact as an
actor
this is
contact page
so
that's how it is
and we will say about my other
properties which is my
Services let me copy it sorry
copy this contacts
and here
I'll be activating my
service in this case
so
class equal to active I remove it from
here
make it available here this is
a service page navigation index pages
about active yeah or looks good heading
about okay here I change
service
it is a change to
looks fine
let's see
okay
service contact about
so for about we need to check where we
need to go
so we have got pages
about our HTML page is also there
so
all there so we would like to see how
the about page will be activated here so
index.html file also contains an about
so here
but I
refresh
well
we will call
index.ht Page
talk Oracle about
these are about page now
services
so like this it is happening for you
okay so that's how exactly my thing is
so we're all good
and uh
Services contact
well my page is now ready and going
forward we would like to beautify my
Pages by offering the CSS well let's get
started with our CSS file so in my CSS
file I will start with my
common properties
which is margin
I'm saying 0 pixel
followed by adding
I'm making a zero pixel again
again we want box sizing
this I say border
hyphen box
okay well going forward this is my
standard settings for all different type
of properties now I want the other
properties to be getting introduced that
is called box body text
Dot
body
iPhone
text
inside is body text I said display
Flex
now what I see where the body text is
available go into my index.html file
body text is available here div class so
here in my CSS file I can say body text
display flex and I say font family
font family I can give anything
God want
to save it
these two we are offering it later on
align items
anal item Center
followed by justify content
we are making a center
then margin top
pixels
these are the properties out there
followed by
okay first let's check what is an effect
here
see
it looks better now
if you would like to go into the nav I
already have the snap with me
no
display
Flex than just a quick content
space around
followed by align item
align items I want to make Center
and then we want to say mid height
so we say when hyphen
okay so midnight we are giving a3h
followed by background color
reset the same color
and same font family we just copy this
form currently and make it available
here well let's check
there we go so nav bar looks awesome but
I still feel the links needs to be
justified we want to make it even more
better but before that I offer the nav
links so here
I see
nav links so dot nav
hyphen lens
this levelings will have display
Flex
display
s and then justify content
that I want to make it space around
again
followed by width
so
width so width would be 20 percent
perfect and now enough link Li Dot
nav links
Li
this
Style
none
let's see how it is changing
there we go that it looks really nice so
nablings are ready and I want to make it
a heading heading
I want to make it more organized so
let's see about a heading
so here I say dot
heading and inside this heading I say
color
which is white
followed by text
transform
text text transform of her case
followed by letter spacing
this letter spacing will be 5 pixels
and followed by last font size
and the font size is just 20 pixel
that's it and let's see what is
difference here
here awesome so this navigation bar is
now looking great and it is giving me
all the basic operation whichever we
have expected now this nav link
switchover we have created okay they are
working fine but I just want to make it
even more beautiful
and how I can make it more beautiful to
make it I would like to go ahead with
the nav links again
Dot
nav Links of type anchor tag
now I would like to activate my anchor
type by making it color
White
okay followed by text decoration
text decoration
and followed by letter spacing
let us pressing three pixels
and then font weight
font weight bold
and font size
14 pixels
and padding
14 pixels
and 16 pixels
both options
that's it and followed by we want to use
the nav licks when I will hover it so
the color should change so we are saying
Dot
nav links
and here with li
followed by a DOT
active when the anchor type is active
then in that case I want to change the
background color
lights light C green I can say
lights
so
we have this option called light C green
this one right signal that looks
beautiful and followed by same
I copy this
and this active so nav links I like DOT
active background color we are using but
if it is not active then in that case
what you will use
so I can just change the small thing
here
I have changed this color
now let me try to copy this first I tell
you about what I want
to copy this and paste it as usual here
what I see is when it is an active
okay well it is an active I will change
the color to
I think this spelling is wrong active it
should be
active background color I want to change
this to Green so for that we are just
using the color hash
there's a green color when it is an
active and when this is not active so we
can just say a colon
active which is used now now l i colon
active or we can say equal whole
equivalent
over
a colon over and here we say colon not
active that's it
let's see how it works
awesome this looks beautiful home home
is active right now they say it is on a
home page I can see it is an about page
it is service page it is a contact now
you can see it looks even more
in the most basic definition a form is
something we use to take the user's data
for example if the user wants to
register on a website then they have to
give us their names email and some more
info about them a firm takes input from
the user and then posts it into the
backend application for further
processing and other stuff like
validation and all the HTML form tag is
used to create a form
it's quite simple to create a form in
HTM we'll move to the programming part
directly and create a simple form to
start with so the first and foremost
part is that we need to use the form tag
to create a form so what we'll do is
we'll move to the body of our program
and we'll write here form so this is the
form tag in HTML save the program and
you can see here nothing happened on the
browser so this formtech created an area
for a form it basically worked like the
Dev tag we used in the previous videos
now to include data in a form we need
text areas or we can say input boxes in
our form
there are various form elements
available like text field text area
Fields drop down menus radio buttons
check Boxes Etc so let's start using
them in the form here first of all we'll
create a text box for the user's name
for that what we have to do is we have
to write here inside the form tag so
we'll write your first name and then we
have to write here
input so input is another tag so we have
to write a input
and then we have to use the type
attribute so the type is going to be
text for this text box and we'll write
here
name name is going to be
first name
fine
now save this and you can see here we
have an input box for the first name
the same code we can use for the last
name as well what we have to do is we
have to copy it from here
we have to paste it here so we'll use
the BR tag before using it again now we
have to change first here with last we
will write here last
and in name as well we'll write
last fine
so we have this last name over here save
it and you can see we have first name
and last name we have two different text
boxes present over here we'll use the BR
tag one more time save it now and you
can see it clearly now right
so here we are done with the first text
box of us now this input tag over here
is used to create these text boxes and
the name refers to the text boxes name
fine another thing we can do here is we
can write here
placeholder and inside placeholder we
can write something let's say we are
writing over here first name and you can
see first name over here
it's permanent until we write something
inside the Box the placeholder value
will appear on the text box same thing
we can do here as well we have to write
here please hold
so we have placeholder for
last name as well save it now and you
can see the value of placeholder over
here the moment we start writing
something over here you can see the
placeholder value is not here anymore

now there are different types of form
controls that we can use to collect data
using HTML form they are text input
controls we can use checkboxes radio
buttons we can use select box controls
and we can also use file select boxes so
we can use radio buttons in our form for
that what we need to do is we need to
change the type in our form so that's
the only thing that will change no
matter what controls we are using so
what we have to do is we have to write
here
let's say we are using brake tag first
so we'll use two Brake Tags over here in
order to make the whole web page clear
and easily understandable for you guys
so next thing we'll do is we'll write
here
gender so let's write here gender then
we'll use Break Tag again and after this
we'll write
input
type is equals to radio and we can write
here name name is going to be let's see
mail and the value for this is going to
be mail again fine we can use the value
attribute here as well so we'll use it
later now the next thing we'll do is
we'll write here
input again
will add another General so let's say we
have type here is
radio again and then we have name as
female and we'll write here
so save it now and you can see two radio
buttons over here we can check them in
and you can see we have radio buttons
working totally fine we can use these
values later on as well similarly we can
use check boxes as well in our form
we'll see how in the upcoming video
where we'll create something like a
login or a sign up form using HTML only
so there are three different types of
text inputs used on phones we can use
single line text input controls so this
control is used for items that require
only one line of user input such as
search boxes or names they are created
in HTML using the input tag we discuss
them till now so these all are the
example of single line text input
controls which we discussed till now the
next are password input control
this is also a single line text input
but it masks the character as soon as a
user enters it they are also created
using the HTML input tag so the syntax
goes like this we have to write here
after this so we'll use the BR Tech
again over here
and now we'll write here
input so before that let's write
password so this password is going to be
the user's password for our website for
login or maybe for sign in so this is
the password so we'll write a input type
is equal to password and then we'll
write here
name as
password fine save it now and you can
see password written over here with a
text box fine
right inside here will get masked so if
we write anything over here you can see
it in the form of password it will get
masked as soon as we enter it so this is
done to make the password a secret
now we can also set the maximum length
of a password using the max length
attribute so what we have to do is we
have to write here max length
and max length is going to be
let's say eight fine save the program
and now if we write something over here
you can see
and now we are not able to use more than
8 characters inside this particular text
box right because we have defined the
max length as a and it will allow only 8
characters inside the text box fine
the last one we have are multi-line text
input controls this is used when the
user is required to give details that
may be longer than a single sentence so
multi-line input controls are created
using html text area tag the Syntax for
a multi-line input is simple we have to
write here after this so we'll use the
BR Tech
again for two times and then we'll write
here let's see description fine so after
description we'll use
BR tag make it more clear and then we'll
write here
text area so this is the tags and then
we have to Define rows and columns here
so rows are going to be 5 and we'll
write here calls so these two are the
attributes we'll write here 50 this
basically we are defining the area
acquired by this text area fine then
we'll write a name
and we'll write here description
then we'll write something over here so
let's say we'll write over here enter
description here
foreign
[Music]
and you can see we have a text area
present over here it's bigger in size
than the normal text boxes we had
earlier so what we can do is we can
remove it from here and we can use the
placeholder attribute inside the text
area tag to write such thing fine
the last important thing in a form is
the submit button so this button is used
to submit the form data we can either
use the input tag or the button tag for
a submit button fine so let's use the
input tag for creating a button first
what we'll do is we'll write here after
this
we'll write here the
brake tag and then we'll write
input type is equals to button and then
we have
value is equals to
submit fine
save the program and you can see the
button over here on the browser so
here's the button
we can further make this button work
with the help of JavaScript but we are
creating the layout only for now so let
it be this way only the next method we
can use for creating a button is by
using the button tab so what we have to
do is we have to write here just use the
BR tag once and right here button so
this is the tag and right here the name
of
button fine so we'll write here submit
save the program and you can see here
another button fine so here's the button
you can see both the buttons are exactly
same no difference between the buttons

apps using Java you'll begin the basics
of JavaScript and then Venture into some
of the most advanced concepts like
angular spring boot hibernate jsps and
MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer whenever we go through the
login or signup portal of any website we
see that on the login page we use
credentials like ID and password name
sign up page on the other hand refers to
the form we need to fill in order to be
a part of that particular website
so what we'll do is we'll create a login
page and a sign up page in today's video
and we'll see what we can learn from
this field
so without wasting any more time let's
move on to the programming part directly
we'll start with the login page first so
first of all here we are in the HTML
file we'll start using the form tag but
before that we are going to provide a
heading for this login page so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body Tab
and we'll write here H1 so H1 stands for
heading 1. I hope you guys already know
this particular element
so what we'll do is we'll write here
login form fine so we have written login
form over here save it and you can see
we have login form written on the browse
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to style it a bit using the
style attribute we have been through it
already so we'll write a sign now inside
style what we'll do is we'll align this
text at the center of our web page so
we'll write here text
align and will text align it to the
center fine so here we are we are done
with text aligning save it now and you
can see it moving in the browser so it's
in the middle of the webpage now you can
see it over here clearly the login form
is present at the center of a whole web
page fine
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to use the form tag over
here fine so we'll write here
form
and this is a form tag so we are going
to create the form inside this
particular tag only now let's style this
so what we'll do is we'll write here
Style again the style attribute comes
into play so we are going to use the
Border attribute now we are going to
keep the Border 3 pixel thick solid in
nature and let's use this particular
color so we'll write a F1 F1 F1 so this
is white color basically so here you can
see it's not completely white off white
or a bit grayish we can say so here you
can see the form body so I hope this is
visible for you guys
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to use a container so what
we'll do for that we'll use the div tag
we'll style and then we'll move on first
so we'll write here diff
now inside div we are going to use the
style attribute again obviously so we
are going to provide padding over here
now we'll write here 25 pixels so what
is padding you guys repeat so what is
padding you guys might be wondering
about it
padding provides the space between the
border and the content of an element
fine
so the space between the border of that
element and the content is known as
padding so padding is going to be 25
pixel for all the sites so padding is
basically foresight from top right
bottom and left fine so we can provide
all the values or we can provide a
single value for all fine so here
padding is 25 pixel now we are going to
set background color for this and the
background color is going to be
let's say like fine save it now and here
you can see we have a container which
has a border of gray color and the
background color is
kaidu or we can say light fine
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to start creating a
form so here we are inside the div tag
so you can see we have the form tag
first and inside the form we have a
particular division
fine so what we'll do now is we are
going to create a login form so we'll
use the label tag so label text stands
for the label of any form so you will
see it over here so we'll write here
username
and we'll put
column save it now and here you can see
we have username present inside the
container or we can say inside the form
fine
so let's put a space over here save it
now and now I guess it looks fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to create a text box now so
for that we are going to use the input
text so we'll write a input
type is equals to text for this username
and then we'll write here
placeholder placeholder will write enter
username fine
now after this we are going to write
here name
is going to be let's say
username again
and then we'll write here let's say
required so required is another
attribute we have
so what will happen now is if we leave
this box empty and if we don't write
anything over here and if we try to
submit a login form then a pop-up will
appear which says credentials required
or something like that only so HTML
provides us with this feature so save it
now and here you can see we have a label
username and a text box which says enter
username fine similarly we'll create a
label for password and text box or
password fine so we'll write here
label again and we'll write here
password
save it now and here you can see we have
a label for password as well now what
we'll do is we'll write here
again we are going to use the input tag
so we'll write here input type is equals
to password
you guys are already aware of this type
and then we'll write you placeholder and
we'll write here
enter
password file so we'll write a enter
password then we have the name for
password we'll write here
name is equals
to
password and then we'll write here a
required again fine
save it now and here you can see we have
another text box
now so let me make it a little
more here for you guys so here we are
done with the username and the password
the next thing we need is the submit
button now fine the button type is going
to be
submit or we can use the input tag as
well as we did in the last video so
we'll write here
login fine so this is the button name
save it now and here you can see we have
the login Button as well now what we are
going to do is we are going to create a
check box or we can say a remember me
function fine so for that what we'll do
is
we are again going to use the input tag
for that so we'll write here input then
we'll write here type type is equals to
check box
and then we'll write here after this
check check there's a property again so
we'll write here
checked as checked so then we'll write
here
remember fine save it now and here you
can see we have a check box and a
remember me option fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to create another button the
cancel button fine so we'll write here
button button and type is going to be
button again then we'll write here
id id is going to be let's say
cancel button why we are using this ID
because we need this ID in the CSS part
we'll see it later then we'll write here
the name of button is cancel fine
save it now and here you can see we have
a cancel button as well now the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to put some links over here so for that
we are going to use the anchor tag again
we'll write here a
href href is going to be let's say hash
because we are going to write here
forgot password so we'll write here
forgot password
or we can write here forget password
fine
save it now and here you can see we have
a link present over here now what we are
going to do is we are going to use a
break over here and then we'll add
another link for the sign up page fine
so we'll write here a href again
reference is going to be sign n dot HTML
so this is going to be the sign in file
or the HTML file for the sign up page
then we'll write here
register fine
save it now and here you can see
register written over here on the
browser so we are already done with the
login form the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to use CSS for
that so we are almost done with the HTML
part for this login page all of you guys
are well aware of the style attribute
till now right this attribute is used to
change the style of any particular
element let me tell you guys another way
of using this style attribute in HTM we
can use all these styling properties
inside the style tag as well for that
what we need to do is we need to move to
the Head section of a HTML file and we
have to write here
type fine so here we are we are here
with the style tag so what we are going
to do is we are going to style a HTML
document inside this style tag on
fine
what we'll do here is we'll write here
body first fine so what we are doing
here is we are styling the body tag the
whole body tag now fine so what we'll do
is we'll use the font family first so
we'll change the font family we'll write
here
okay we are going to use Gill synth we
are going to use this then we'll write
here the background color so we'll
change the background color of this
pitch we'll write a RGB the RGB values
are
we have to write it in
small letters the RGB values are 1 3
4 comma 1 3 2 comma 1 3 3 fine
we are done with it save it and here you
can see the change
so the RGB values are not working
because we have written RBG over here
instead of RGB save it now and here you
can see the background color is greener
fine so it looks nice
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to style the button so the
button tag we have used here you can see
it over here we have used the button tag
for cancel button and for submit button
fine or we can say for login bit so we
are going to style both of them
at once so we'll write here button we'll
write here the tag name basically so
button is the tag name now we'll change
the background color of this button
which is going to be let's say hash 150
5 FM so guys I'm already aware of these
colors and you can do what we did in the
background color video or you can change
the background color according to you
you can use the color name you can use
the hex values or the RGB values
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to provide here the width
width is going to be 100 of the whole
time fine then we'll write here color
color is going to change the font color
of this button so we'll write here RGB
again
and we are going to write a 2 4 8 comma
2 4 8 comma two four eight eight fine
let's see what it is so here you can see
the login and cancel button are changed
now so the font color is white the
button color is
blue
and next thing we are going to do is
we are going to write here
padding padding again is going to be 15
pixels for all the sides then we'll
write here
margin fine so we'll write a margin
margin is going to be 10 pixel and
0px fine so what is margin guys margin
provides the space between the border
and the outer
there's a difference between padding and
merge padding provides the space between
the border and the content of element so
here in this case this is the content
and this is the
padding fine margin on the other hand
refers to this space between this
element and the next value fine so
margin as 10 and 0 pixel means 10 pixel
from top and bottom and 0 pixel from
left and right fine
the next thing we are going to do here
is we are going to write here border
fine so border will Define as none
save it and you can see the buttons here
now the next thing or the last thing we
are going to write here is we are going
to change the cursor to point on taking
over these buttons you can see the
cursor changed now fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to style the input
tags so we'll write a input
and we are going to style them so we'll
write it type is equals to
we have used a lot of
input tags right so we'll write it type
is equals to text and then again we are
going to write here input
then we'll write here type is equals to
password fine so we have two input tags
for
username and for password so we are
going to style them at once side by side
we are going to style them
so the next thing we are going to write
here is we are going to set the width as
100 percent
and then we'll write here margin again
so we'll write a margin as 8 pixels
and 0 pixels fine
save it now and here you can see the
login form is looking more and here you
can see the login form looks much better
now the next thing we are going to do
here is we are going to dis Define the
padding as well padding is going to be
12 pixel and
20 piece fine
then we'll write a display display as
inline block and we have border over
here border is going to be 2 pixel
solid in nature and we are going to
define the RGB value again so RGB is
going to be 109
for green we have
it and for blue we have
and for blue here we have let's say 240.
fine save it now and here you can see
the borders over here now what we are
going to do is we are going to remove
pixel from here and here you can see we
have the
input boxes or we can say the text box
is working totally fine now what we are
going to do last is we are going to
write here
box size you can see these boxes going
out of area so we'll write your box
sizing as
border box save it now and here you can
see the login form is almost done fine
so let me close it once
now the next thing we are going to style
is the button tag again so we'll write
here button
and then we'll write here a property it
totally depends upon us if we are going
to use these properties or not so we
have to remove
from here we have to write a hover and
on hovering the opacity will change so
the opacity will change to 0.7 now look
it carefully and here you can see when
we take our mask cursor over any button
there's no change right now save the
program try to take the mouse cursor
again you can see it's still not working
as of now
you have to remove this and here you can
see now it's working totally fine when
taking the mouse cursor over any button
it hovers now the opacity will change
fine the last thing we have to do is we
have to style the cancel button
so we are going to use the ID over here
so here you can see in the HTML part of
cancel button
so we have used the ID as cancel button
over here so we are going to use this ID
to style this particular button fine
we'll write here inside this cancel
button
width width is going to be Auto then we
have
padding padding is going to be 10 pixel
and
18 pixel
for top bottom and for left right fine
then we have the margin as well
and margin is going to be 10 pixel for
top button and 5 pixel for Left Right
save it now and here you can see the
login form is completely done
fine now that we are done with the
styling part let's check the final
output save the program and you can see
so here you can see on the browser we
have this basic login form it looks fine
right we can make it more attractive but
we need CSS for that with HTML we can do
this only so let's move ahead and we'll
now create the registration form or the
sign up page
so let's move ahead to another HTML file
so here we are in the HTML file so this
file is for sign up page here you can
see the title for sign up so we will
remove this contact from here it's a
mistake save it now and now what we are
going to do is we are going to open it
with live server again
so here you can see this HTML file has
no output as of so let's create the sign
up form now if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scale up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
so what we'll do first is we are going
to write here the style tag and
we'll finish it later on now moving to
the body part what we'll do is we'll
style the body first so we'll use the
style attribute now we are going to
define the font family here font family
is going to be this one again let's say
we have used this in the sign up form or
we can say the login form as
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to change the background
color for this whole body now what we
are
doing here is we'll write here RGB then
we'll Define the values as 1 3 4 comma 1
3 2 comma 1 3 3 the same one from the
previous login form save it now and here
you can see the change in the background
color of the whole body tag fine next up
what we'll do here is we are going to
use the h1tac again
we'll style it as well so we'll write a
style we are going to align it to the
center we'll write a text align
and we'll write here text align at the
Center fine so here we are then we'll
write here
registration form
save it now and here you can see we have
registration form written and the center
of a web page fine next thing we have to
include a lot of text boxes and a lot of
labels in this particular registration
form because for login form we need only
two text boxes or two labels right the
username and the password but the sign
up form is different we need a lot of
information about the user so for that
we are going to use a lot of input tags
first thing we are going to do is we are
going to use
break over here then we'll use the form
tag
and that's it inside the form tag we are
going to change the style over here only
so we'll write a style
and we are going to use the board border
is going to be 3 pixel
solid in color and
or we can say solid in nature and
off white or gray in color fine so here
you can see the border on the browser
now what we are going to do next is we
are going to use the div tag again
so we'll write a diff
here we have the div tag so let's style
this div tag over here only we are going
to use the style attribute for that we
are going to define the padding padding
is going to be 25 pixel for this as well
background color we are going to use
light blue okay save it now and here you
can see the container on the browser so
it's similar to the login one now what
we are going to do is we are going to
use label first so we'll write a label
then we have the label as
first name
and save it you can see we have our
first level over over here
the next thing we need is the input area
or the text box for this first name so
we'll write a input
type is equals to text then we have
name name is going to be
first name then we have
sites or we can say the length so
will write here
max length max length let's define it as
15
and we are done with the first text box
use the break tag again over here and
that's it so we are done with first name
similarly we have to mention the middle
name last name is when so let's define
them here so we'll write here label
again
this time we have the label for
middle name
and that's it save it and here you can
see we have middle name written over
here we'll copy this piece of code or we
can say the input tag from here
will change the name to
last name
and save here you can see we have
another text box present over here fine
so one thing we forgot to mention here
is the placeholder we can write here
placeholder
enter
first name fine save it now and here you
can see the placeholder on the browser
so we'll copy it from here we'll paste
it here will mention for last name or
for middle name as well save it now and
here you can see something is wrong
save it again
and there's something wrong fine
okay so there's a problem with the live
server so what we'll do is we'll open it
again with live server
and here you can see it's not working as
of now
okay the Break Tag we have
something wrong over here let me check
guys
okay we forgot to mention
this over here save it now and it's
still not working
with live server again and it's working
now fine
so it's working as of now we'll do the
same thing for
last name is so we'll copy this piece of
code from here we'll paste it here we'll
change middle to last everywhere so
we'll write here enter last name over
here
then we have name as last name
and we have to write here enter
last name or we can say last name over
here save it now and here you can see we
have another text box and another label
present over here for last name as well
now what we are going to do is we are
going to select
or we can say we are going to use
options or we have to mention them over
here so for that we'll write here
label so we are going to mention course
over here and for code we are going to
provide drop down menus so for that what
we need to do is we need to use the
select tag in HTML so inside the select
tag we have to provide options options
let's say the value of option is first
value is going to be course and then we
have to write here course it is going to
be a drop down list so we have to
mention a lot of options over here so
we'll write your option again
and then we'll write here
value value is going to be BCA
then we have to write here BCA save it
now and here you can see we have course
over here so here you can see till now
it has two values let's add some more
values over here for options or we can
say let's add some more options over
here we'll add let's say three four more
options we'll write here BBA instead of
BCA for this
then we have let's say
B Tech
and we'll change the value over here as
well
we'll write here B Tech then we have
MBA as well let's say
so we'll write here MBA
then finally we have let's say
mtech as well so we'll write here mtech
save it now and here you can see if we
click on this code you can see we have
different options available we have BCA
BBA B Tech MBA
so the select tag or we can say the
option tag and select tag both are used
for drop down menu so here is a drop
down menu so we have to put a colon over
here save it now and I'll guess it looks
fine now
so
the next thing we need to do is we need
to use the radio buttons for gender fine
so what we are going to do is we are
going to use
the brake tag
and then we'll write here
gender so gender is going to be the
label so we have to put it inside label
tag so we'll write here label
and we have to put gender inside fine
save it now and here you can see we have
gender present over here
now what we are going to do is we are
going to put a break again over here and
then we have to
use the input tag so we'll write a input
type is equals to
[Music]
radio
for radio buttons when then we have to
write a name name is going to be mail
and the first value is going to be
fine then we have to put the BR tag
again
then we'll copy it from here
we'll paste it here
for female
then we have to change the value here as
well
email we have to write here we have to
put a br tag
will copy it from here again and let me
close it once we'll copy it from here
we'll
paste it here
now we have to write here instead of
female
other fine
so we'll mention other over here as well
save it now and here you can see we have
three radio buttons over here for gender
we have male female and other fine now
next thing we have to include is we have
to include the phone number for phone
number we need two input boxes one for
the country code and another one for
phone number fine so we need to write
here and we'll put another break over
here then after this break we need the
label for
fine so we'll write your phone
and after phone we have to write here
input
type is equals to text for phone number
then we'll write here
name name is going to be
country code
then we have to write here the value as
well value is going to be plus 9 1 this
is the country code of India then we'll
write here
max length max length is going to be 3
so that the user cannot write anything
inside here fine save it now and here
you can see we have phone as label and
we have a text box if we try to write
anything you can see we are not able to
write
so what we'll do next is we'll add
another input box or we can say the text
box for phone number so we'll copy it
from here
we'll paste it again we are going to use
the name as phone for phone number
the value is going to be
none so we'll remove value from here
and then what we'll do is we'll change
the max length to 10 degrees fine
save it now and here you can see we have
another text box over here so what we'll
do is
we'll change the type here so you can
see we are able to write
characters here as well what we'll do is
we'll change the type as number fine
save it now and now you will be able to
see that we are not able to write any
character over here but we are able to
write a number fine
so here is
the text box for phone fine so we are
going to use
The Break Tag again so we'll write here
break
let's use it twice and after this Break
Tag what we need is the address so we'll
write here
label label is going to be address
so we have to write here address we have
to put a colon over here and after this
address we have to put the Break Tag and
the text area so we are not going to use
this text box for this now we are going
to use the text area attribute so we'll
write a text area text area columns are
going to be 80 for this area and
roses fine fine
value is going to be
foreign
and we are almost done so save it now
and here you can see on the browser we
have a text area for address
fine
so what we need to do next is we need
email we need password and retype
password we need three more options
right so let's start with email so what
we are going to do is we are going to
use break over here
twice so that it will be clear for you
guys to see now what we'll do is we'll
write here
inside label we'll write email
so we have the label as email then we'll
write here
input
type is equals to email then we have
ID as
email then we can write here
name as well name is going to be email
again so save it now and here you can
see we have a text box for email as well
now what we need to do is we need
another box for password so we are going
to use the break Tech twice
and now we are going to use the label
tag again label is going to be password
save it now and here you can see we have
label as password now we'll write a
input
type is going to be password then we
have ID is equals to pass in case we
need them in the CSS part that's why we
are using the idea attribute here
name is going to be pass again and
that's fine so we have text box for
password now what we are going to do
next is we are going to use the bread
tag again
next up we need to retype password
because this is a registration form the
user needs to retype the password he
choose fine so we'll write here
label label is going to be
re-enter password
and that's it we need an input box for
this as well so we are going to use this
one only so we'll copy it from here
we'll paste it here
and we are going to use the BR tag again
fine
save it now and here you can see we have
another text box for a re-enter password
fine
the next thing we need is the submit
button the last thing so we will write
here input
type is going to be button then we have
well value is going to be submit
so save it now and we are done with the
registration formation
so here you can see we have everything
we need in a registration form
so here we are done with the HTML part
only let's style this page a bit now
we'll move on to the Head section again
and we'll write here inside the style
attribute or we can say the style tag
basic
so we'll write here
we are going to use
input
input for type as
text so basically we can do one thing
we can remove it we can go back to HTML
and we have this input one over here
we'll copy it from here
we'll come back to sign up page and
we'll save it so here you can see it
looks fine now so some of them are not
working obviously because here for email
we have use the input as email so for
that to work what we need to do is we
need to write here again after a comma
we need to write here input then inside
this brackets we need to write here
type is equals to email and for one more
we need to write here input
type is equals to
number fine
save it now and here you can see these
two are also working the text area we
can also use you over here so what we
can do is we can write here text area
only and it will work as well
so we need to change the Box sizing for
this address attribute or we can say for
the text area
so one thing we are going to do here is
we are going to write here
text area as well
let's see if it works you can see we
have written text area over here and it
works completely fine now fine so here
you can see we have both the pages now
if we move back to our login form you
can see this is a login form and this is
a registration
so it looks nice so what we can do is we
can go over here login form and we can
click on register and it will take us to
a registration form because these two
pages are linked together fine
so this is how we can create a HTML
login or sign up page using HTML and a
bit of CSS we can say I hope you guys
got it try doing it by yourself and let
us know what extra you did now that you
have learned all about HTML let's move
on to CSS here we'll discuss CSS
selectors CSS Box model CSS grid layout
and flexbox CSS display CSS positioning
difference between flexbox and grid and
CSS background image and colors then
we'll move on to discuss CSS keyframes
and animations CSS Transitions and hover
effects CSS navigation bar after
learning this switch we look at some
tricks that come in handy when you write
the code after that we look at CSS
Advanced tutorials and responsive design
at last we learn some important
interview questions that are frequently
asked
what are CSS selectors
CSS selectives allow you to select and
style HTML elements selectors are used
to find elements based on their ID
classes types attributes value of
attributes and much more let's discuss
the most common selectors there are
several different types of CSS selectors
the most common of them are CSS element
selectors CSS ID selector CSS class
selector CSS Universal selector and CSS
group selectors so what is the CSS
element selector
the element selector selects element
based on the element name
this is a CSS selector it means it will
select all the P elements on the page it
will style all the P elements to the
central aligned having blue color
this is a CSS selector
it is set to P this means it will select
all the P elements on the page it will
style all the P elements to be centered
around having blue color
let's look at what it looks on a page
so as you can see all the elements are
centrally aligned with a text color blue
CSS ID selector
the ID selector uses the IDU attribute
of an HTML element to find a specific
element
an ID should be unique within the page
so you should use the ID selector to
find a single unique element
to find an element within a specific ID
use a hash character followed by the ID
of the element
so here we have used the hash paraben so
all the rules will be applied to the
HTML element with ID equal to para1 so
this is an ID selector
it will be applied to all the HTML
element with ID is equal to para1 as you
can see it is applied to the elements
having the ID paragraph and all the
other elements are defaultly styled
CSS class selector the class selector
finds the element with a specific class
set by the HTML class attribute to
select an HTML with a specific class use
a period character followed by the name
of the class so this style will be
applied to all the elements having the
class name class 1. this is a class
selector it is denoted by a period
symbol all the elements having a class
named class 1 will be styled with
centrally aligned and color blue
as you can see the element having the
class name class 1 is tiled and all the
other elements are set to default
CSS Universal selector
the universal selector flaps all the
elements on a page the universal
selected is assigned by a star character
the universal selector selects all the
elements on a style sheet as you can see
it is generated by a star Mark all the
elements inside our web page will be
centrally aligned and the color will be
set to Blue as you can see all the
elements are centrally aligned and the
colors are set to Blue CSS group
selector in stylesheets there are often
elements using the same style to
minimize the code you can group
selectors to group The selectors
separate each selectors with a comma
here we have group selectors for H1 H2
and P
so style is applied to H1 H2 and P
elements only
it is better to group The selectors to
minimize the code
here we have group selectors P H2 and H3
so style will be applied to only element
having P H2 and S3
as you can see so all the elements of P
H2 and S3 are centrally aligned and
colored to Red in this video we will
discuss what is the Box model and its
various properties
we will also do an example to understand
the Box model better
so let's get started
every element that can be displayed on a
web page is comprised of one or more
rectangular boxes CSS Box model
typically describes how this rectangular
boxes are laid out on a web page
these boxes can have different
properties and can interact with each
other in different ways but every box
has a Content area and options
surrounding padding model and margin
areas
the following diagram demonstrates how
the content padding model and margin CSS
properties determine how much space and
element can take on a web page
the content area consists of content
like text images or other media it is
bounded by the content Edge and its
Dimensions is given by the content box
width and height
the Border area is the area between the
Box padding and margin its dimensions
are given by the width and height of the
Border
the margin area consists of spaces
between the border and the margin the
dimensions of the margin area are the
margin box width and margin box height
it is useful to separate the element
from its neighbors
the padding area is the area
that includes the elements padding this
area is actually the space around the
content area and within the Border box
its dimensions are given by the width of
the padding box and the height of the
padding box
now let's jump to an example to
understand the Box model better
so we are on the sublime techno to get
started I have created a box theme
simply run background color pink the
font size 30 pixel and we have set the
border to zero solid green
let's see how it looks on our page
so as you can see we have a box named
simply learned with background going all
the way to the end
I have also removed all the padding and
margin from the page so that the boxes
are pushed just at the corner of the
page as you can see
let's start by adding a padding of 20
pixel to the Box
if you save the file you can see the Box
increased by 20 pixel from all the sides
padaguckers inside the background of an
element it goes around the content of
the element most of the buttons inside
the CSS be designed using padding so
that the background of the button
becomes wider than the actual text
the next thing you can do is change the
border of the element so if you change
this border size to 15 pixel we will get
a nice solid background of color green
the Border goes around the padding of
our element so we have the 20 pixel of
padding around our content and 15 pixel
of border around the padding which is
around the content
now we'll see the working of the margin
if you add 30 pixel of margin to an
element you can see the spacing on the
outside of our border
so let's add the 30 pixel margin and
refresh
you can see the spacing on outside of
the Border margin is used to space two
elements apart from each other
now let's change these values to see the
difference
let's make the margin 40 pixels
we'll make the padding 30 pixels
and let's keep the Border 20 pixels and
make it color red
this is 40 pixels
let's observe the changes
so as you can see our border now has a
red background the padding is 30 pixel
the margin is 40 pixels let's inspect
the elements to understand it better
inspect you can see the different styles
here in the computer tab you can see the
Box model
this is a Content area this is the
padding area this is the border and this
is the margin area
we have the margin of 40 pixels around
the border so you can when you click on
this area you can see the margin gets
highlighted
the body area gets highlighted of 20
pixels this is the padding and this is
the content
you can change the size of the content
by adding the height and weight
so let's try adding height and weight
will give the height 50 pixels and will
give the width also 50 pixels
just save the file
now when you refresh you can see the
content Area 15 to 50. in this tutorial
we will discuss everything needed for
you to get started working with grid
layouts
we will start by discussing what is a
grid layout
then we will move on to the features of
the grid system and some basic
terminologies which will help you
understand the grid system better
in end we'll work on an example to
understand a grid system
so let's get started
what is a grid
a grid of the setup intersecting
horizontal and vertical lines defining
the rows and columns
and what is the grid layout
so CSS grid layout is the most popular
layout system available in CSS
it is a two-dimensional system meaning
it can handle both columns and rows
unlike flexbox which is largely a one
dimensional system
you work with grid layout by applying
the CSS rules to both the parent element
which became the grid container and the
elements children which became the grid
items
the CSS grid layout excels at dividing a
page into major regions or defining the
relationship in terms of size position
and layer between parts of a control
built HTML Primitives
you can see this is the basic layout of
a grid system
like tables grid layout enables an
author to align elements into columns
and rows
however many more regular layouts are
either possible or easier with CSS grid
than they were with tables for example a
grid container's child element could
position themselves so they actually
overlap and layer similar to the CSS
position elements
so here are the features of the CSS grid
layout they are fixed and have flexible
track sizes you can create a grid with
fixed track sizes using pixels
for example this sets the grid to the
specified pixel which fits to the layout
you desire
you can also create a grid using
flexible sizes with percentages with the
new FR unit designed for this purpose
you can place the items into a precise
location using the grid line numbers
names over targeting an area of the grid
the grid also contains an algorithm to
control the placement of items not given
an explicit position on the grid
you can define an explicit grid with a
grid layout the grid layer specification
is flexible enough to add additional
rows and columns when needed features
such as adding as many columns that will
fit into a container are included
it also gives you control of overlapping
content more than one item can be placed
into a grade cell or area and they can
partially overlap each other
this layering May then be controlled
with the Z index property
so here the basic terminologies you
should know to work with the grid system
better
the grid line is a dividing line that
make up the structure of the grid they
can either be vertical or horizontal and
decide on either side of rows and
columns
a grid column is a space between two
adjacent vertical grid lines
the size of a grid column is determined
with a grid template columns property
on the other hand a grid row is a space
between
two adjacent horizontal grid lines
its size is determined by the grid
template rows property
the grid cell is a single unit of a CSS
grid
and in Grid design a gutter is basically
the width of the space between columns a
gutter margin is a white space formed by
the adjoining inside margins of two
facing pages in a book or space between
columns on a page also if you want to
become a full stack web developer then
the postgraduate program in full stack
web development in collaboration with
Caltech ctme can help you accelerate
your career as a software developer in
just few months you'll learn modern
coding techniques with boot camp level
intensity and gain all you need to be a
full stack technologist this program
will give you the foundation for
building full stack web apps using Java
you'll begin the basics of JavaScript
and then Venture into some of the most
advanced concepts like angular spring
boot hibernate jsps and MVC now is the
perfect time to get started on your
career as a full stack web developer so
with this let's now move on to the
Hands-On demo and see how the grid
system works in actual world so we are
on the Sublime Text Editor open with a
project with some basic background
Styles and nothing inside the body
you can see this is a basic background
style we have pre-applied just to have a
good look of the Box model
we'll start by creating a container and
wrapping our grid items in it so let's
create a grid and give it a class name
grid container
and inside of it we'll put out different
grid items so we'll just create
different grid items and give them a
class grid item followed by a class
number they belong to
so that we can easily distribute between
them
foreign
so we'll have the five elements on our
page
let's save the file and see how it looks
on the page
so you can see we have the different
grid items on the screen so that are
easy for us to visualize we have not
applied any styles to them other than
the visual styles
so we'll go back to our code
let's go back to the CSS styling sheet
so to create the grid we'll open a
stylesheet we need to display grid on
our grid container so we'll select the
grid container and set the display to
grid foreign
any rows and columns for us to work with
it just they give the alignment properly
therefore by default it looks just
exactly the same to make the grid look
actually great we want you need to do is
Define columns and rows for a grid
so to do this you will use a set grid
template and set the column if you want
to set the size of the column we'll set
the size to 100 pixel and 150 pixel
now
if you refresh you have the 100 pixel
column on the left and a 150 pixel
column on the right and then the grid
captures our next row
but what if you want a box to flexible
size themselves according to the items
inside of them here we'll use a fraction
in it so instead of a 150 pixel column
we want one fraction of our size and
instead of 100 pixels we want the two
factors of our size
so we'll just replace with two fractions
and this with one fraction
now if you save the file and go back to
the page
you will see the items on our left here
in our first column are twice as the
largest item on the second column and
that because of the FR unit we have
defined
you can see the difference in the sizes
Title One is the twice the size of the
item two
another thing you can do is with columns
is use repeat
suppose you want four Columns of a size
100 pixel wide you can just write repeat
command and inside of it how many times
you want to repeat the size
so we will just delete this
and use the repeat
we'll set the number of times we want to
repeat and the size of the
columns
now if you save the file you will see we
have a four Columns of 100 pixel wide
we can do the same things for rope just
set the grid template
rows and Define the size you want
foreign
container
if you don't know how large your grid is
going to be you can use the grid Auto
rows and this will determine the size of
all the rows that is added after the
template rows suppose we want all our
rows to be 100 pixels
so we'll just delete the grid template
rows
and set the grid Auto rows to 100 pixel
now you can see all the rows are now 100
pixel tall
let's change our colon back to 100 pixel
and 150 pixels
so that it will be easier for us further
we'll just delete this grid Auto rows
now we'll talk about the spacing of the
rows and columns apart from each other
we can do this with the help of the grid
grab property grilled row Gap will give
some spaces between the rows similarly
the grid column will give you the spaces
between the columns
now you can see the gaps between the
rows and columns
now we want the same value for both The
Columns you can use a grid grab property
and mention the space
we'll just delete these two
and instead of it we will use just the
grid Gap
and set the
size to 20 pixel
now you can see the evenly spaces
between the rows and the columns
this is all you need to know about the
sizing of the different columns and rows
now let's talk about the positioning
items within its grid cells so for
horizontal positioning we could use the
justify items and we can set that to
Center
so that centers each item within the
cell
by default it is set to stretch
you can also set it to start
or end
or space around
foreign
we will leave this to Center
to vertically position the content we
could use the Align items
the Ally items also accept the same
values
we can set it to Center
we can also set this one to start or end
just we'll keep this to Center as well
you can also align the entire grid
within the container
so let's get rid of these to just
demonstrate them in a proper manner
we could use a justify content and that
will align the content horizontally
within the container
foreign
you can also set this to start or to end
just set this back to Center
to align the content vertically we could
use the Align content and the Align
content also accepts the same value we
can set it to Center
or start
if you inspect the elements
you can see they are aligned centrally
between the container we'll just close
this
okay so this is everything you need to
know to get started with the grid layout
grid works very similar to the flexbox
but it allows you too much in terms of
laying your elements because of its 2D
nature in this video we will learn what
is a flexbox and how it is useful in
designing the layout of the website
we will also try to understand the
different properties of flexbox with the
help of an example
so let's get started
what is a flexbox
flexbox also called flexible Box model
is basically a layout mode or model that
provides an easy and clean way to
arrange the items within a container
if you are using a CSS for a while you
must have used the old block model where
you assign width in terms of percentage
or fixed width and then use the float to
arrange the items on the page
suppose for example you want to arrange
three boxes in a row
then you have to enter everything
manually from width height and to
padding flexbox can do all these things
with ease
some of the concepts of flexible Box
model is the ability to alter the item
width and height to best fit in the
containers available in the free space
Flex model is the direction agnostic
which is different from the Box model
which is vertically biased and the
inline which is horizontally biased
flexbox works for both
flexbox is more Effectiveness more scale
layouts
so here are the main properties of the
flex
okay so let's jump to some code and
learn how these Flex properties work
okay so we are in the subline text
editor
to get started let's add a div inside a
body here and we'll give a class of
flexbox container since this will be the
container where all our flexbox item
will decide
then inside this container we will add
another div and give it a class flexbox
item and one more class flexbox item one
which will help us to understand which
items we are referring to when we style
our elements individually
foreign
foreign
let's just save the file and see how it
looks on a page
now if you save the file you can see we
have the box because I have already
applied some of the styles to these
flexbox items let's just see the styling
so you can see we have the items tiled
just a basic styling so that we get the
Box on our page
now let's just copy these and add two
more flexbox items and you will see we
have two more boxes on our page
just copy and paste them below
give them the class name flexbox item 2
and flexbox item three
just save the file
now you can see we have three boxes on
the page
Now to create a flex container
we will add display Flex to our Flex
container and this is how we create a
flex
box container
so here we will just add
display Flex
just save the file
now you can see all the items are at the
same height and they are all in the same
row you will also notice that if you
shrink our browser the items adjust
themselves accordingly to fit within the
browser
now if you want to style the elements on
the mean axis we will use the property
justify content inside of flexbox
container let's make it a center
save the file
now you can see that all the elements
are in the center of the page
another thing we can do is if we want
our layout to have a spaces between the
elements we will set the justify content
to space between
you can see all the items are evenly
spaced if you want to lay out your items
on the cross axis we would use the Align
items property
the default value for this is stretch
if we want to keep the size of our items
we will use the center and then all our
items will be centered vertically
before flexbox aligning the items
vertically inside the container was
nearly impossible with flexbox you can
do it easily
now you can see the items are aligned
vertically inside the container now
let's just delete everything and we'll
just keep the display flag
now if you want to have a column layout
instead we will use the flex direction
and change it to column select Direction
column now if you refresh the page you
will see all the items are shown up in a
column
now we can start talking about the
different properties that can be applied
to our different flexbox items as
opposed to flexbox container items the
flexbox contains only for laying out and
spacing between your items as well as
the positioning of your item inside the
container the actual flexbox item
properties are used to override those
item Properties or to apply different
sizing to this element now if you want a
first item that it does not shrink when
you shrink our browser we'll set the
flex shrink to zero to our first item
so we'll set the flex
shrink to zero
now if you go back to the page
and try to shrink this
you see the first item Remains the Same
it does not shrink
now in the same way you can set the
items to grow in proportion with the web
browser suppose we want our Flex box
item to to grow with the as the page
grow and cover all the empty spaces so
we'll set this Flex grow to 1.
now you will see the all these empty
spaces are taken by the second item
let's say we want a second box to be the
center of the container instead of
stretching to full height we can use the
Align self property and set it to Center
now you'll see that the alliances
property overrides the Align content
property of the container
you can see it is centrally aligned
so this is all you need to understand
and get started to work with the flex
boxes
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
learned something new about the flexbox
and how you can use the flexbox to
create the dynamic layout for your site
in this video we are going to discuss
one of the most important topics of the
web development which is CSS display so
without wasting any time let's get
started
so what is a display property
the CSS display property controls the
layout of the element on the page
the default value of the display
property is block or inline
let's jump back to our Sublime Text
Editor to see the various display
Properties by using an example to get
started I have a really simple example
setup
as you can see inside my HTML and the
two paragraph tags and I have a
formatting with the background color of
sand color and font size 30 pixels
as you can see this looks like something
like this on the page
the very first property we are going to
discuss is the display block property
the drug display values make an element
a block element
the block elements start a new line and
span the entire width of the viewport by
default like how P elements behave
there are also line breaks before and
after these elements
the default value of the P element is a
display block
so here this looks something like this
what display blocks does is it means
that it is going to take the entire
width given to it
this is going to force a new line above
and new line below it so you cannot have
something next to here now if we change
here this to
[Music]
the next property we are going to
discuss is in line the inline display
value turns any element into an inline
element
these elements will appear on the same
line without breaks
now if it says here this will display
inline now all the P tags will behave as
an inline element
now if you go back to our page and
refresh
you can see now this is an inline
element
the inline element takes the minimum
amount of space possible as you can see
here the CN color takes a minimum onto
space to fit all the content inside of
this p
so this is what an inline element does
also all the inline elements are on the
same line
they share the space together because
they take the minimum amount of space
possible
there are no line breaks in these
elements and they try to fit as closely
as possible
now one of the demerited here is we
cannot change the height and width of
the inline element
if you change here height
to 200 pixels
and with 200 pixels and Save
just go back and refresh you'll see
nothing happens this is because in the
inline display property you cannot
change the height and width of the
element
the next property we are going to
discuss is the inline block value the
inline block value is a hybrid of inline
and block element elements assign
display inline block appears on the same
line with the other inline elements
a characteristics of inline elements
however inline block elements also like
block elements in that you can change
the width and height of the CSS
now if here you try to change the height
and width
of the element
let's just change this to inline block
now if you go back to the page and
refresh
you will see the height and weight
property works this is one of the major
difference between inline block and the
inline inline display property
the last name type of display we are
going to discuss is the display none and
this is a really straightforward display
property
you just delete this
and change the display to display none
now if you save the file and go back to
refresh you'll see both the element
disappears
the display name removes the targeted
elements and all its child elements from
the page this causes accompanying
elements to behave as if this element
does not exist in this video we'll
discuss everything we need to know about
CSS positioning
by the time this video is over you will
be able to position the elements in CSS
like a pro
so let's get started
first let's cover the theoretical part
here we will discuss what is the SS
position property and its different
types after that we'll jump to practical
example to learn how to work with these
properties
so let's get started
so what is CSS position property
the CSS position property allows you to
define the position of an element on a
web page the top right bottom and the
left CSS position properties are used to
determine the final location of the
element
there are four values that you can use
to set the position of an element on a
web page they are static fixed selective
and absolute
using one of the four values above you
can specify how an element should be
positioned you can also use the top
bottom left and right properties to
further Define the element position on a
page so let's discuss each of the
properties individually
CSS static position
this is a by default position for HTML
elements
it always positions an element according
to the normal flow of the page
it is not affected by the top bottom
left and right properties
it is important to note that having a
static equation is the same as not
setting the position property at all
the next is CSS fixed position
the fixed positioning property helps to
put the text fixed on the browser
the fixed test is positioned relative to
the browser's window and does not move
even when you scroll the window
the next is CSS relative position
the relative position property is used
to set the element relative to its
normal position
the relatively positioned element
behaves the same way as a static element
except that it is now subject to the
values of the four other CSS properties
we will discuss each of them with more
detail in examples
now there is CSS absolute position
the absolute position is used to
position an element related to the first
parent element
that has a position other than static
if no such element is found the
containing block is HTML
with absolute positioning you can place
an element anywhere on the page
now let's move on to the example to
understand each of the properties better
to demonstrate the properties I have the
simple example setup currently we have
three elements with just basic curving
Style
we have not applied any position style
to them
now let's click on this element 2 and
inspect it
just go to the computed
and type here position to see the
position of this element
so you can see the currently the
position is static
static is a default value of all the
elements of the page in starting
the next position we'll see is the
relative position
it works almost in a similar manner to
static if you go here and change the
position to relative
okay
you can see nothing changes
relative Act is the same as static with
the only difference is that the relative
allows you to change the top left right
and bottom of this element Let Me Show
an example
now if we change here to
left
20 pixel
and refresh
you will notice the elements move itself
to a 20 pixel from the left
let's set the top to 10 pixel as well
foreign
you can see the element has moved 10
pixel from the top and even overflows
the element below this is because
relative position when applied with the
top right left and bottom actually takes
that element out of the document flow
so let's just reset it
next property we are going to discuss is
absolute position and this property gets
well along with the top right left and
bottom so let's make this position to
Absolute
and you can see the changes made due to
this by just saving
the absolute value completely removes
the element from the document flow this
is useful when you want a particular
element to be a specific position but
you don't want to disturb the other
elements positioning
absolute position positions the element
inside of some parent container that it
can reference now just let's shift the
top to 10 pixels
you can see the movement of this element
[Music]
the absolute position always position
the element inside some parent container
that it can reference to
now if we change the here body position
to relative now the this nav bar will
position the element according to this
body so if you go here and refresh this
you can see that this 2 is in its
relation to with this container
and this is the relative is very useful
next is fixed positioning which is very
similar to Absolute positioning with
some differences
so let's change this to fixed
and just save this
foreign
positioning and goes entirely at the top
this is because fixed position elements
are always fixed based on the entire
HTML element it has nothing to do with
the parent elements one unique feature
of its element is they stay in the same
place when you scroll
let's make the height here
to 200 vertical height
now if you scroll down you will see that
the element 2 will stay on the same
position
C the two elements stick to the same
position
but absolute does not work that way when
you change this here to Absolute
you can see it is not stared at the top
now
this is one major difference between
absolute and fixed
so that's it you can see the working
with the CSS position super EV in this
video we'll discuss the differences
between both the layouts and we'll
discuss which one you should use
I will also show you both the layout in
a practical example without diving too
deep so let's first understand the
theory
CSS grid allows developers to construct
custom grids with more flexibility and
control than ever before
it is for two dimensional positioning we
got rows and columns here
whereas text boxes for one dimensional
layout it is useful in allocating and
aligning the spaces among the items in a
grid container the flexbox layout
pattern makes it easier to design and
flexible and effective layouts
the grid is used for creating a more
complex and organized layouts on your
pages
whereas the flex items is used to design
the responsive Pages without using too
much of positioning or float in our CSS
code to work with the CSS grid layout
you have to add display grid property to
your element
whereas to create the flex container you
have to use the display Flex property
so this is the main difference between
the layout of the
grid and the flexbox
here in the grid layout you can see that
there are rows and columns with all the
header menu main right and the footer
included whereas the flexbox is only for
one dimensional positioning
now let's move on to the example to see
the working of the both the layouts so
here is an example of the web page that
does not have any function other than
some basic styling here on the page we
have a header which is blue in color
this is the sidebar with a red
background and this is the main content
and this black color is a footer of the
page
here you can see this all these items
are stacked on top of the each other
in the code you can see um this is the
footer part of the page uh this is the
main content of the page this is for the
sidebar and this is for the header area
of the page
for the style in part we have used some
basic styling just so as to understand
the example better
now
we can turn the body into a grid by
setting the display property to the grid
so here under the body we'll set the
display to grid
just save the file and refresh
you can see nothing changes because by
default the CSS grid starts creating
rows automatically and adds the content
in these rows that's why it didn't
change
we can change it by adding the grid
template column property in our body in
our case we'll need two columns one for
sidebar and other for the main content
foreign
area to 30 percent
and we'll keep the main area to Auto to
cover the remaining spaces
now if you save the file and reload you
can see the elements have broken into
the skills we created
we'll also Define the rows for our
header and we will use the grid template
rows
we'll set the grid template rows for the
header to 60 pixels
for the sidebar and for the main content
we'll set it to auto
and also for the footer we will keep it
60 pixels
now if you save the file and reload you
can see the elements adjusted in a 2d
manner just as you wanted
this shows the power of the grid and the
flexibility it provides to the developer
however we can see that items are not
positioned properly in the header
and the footer
this is where the flex block comes into
play as discussed earlier flexbox is
about positioning elements in a
one-dimensional area
so what we'll do is we'll go back to our
navigation list class here
and we'll add display as Flex
now if you save the file and reload
you can see these are sitting next to
each other
by default the display sets them into
the rows
now we want the contents to be in the
center of the main axis so we will use a
justify content and set it to Center
you can see the items are now in the
center of the main axis
to Center them vertically we'll use the
Align items and set it to Center as well
this is position them in the center
across the axis
for this to work we have to specify the
height um so we'll set it to 100 percent
so now you can see the items are aligned
centrally both on the main axis and the
cross axis
let's now add some spacing between these
items
so to give some spacing between we'll
add a margin to navigation item class
we'll set the margin to zero for top and
bottom and 10 pixel to left and right
if we save the file and a refresh you
can see we have the spaces between the
items in this video you will learn how
to set a background image on a web page
you will also answer the basic
properties of the background that I used
to set the image
so let's start by discussing the agenda
for this tutorial in this tutorial we'll
discuss what is CSS background image
after that we'll discuss some of the
basic properties of the background image
in the end We'll add a background image
to our web page by adding the code to
our text editor
so let's begin by discussing about the
background property of the CSS
the background image property specifies
an image to use as a background of an
element
the background is defined in the body
element of the HTML code
to add a background image on an HTML
element use the HTML style attribute and
the CSS background image property and
mention the path of the image inside the
URL attribute
there are several properties of the
background that are used to define the
image on a page some of the common ones
are background image background repeat
and background position
by default the image is repeated so it
covers the entire element
let's switch to the text editor and see
how we can add the background image to
our page so we are on the sublime
texturator let's start by opening a
style tag
the background image is always set on
the body tag so type body and open the
curly braces
the background image is always set on
the body tag so open a body type with
curly braces and start typing background
image
use the URL value of the background
image to set the path of the image
make sure the image is in the same
folder as of the HTML file here we have
our file nature3.jpj
so mention the path inside the double
quotes
save the file and let's see how it looks
on a web page
as you can see we have the image on the
web page let's format this image a
little bit we'll start by setting the
background size so type background size
and there are three values to the
background size first one is Auto
it will set the image as it is
save the file and let's see how it looks
on a page
as you can see the size of the image is
as same of the original size
the color value will set the image size
that will be fit to the web page
as you can see the image is set to the
whole web page
we can also set the image size to manual
let's say you want the image size of bit
500 pixels so
now as you can see the width of the
image is 500 pixels next we will set the
background repeat property there are
three values to background repeat first
is no repeat with no repeat value the
images will not be repeated on a page
now as you can see the images are not
repeated
second is repeat X it will set the
images to be repeated on the x-axis
as you can see the images are now
repeated on the x axis
similarly repeat the images on the
y-axis
as you can see the images are not
repeated to the y-axis and there's a
default value repeat which will repeat
the images on the web page
so let's keep it to cover
so let's keep the background size to
cover and set the background repeat to
no repeat
let's save the file and look it on a web
page
now as you can see the image is fully
fit to the web page
let's add a text above our image to see
how it looks like so I'll add a
paragraph tag
and type some random text here
foreign
let's set the text color to red and
align it to Center
I'll type P and open the curly braces
I'll set the color to red
and I'll set the text align to Center
let's save the file and see how it looks
on a page
as you can see we have a text above our
image which is centrally aligned and the
text color is red in this tutorial we
will learn how we can add colors to our
page using different methods we will
start with discussing colors and then
see the hex value and RGB format of the
colors in the end we'll do an example to
understand how we can add colors to our
page
CSS uses the color values to specify the
colors on a page they can be specified
using predefined color names hex or RGB
format there are nearly 140 standard
color names hexadecimal is a six digit
representation of a color the first two
digits RR represents the red value the
next two are green value and the last is
the blue value
all the other colors can be created
using the combination of these three
colors there are several websites
available where you can know the hex
value of the different shades of color
as you can see the black color is
signified by hashtag and the six zeros
the red is hashtag FF and the four zeros
followed by it the RGB color value is
specified using the RGB property this
property takes three values one for red
green and blue the value can be the
integer between 0 to 225 or a percentage
as you can see the black color is
signified by zero zero zero the red by
25500 the blue
y00255 and the green by zero two fifty
five zero now let's move to an example
to understand how we can add the colors
to our page
in this example we will see how we can
add colors in different ways to our HTML
so we are on the Sublime Text Editor as
you can see we have the Standard wall of
it ready with an H2 and a paragraph on
our page open the style tag and make the
font size of the paragraph to 25 pixels
so it is clearly visible
let's start by adding colors to our text
just by color names HTML supports nearly
140 standard color names
we'll make the color of the paragraph
green for that just type color and set
the color to Green
as you can see our paragraph is changed
to Green
let's try one more
this time we will add the color red
just refresh
as you can see the color is now changed
to red
there are nearly 140 HTML standard
colors that is supported by the web
browser
you can also add colors using the RGB
format there are many websites available
to know the RGB or hex value of the
desired color once such as HTML
codes.com
as you can see in the HTML course.com we
have the hex value and the RGB value of
the desired color
let's try one
we'll add this color with the RGB value
171 229 and 27 to our paragraph So for
that
just type RGB and the color code you
want
as you can see the color is not changed
to our RGB value let's try one more
foreign
value to our text
you can see the colors changed to a
desired value
in this way you can use the RGB format
to change the colors
the next way is using the hex values
xlfm is a six digit representation of a
color the first two digits are red next
one two are green and a last are the
blue value let's see how you can use the
hex values
as you can see the hex value for this
color is hash 31787f
we'll use this value to our text
to add the hex value you have to use the
hashtag followed by the color code
you can see that color is changed to a
hex value let's try one more
foreign
just copy the desired value to your file
you can see the color changes
you can also add color borders to our
heading
do that just mention the Border style
along with the color code
we'll add the Border color red to our H2
now you can see we have the border
around our S2
I hope you have understand how to use
the color values to a web page there are
mainly three ways by which you can add
the colors to your web page they are
hacks RGB values and the color names in
this video we will discuss what are
keyframes and how you can use them to
add animations to your page
we are going to discuss what are
keyframes and we'll try to understand
the syntax of the keyframes so let's get
started
the kpfs are used to specify the
animation code in the page they are used
to change the animation from one pattern
to another keep in mind that the
keyframes do not have any selectors on
them
they are not nested inside anything they
are on the root of the CSS page you
write at the rate keyframes and the name
you can name it anything you want we are
going to use that name later on to call
the selector in this case we are looking
at from and 2 from implies the initial
State and to the ending State here in
this example the element will start from
0 pixel and will go all the way to 100
pixel so what we are going to do right
now is we are going to jump to the
keyframes and work out some examples to
understand the working of the keyframes
better so we are on the sublime Tech
theater and this is a simple setup we
have created one HTML element name box
and we have a CSS body of padding 50
pixel and the Box element is an inline
block
background red with heightened with 200
pixel
and also I have an animation stat
declared on the box currently it's doing
nothing because it is calling keyframes
called my frames but if you have not yet
created any keyframe we will discuss
what this animation line means at later
stage but right now I need those lines
to be able to explain you to the
functioning of the keyframes
you can see we have a box on our page
with the color red and padding 50 pixels
around it we are going to write add the
keyframes and I am going to use the name
my frames then we'll write prompt
condition to have the starting State and
let's just keep the height 200 pixel and
then we want it to grow and we will set
it to increase till 500 pixels so let's
just create our keyframes
this is a from condition
we'll set it to 200 pixels
and we want it to grow till 500 pixels
just save the file
now as you can see our box is going all
the way to 500 pixel and when the
animation is done it resets back to 200
pixel and starts again because the
animation is looping you can also put
multiple style declaration for example I
am going to write background pink in the
two condition
just save the file
you can see that the animation is
starting at red and ending at pink now
instead of saying from and do we can
also say from zero percent to hundred
percent
this is as same as doing from N2 but
what it enables you to do is you can add
something in the middle of here say 30
and we will make the color any different
so in the place of prompt we'll write
zero percent
and will replace two with hundred
percent
let's just add one more condition in
between say 40 percent
so at forty percent we want the color to
change to say something uh
greed
let's save the file and see how it looks
on the page
so as you can see it starts with red it
turns to Green in the middle and then
all the way converts to Pink as you can
see there are lots of interesting things
you can do with the keyframes
all of the things that I am showing you
today are just like how this works to
really get a great understanding of how
it works you just have to open an editor
and start experimenting on it
okay so now let's go back to our code
and learn about animation property
so here we have the animation name my
frames
the animation name should be as same as
keyframe's name to work it properly
the animation duration specifies for how
long we want our animation to last in
this case two seconds
let's just change this to say
10 seconds
just save the file
now as you can see the animation is
going at a slower speed just to cover
the 10 seconds update
let's just reset it to two seconds
the timing function used to mention the
transition there are some keywords such
as easy and linear easy node and some
more the animation delay is interesting
to understand it means how long we are
going to wait once the animation is
triggered before the visual starts
happening
let's change it to 3 seconds
as you can see the animation starts
after the three seconds
iteration count specifies how many times
the animation should happen here we have
set it to infinite
which means animation will keep on going
let's change it to something say 5.
as you can see after the count of five
the animation stops
we'll set it back to infinite
animation running State can be paused or
the running State also if you want to
become a full stack web developer then
the postgraduate program in full stack
web development in collaboration with
Caltech ctme can help you accelerate
your career as a software developer in
just few months you'll learn modern
coding techniques with boot camp level
intensity and gain all you need to be a
full stack technology this program will
give you the foundation for building
full stack web apps using Java you'll
begin the basics of JavaScript and then
Venture into some of the most advanced
concepts like angular spring boot
hibernate jsps and MVC now is the
perfect time to get started on your
career as a full stack web developer in
this video we are going to break down
everything there is to know about the
CSS animation
CSS animations make it possible to
animate transitions from one CSS style
configuration to another
animation consist of two components a
style describing the CSS animation and a
set of keyframe that indicates the start
and end states of the animation style as
well as possible intermediate
now to understand this better I have an
example so let's get started now
so we are on a Sublime Text Editor now
to get started I have a very basic
example with HTML and CSS
I have a parent element here
and inside this parent element I have a
div class child
so when you go back to the page it will
look something like this this pink color
is the parent element and the small box
with the red color is a child element
whenever you hover over the element the
child elements move from left side to
the right side of the parent
we want to talk about animation
in case there are two different ways to
animate one is the CSS translation
property which works well with only
simple animation
if you want to learn about CSS
transition property you can refer to the
last video on CSS transition
there is a full-fledged animation
property which is used for more complex
animation
I am going to show you how you can make
this simple transition into animation
for this example we'll make this child
element move all around the Box using
animation
so let's go back to our code
so just like the transition property we
have the several properties in the CSS
animation as well this consists of like
timing function fill in mode and several
other functions in the CSS animation
so to convert the transition into
animation all we need to do is write the
word animation and you write the
animation where you want it to happen in
our case here is our hover so we write
the animation here and as you write you
will notice that you have more
properties in animation than transition
in general you will write everything in
this animation keyword because it is
easier
you can write it separately as well like
animation delay duration animation name
but
we will use the shorthand property of
the animation so we'll select the
animation and the first thing that the
animation leaves is the animation name
so we will give some name to this
animation
say
example
this is just like transition we can
specify our duration
in our case we will use one second
so we have given the name of the
animation
will give the duration we can define a
timing function which will be ease out
this is all the code we need for our
animation
this line is same as writing this
individually like animation name
okay
[Music]
animation duration one second
and animation timing function
which will be ease out
or let's say e z
so for the better understanding let's
just remove the shorthand property and
use it individual properties
now just save the file
let's understand briefly what each of
these properties is blue the animation
duration property defines how long time
an animation should take to complete
with the animation duration property is
not specified no animation will occur
because the default value is 0 second
the animation timing function property
specifies the speed curve of the
animation
now comes the keyframes keep frames are
used to define the animation name we
come down here and write at the rate
keyframes
followed by the name of the animation
the keyframes has to be put outside any
selector
keyframes essentially determine what the
animation looks like between the value 0
and 100 percent
so at our animation we want to have this
Translate
so we'll write 100 percent
and we'll write
transform
translate X
100 and save the file
now when you save and go back to the
page
you will notice a smooth transition of
the animation
when you hover over
one thing you will notice that as soon
as the animation is over the Box goes
back to the original place
the reason for this is all the process
happens inside this keyframe this one
as soon as the animation is done the
default set kicks in
if you want this to stop in the
transform State like box should be here
is on the right side
we have to specify it in the animation
property we'll set the animation fill
mode to forwards so here
we'll set the animation fill mode to
forwards
just save and then when you go back to
the
page and refresh
you see the Box stops on the right side
and doesn't go back to the original
state
now that you have a basic understanding
of the animation and its different
properties let's work around our main
aim to move this child element all over
the parent element from this this side
to this side to this side so here at the
keyframes we'll just delete this and
we'll start with zero percent
so here at the zero percent
will set the transform and translate X
to 0.
after that added 33 percent
we want
this box to move down so we'll work on
Translate Y
so
we'll translate the Y 200 percent
at 66 percent
we want both the x axis and y axis too
to move from here to this side
so we'll set
translate X to 100 percent
and Translate
y 200 percent
and finally at hundred percent
we want to translate X
back to hundred percent
on the upward side so when you save and
refresh
you see we have achieved our Target
the child elements move all over inside
the parent element
to wash it little bit more slowly let's
change the time here to three seconds
when you go back and refresh
you can see the Box move little bit
slower
so
with the animation property we can go a
step further we can tell our animation
how many times to repeat the order of
the animation among other things
so the animation iteration count
property specifies the number of times
an animation should be played let's set
it to three
so here
you set the animation iteration ground
to three
the animation Direction property is
defined whether animation should be
played forward backwards or in alternate
Cycles so for the animation Direction
we'll set it to alternate
now if you save and go back
that's one
two
and three after the three count the
animation will stop and you must have
noticed that the Box were moving on the
alternate rounds
let's go back to see it again
this is the first cycle now it moves alt
on the other direction and now on the
other direction
so this is for animation you can see
animation property is as same as a
transition property with the more
functions answer properties you can add
more complex animations to the page with
the help of this animation property the
CSS transition property is the simplest
way to add the animation to our website
and in this video we are going to see
how to use it
so animation is a good way to catch
attention on the page and if done
properly it increases the user
experience
the most basic way to animate something
is by transition
according to the mdn definition
transition enables you to define the
transition between two states of an
element basically when the state of an
element changes such as over Focus or
anything else you can change the CSS
property through a transition there are
handful of transition property let's
discuss what they are and how they work
so we are in our Port pen I have a box
that changes the color on the hover
the first property that we are going to
start is with the transition duration
property
the transition diffusion property
specifies how many seconds or
milliseconds a transition effects takes
to complete
so here I can write transition duration
and I can write here a number take note
that here we can enter time in
milliseconds or seconds I will suggest
you to use the millisecond since
JavaScript does not accept time in
second
so I will enter here 500 milliseconds
now
when you go here and hover over this box
you see the color changes from pink to
Green in about 500 milliseconds
let's change this to say two seconds
and see the difference
now if you hover this box
you see it takes two seconds to change
the color from pink to Green
[Music]
the next one we are going to look is a
transition property the transition
property sets the CSS properties to
which the transition effect should be
applied
suppose we want to rotate this box when
hovered over
so first we'll specify the transform
property here and we'll set it to rotate
45 degrees
now here we'll specify the transition
property and set it to transform
now if you hover over this box you see
it takes about 500 milliseconds for the
box to retrieve to 45 degrees while the
color changes instantly
suppose we set it here to 2 seconds
and Save now you will notice the Box
will take to about 2 seconds rotate to
45 degrees while the color will change
instantly
you can see the difference here
now the next property is transition
timing function
the transition timing function property
specifies the speed curve of the
transition effect
the default value is ease ease means it
specifies a transition effect with a
slow start and then fast and then end
slowly
suppose here
will set the transition
timing function
to ease
there are four major values for this
timing function they are ease linear
ease in and ease out
let's see one by one in detail
so the linear function specify the
transition effect with the same speed
from start to end
so if we change here to linear
you see it rotates with the same speed
from start to end
now if we change this to ease in
the easy specify the transition effect
with a slow start so now if you hover
over this
you see the Box rotate in the slow start
and then increases the speed at the end
the ease out specifies a transition
effect with a slow end
so if you set it to ease out
you see at the end the speed decreases
the last property we are going to
discuss is a transition delay the
transition delay property specifies when
the transition effect will start
the transition delay value is defined in
milliseconds or in seconds
let's set the transition
delay to two seconds
and just remove this
now if you hover over this box you will
see it will take two seconds to rotate
the box to 45 degrees
so you can see after the two seconds the
transition property takes place
now if we change here
to background
you see the Box will rotate instantly
while the color will changes from pink
to green after two seconds
so this is a transition property is it
as simple as it can be in this video you
will learn how to add interactive hover
effects to your elements we'll do an
example where we'll create horror
effects to our buttons so in this
tutorial we will discuss what is a CSS
over effect and then we'll do an example
to understand it better
so what is the CSS over effect
a CSS hover effect is a style technique
where the user interacts with an element
with a pointing device but it does not
necessarily activates it
it is triggered when the user hovers
over an element with a pointing device
now let's jump to an example
in this example we will create the hover
effects which will look something like
this we have different hover effects for
all the buttons
so let's get started and see how you can
make this all by yourself
so we are on the Sublime Text writer
create two new files index.html and
style.css where we will write our HTML
and CSS code respectively
start by linking the CSS file with the
HTML file
now we will add four anchor tags we will
specify the class name for each of them
so that we can style them separately
later
put all the anchor tag inside the div
tag and name the class
middle
we'll name the class BTN btn1 BTN btn2
BTN btnc and BTN btn4
foreign
times
save the file and let's see how it looks
on our page right now as you can see we
have the four text on our page
with this we are done with our HTML path
now let's shift to CSS and design the
text and add the hover effects so in CSS
you will start by setting the margin and
padding to zero we'll also add the
background body color
as you can see the margin and padding is
now zero and we have a good background
color
now we will Design the buttons and give
them proper formatting we will start
with the class middle
set the position to Absolute
the top property affects the vertical
position of a position element the left
property affects the horizontal position
of a coefficient element the transform
property applies a 2d or 3D
transformation to an element this
property allows you to rotate scale and
move the elements
as you can see the elements are now in
place
now let's format the buttons
set the position to relative
display block
will keep the color as white
font size 25 pixels
we will use the font family as
montessorette
keep the text decoration to none
we will set the border to two pixel and
solid
we keep the text transformation
permission repeat we'll keep the text
transformation as the uppercase
transition allows you to change the
property values smoothly over the given
duration
the before selector is used to insert
something before the content of each
selected elements
keep the position to Absolute
foreign
let's save the file and see how it looks
on a page
now as you can see all the elements are
in place with proper background and text
we have the padding and Border properly
formatted and now we can add the hover
effect to this button
now we'll add the hover effects to the
first button
as you can see we have the hover effect
on our first button ready
in a similar manner we can add the
effects to the second and third Button
as well
we'll just copy and paste this above
code below and make changes to this code
we'll set the width to 100 here
and hike to zero
we'll change it to height hundred
percent
just save the file and refresh the page
as you can see both the buttons have the
horror effect now
it's time to add the hover effect to our
third button
now we'll add the hover effect to the
button third
just save the file and go to the page
as you can see all the three buttons are
ready
now it's time to add the hover effect to
the post button
we'll set the color to Hash FFF
this will change the text color to red
when we hover over the fourth button
set the position to Absolute
keep the width as 200 percent
we'll set the background to hash dcd159
will keep the Z index as -1
keep the transition to 0.8 seconds
foreign
set the height to 180 percent of the
page
now to add the hover effect
write the following code
just save the file
refresh
now you can see we have all the hover
effects on our Pro button
as you know the asset animations is a
powerful concept that is used to make
your web page engaging and attracting
visitors to your website
they make the user experience smooth and
entertaining
so in this video we are going to learn
how to create some cool CSS effects
using just HTML and CSS
so without further wasting any time
let's jump to our Sublime Text Editor so
we are on a Sublime Text Editor for our
example purpose I have used one image
from an unsplash.com I have created a
simple class div clock container for it
now let's go and style these images to
get a 3d effect so first let's design
the body part
we'll set the margin and padding to zero
itself
we'll set the width to 100 percent
and will set the height to 100 vertical
Heights
we'll keep the display as Flex
and will align the items in the center
and we'll justify the content in the
center as well
now we'll design our container class
so for the container class we'll set the
position to relative
we'll set the width to 360 pixels
and will keep the height to 640 pixels
we'll set the margin top to 150 pixels
and we'll keep the background to White
we'll use the rgba format
we'll use the transform property to
apply a 2d or 3D transformation to an
element
so we'll use the transform and we'll use
its properties we'll keep this two
30 degrees
we'll set this Q to
say 25 degrees
and we'll scale it to 0.8
let's discuss more about this property
so
the translate property defines a 2d or
3D translation the scale defines the 2D
or 3D trough scale transformation
and this Q property is used to suit
transformation along the x or y axis
now let's design the images
we'll keep the position to Absolute
we'll set the width to 100 percent
and will keep the transition time
to 0.5 seconds
let's go back to our page and see how it
looks up to this point
so as you can see we have the images
aligned as we want
on a flat side
milk we will create the 3D
transformation when we hover over it
so let's go back to our CSS file
so for the 3D effect we are going to use
the edge child property the entire
selector allows you to take a single
argument it describes a pattern for the
matching element indices in a list of
siblings
we'll design the eat image separately so
for the fourth image
he'll use the transform property and
will translate it to 160 pixels and
minus 160 pixels
let's copy this code
four times
okay we have to set the opacity as well
so we'll set the opacity here
to 1.
the opacity property says the
transparency of the element
just change that number of the nth child
elements so here we'll keep it to 120
pixels
minus 126 L will set the opacity
to 0.8
for the second element let's keep the
translate to 80 pixels
minus 80 pixels and we'll set the
opacity
to say 0.6
and for the last image
will translate it to 40 pixels
and minus 40 pixels and we'll keep the
opacity to say 0.4
so now when you save the file and you
will go back to the page
let's see how it looks
so if you refresh and hover over it now
you can see the image has a 3D over
effect over it there are four layers to
the image and we have
designed the opacity according to the
image layer
so this is a 3D image hover
the next property we are going to
discuss is a 3D perspective image
so for this let's use a new set of
images
so we'll go back to the unsplash.com
again
and let's select one image
this one looks critical
so let's copy the image address
and mention it under the image tag
just save
[Music]
now when you go back to the page
you'll see you have your image here
now let's add the 3D perspective Image
Design over it so under our CSS file
let's first design all the elements
let's keep the margin and padding to
zero
let's keep the width of the container
elements 200 pixels
or say hundred percent
let's keep the minimum height to save
100 vertical Heights
and we'll use a background color of hash
333
let's design the image as well before
going back to the page
so we'll set the perspective to save
4000 pixels
the perspective property is used to
determine the distance between a z plane
and the user in order to give a 3D
positioned element some perspective
let's keep the width of the image 20
percent
will keep the position to Absolute
keep the left margin to 50 percent
and drop to 50 as well
we'll use the transform property
use the translate value of it to minus
50 percent n plus 50 percent
we'll use a transform style property and
set the value to preserve 3D
the present 3D indicates that the
children of the element should be
positioned in the 3D space
so just save the file and let's go back
to the page to see how it looks up to
this point
so as you can see we have the required
background image and we have the image
over
in a required position
now it's time to style our image
so we'll use a transform property
and we'll rotate
we'll use the rotate X property of it
we'll keep it to 70 degrees
foreign
States
it results in the transform function
data type
the transformation is stack size where
three dimensional Vector it coordinates
because how much the element moves in
each Direction
let's set the Box shadow
to minus 80 pixels
60 pixels
15 pixels
it has an rgba value to
0 comma 0 comma zero
point four let's say
let's set the transition to all 0.4
seconds
it will set the transform style to
preserve 3D
so just save the file and let's go back
to our page to see how it looks up to
this point
so as you can see the image is flat for
and ready for 3d effect
now let's Design This 3D horror effect
on it
so for the 3D over effect
we'll use the cover property image
colon over
the image
will set the transform
rotate x 0 degrees
rotate red to zero degrees
and translate through to
zero pixels comma
zero pixel comma 0 pixels let's check
this once again
this is right
now we'll set the Box Shadow to
0 pixels 0 pixels 0 pixels
zero pixels and rgba
0 comma zero comma zero comma zero
just save the file
and refresh
now when you hover over it you will see
that the perspective of the image
changes
so this is a 3D perspective image
now there are many CSS effects that you
can design using these properties also
if you want to become a full stack web
developer then the post graduate program
in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with boot
camp level intensity and gain all you
need to be a full stack technologist
this program will give you the
foundation for building full stack web
apps using Java you'll begin the basics
of JavaScript and then Venture into some
of the most advanced concepts like
angular spring boot hibernate jsps and
MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer in this video you will
learn what is navigation bar and its
importance on a web page
you will also learn how to create a
basic navbar using HTML and CSS
so let's start by discussing the agenda
for this tutorial
we will start with what is navigation
bar and why navigation bar is required
in a web page you will look at some of
the well-designed navigation bars on
websites after that you will work on the
code to create the basic navigation bar
using HTML and CSS so let us Begin by
discussing what is navigation bar
a navigation bar is a graphical user
interface intended to Aid the user in
accessing the information it is usually
placed at the top of the page a
navigation bar needs standard HTML as
the base navigation bars can be created
either vertically or horizontally
so what makes a navigation bar so
important
an irrigation bar is an important
element of website design since it
allows user to quickly visit any
sections within the website if we have
ever visited a website without a
navigation bar you may have found it
difficult to locate the page you need
you may have also had to click back
several times in order to find a link to
the next section you wanted to visit
thankfully web design has become more
standardized in the recent years and
nearly every websites now include a
navigation bar keep in mind that you
want to keep people on a site to explore
further a well-designed navigation bar
is an important part of the user
experience now let us look at an example
of a navigation bar on a website we are
on the home page of Amazon website as
you can see this is the navigation bar
that has several elements on it as the
user clicks on these elements they will
be directed to the different sections of
the website the navigation bar allows
the user to easily boot through any
section of the website
by clicking on the best service button
you will be redirected to the best
sellers page on the Amazon
now we are going to create a navigation
bar with HTML and CSS that's going to
look like this
will have the following sections with
sub menus and some of them
make sure you have a text editor to
write the code I'll be using a Sublime
Text letter for this purpose we will
create two new files index.html and
style.css where we will be writing on
HTML and CSS code respectively
let's start by adding the standard
boilerplate
keep the title as CSS navbar
link your CSS file with the HTML file by
using the link tag and hdf attribute
this navigation bar is going to consist
of a bunch of UL tags which means an
another list and list items
let's create our first another list and
this will be our main menu of the
navigation bar
I have options such as home about
contact services and news so this is
going to be our main menu
save the file let's see what it looks
like right now by opening it inside our
browser
you can see it is just an unordered list
with no menu at this point let's go
ahead and add our sub menus home will
not have any sub menus but the about
list item is going to have a sub menu
add another UI tag inside the Ally tag
this will create a sub menu inside the
about item save the file
just copy paste it and paste it inside
the UL tag
name them as team
clients
careers and Legacy
just make the indentation properly
if you see this is a browser you'll see
that we'll have the sub menus inside the
about let's do the same thing for
contact just copy paste this whole
section and place them inside the
contacts list rename them according to
your wish and save the file
if you go back to the browser you will
see that we'll have the sub menus inside
the contacts as well
as you can see this is our complete sub
menus without the styling all the HTML
content is ready now we are going to
write the CSS for it in the CSS file
let's apply the background image first
because it will make the page look a
little bit nicer
I have my file on my computer make sure
the image file is in the same folder as
your HTML and CSS file I am using a
tech.jpg
and for the background size I will set
it to the cover which is going to adjust
it to the image screen and it's going to
cover the whole background of our web
browser
keep the font family as aerial
let's see what it looks like at this
stage you can see we have a background
image and the font is changed to Ariel
now let's make sure our unordered list
does not have any margins or padding by
setting it to zero
also put the list style to run because
we don't want to have any kind of bullet
under our listing
now another list list items they're the
main items that are going to apply the
style to the list items of the main URL
tag
float that all the text to the left
and set the given formatting
we will set the background color with
the hash value
003542 you can choose your own value
from our website known as color
picker.com
foreign
we will fix the line height to 40 pixels
this will Center the text vertically
text align to Center
this will align the text horizontally
and font size to 20 pixel
font size 20 pixels
let's see what it looks like now you can
see the text is floated to the left
now let's tell the actual menu link so
the menu link will be ulia
Uli a
keep the text decoration
to none and color white
keep the display as block
now it's time to set the hover effect of
our array the urli hover will set the
formatting when the user hovers over the
menu
foreign
save the file and let's see what our
page looks like up to this point
you can see we have the hover effect
over our menus and we have the sub menus
under the main menu we want our set menu
should be visible only when we hover our
menus so we will set the UL alike to
display none and we will set the hover
effect to the block
foreign
looks like up to this point
now you can see our navigation bar is
ready
with all the sub menus and menus at
proper places we have this nice hover
effect over the menus
in this video we will discuss some cool
tricks that every web developer should
be familiar with and which will help you
during the time of your designing of
your web page so let's jump onto the
Sublime Text Editor and see these tricks
so the first trick is called the CSS
blend mode the CSS background blend
property sets the blend mode for each
background layer and you can blend it
with image or with different colors with
the help of this property we can blend
background image or blend them with
colors
so here's an example of the CSS blend
mode here you can see the images are
blended with different colors
so let's see how we can achieve this
so for our example purpose I am going to
use this image
to our page
so in the body tag add the image URL and
the location of a file
keep the margin left and margin right to
auto
now let's add some style to a body tag
in the blend mode there are several
modes such as normal multiply darker and
lighter or screen
let's blend that image with one color so
you can select the color from this HTML
color codes I'll use this color for my
purpose so just copy paste here
and in the background blend mode let's
keep it to lightened
now if you save
and then refresh here
you can see we have Blended our image
with color
let's go back and change here something
different
let's keep it to darken
let's try something different let's keep
it to screen
so as you can see there are several
properties for this blend mode and you
can use according to your needs the next
trick is called clipping the CSS clip
Pass Property creates a clipping region
that specifies the region that should be
shown on the page so let's understand
this with the help of an example here
we'll create a div
and give this class any class say TR
the easiest way to generate the clip
value is to use a generator
there are several websites that give the
value of the clip
so we'll use this
website to generate our clip value
suppose we want a hexagon shaped
image on our page
so here you can adjust it according to
your needs
the any shape that you want
here you can see the clip value just
copy paste it from here
now here we'll use that class that we
are specified
we'll just copy paste the clip value
here
will keep the height to say
50 or less than 60 percent
set the width to 60 as well
select the color you want to give to a
clip image
I'll use the same color from the
previous example
so just copy paste this color code
keep the position to Absolute and the Z
index to minus 1.
just save and go back to the page and
refresh
now you can see we have the clipped
image on our page let's try something
different
um let's say I want
a left Arrow
so just copy paste this
clip
value clip path value
[Music]
just save the file
and you can see we have the arrow on our
page another must have for web
developers is animations
CSS allows us to animate almost every
property that we use in the CSS
let's look at one example so here an
HTML file we'll just add one div tag
first
and to start with animation we'll have
to mention a keyframe the keyframes
allows us to create different steps for
our animations
we'll keep the keyframes name to Blink
so here in this example we'll create a
box and we'll add different colors at
different points of animations right so
we'll write zero percent and we'll set
the background
to Indigo
which change the colors five times so
just copy paste this code five times
we want next change at 30 so we'll set
the background here
suppose say red
at 50 we want it yellow
at 70 we wanted green
and finally we'll change it to say blue
so inside the div tag we'll mention the
height and width of the Box first let's
say 400 pixels and width also 400 pixels
now I will mention the border of the box
so just set it to say 1 pixel
solid black
now for the animations part
will set the animation for 10 seconds
and for infinite number of times
write this webkit so as to support in
our Google Chrome
now just save the file and go back to
our page
and here you can see we have the
animation on our box
you can style each and every element in
HTML using animations
another thing you can do is add PSS
gradient the CSS gradient property
allows you to add smooth transitions
between two or more colors
for this purpose you can get the
gradient value from a website called CSS
gradient.io
here in this website you can get the mix
and match of the different colors you
want to use let's look at one example to
understand better
so here in this HTML file first let's
set the height
so we'll set the height to 100 percent
now inside the body tag
will keep the height as 100 percent
will mention one background color
let's select different colors this time
so we will use say this color
this time
just copy paste the value here
now for the gradient value just go back
here in this website and you can select
the color you want let's say I want a
mix of this color
and
you can change the shades from here
now when you're done with the colors
just go back below and copy this
code here
to your page
now when you go back to the page you'll
have a beautiful gradient here
let's try one more
this time a linear gradient
just copy this value to your code
just save the file and go back to the
page
and you will have a linear gradient here
in this video we are going to run some
of the more advanced features that can
be used to optimize your web page and
add some extra features to it
so let's get started so the first
function we are going to discuss is CSS
sudo class
a CSS sudo class is a keyword added to a
selector let's specify the special state
of the selected elements
lets you apply a style to an element not
only in relation to the content of the
documentary but also in the relation to
external factors like history of the
Navigator the status of your content or
the position of the mouse
like hover which lets you know if the
mouse is over an element or not
so the first pseudo class we are going
to discuss is CSS hover
this pseudo class is used to add a
special effect to an element when our
Mouse pointer is over it
let's work an example to understand how
this works
so we are on a Sublime Text Editor and
we have added a standard wall update to
it
so first I'll create a box element
okay
we get the depth class box
let's save this and see right now what
is the status of our page
so as you can see we have this simply
learn tag and the heading that we have
given the color changes when you go over
me
now add a style tag to define the
styling of the box
so
we'll keep the background color of the
box as
if the width to 300 pixels and height
to 200 pixels
we'll set the margin to auto
let's keep the font size to 40 pixels so
that we can see the text clearly
and we'll align the text to the center
just save and go back to the page
now you can see
we have this box with the tag the color
changes when you hover over me
now to add the hover effect you just
have to mention the class with semicolon
and hover so we'll mention the class box
the semicolon and Hoover
he'll mention the background color to
which the Box will change any hover over
Mouse
so we'll keep the background color to
say a CN color
just save and go back to the page
so if you refresh and when you hover
over it you can see the color changes
so this is how the pseudo hover class
works
the next photo class we are going to
discuss is an active pseudo class the
actors for the class represents an
element that has been activated by the
user either while pointing a device or
by a touchscreen device
let's work on an example to understand
how to use the active class to change
the color of active elements the
possible values could be any color name
in any valid format so we'll use the
same example with some minor changes
first
let's change this text here
keep it to click here
we keep this part as same and instead of
over here we will use the active solder
class so
foreign
to the center
when you refresh and go back
so
you'll see here it is click here to see
the effects now
to see the difference now you can see
when we are hovering over it the color
does not change it instead of it when we
click on it the color changes
so this is how the active over class
works the next Advanced Property we are
going to discuss is a CSS pseudo
elements
a CSS pseudo element is a keyword added
to a selector that lets you style a
specific part of the selected element
you can use one pseudo class element in
a selector
it must appear after the simple
selectors in the statement
as a rule double colon should be used
instead of a single column this
distinguishes the singular classes from
the studio element so the first two-do
element we are going to discuss is the
first letter Studio element this pseudo
element applies that the first letter of
the first line of the Block Level
element
let's work out an example to understand
this better
yes
so let's add some content to the body
and we'll add an H1
which says welcome
and we'll add an H2
which says this is an example
of first
letter
to development
tile tag
text from the body to the center so
we'll use text align
just give proper spacing here
now to this H1 tag we'll add the first
letter sudo so to add the first letter
sudo element just use the double colon
and type first
letter
if the font family of the first letter
essay lucida
calligraphy
the spelling mistake
we keep the font size to 360. meters
we keep the color to red
and just add a text shadow
for better animation
so we'll keep the text Shadow to Pi
pixels
pixels
and pixels any color cyan
now when you save and go back
just refresh so this WC is a first
letter pseudo element
as you can see we have changed this
first letter with a proper shadowing of
a c and color and a different font size
so this is how the first let us
pseudo element works
the next one we are going to discuss is
the before pseudo element
the before pseudo element can be used to
insert some content before the content
of an element
let's work out an example
so just add the standard boilerplate
inside the body let's add
welcome to Simply learn
we'll add the text inside a q tag the
queue tag defines a short quotation so
inside the queue tag
we'll add welcome
to get closed
to
and away
and again Q tag
in preload
now that we have the text inside the
body let's add the styling
so we'll keep the font size to of all
the
text 230 pixels
this is the all selector we have used
font size 30 pixels
now before the text we are going to add
some symbols so we'll use double column
Q before
we'll add the content with some symbol
like this
with keep the color of this
symbol to Blue
and we'll use the after pseudo class to
add the content
like this
we'll keep this color to red
now that we have everything in place
let's go back to see how it looks
you can see the symbols before and after
our text
so this is how the before Studio element
works
so the next function we are going to
discuss is CSS loader
the CSS loader is an animation that
shows the visual about the page when it
is loading it is helpful when a page
takes some seconds to load the page
content it is similar to the buffer sign
so let's see how to create a loader so I
hope you remember the concept of the
keyframes and animations
if you want to revise the concepts you
can watch the previous videos on the
keyframes and animations from the
playlist
so
let's create the loader
we have the standard boilerplate
so inside the body tag just add the
center tag and inside it we'll add one
H1 which says
welcome to Simply learn
and we'll add five div tags with the
class A1 A2 A3 A4 and A5
just copy paste it five times
so this is A1 A2 A3 A4 and A5
let's open our style tag
inside of style type will first add
color to our H1 so let's keep the color
of our H1 to Orange
foreign
we keep the display to block
um keep the position to Absolute
we set the width and height to 10 pixels
each so with 10 pixels
High 10 pixels
we'll use the calc function to determine
the left margin so to use the calc
function that add CLC
50 percent
and minus 1 em
the calc function performs a calculation
to be used as a property value
keep the Border radius to say 1.3 em
is related to the font size of the
element
1.3 em means 1.3 times the size of the
current point
we'll use the transform origin function
with a value 1.3 em
and two em
the transfer margin property allows you
to change the position of the
transformed elements
2D Transformations can change the X and
Y axis
uh we'll keep the animation iteration
count
in finite
I will keep the animation duration to 2
seconds
let's save and go back to the page to
see how it looks at this point
so as you can see we have our heading
and you cannot see it but we have a
loader ready
and we just have to add some keyframes
and animations here
so
let's define keyframes
the name of the animation rotate
so at zero percent
[Music]
function to rotate it to
zero degrees
just copy copy this
at 100 when it's complete it will rotate
to the complete 360 degrees
so here we will give the religious 50
degrees
now represent each of the
classes here that we have defined so
dot K1
the animation delay
will be of 0.1 seconds
so for each of the classes that we have
here we have to Define them with a
different color
so that when the loader appears we can
see them clearly with the different
colors so for this
A1 let's keep the background color to
say cyan
three four and five
let's make changes here so for the A2
we want it
to appear after 0.2 seconds
put a color pink
now let's keep to 0.3 seconds
The Color Purple
color green
0.5 seconds it's color black
we have kept the animation delay to so
close like point one seconds point two
seconds point three seconds so that the
loader appears in a complete sync with
each other foreign
refresh and go back to the page
now you can see this is the loader we
have our heading and this is like a
buffer and it will show when you have
some content to load
in this tutorial we are going to discuss
what is responsive design how we can
so let's get started making a website
with an adaptable layout is called
responsive web design and CSS media quiz
are one of the most important part of
responsive design
in the past building a website was much
simpler today a Website Layout should
adapt itself not only to computers but
also to tablet mobile devices and even
TVs so let's see how we can create
responsive web layout using CSS media
queries with the help of an example so
here we have a Sublime Text Editor we
haven't a standard wallet ready so let's
create something
so let's start by creating the four divs
here
we'll give it a class name box
with an ID box one
foreign
just copy it four times
let's rename this ID to box two and here
we'll type Mac OS
for the Box three will have
Linux and the box for
will have Android
let's add some styling over here
so just open this time tag
align to Center
uh we'll set the background color
select some color
so we go to the center activation fellow
course choose a good seller
select this color
you set the text color to white
and we'll set the font size to say
something
and just save the file and let's go back
to refresh the page
this
so now if you refresh you see we have
our games with Windows Mac OS Linux and
Android and with this background color
so to design a responsive web pages use
the media queries so what are media
queries let's first discuss this so a
media queries are used when you want to
customize the website presentation
according to the user screen size with
the help of the media queries you can
display different markups based on the
devices generated
a media creates a logical operation
whenever a media query becomes true then
the related CS is applied to the Target
element
so to start the video just type at the
rate and media
now here we'll mention the max width
to save 400 pixels
the status media query you write the CSS
code that should take an effect Ive
conditions
has set the box one
[Music]
to display block
now
if you go back to the page and you
refresh
you see nothing happens because we have
not made with display To None So post go
back to the CSS code
and secondly display to none
now you can see we don't have any
display here so let's inspect the page
first
so you see we have our contents here now
you can see this is the layout we are
currently using the current width is 685
pixels into high 255 pixels
now we are set here Max bit to 400
itself this means if this width
decreases to less than 400 pixels how
this CSS score will kick in so let's
decrease the width here
so as you decrease
this way
you see as soon as you get less than 400
pixels rcss kicks in so we have our
Windows displayed here which is the box
id1 so this is how the media query works
let's add some more video queries to
understand it better so just copy this
code now
so now let's set this minimum width
to
4001 pixels
and maximum you say 600 pixels
now when this condition is true let's
say we want our box to
to display block
with color green
so this is the background color here
to place
say green
now we will add one more video query
so just copy this code
paste it here
so when the grid is from 601 pixels to
stay
800 pixels so we'll set the Box 3
display
to block and color
to shifting
so just save this and let's understand
it
on the page
so let's
change the width of the screen
so see as soon as the width goes less
than 400 pixels we have our windows on
display now we're going to increase the
width size and it goes more than 401
pixels it has a Mac OS display keep on
increasing it
now see rabbit is more than 1500 pixels
and we have a Linux on display so this
is how we create the responsive web
design for the different devices so
without further Ado let's get started
with the interview questions based on
HTML it's the first question
what is HTML HTML stands for hypertext
markup language and it is the language
of the internet it is a standard text
formatting language used for creating
and displaying pages on internet HTML
documents are made up of the elements
and tags that formatted properly and
display it on pages
so we have our next question now what
are HTML tags so the answer for this
question is HTML tags are used for
placing the elements in a proper and
appropriate format tags use the symbols
greater than and less than to set them
apart from the HTML content the HTML
tags need not to be closed always for
example in case of images the closing
tags are not required for an image tag
now followed by the second question we
have our third question what are HTML
attributes the attributes are the
properties that can be added to an HTML
tag that changed the way the tag behaves
or displayed for example an image tag an
image tag has SRC attribute with which
you can use the source from which you
have to display the image from
now the attributes are added right after
the name of the HTML tag inside the
brackets the attributes can only be
added to opening or self-closing tags
but never in closing tax
now followed by third question we have
our next question what has Mark you in
HTML Mark U is used for scrolling text
on a web page it Scrolls the image or
text up down left or right automatically
to apply for a Mac queue you have to use
Smart View tax now we have our first
question how do you separate a section
of text in HTML we separate a section of
text in HTML using the below tags which
are the Break Tag paragraph tag and
block code The Break Tag is used to
separate a line of text it breaks the
current line and shifts the flow of the
text line to a new line followed by that
we have the paragraph line the paragraph
line is used to write a paragraph of
text and third one the block code the
block code tag is used to define large
quoted sections now we have our sixth
question Define the types of lists in
HTML so we have the three types of lists
in HTML which are the ordered list
unordered list and definition list so
first we'll discuss the audit list the
ordered list uses ol tag and displays
elements in a numbered format next we
have the unordered list the unordered
list uses UL tag and displays elements
in a bulleted format thirdly we have the
definition list the definition list uses
DL DT and DD tags and displays only
elements in the form of definition like
a dictionary
next we have our seventh question how do
you align list of elements in an HTML
file we can align the list elements in
an HTML file by using indents if you
indent each nested list and further than
the parent list then you can easily
align and determine the various lists
and the elements that it contains now we
have our eighth question differentiate
between ordered list and unordered list
so the answer for this question is an
unordered list uses UL tax and each
element of the list as written between
Li tags the items are displayed as
bullets rather than numbers now coming
into ordered list so for creating an
ordered list you'll be using ol tax and
each element inside the list as written
using l i tags the list items are
displayed using numbers rather than
bullet points now we have a sample on
the screen right now so the first three
elements are a set of unordered lists
which are represented using bullet tax
and the second set which is the coffee
tea and milk is an ordered list which is
represented using numbers
now moving ahead we have the ninth
question how do you display a table in
HTML web page so the table in HTML can
be created or displayed using the table
tag
so it also uses to manage the layout of
the page for example header section
navigation bar body content photo
section etc etc so given below our list
of HTML tags used for displaying table
in an HTML web page so we have table TR
th etc etc table is used to define a
table TR is used to define a row in a
table t h for header TD for a cell
caption is used to define a caption and
we have the call group which is used to
specify a group of one or more columns
in a table for formatting next we have
call which is used with call group
element to specify column properties for
each column next we have the body which
is used to group The Body content in a
table next we have t head T footer which
are used for header content and footer
content respectively moving forward we
have our 10th question how do you
display the given table in an HTML web
page so the answer for this question is
written on the right side part of my
screen this is the sample code which you
can use to represent or display a table
which is given in this particular format
over here now followed by this we have
our 11th question how do we insert a
comment in HTML so the answer for this
question is we can insert a comment in
HTML by beginning with lesser than sign
and ending with a greater than sign for
example as shown in the right side part
of my screen which is hello world now
moving ahead we have our 12th question
how do you insert a copyright symbol in
HTML so you can insert a copyright
symbol by using Ampersand copy semicolon
or Ampersand hashtag 169 semicolon in an
HTML file now moving ahead we have our
13th question so what is a white space
in HTML so the answer for this question
is an empty sequence of space characters
is called as white space in HTML this
white space is considered as a single
space character in HTML white space
helps the browser to merge multiple
spaces into one single space and so
taking care of indentation becomes
easier
white space helps in better organizing
the content and tags making them
readable and easy to understand with
this let's move into the 14th question
how do you create links in different
sections within the same HTML web page
so the answer is Anchor text we can use
anchor tag along with referencing
through the use of hashtag symbol to
create several links to different
sections within the same web page moving
ahead we have the 15th question how do
you create a hyperlink in HTML so the
answer is we can use anchor tag again
here the same thing we can use anchor
tag to create a hyperlink within the
HTML that links to another web page the
hyperlink can be added to images too now
moving ahead into our 16th question if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
an image map so the answer for this
Quest
and kinds of web pages using this single
image it can be used for defining spaces
in the images that are made part of the
image mapping process
moving ahead we have our 17th question
why do we use stylesheet in HTML a style
sheet helps in creating a well-defined
template for HTML web page that is both
consistent as well as portable a single
style sheet template can be linked to
various web pages which makes it easier
to maintain and change the look of the
website now the 18th question what is
semantic in HTML
so the answer for this question is
semantic HTML is a coding style it is
the use of HTML markup to reinforce the
semantics or the meaning of the content
for example the semantic HTML B tag is
not used for both statement as well as
itac which is not used for italic
instead we use strong and EM text now
followed by the 18th question we have
our 19th question what is SVG in HTML so
the HTML SVG is used to describe the
vector or raster Graphics SVG images and
their behaviors are defined in XML text
sheets it is mostly used for Vector type
diagrams like pie charts two-dimensional
graphs in an x y coordinate system now
moving ahead we have our 20th question
what would happen if there is no text
between the HTML tags so the answer for
this question is really simple there
would be nothing to format if there is
no text present in between the tags
therefore nothing will appear on the
screen some tags such as attacks with
our closing tag like image tag do not
require any text between them now
followed by the 28th question we have
our next question how do you create
nested web pages in an HTML so nested
web pages basically mean a web page
within a web page we can create nested
web pages in HTML using the built-in
iframe tag the HTML live frame tag
defines an inline frame for example
which is displayed on the right side
part of my screen you can see the iframe
source
which redirects the user to Simply
learns official webpage
now followed by that we have our 20
second question how do you add buttons
in HTML so we can use the built-in
button tag in HTML to add buttons to the
HTML web page so on the right hand part
of my screen you can see the
implementation of button to an HTML web
page now followed by 20 second question
we have our 23rd question what are the
different types of headings in HTML so
the answer for this question is there
are basically six types of heading tags
in HTML which are defined with H1 to H6
tags
each type of the heading tag displays
different text size from another where
H1 is being the largest and H6 is being
the smallest so on the right hand part
of my screen you can see the
implementation of heading tags from H1
to H6 now the
output for this particular code segment
is the H1 H2 s3h4 H5 H6 so you can see
that H1 is being the biggest one and H6
is being the smallest one now moving
ahead into our 24th question how do you
insert an image in the HTML web page so
the answer for this question is you can
insert an image in the HTML web page by
using the following code which is
displayed on the right side part of my
screen you can see we have a image
source is equals to tulip.jpeg which is
used for inserting an image into your
HTML web page
now our 25th question what is the alt
attribute in HTML now the answer for
this question is the alt attribute is
used for displaying the text and place
of an image whenever the image cannot be
loaded due to any technical issue so
basically when you have four internet
connection and you're trying to load an
image you can see some sort of text in
place of an image so that particular
text is nothing but the alt attribute
now moving ahead we have our 26th
question how are hyperlinks inserted in
the HTML web page you can insert a
hyperlink in the HTML web page by using
the following code which is present on
the right side part of my screen you can
use the anchor tag along with h
reference and inside that particular tag
you can use the URL to which you want
your users to redirect to now followed
by this we have our 27th question how do
you add color to the text in HTML
so the answer for this question is you
can add color to the text by using the
following code which is present on the
right side part of my screen where you
can add a red color and blue color green
color to this particular paragraph and
headings now followed by 27th question
we have our 28th question how do you add
CSS styling in HTML so there are three
particular ways to add CSS to your HTML
there are inline CSS external style
sheet and internal style sheet we'll
discuss each of these methods in a bit
more detail first we have the inline CSS
so it is used when less amount of
styling is needed or in cases where only
a single element has to be styled to use
inline Styles add the style attribute in
the relevant tag now moving ahead we
have the external style sheet this is
used when the style is applied to many
elements or HTML pages each page must
link to the style sheet using the link
tag
now we have the last one which is the
internal style sheet it is used when a
single HTML document has a unique style
and several elements need to be styled
to follow the format internal stylesheet
is added in the head section of the HTML
Page by style tag now followed by this
we have our 29th question what hierarchy
do the style sheets follow
the answer for this question is if a
single selector includes three different
style definitions the definition that is
closest to the actual tag takes
precedence inline style takes priority
over embedded style sheets which takes
priority over external style sheets now
our last question for the session today
how do you add JavaScript to an HTML web
page so the answer for this question is
we basically have three methods to add a
JavaScript to our HTML webpage they are
inline script block and external
Javascript file first we'll discuss the
inline you can add JavaScript to your
HTML elements directly whenever a
certain event occurs JavaScript code can
be added using attributes of the HTML
tags that supported now the next one
that is the script log you can define a
script block anywhere inside the HTML
code which will get executed as soon as
the browser reaches to that part of the
document this is why script locks are
usually added at the end part of the
HTML documents now the last one that is
the external Javascript file you can
also add or import the JavaScript code
from a separate file and keep your HTML
code clutter free this is especially
useful if there is a large amount of
scripting added to the HTML web page so
let's get started with those questions
and answers
okay now
here we'll talk about basic CSS
interview questions
now name some CSS Frameworks as we know
it very well today in CSS environment
there are so many Frameworks are
available okay like we talk about CSS
these are the basically necessary
libraries which offers you some very
popular ready-made components which you
can utilize into your existing project
and without writing much code you can
really create some awesome effects so
some of the very very popular libraries
are like in Foundation
bootstrap Gumby ukit semantic UI and
many more which are available here
okay now what do you understand by the
universal selector see Universal
selected as you know it very well in CSS
normally we talk about specific
selectors like in talk about class
selectors ID selectors this select
specific set of elements or specific
element
when we talk about Universal selectors
Universal selector is matches any
element
types like instead of selecting elements
of a particular type so you talk about
like an asterisk where the all elements
irrespective of what name and what
category they have it all will be
selected
next tell us about
rule set see typically rule set is for
the identification for selector which
can be attached with other selectors so
there are normally two rule sets are
available
when we talk about declaration block and
we talk about selector so declaration
block contains one or more semicolons
separated by declarations set of styles
which we say and the selector is means
or which particular
element this CSS style will be intended
for
next what are the elements of CSS Box
model
okay so we know it very well the C6 Box
model is all about offering you the
layout which is a part of the design
element so in CSS we can see this
elements are like in images you talk
about text okay you talk about padding
which is so called area around the
content you talk about border talk about
margin okay so you talk about this CSS
Box model
next difference between css3 and css2 We
Know It variable CSS has changed a lot
and css3 has brought so many new
features
so we talk about a difference so in css2
so CC splits up the different sections
of code into the modules so in css3 both
CSS and HTML were put into the single
file
in css3 there were no new way of writing
the CSS rules there are new view rules
are available
in writing a CSS rules
normally in css3 it is a backward
compatibility maintained by the with a
css3
but in css2 we do not have any backward
compatibility maintained by the css2
here
now how can CSS be integrated into the
HTML page like in order to utilize this
we always use the style sheet we use
style tag okay so multiple options are
available when we talk about using the
style tag in a head section else we talk
about inline styling with an element
itself or third we talk about external
style sheet which you can link it with
your current HTML page which anyways
enforce reusability
coming back what is the RGB stream
so RGB stands for red green and blue so
it represents a color in CSS so they are
basically uh starting with the color
number zero goes till 256.
next
what is the purpose of developing a CSS
okay the main purpose of developing a
CSS to basically offer the visual
appearance to give the better look and
feel to your code so that your HTML will
offer only the skeleton part but when it
comes to the beautification
we talk about organization and
everything you talk about the CSS okay
so CSS offers the styling part of your
web page if it looks more attractive
so what is the difference between class
and IDC these are two different type of
selectors are available in CSS class
selectors and ID selectors so class is
the way of using this HTML elements
so they are not unique and have multiple
elements whether ID is unique and it can
be assigned to a single element
so with CSS different documents can be
controlled using the single style so
style can be grouped in a complex
situation
to offer the consistent look for the
multiple HTML pages so that is what the
advantages you have it
so you can group multiple Styles
together and that you can reuse over the
different pages to offer the consistent
styling
okay now we talk about some intermediate
CSS interview questions
so here in the intermediate level you
will see like the first question is like
what defined as Z index see Z index is
specify the stack order of the elements
that overlap each other
okay so its default value is 0 and can
take both negative and positive values
okay the higher the Z index value is
stacked above the lower index element so
it normally takes the following value
talk about like an auto number initial
and inherit
next
you talk about what are the benefits of
CSS Pride see the main benefit of CSS
Sprite is like loading a multiple image
is not an issue okay uh blinking is not
seen there are some advantages are
available like when you talk about like
at one single or small small images it
really takes a lot of time to download
it individually so CSS is Sprites
loading multiple image is not an issue
blinking is not seen because normally
what happens blinking happens when the
image is getting loaded so Advanced
downloading of asset doesn't make a
place of
until needed that's the benefit of
having the CCC Sprites
next how can you target the hcn H2 with
the same styling so you can do the comma
separated so you can see multiple
elements can be targeted with using
comma separated so you use comma
separated values to give the consistent
style to both the elements
so name and media types Allowed by CSS
so media types are basically a part of
your responsiveness
different media types are allowed like
in speech audio visual tactile media
continuous or paged media grip Media or
bitmap or interactive media these are
all type of Medias
are allowed in CSS
so how can you use CSS to control image
repetition so we talk about no repeat so
background repeat properties which is
available so you can see background
repeat none so that it would not be
repeated again and again within your
background
okay so we're talking about the next
questions like
about the image scrolling control how
you can control the image scrolling so
that you want the image to be remain
fixed and rest of the part gets scrolled
so here it is a part of your background
attachment property so here you say the
background repeat no repeat and you see
background attachment fixed so that when
you scroll down your image is not going
to be scrolled so that is the benefit of
this image control scrolling
now name some font related CSS
attributes
so we have some options available like
you talk about font style weight
variance size family these are the
font related CSS attributes
Define contextual selector
so normally in CS is the contact
contextual selectors allows developer to
specify style of a different part of the
document okay so style which you utilize
it can be aligned directly to the static
HTML pages
to create independent classes
okay that's called contextual selector
so responsive web design responsive web
design is a web design which you want to
remain consistent across multiple device
screens or the different type of screen
sizes and you want to offer the better
layout which doesn't looks bloated over
the different websites
so that's the benefit which you see when
you talk about like responsive web
design
thesis
nomenclature
nomenclature means The Styling commands
are written in a value on a property
fashion okay so normally CSS includes a
system Terminator semicolon the entire
style is wrapped in a curly braces and
attached to the dedicated selector
okay so this actually creates a style
sheet that can be applied to an HTML
page so this is the standard
nomenclature okay now coming back to the
next point
Advance csis interviews
I will tell you about few questions
which are normally asked as a part of
advanced CSS
okay now when do you use translate
instead of absolute positioning okay so
the translate in a CSS okay transform
value on changing
you can talk about opacity or transform
okay so the browser Reflow or repaint is
not triggered when you talk about this
Translate Okay so the transform requires
a browser to create a GPU layer for
elements okay but using the CPU changes
absolute positioning property so
translate is more efficient and result
in
shorter paint times
next name different ways to position
same aspects in CSS
okay so you talk about positioning
properties okay so the five different
positions values are number one you talk
about fixed you talk about static you
have absolute you have a chord relative
I never got sticky so five different
positioning elements are available in
CSS
what are mixins
Mixels is a similar to the function
block of code returning a single value
it is a kind of function which we say
okay
so traditionally it is used in a SAS or
okay which is typically called
statically awesome style sheet so that
code that directly compiles into the CSS
styles
so how can you optimize the web page for
the prints so you actually identify a
control
okay so called contents areas of a
website a general website has a footer
header sidebar or nav bar
or content area
so normally we say conquer the print
media without changing the website's
Integrity by using the page breaks so
creating styles for print
size your page for print and avoid
unnecessary HTML table so using this you
can optimize the print of your web pages
so what are the meant by CSS working
under the hood so when your browser
display a document it actually combine
the style okay which presents
information and document content so the
document is actually processed in two
stages number one
conversation
okay or conversion of HTML and CSS into
the document object model so called Dom
and Dom display contents of browser
difference between the use of ID
selector and class selector we have
already seen that the but this is a
simple demo of how the ID selector in
class selectors are used the difference
is all about using so here you have a
call ID which use
dot sorry this hash and there you use
Dot
so tell us about CSS float property so
normally CSS float properties
uh of positioning an image to the right
or left as needed so it typically
including text wrapping around it so all
properties of elements used before it
remain unchanged that is known as called
float
so what do you understand with the
pseudo element so pseudo elements are
special effects to your selectors so
normally CSS finds OK using applying
Styles in a HTML markup so if additional
markup or style is not visible for a
document then pseudo elements help by
allowing extra markup without
interfering with the original document
difference between logical and physical
tag so normally logical tags focus on
the content
okay and are older as compared to the
physical ones logical ones do not find
much usage in presentation and terms of
utilization at the same time physical
ones find application in presentations
so how media type Works in CSS type so
we have discussed already about a media
type so we normally say four different
type of media properties that are
available like in print speech and
screens
okay like you talk about print media
screen so we use always at the rate
media print you talk about H2 so this
changes according to what option you're
offering it
so guys here we have multiple CSS
question and frequently our CSS
interview questions are offered like
tell something about css3
okay so we say CSS is divided into the
modules and is supported by almost every
single browser okay it is an advanced
version of css2 and offering you lot
many other advancedable features which
typically in cc2 we do not have that
okay now we talk about how CSS selectors
used so with the CSS selectors we can
choose you know any element of your HTML
Okay so
you talk about element attribute you
talk about any child selector you can
basically select it
so what are CSS made scripts so the
group of image placed into the one
single image is in a CSS image script it
can reduce the load time because
individual images certainly take more
time so this takes more time
comparatively
so we have got explained CSS specificity
so the CSS specificity is a rank or
score that decides style declarations to
be used to an element ID selectors have
high specificity while Universal
selector has low specificity that's how
the specificity is all about so the
force uses categories that authorize the
selectors specificity
levels are IDs inline element sudok and
class and style attributes so these are
a different type of conditions based on
that the specificity is considered
Define gradients in CSS we know the
gradient are again a css3 property that
allows displaying a smooth
transformation
from one type of color to another color
okay so that's really awesome technique
through which you can talk about linear
gradient or else you talk about radiant
gradients well two different type of
gradients are used and supported
so what are the properties of flexbox so
we know it flexbox are basically
designed for the alignment purpose so
typical the flex boxes are Flex
Direction you talk about wrap flow
content align items and the contents
like that it is once again the property
of alignment
so tell us about the usage of CSS Box
model so normally blocks Box model is a
box binding in HTML elements that
includes padding border margin and the
actual content for the more better
alignment
so normally is the Box model you get an
authority to add a border all around the
elements and define space between the
elements
so what are the position states in CSS
so we'd normally talk about four
positions in CSS so-called relative
Statics absolute and fixed
the default position is status always
static
so difference between absolute and
relative and CSS so normally relative is
useful for some tags in CSS if we write
like 20 pixels then padding shift 20
pixels in a right but when we talk about
absolute
so it is absolutely relevant relative to
the non-static parent that means if I'm
talking about if you say write 20 pixels
the result will be 20 pixels far from
the right edge of the parent element
that's how the relative and absolute
position is
so what is the common between class and
ID see both classer ID used in HTML also
if you if you become a full stack web
developer then the postgraduate program
in full stack web development in
collaboration with Caltech ctme can help
you accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with
bootcamp level intensity and gain all
you need to be a full stack technologist
this program will give you the
foundation for building full stack web
apps using Java you'll begin the basics
of JavaScript and then Venture into some
of the most advanced concepts like
angular spring boot hibernate jsps and
MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer this mini project will
help you to understand how we can align
our content
to display to my end user so lot many
things are there we have a code CSS in
place we have a HTML in place and using
some css3 based effects using some HTML5
based effects we'll be creating our mini
website having some single HTML page and
a CSS and lot of images will help you to
understand in case if I want to develop
a website how to Kickstart them
okay so let's get started so this is my
folder I've created called Web Pro and
in a similar folder I'll be creating
some of the files so my first file will
be called styles
dot CSS so in this files.cs first of all
I need to import some of the fonts which
I will be using it throughout my
development so I'm saying to add the
rate
import URL
and here I'll be offering the location
by saying
HTTP is
phones
Dot
Google
apis
.com
CSS
okay question mark we have to use family
equal to here we can use lure up
Alura and with using this pipe symbol we
are using Josel
plus sense
so that is the URL for me in case if you
want to verify whether this URL does
exist or not so what you can do you can
just copy this
on go to your browser and try to place
this and check if it does exist yes it
does exist that means this URLs are
available to us so this is a URL which
I'll be using it for my development
after that I'll be using this is as
trick and providing some of the core
features like a margin
colon 0.
followed by other details okay like I'm
saying margin column 0 and
padding once again zero followed by box
Rising
just pressing border box
followed by outline
okay
okay and post this will be offering this
style
here we are also saying none
after that text decoration
text decoration once again none
after that font family
so we are using this
this option which you think called juice
fill
okay sorry this double which we have
used
comma
we're using one more called sense
hyphen sorry
so this would be a first set of the
style which will be Global to all I'll
be using this
well earlier we have given the common
style to all now I'll be giving a start
to my paragraphs so
here in my paragraph we are trying to
save margin
iPhone
and bottom I want to give all 15 pixels
because I want to develop all the Styles
well in advance before I proceed ahead
we are saying font horizontal size
yeah font iPhone size that we want to
give it called 14 pixels
followed by line height
line height I'll give 20 pixels
after that color
color you can give anything
okay so there's one very common color
called light blue
for that there's only value called five
f
okay 80
and again eight e
we can see that is called a kind of
light green color which is coming up now
okay which is used now a part of this
paragraph we'll be using H1 title
okay actual title and in this H1 title
we are saying margin bottom
margin bottom we are saying 20 pixels
after that color
Orange
okay uh let me put semicolon here
along with this phone family
this phone will be giving ellora
okay along with this we also want to
give curacy
Curacao okay also text
transform
this text Transformer I want to use
uppercase
along with this font size
this font size I would like to give 38
pixels
followed by font size
yeah so this font size I want to give is
called 38 pixels
or font size we've already given a word
basic we have to give
this word spacing will take in 25 pixels
letter spacing
uh related spacing of them in 5 pixels
so these are the details we have given
for the
H1 title okay so now we'll be talking
about our buttons which are the relation
field we have to go or provide to our
button so we are saying once again dot
BTN okay space a means under my button
tag a what I want so I say
a width
180 pixels
also can
yeah alert 180 pixels we're giving
height
25 pixels
followed by line height
line height we're giving 35 pixels
followed by border
in this bottle will be 2 pixels
solid
black
okay after that color
color we want to give it I would say red
would be sufficient enough
followed by display
I want to give it is called block
followed by margin
margin I'm going to give 25 pixels
Auto
and zero
followed by text align
okay
Center
so this is for btna which we have given
along with this btna there are some
other properties are also available like
import
main or the score
container here we would like to provide
position
okay
polar
relative
okay after this position we would like
to also provide the property for navbar

after 30 second display
display we are providing Flex
after that we are saying justify content
justify content we are seeing space
around
after that
we are saying align items
this we are giving is Center
okay along with this we are giving this
logo
of type A
so inside this logo we are saying font
family
this fall firmly we are once again using
the same
the one which I have used earlier
you remember belura and Q result let me
we can use this thing whatever we have
used it earlier so same condition you
can use it here so we remember earlier
what we have used in my previous program
okay font family so the same font family
I would like to use it here also
okay so logo a but let me check
somewhere down the line Port weight
phone family so let me copy the same
at least here right now okay so we have
a god Paul's family with me which we
have taken it right now to my existing
logo a along with I want to use called
font size
we would like to use structural pixels
also color
and as usual I would like to use right
okay so that is for logo on which we
have basically applied this a part of
this we would like to also use for
navbar
Webber underscore
item
space visual
and here we would like to provide margin
0
and padding
again zero
followed by line Style
list style sorry
list
style here we're saying none see that is
the benefit of having this Visual Studio
code because sometimes when you are
going wrong it immediately gives you the
idea of like saying like hey you're
going somewhere around that's what the
suggestions were not given to us so till
here we've added furthermore we'll be
adding few more Styles into my code well
you will be have seen now followed by
saying
dot level okay underscore
items followed by valuable which we have
it and along with this we would like to
go ahead with this list items also and
in this list items we need few details
first I'll talk about call Float so
float left for sure then we talk about
color width
width will be 100 pixels
and now we talk about color height
height will be 40 pixels
well
float width height we have talked about
now we talk about called background
color
background color we can say like the
elements
that looks nice
and opacity
opacity we can just give call 0.8
followed by line height
line height I can give call 40 pixels
okay along with this we also want
texture line once again Center
foreign
bar you may have some other properties
also
okay this is for never Uli and we can
also have the same property
copy
but along with this Ally I can also have
this anchor tag so we can select
multiple arguments together
so here I would like to offer text
transform
you see this texture form
uppercase followed by color
this color we are saying black
and we're talking about called text
decoration
text decoration we want nothing
along with this I won't display
and as usual it will be a block type
okay that was Li and within this anchor
tag I also can have a hover let me copy
the same
and with this anchor I can have the
property name called what
so what property you are expecting for
this so here in my hover property I can
say background color
and I can use
tomato
okay well after this in the same navbar
items I also want to have after the
anchor tag what should happen so this
conditions I want to utilize because I
want to offer some of the animations
Behavior right over there so what
animations I would like to go ahead that
I need to offer under this navigation
items Ally so I just copy this
paste it below but this over which we
are talking about we would like to
change from
to after
okay
after so I'm removing this background
color with this because background color
can be changed to something else so I
can change to White
invite well let me have few more
properties to be get added first thing
we have tried is equal position
Position will be absolute
foreign
from left side
left I want to give 50 percent base
after this from bottle
I'm saying zero
okay now I want to talk about called
transform
you remember to the property available
in CSS and here we are saying
Translate
X and inside this translate X I say
minus 50 percent
okay and here we are saying after that
scale
X
okay and here we're providing what zero
so that's what the condition we want to
provide it for the transform
and the next thing will be transform
origin
transform origin so I say fifty percent
and again fifty percent
after this we would like to talk about
width
width will be 100 percent
okay and we also want this height
will be 2 pixels
okay with hundred percent High two
pixels after that we talk about
transition
and this transition we can talk about
what transform
okay transform to 50 payments
okay so these are so far the details
which are available with us which I
would like to use it in my code
okay that is for after of this anchor
tag so when we talk about hover you
further want to change the behavior over
there so in this case I would like to
use the same
condition I just copy that
and here when you say colon
so you can see
Li
space a equal and over colon after
so what conditions you want to use it
here so
transformed
okay so here
translate X
okay so here you say minus
50 percent
scale X
1.0
followed by we would like to use again
Dot
navbar
okay underscore item
okay you will followed by Li followed by
once again UL
once again LA and here in this case we
want to offer display null
display
Okay so
that's okay and one more conditions I
would like to take it here is
here when I say Uli Li colon hover so I
can say l i
colon
over
UL align so we will say display
block
that's a condition
okay so so far we have written this much
of CSS we would like to go ahead and try
to implement some of the HTML behavior
and we'll be back to our CSS to make
this possible
okay everyone so we have developed a lot
about CSS it's time for us to move
towards our next
UI that is called the HTML part okay so
here
I've already kept it just for the kind
information I've just downloaded few of
the images
okay from the internet just to utilize
into my application
and concrete
the another
file and give the name called index.html
okay this index.html file let me have
this template with me okay so I have a
good template with me now here we want
to use some of the
awesome CSS styles for of my usual
development So within my head tag I
would like to use this link
now I'm gonna give the location so this
CSS is there that's called style we want
to say called styles.css and one more
style I would like to use in my code
but the location will be somewhere else
I am saying
https cdngs
Dot
cloudflare
dot com slash Ajax slash Libs
slash font
hyphen
awesome okay that is a well-known style
sheet we are giving the version called
5.15.1 slash
CSS slash
all
sorry all dot Min dot CSS so that is the
location actually
okay now I want to just check whether
this location does exist or not so I'll
just copy this
paste it in my browser to verify
well yes this style does exist so we
would like to go ahead and continue
well I would like to give some title in
case if we want so it is a document I
can just get the link or
foreign
website development
coming to my body tag here I just want
to give a div
class equal to
let's give the name called Main
underscore
container okay and also we want to give
ID equal to
oh that is a Dev type for that
okay now along with this I want to give
some other type of Dev tags too where I
want to use it now here within this Dev
tag I want to give another div tag where
I want to provide a nav bar so
equal to never
okay and within this number I want to
use another div tag which says
class equal to
logo
okay within this div tag we want to
provide the HF
okay a href equal to here we want to
provide this hash
okay
and this will be provided to
home so this is we have got div class we
have called Dev class equal to logo and
under this we are providing this hashtag
and using
simply learn
Solutions
okay that is the first anchor tag the
drip tag is getting closed and we would
like to start
another tube tag and in this div tag we
would like to say class equal to
in live bar underscore
items
okay within this div type we would like
to use this you will
and within this URL I would like to use
this array
okay and in this La uh we would like to
bring some
ahref equal to hash
that is the link which I need to provide
okay so in this anchor tag we want to
provide a location called home here this
is the first list item which is there
like this I can provide some other list
items too like I didn't talk about call
about we're using hash
about and here we say
about here so this anchor tag is getting
close
okay and here before I close this list
item here we would like to take another
URL tag
okay in this fuel tag we would like to
paste this list item again and here with
this hash we can just give the name call
something whichever you want to give it
again
[Music]
it did
I'm like and
20
so after that UL is also getting closed
Li is also getting closed here
okay after this we can provide few more
Ally tags here
okay so href equal to here we would like
to provide a real URL remove the hashtag
and say
https
simply one.com slash
corporate python
training okay and here we'll be giving
the option called services
This falls into the category of what
services like this we would like to
provide one more anchor tag for contact
us
let's see
contact
one more vocal our team
okay and here we say
power t
okay let me go back to my index.html
file and check the status
well it looks pretty nice now here we
have got simply learn solution with us
and right hand side you can see now here
in about you see how the things are
working for me this links are coming up
automatically it came because here if
you remember in my code
when I was seeing this about
okay this was a part of our current code
and due to that it is now making it
possible for us and that is possible
because here in y style dot CSS if you
remember we were using this a kind of
neighbor UL Li
okay so the mode I try to hover
okay so this was giving me the complete
details and due to that I was in
position to get all the details so looks
pretty nice
okay so going forward what I would like
to do is within my program as I could
see in my index.html file we have
provided this tag so UL is getting close
this div is getting close this tip is
also getting closed okay
now here we would like to start another
table
we say Dev class equal to Banner image
minor underscore
image okay now within this tip I would
like to use one more divide with
intensive we say
class equal to
Banner underscore
content
okay Banner underscore contract now
within this div class we would like to
use this H1
here we can say
welcome to
welcome to Simply learn okay after this
Break Tag as you know that is a for
break and now
this is fine tag you can say
words
okay
words
number one boot camp
okay here the instrument deck is getting
closed after that the paragraph tag
within this paragraph We Can Say
get certified
get
ahead
this value
after this the Dev tag is getting closed
the second tip tag is also getting
closed let me check
okay so that we need to organize it
uh in a better way so but initially we
have a god welcome to Simply learn words
number one boot camp thumb
how my look and feel is really gonna
help because this Banner part I want to
organize it because I do not have a CSS
for this clear so certainly I need a CSS
to organize this particular Banner
getting it because when we talk about
code Banner content so I need to tell
where it needs to go because I also
would have some banned image also too so
I'll go back to my CSS now and in my
style CSS here
let me say Banner content
Banner underscore
content
and here we can save
text align
enter and say color
you can say
white smoke
okay and also within this Banner content
we want to use the H1 tag
within this H1 tag we have to just say
text transform
properties
and line height
line height 38 pixels
okay and
margin bottom
this margin bottom we won't reuse 15
pixels
okay so that's when we have it let me
close this
sorry
and here we want to use the remove
property called Banner content
with H1 and the spine tag so that I can
change the color so here
Banner content
as well we also want to use
pattern tag within this I want to say
color and you can just say
tomato and let's check does it affect my
application yes exactly it does affect
now you can see it is somewhere coming
down the line like this
okay so I can further change it
to my application
like
if I talk about about A Renault so this
I can change it for sure because if I
have some images also those images I
also want to change
towards my application but it is just a
simple part
we are talking about call Banner
and we have also have to take some
images too for this balance image
so let's go back and talk about our
index.html file and see what some of the
balance I want to utilize it here
okay now when we talk about get ahead I
certainly need some of the banner image
too but Banner image is not available so
let me go back and try to use some
Banner image whichever we have to Define
under my CSS okay so here in my style
CSS let me go here and say dot
Banner underscore
image
in this Blended image we have to say
background new model
background
colon or you to say URL and in this URL
we have to use this image called images
slash P4
dot JPC
that will be my image and also we would
like to use one very common option that
is called No repeat so that it should
not repeat it and I want to fix it to
the top
and in a center
okay now let's check
perfect it is coming up but it is not
looking as good as it looks like it so
we want to use few more important things
think this background size
background size
cover and also want to use width
width I want to use hundred percent
and height
we want to use it because 600 percent
okay display
we want to use it Flex
and justify content
we want to use it called Center
and align items
Center let's check this out
okay now you can see it looks pretty
better compared to the previous version
whatever we have written it
but this image needs to be look even
more better
okay and the content needs to be more
awesome but anyways that is the first
thing which we've written after that we
have to write an About Us and other
areas but that is initially which I
would like to make it even more better
and more look
okay
okay so we have seen the value still
call option called get certified get
ahead the div tag is getting closed and
I want to use another
div and inside this div we want to say
class equal to about
okay and uh
ID equal to about
okay
and within this div tag I want to use
this H1 tag with the search one tag I
said
class equal to
title copy here I want to say
about us
Azure type is closed after that I want
to Define this paragraph and want to
give some details about a simple learn
okay like
and talk about simply learn
words number one
training okay we can just
provide you know some details training
providers
that's it so we can write it that much
about in paragraph tag and we can use
this div again
within this tip we say to
plus equal to
bdn and say
a
href equal to
and in this exercise we would like to
see
column
simply learn
dot com okay slash
resources and here we can just give the
option name call
no
more
to this anchor diagram the div tag is
getting close later on
okay now just like in there we have
provided here we can also offer the
details with regards to your services so
I can just copy the same
and provide about the services so you
can see
Services ID equal to
services and you can provide anything
whichever you would like to provide
title is the same about us we can set
our services
our services
so you can give any details if you want
okay paragraph
now here after this paragraph using div
class equal to
div
underscore services
and we may not have any hrf right over
here so we're removing this href tag
okay div class equal to diff or sickness
d i developed inter Services here you
want to use another div tag and in this
Dev tag we want to say class equal to
enter underscore
Services underscore
item
we have to basically provide and within
this I have to use this option called
IMG SRC equal to now you have to provide
a location so I'm saying
under this images folder we have a call
services
because the research one
dot jpg alt equal to in case of the
service is not available you can just
say
service underscore image
okay within this once this is close you
would like to use a S3 tag now
and in this H3 tag I just said
plus equal to
sub underscore
title and here we get the title name
column
web development let me go back and check
yeah so I can see this option called
about us is coming up learn more if I
talk about learn more you see I'm taking
you to the website of this simply done
resources which are available to us so
this link is working perfectly fine
and uh I can see here called our
services
it is a thing well going back so we have
a call
thus our services
so alt equal to
Services underscore image SD class equal
to subtitle web development
and uh that's it
so the dim tag is getting closed here
and I may choose to talk to words Dev
service item so let me have
another Dev tag here and in this div tag
we said
equal to
div underscore
Services underscore item
if underscore Services underscore item
okay now within this Dev tag
okay so what you want to offer now I
want to offer some again certain images
so what those images will be let me try
to copy this
and the S3 tag too let me copy this
again
service one I'm giving call service two
service underscore images server
underscore title rather than using web
development we can say app development
okay
so this deep tag I will copy it again
which is getting closed and try to use
one more
so deep underscore service underscore
item again images I'll say
service 3 instead service image and here
I can say online certification
online certification
okay
so like this
all the 3D tags are getting close now
and after that we will start meanwhile
let me check
so these image sizes are pretty big so I
just want to make them small but
initially they are okay
okay you can see we have called our
services
Okay so
you can see like web development
so image sizes are pretty big which we
can make them small to cover up the way
they are supposed to but this way we'll
be doing it little later on let's go
ahead and talk about the complete HTML
portion which we want to complete it now
okay so did online certification we have
taken so also the three div tags are
getting closed now here onwards we want
to start the another tip
okay with this tip we want to say class
equal to
equal to we want to use contactors
we want to say contact us and here
ID equal to
contractors
let me try to wrap it with this single
quotes
and here we will use this H1 tag within
this H1 tag we say
class equal to
title here and here I say contact us
contact us okay that is for the Post H1
tag we are using it now after that let's
start with another div tag with this div
we want to use class
equal to
form
underscore
wrapper
okay div plus equal to what form
underscore what wrapper
do again okay
plus equal to
form underscore what input and here we
say
the input tag
so the input have equal to what a
checkbox for me so I would like to say
text instead input type equal to what
text and just say remove the name and ID
and say
please hold it equal to
email okay so this div tag is getting
closed after that I can also use
so for
I would say subject as well as for
message if I copy this
form input so once again placeholder
subject
and once again placeholder equal to what
[Music]
three options we are using it right now
okay do after this once it is over we
would like to use another div tag
into
class equal to
BTN
and within this I want to use
some anchor tag
a href equal to hash
it up equal to what hash
and want to use submit
okay and that's it
now
we can see we have got these three
properties are coming up at the end
but certainly we can go back and try to
fix those images which are there behind
the scene
okay using what the style
so first important thing is we have got
this images with us
what those images are if we just check
here you have a call def service item
okay we have a call what Dev service
item so that we want to change it but
before that I will go back to my style
and after this H1 span we want to use
for thought
about
okay dot
service may press enter
service
or I can say services
here we talk about Dot
contact us
we also talk about dot dot
our team
okay
so these four properties we are going to
use it by saying
texture line
Center and
padding five percent
ten percent
okay now we talk about services using
Dot
services with the services we can say
background
White
smoke
now you would like to provide the tip
services where we have this options with
us we say dot div underscore
services
here
margin top
25 pixels
from margin top USA after that display
your selecting is called type selects
also justify contents
of types placed between
for Dev Services now in this div
Services we may get many different type
of options
okay this is the positive service now in
the same option in Dot
Dev services
a space
we talk about depth Services underscore
item
okay and here we want to save with
30 percent
okay now
I copy the screen
in this gym Services item
so we want to use
image font that is the most important
area here we say width
hundred percent
okay and margin button
okay margin bottom 25 pixels
okay
okay now you can see this images looks
pretty nice
yeah looks better so that's how you see
your websites are really creating some
different compared to the previous one
now they are aligned properly and you
can see here
these images are really nice
okay that's the benefit so we have this
let me call the glasses
yeah and uh once this image part is
closed we would like to talk about H3
part
let me copy this
item
and with this item we say
and this S3 will say color
tomato and margin bottom
we say 15 pixels
okay for this S3 and when it comes to
this text boxes
certainly you can change the look and
feel how you really want it so for this
you can say dot
form underscore
wrapper
or underscore
input
okay form wrapper form input
we say margin hyphen bottom
14 pixels
okay first form input
now in a similar line
uh form input we may have of our text
area
input
text it here and in this text area we
want to offer some of the details like
in I'm talking model I can width we talk
about padding let's talk about like
width I'm saying 250 pixels
okay we start adding
research pixels
[Music]
um
20 pixels we talk about
height
80 pixels we'll talk about resize
we talk about none
we say border
this bottle we say 1 pixels
solid
and
White
this is for this and in a similar one I
can use it for the text box so form
colon input
whatever we have used it form wrapper
form input so let me copy this
okay form input and here we say input
equal to
type of text
so what
combination you'll be using so I'll be
using width padding and border
copy
or in it with addict and Border height
and precise we're removing it
and
awesome so they look pretty nice
okay so we have this three text boxes
with us
and color looking nice the way we are
expecting from our application okay so
that's the one which my application is
offering about this text area and all so
that looks really nice the way we are
expecting right now
Okay so
what are the areas we have seen Tiff
Services item
and everything whichever you were saying
like this
so let's go back and check to my
index.html file
so we have a call
form wrapper which is the outermost
okay
you see now here it contains lot many
things
so here in my
program when I see like form wrapper
okay form underscore wrapper dot form
input and
talk about like the other details
talk about input type equal to text
you see like the border is like that
so if you want to have this border some
different color
you can certainly use black
now you can see it looks pretty nice
because earlier it was looking like
pretty much different now at least I can
see here the location has been given
okay uh so going back towards the
previous
HTML page so we had a call a submit
button with us okay after this the
all three div tags are getting closed
and now onwards we would like to start
working with Team details
so we are saying div
so div
plus equal to
our team and uh
ID equal to
team again
okay and now we want to use this H1 tag
here this H1 tag we say
class
equal to title and here I say
13. in a H1 tag now once it is over we
will use again another div tag which
having
class equal to our team wrapper
our
team
control
whatever
now within the step tag
uh we want to use one more div tag here
in this
class equal to
team underscore or team hyphen one
face clean
protective tag now here we will be using
a lot of other Dev tags inside this like
I say div
plus equal to team members
team members
okay and data hyphen name equal to you
can give any name right let's give the
name call
it's like space key
okay and within this I want to use one
image tag
IMG space SRC equal to
Images slash team one
dot jpeg
okay so that's the first thing
we have it so this div tag is closed now
uh I copy this thing
but total I want to use this three one
two
three and here team members I would like
to change the name here rather than it
actually let me get the name code
RPG and uh one more
that is called
okay and change the name to two
forward five three
okay so this is the first div we have
used it so this div tag is getting
closed right over here along with this
this is the second tab track is getting
closed so after having this
two div tags closed we want to use
another one so for team two
okay so I just copy the same
okay
I would like to go ahead with
Team 2 team so team members
and here I would like to say four five
or
five
six and change the name like you can
give anything I just give the name
called suppose
Aryan
others
and
so these names we are using it now let's
go back and see how it really looks
so these images are coming like that
okay so we want to use those images in
somewhere not like this or horizontal
vertical so this spot fix that issue I
have to once again look back to where to
my styles
okay where this option can be used in
better way I like to go back to my
style.css and want to use the first
option called dot over 3.
background
sorry
background now here we say
white smoke
now
again
our team
wrapper
so in this I would like to say display
Flex
and flex Direction
face between
oh sorry column
let's check how it really looks like it
there's a number change
but
certainly few more classes can really
make a difference
so our team
okay underscore wrapper
let's check this is the same name we
have used it
is our team
now in the same way we want to use this
team
so again our team wrapper
okay
Dot
team display
and justify contents
space between
okay
now here when we talk about t we also
want to say uh
our team underscore Rebel Dot
team underscore
members
here we would like to give width
how much 30 percent
and height
this will be Auto
and here we'll be having cursor
pointer for sure and overflow
hidden
and position
relative
this is what team members
now you can see it looks better now now
we have to basically divide those
because we have got separate team
members are available so we have to also
divide them two so here after that we
want to say
Dot
our team wrapper and again Dot
team members
is based IMG
these images we say
on display
block
width
100 percent
okay
height
Auto
okay
transition
transition or transition I can say or
type all
like this
okay and in a similar way
copy this team
and we'll say the members
over image
then we can say
transform
a scale
1.1 so
that's it
okay so we have this
look at field appeared okay width
transition image cover so they're all
ready with us
okay everybody so after writing all
those the only difference I've made it
like I had used hyphen but I'm using
underscore here finally when I see my
look and feel
of this
I can see now it is moving you can see
now it is all moving okay so that gives
me the confidence of like yes exactly
the code is working the way it was
expected earlier in my index.html file
okay so once this portion is over okay
we want to go ahead so three tube tags
are getting close one two and three and
here
we would like to start working with a
footer so here we start
footer
so uplifting this photo I say class
equal to
okay now after this I use container div
IDE
div class equal to what container and
again div
equal to
row
okay now div class equal to row again
another div
equal to
quarter hyphen colon converter iPhone
column now let me use H4 within the
search for I say
company
okay after this we want to use this UL
within this evil once again I want to
use some link items
list items within this list item
a
equal to
this hrf tag we want to save
HTTP okay we have already used the
simply learn.com URL
yeah let me copy this
come down
https simpleton.com rather than
resources I can say about it
about iPhone us
and here we say about this
so it is getting closed
so I copy this line again
okay so one more thing I want to use it
think HR is equal to
hash and here we will say
our team
okay
after that
we want to offer the careers so be safe
yes
and we want to use
careers
here
review
concept
Ali when you speak
so this is the detail of this so the URL
tag is getting close
and after the serial tag is getting
closed
uh
we want to use one more Dev class equal
to footra hyphen column
okay I copy this
it is getting closed here
okay so do classical two footer hyphen
column so rather than using company we
want to use stress cover
discover and here in this discover we
say simplyleon.com and here we have this
option calls kill up
hyphen
free iPhone
online hyphen
order
okay so here we will give the name call
a scale up
okay after this
we have this called careers we say
resources
we remove this
resources here we can give the name for
resources again
resources we have called tutorials
tutorials
research
tutorials here
so like this we can create as my number
of URLs as I want
okay
so once it is over
let me copy this again
foreign
column we say followers
or else we can say this option you call
work with us
all right
in this world because we can have
some options with us in UL
remove those two
in this we would like to say guest
blogging
we saved
guest blogging
yes blogging we can say blog is kissed
blog I'll meet
guest another link which I have it here
that is called become our trainer
here we say
become
hyphen our iPhone
trainer and reset
foreign
[Music]
okay so like that you're offering it and
once it is done I can copy it once again
this div
and provide few more photo hyphen column
followers
okay and uh
follow us we would like to use another
tip
okay we say div last
equal to
social hyphen
links and this divide will be closed
later
okay templates equal to Social Links in
this I can have some facebook.com and
you know twitter.com and many more names
I can take it so and here another Dev
class equal to social link here I will
not be using any URL here I will not be
using any Ally here
okay so I'm closing this username
closing this URL and I like to
well simplylamp.com or else we can just
give the name called twitter.com
okay
twitter.com slash
simply learn
Okay so
we can offer the user
to follow solar
Instagram also or to the Twitter also so
here we say
a hdf but what we need to give it so we
can see twitter.com
simply learn
we remove these values whichever we have
it
so instead we use this I
okay and in this I I say
equal to
Twitter
okay anchor tag is closed so in case if
you want to talk about like an
typical
[Music]
you know Instagram that Instagram also
you can use it now so here we say http
www
dot install
we say instagram.com okay slash
simply learn underscore
underscore e-learning
okay and I want to use the same option
there also
hi
I'm enter with this
remove this
okay so here you just get the name
called fa hyphen
Instagram
now let's go back and check
okay so you can see now we have got this
links coming up for Facebook as well as
what of this Instagram so that looks
really nice that gives us a feeling of
yes exactly the code the way we are
looking forward for it is working the
way it was expected
okay and uh if you want to offer any
other type of details that also you can
offer but this is the first thing which
we have taken so this is the navigation
links are available these navigation
links
you could also change the way they
always look forward for so I'll be
providing some links which we can later
on use it
okay everyone so finally we are all
ready so I have basically added some of
the additional styles to my code you can
see here from this part downwards we've
added this image URL
this is for body this is for Star
container row UL this is for footer this
is for photo column so because we are
also using some photo portions into my
code as you can see we will call photo
column and photo class equal to what
footer so implemented this photo
background color equal to Black we have
used it padding 70 pixels photo column
footer column because we are using this
H4 tag also if you remember like we're
using this H4 tag also so for all H4
tags this would be the basic setting
for footer column H4 before we would
like to give the contents like this by
giving this background color height box
sizing width and the null photo column
you will and I not last side we're gonna
give this margin bottom and this is the
style for photo column URL Li and list
items
clear and here you can see this font
size we are giving it this is for over
this is for photo column where we have
of course Social Links whichever we have
created so it is showing me that display
inline block margin border radius and
this is for Social Links when I try to
click on or over it so the color will
change to this white color and the media
this is for responsiveness to make sure
like in case if I reduce the size of my
browser they look better the way it is
expected
so when the line size will change to 720
pixels so this color will be changed and
this is the styles for Arrow footer one
these on we have implemented and finally
my application when I refresh it
actually looks like that see that this
is the photo area of my application
so I'm sure that this looks even more
better and convenient because when I try
to reduce the size you see now it's
still gonna give you the responsiveness
can you see this now this is going to
give you the responsiveness reason
because here we are using this Logic for
media when the change of width will
choose 720 pixels if it is going to 767
pixels so like that you implement that
so guys our project is now ready I'm
sure that you enjoyed thank you very
much for enjoying this project so
finally our application is set and our
application is working the way it is
supposed to work for us also if you want
to become a full
post graduate program in full stack web
develop
ment with Caltech ctme can help you
accelerate your career as a software
developer in just few months you'll
learn modern coding techniques with boot
camp level intensity and gain all you
need to be a full stack technologist
this program will give you the
foundation for building full stack web
apps using Java you'll begin the basics
of JavaScript and then Venture into some
of the most advanced concepts like
angular spring boot hibernate jsps and
MVC now is the perfect time to get
started on your career as a full stack
web developer
in this session we'll cover the HTML and
CSS part of creating a quiz application
the JavaScript part will cover in one of
the upcoming sessions so there's a
specific reason for not discussing the
JavaScript part because it may happen
that many of you guys will not get what
we try to do so this specific video is
for HTML and CSS and in some other
session we'll complete the whole
application using JavaScript
so let's move on and let me show you
guys what we'll create in this session
we'll create the front end of our quiz
application using HTML and CSS so here
you can see on your screen that we have
the start quiz button present on the
screen right click on it and you will
see the quiz starting this was
interactive right all this
interactiveness comes with the inclusion
of JavaScript
that's the reason JavaScript is so
important now you can see these rules
for playing the quiz right we have five
rules for playing the quiz and two
buttons are present here for different
tasks
one button is for exit and the other one
is for continue
click on continue and you can see a quiz
starts we have several questions here
for the user to play the question will
feed from a Javascript file and the user
will answer them to see the score at the
end let's answer some of the questions
over here so let's say this is the
correct answer for this question
you can see the answer is correct for
now we have only two questions present
here we'll add as many questions as we
want
so
we'll do it in some other video let's
move on to the next question for now
here's a second question so click on
next question over here and here you can
see it's a second question
and if you guys know the correct answer
for this question then put it in the
chat section I clicked on the wrong
answer intentionally
so that it will be marked as red so here
you can see the it is a wrong answer
2001 is the wrong answer that's why it
is marked as well the correct answer for
this question is 1995. Javascript was
actually developed in the year 1995 by
Brenda Knight when he was working for
Netscape Communications so click on next
question and a result box tells the user
about their performance I hope you guys
must have got an idea about what we'll
do in this video so let's hop into the
programming part directly
we have all the required files present
here so if you can see here we have this
HTML file we have this CSS file these
two files are of utter importance and
the script part or we can say the
JavaScript part we are not going to
cover in this particular section but we
have these JavaScript files here as well
so let's do the structural and styling
part of this whole quiz application
we'll create the start quiz button first
followed by the info box so let's create
them first move to the body section of
HTML document so here we are going to
create a button first the start quiz
button if you can see here we have this
button over here which is the start quiz
button we are going to create this one
first so we are going to write over here
inside the body tag
we are going to use the Dev tag with the
class attribute so we are going to write
here the class name as let's say and
start underscore button then we are
going to use a button tag within this
so we are going to write here button and
then we are going to write a
button name so button name is start quiz
and save it and here you can see the
button present over here on the browser
now
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to create the info box so for
creating the info box what we need to do
is we need to use another div tag fine
so this time we are going to use
div tag for creating the info box so by
info box we mean this particular box so
this rules box we have to keep these
things in mind fine
now what we'll do is we'll write over
here
after this let's put a comment over here
and we are going to write over here
rules box or rule box or info box
whatever you guys want to write P you
guys can write over here let's say we
are going to write over here rule box
and now we are going to create a
info box so we are going to use again
div class is equals to
info underscore box so within this div
tag we are going to use the
Dev tag again so we'll write over here
div class is equals to
info underscore
title fine
now this particular div tag this info
title this div tag with classes info
title we are doing creating this div tag
for this some rules of this quiz area
fine so this is why that's why we are
using this some
Dev tag over here so now what we are
going to do is we are going to write
something over here
so we are going to write over here rules
and
regulations fine
now we are done with this part as well
the div tag is closed so we are going to
do one more thing we are going to put it
within the pan tag fine rules and
regulations we are going to put within
the span tag so we'll cut the span tag
from here we'll paste it here and
then we have this div tag closed now
within the same Dev tag we are going to
create another Dev tag this time we are
going to create for this section so we
are going to put Five Points within this
particular div tag the one we are going
to create right now so let's right over
here we are going to write div
class class is going to be it's a list
of elements so let's say we are writing
over here info list
and then it's fine so we'll write over
here div class
will write as info for a information so
here we are going to Define our rules so
we'll write over here
let's say
you will get
within the span tag we are going to
write 15 seconds
or every
question fine
now we are going to use the Dev tag
again with the same class so we are
going to write here div classes
info
and we are going to write a second rule
over here
is no
point
of
going back
once cu
are the quiz fine
now we are going to write another rule
over here so we are going to write Dev
class is equals to info
it takes a lot of time guys to write
these rules and regulations so
let's go ahead and we'll write over here
you can't choose
more than one option at a time
this is a third rule for the quiz and
then we are going to write here div
class is equals 2 info again and we'll
write over here
this is going to be a fourth point
we are going to write here
let's say you
will get one point
for each
correct answer fine
so that's done with this we are going to
write a fifth Point as well so let's say
we have
this class has in four we are going to
write over here 5 and now let's say we
are writing over here
enjoy your quiz fine
so let's not
make it too long save it and here you
can see we have all the rules and
regulations present over here
you can see we have this these five
rules one two three four five each of
them is working fine now in the next
task for us is to create the two buttons
we have and we have two button the exit
quiz button and the continue button so
if you can see here we have this exit
grid and the continue button so let's
create them as well what we are going to
do is we are going to create
another div tag after this
so we are going to create a div tag for
buttons now we are going to write here
div class is equal to buttons
and we are going to write here button
so then we are going to create a button
class is equals to let's say quit for
the quit button and we are going to
write over here exit
who is
and we are going to create another
button
so we are going to write
name as restart the class name is
restart basically and the button name is
going to be continue fine we'll move to
the body section of our HTML document so
we'll design this button first we have
this start quiz button will do it first
and then followed by a
other things like then we have to design
this one as well so let's start writing
the HTML code for this so what we'll do
is
we'll start writing over here now the
first thing we need to do is we need to
add a div tag over here so for that we
are going to write here
div
class class is going to be let's say
start button fine then we have to write
over here
we have to create a button for this so
we'll write button over here and then
we'll name our Button as
start with save it and here you can see
we have this button present over here on
the browser let me just just zoom it out
so here you can see we have to create
this button let me just show you guys so
this is the button we are going to
create now we are done with this
let's move ahead and we'll design the
other info box basically so we'll write
the code for this as well now we'll move
back to our HTML document and we'll
write over here
so this is the start quiz button so
let's put a comment over here we'll
write
start quiz button
and that's it fine so the next thing we
are going to do is we are going to
create a rules button or we can say info
better so we'll write over here in the
comment box
so let's create it for that again we are
going to create a div tag so we'll write
over here div
followed by the class name so the class
name is let's say going to be
info box so we'll write over here info
box close this div tag now anything we
write here will be considered within
this particular box so let's write over
here the code we are going to write over
here
we are going to take another div tag
basically so we are going to write the
design the title so we'll write over
here info title
and this is a class name so
let's move ahead we'll
write over here within the span tag
rules
and regulations
fine so this is what we are going to do
now we are done with the title now the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to write the rules over here so
for that we are going to use another Dev
tag with classes
let's take any class of your choice we
can take like
let's use info list so it is a list
basically so we are going to write over
here
classes
info underscore list
fine
we are done with the class then we have
to take another div tag for
all the separate points so we are going
to write here info fine so this is our
class okay it's a mistake over here we
are done with the div tag
save it and here you can see it says
rules and regulations fine
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to write over here
other things so we have to close this
div tag first
and let's create all the div tags first
so what we are going to do is
we are going to copy this from here
basically we have five rules right so we
are going to paste it five times now we
need to write the rules over here so for
that what we are going to do is we are
going to write the rules over here so
the first rule says you will have only
15 seconds for each question
so let's write it over here
you will get
so we have 15 seconds written
differently over here you can see it's
blue in color so what we are going to do
is we are going to use the fan tag over
here so we'll write over here
pan 15 seconds we are going to write
within this pan text
and then we'll continue writing over
here for
each
question
fine
so this is our first point you can see
it says you will get 15 seconds for each
question
now we need to do one more thing
just reduce the size of this vs code and
that's it fine we are good to go now
we'll write a second point over here
so second point is
no way
of going
act once you
or the quiz fine
the third point we have is
you can't select more than one option at
once
so let's use it we are going to write
here you can't
select mode then
one
fine
we are done with the third point
let's give them the numbers as well we
are going to write one here
two over here and
three away save it and here you can see
we have three points present over here
now we are going to write okay we have
the div tag here so we'll write our
fourth Point within this div tag
let's use anything let's say we are
writing over here you can't quit the
game
with the quiz in
between
fine then finally we have the fifth
Point fifth point is
you will
get one point
for each
correct
answer
fine so we have our Five Points over
here now the next thing we need is
these two buttons right we need the exit
button and the continue button so let's
add them as well for that what we are
going to do is we are going to leave
this div over here and after this div
tag we are going to write over here div
plus is buttons
and then we have to write over here
button
class and let's say the first class name
is quit
this is for
exit quiz fine
we are done with the one button
the same thing we'll do for the second
Button as well we are going to use the
classes
restart because we are going to need
this class later on as well so we'll
write over here exit
what exit quiz we are going to write
over here continue
fine
save it and here you can see we have two
buttons present over here let me remove
this save it and here you can see we
have two buttons present over here now
we are done with the HTML part we have
the start quiz button then we have the
rules and regulations present over here
and finally we have two buttons right if
you can see here we have these two
buttons exit quiz and continue button so
we have all the five rules written over
here on the browser for this one now
let's move ahead and we'll now style
these elements so the first thing we are
going to do is we are going to write
over here
body let's define the body color ones
the whole background color we are going
to Define so we'll write over here
background background is going to be
let's see Gray
save it and here you can see the gray
background so one thing we are going to
do is we are going to change the color
from here
a this one is little bit dark
it's light and
save it and here you can see we have a
background color
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to style the start button
first so this is a start button this
button we are talking about this button
we are going to style it so let's do it
we are going to write here
start underscore button this is a class
name I guess let's check so this is a
class name start button
then we are going to write over here
position position is going to be
absolute
and then we have top top is going to be
50 because we want this button to be
present at the center of the screen
right save it and here you can see we
are going to Define left as well for
this
so left is going to be 50 again
and here you can see the start quiz
button at the center of our screen now
we are going to write over here
transform transform we are going to
write
Translate
minus 50 percent
50 fine okay we have to write a minus 50
again
so save it and here you can see the
button at the center of a browser
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to style this button so for
that we are going to write over here dot
start underscore button
then we have to style the button tag
fine so we'll write over here font
size font size is going to be 25 pixels
then we have the font weight so we'll
write over here font weight font weight
is going to be let's say 500
and let's see the color the font color
is different so it's
blue in shade
so guys I have no idea about the
font color so let's do one thing we can
use any color of our own choice fine so
we'll write over here color color is
going to be black in this case let's say
we are going to use black color only
then we'll Define padding padding is
going to be 15 pixel and 30 pixel
followed by the outline fine we'll write
outline over here outline is going to be
none for this then we have the border
border is going to be none again
and after this we'll Define the Border
radius border radius is going to be 5
pixels
and then we have the background color or
we can say the background so let's
do one thing let's choose any color
and we'll write the background color as
let's keep it white fine for this time
we are going to keep it white
after background color we are going to
write over here cursor cursor will
change to pointer on taking the mouse
over this particular button and you can
see it's working totally fine the button
looks decent
fine
now the next thing we need to do is
we need to
over effect to this button so what we'll
do is we'll copy this piece of code from
here
will
paste it here we'll put over in front of
it and now we'll start writing the code
so we'll change
the font color to white so let's say the
font color is going to be white this is
the hash code and we'll change the
background color as well so the
background is going to be red let's see
let's change the Border color as well so
we'll write border color as red again
save it and you can see it's working
totally fine on taking the mouse cursor
over this start quiz button fine so we
are done with the start quiz button now
the next thing we need to do is we need
to
styler
info box or we can say the rules and
regulations box so what we'll do for
that is we'll move to the index.html
we'll copy this info box class from here
we are going to paste it here with the
start button and that's it okay we have
to write here dot info box and we can
copy it so that we can use it every time
we need it
I guess it's fine you can see the
content at the center of a browser so
it's working totally fine
now the next thing we need to do is we
need to style this info box
so before that let me change
the background color a bit so we are
going to write over here
49
48
48. I heard this somewhere that this
color is nice this 49 48 48 you can see
I didn't find any difference if you find
any you can let me know in the comment
section so let's move ahead when we'll
write dot info box over here this is the
class name
we are going to define the width for
this info box which is going to be 540
pixel and then we'll Define the
background
and then we'll Define the background
color for that we'll write over here
background so background is going to be
white again we'll write hash FFF
and it looks fine I guess the background
save it
and here you can see the whole rules and
regulations box with white background
fine now we are going to define the
Border radius border radius is going to
be 5 pixel in this case you can see the
border is curved now now what we are
going to do next is we are going to put
it here we are going to use the
info title class for a title
so we'll write input title over here we
are going to write height
it is going to be 60 pixels then we have
width width is going to be 100 not 100
pixels keep this thing in mind
so I will write with 100 percent we'll
write
border bottom
border bottom is going to be one pixel
solid and let's see
light gray fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to write a display
is going to be Flex
cool we are going to align all the items
at the center we are going to align
items at the center save it and here you
can see
and the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to write here padding 0 and
the five pixels save it and here you can
see rules and regulations written over
here now this next thing we are going to
do is we are going to define the font
size font size is going to be 20 pixels
for this
it looks fine and then we have the font
grid so we'll write over here font
weight font weight is going to be
let's say 800.
fine so here you can see it looks fine
and let's
see if we have any mistakes over here or
not no we are not
having any mistakes as of now so let's
move ahead and we'll
now style the rules we will style all
the five rules at once so for that we
have to write over here
hot info box dot info underscore list
and we are going to write over here
padding
padding is going to be 15 pixels and 35.
pixels
we are done with this we'll write over
here again dot info box then dot info
underscore list
and then we'll write over here dot info
dot info is the class for each room fine
keep this thing in mind so we'll write
over here margin margin is going to be 5
pixels then we have font size
font okay we have to write font size
over here
we have to put semicolon so we'll write
font size font size is going to be 17
pixels
save it and here you can see all of them
looks decent so the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to write
over here
the span tag so basically we need to
make these 15 seconds
let me show Blue so let's do it
what we are going to do is we are going
to
use this particular span tag this 15
seconds is present in between the span
tag so we'll
copy it from here we'll paste it here
and we are going to use
pan over here fine
so we are done with span we are going to
write over here font
font weight is going to be 600
then we have color
color is going to be
let's use a different color of blue I
don't know
maybe we can use
excuse the RGB value first so we'll use
3 comma
okay not green let's use blue
for that we have to write 0 comma
4 comma
255 RG b b for blue
so here you can see they are blue in
color it looks perfectly fine now
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to
write the code again for buttons so
we'll write over here
buttons so we'll mention info box over
here
okay we will mention over here
dot info box dot info list dot info now
we need to style these buttons so we are
not going to need this info list and
info we are
going to write here dot buttons because
buttons is the class for them I guess
or both the buttons the class name is
buttons so we are doing good let's use
the height attribute first
okay height is going to be
let's say 60 pixels for both the metals
then we have display display is going to
be Flex so we'll write Flex over here
then we have to align these items at the
Center
and after this we have to
write
Flex end over here
okay we have to mention display first
display is going to be
flexing
so okay no we have to write justify
content so we are going to justify the
content over here so we'll write justify
content justify content at the like send
and we have to mention padding over here
padding is going to be 0 and 35 pixels
we are done with it almost so we'll
write border top here and we'll write
1 pixel
solid
and let's use light gray again
fine we are done with this light gray
thing
save it and here you can see both the
buttons are present at the bottom and in
the footer section basically
now the next thing we are going to do is
going to write over here
okay let's copy it from here we are
going to style each button
so we'll write over here and then we'll
use the button tag
fine so we have to put a space over here
and we have to write here
margin
margin is going to be
Z
5 pixel fine then we have
height as 40 pixel
okay so we have to write here height
as
40 pixel
fine
so height we are done now we have to
write over here width
width is going to be 100
pixels saved and here you can see that
both the buttons now we are going to
write over here
border border is going to be one pixel
solid in nature and
blue
and so you can see the blue borders over
here
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to write
background
okay
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to add the background color to
these buttons so we'll write over here
background background is going to be
let's see blue again fine save it and
you can see the color is a bit dark so
let's choose a light shade of blue or we
can say Aqua so we'll write over here
RGB 9
176 and
26 let's save this and you can see this
color so this is the color what we are
going to do is we are going to copy it
from here and we are going to paste it
here so every time it looks fine now
right
so everything is working totally fine
then we'll write over here after this
background we are going to write
let's see border radius border radius is
going to be 5 pixels
and then after this what we are going to
do is
we are going to write over here
color so let's define the font color as
well so for font color we have to write
your font or we can say just color color
is going to be let's say white then we
have font size font size is going to be
16 pixels
and then we have font weight as well
font weight is going to be 500 let's
suppose
and then we'll write over here cursor is
0.2 save it now and here you can see
these buttons look good
now these buttons are done the next
thing we need to style let's see what we
have here for styling now
and we have two buttons left the quit
button and the start button so we'll
move back to our CSS file and we'll
write over here
dot button
and just a second let me check we'll
write over here dot buttons not DOT
button then we'll write over here button
men will style each button fine so we'll
write over here
quit
and we have to style the continue button
as well so for that we'll write over
here
dot buttons
button Dot
restart
now we have to check the colors for both
the buttons so for the continue button
the color is the background color is
blue basically and so what we'll do is
we'll change the background color over
here
and we'll write over here inside the
restart we are going to write
background background is going to be
blue
or just let's do one thing we are going
to copy this background property from
here we are going to paste it here
and we are going to do the same for
Border as well
fine so we'll write over here this
looks good we are going to remove it
from here
save it now and for this exit button
we need to write over here
border color border color is going to be
let's see
gray I am not sure
and then we have to mention
we can say is the font color as well so
for that we are going to write here
color color is going to be
black save it and here you can see it
looks nice now
so we are done with these buttons now
the next thing we are doing is we are
going to do is we are going to add
Hoover effect in these button fine so
till now what we did is we did the
buttons part now what we'll do is we are
going to use the hover effect over these
Metals so what horror effect will do is
on taking a mouse pointer to these
buttons over these buttons the whole
effect will change these buttons like it
can change its styles
and all that things right so what we are
going to do is we are going to add a
property here first we are going to add
the transition property here
to write here transition before we add
the hover effect so we'll write over
here
transition and we are going to write
over here all at 0.3 with ease
fine so our transition is done now the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to copy this from here
we are going to paste it here
and we are going to mention the
over property here so we'll write over
here hover
and now we'll see what we can do while
using the hover property so what we are
going to do is we are going to change
the color to Red so we are going to
write here
background color is red
save it let's see if it's working so
it's working we are going to change the
Border color as well so we'll write over
here border color is going to be red
again
order is going to be of same color you
can see it's red and
we are going to do the same thing for
the quit Button as well so we are going
to write over here
quit so we'll copy it from here
we'll paste it here and we are going to
use the Hoover effect we are going to
write here inside this
color V background color we are going to
change to red
same goes for the Border color border
color is again going to be red on taking
the mouse cursor with this particular
button and we are going to change the
but we can say font color as well so we
are going to change the font color to
white now it looks good right so on
taking the mouse cursor over this exit
button you can see the font color is
changing to White you can see the
background color is changing to red
fine
so we are all done with this part
so it looks similar right not similar
though now we need to change
these
info box so what we are going to do is
we are going to write here let's say 640
let's try it
so the resolution it changes okay
for now we are
done with it and
you can see the box is fine so we have
all the rules and regulations present
over here
one thing we can do is we can put this
space after this fifth point so we are
going to write over here
like this
and you can see it's fine
fine
let's check it out if everything is
correct the class name is info for all
of them then we have the dev tags closed
perfectly fine then we have the in full
stack close perfectly fine
we have these buttons present over here
and
that's it right so the next thing we are
going to do is
we are going to
get back to a CSS file and we are going
to write something over here which is
play is going to be none
save it once and here you can see we are
at the initial stage of focus so here
you can see we have this start quiz
button and if we remove this display you
can see we have this rules and
regulations box
fine it is working totally fine so for
now we are going to use this only
so now let's move to a HTML file and we
are going to write the code for quiz box
so we'll write after this particular div
tag before the body tag basically so we
are going to write over here
div
class is equals
to quiz underscore box
this is the division for creating the
quiz so let me put a comment over here
we are going to write here
quiz box now we are
what we are going to do is we are going
to use the header tag
within the header tag we are going to
use a div tag again so we are going to
use the classes
title so we have to write the title over
here title is going to be
this application so let's change the
title in this particular code so we are
going to write here
we could
quiz application
fine
save it I think you guys are not able to
see it but if you can see here clearly
we have this simply code quiz
application written over here on the
browser so let's Zoom it out again
now what we are going to do is we are
going to add the timer so we are going
to write over here
div
class is equals to timer
and within this we are going to write
div class is equals
to timer underscore text
and we are going to write here time
left
fine so we are going to
use another Dev tag now we are going to
write the class is equal to timer
underscore seconds
and we are going to write over here 15
because we are going to give 15 seconds
to the user
we are done with the header section
so the next thing we are going to do
before we move further let me show you
guys that what we are going to create so
this is the part we just created we have
this simply code quiz application
written over here then we have time left
for this time left and then we have
seconds written over here save it now
and here you can see time left 15 and
all of these things written over here so
we have to write it here like this the
next thing the next part we are going to
design is this particular part so we
have to add a question over here for
that so let's do one thing we are going
to write over here
or we can say we are going to use the
section tag over here fine so we'll
write over here
section
and close the section tag then we are
going to write div
class is equals to q u e underscore text
let's say then we are going to close
this then we are going to write a
question write a single question
basically just
for the front end part we are not we are
going to add questions through
JavaScript but this time only we are
going to use a simple question for the
front end part just to let you guys know
how the front end actually works so our
question is which one of the following
is the latest version of HTML so let's
add it
what we'll do is we'll copy it from here
and we'll paste it here
fine
so we are done with this pan tag and
this div tag as well this is the
question tag next now we have to Define
these four options HTML 4.0 5.0 3.0 and
2.0 all of them we are going to Define
anyways let's move ahead and we'll write
over here
div again so we are going to write over
here div
class is going to be
option underscore list
and then we have to give the options
here basically so we'll write all the
four options over here
we have four options as HTML 4 3 2 in
I
then we have to add in the this
icon here as well just to let you guys
know that this particular question is
correct and we have to add two icons
right so one is this let me show you
again with the other icon
these are the two icons we need to add
so the cross sign at the
correct sign the correct sign will show
that the answer is correct and the cross
sign will show that the answer is wrong
fine so we need to add them what we are
going to do is we are going to write
over here
all the options so inside the option
list basically inside the div tag with
classes option list we need to add
another div tag so we'll write over here
div last class is going to be option
only
now we are going to add a first option
so we'll write over here span our first
option is HTML
four point
zero
and we are done with this now we are
going to write over here div class is
equal to icon
we have to write here icon and
tick and there is no underscore so we'll
write over here icon tick then we have
to write over here
I
we are going to write over here class as
fast for
times or we can say phosphat checks for
the correct one so we'll write a v of us
for check
we are going to close the I tag over
here and we are going to close the
division as well
fine so The Division is closed what we
are going to do is we are going to copy
it from here
and we are going to paste it here for
another then we have four options so we
are going to paste it for four times
and we are going to change the options
here from HTML 4.0 to 3.0 then from
here we are going the last one is the
correct answer keep this thing in mind
so we have to write over here
so all these answers are wrong instead
of this one so for this we are going to
use fast for check
otherwise we are going to use a
different class over here
the class name is
as far wrong I guess let me check
phosphat times
for I can cross so we are going to write
here icon
cross
for this one we are going to write as I
can cross
we don't need to add all of them in each
option so let's do one thing let's
remove it from here
let's move from here as well because we
don't need it in these two options it's
just the front end so we are going to
show you how to do it we have to write
here
4 4 times so it's fast for times
it's not fast for check it's fast far
okay whatever it is so we are going to
write your password times and we are
going to write over here first for check
I mean let's see you can see we have two
icons present over here one is crossed
and the other one is correct so this is
the tick and this is the cross it means
that HTML 4.0 is the wrong answer and
HTML 5.0 is the correct answer fine now
let's do one thing let's create the quiz
box footer now so we are going to
write it over here after this section
tag
so the quiz box is taking a lot of time
let me put some comments over here so
that you guys can understand it
well right over here
let
this is the quiz box
header so we are going to write over
here quiz box header then we have the
section tag over here here we'll write
quiz
box what we are going to say is
questions let's define it like this then
we have after this the footer section so
let's define the footer section as well
we are going to write over here quiz box
footer fine
so we are done with this as well now
what we are going to do is we are going
to define the footer section so we'll
write over here
the footer tank
So within the footer tag we are going to
write
div class we have to write
it here like this class is going to be
total underscore questions and then we
have to write here
after this pan
So within the span tag we are going to
use P within the P tag we are going to
use two
then we are going to use off
and then we are going to use the P tag
again
so we'll write over here like this
okay so we have to
questions we have till now so we'll
write here two of two
we have to write here
questions fine
so we'll write over here like this save
it now and here you can see it says two
of two questions over here on the
browser
fine now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to
add the buttons so
if I take you here
so here you can see we have this one of
two questions we have this simply code
logo present over here and then we have
this next question button so what we are
going to do is we are going to add this
button first and then we'll add this
logo as well fine so don't worry about
it we'll add the logo as well now let's
continue we are going to write it after
this div tag we are going to write
button
we have the button class is
next
TN
and we have the button name as let's say
next
question

so we are going to add the simply code
image over here after some time because
let's style everything first then we'll
add this simply code image
fine so what we'll do is
we are done with the next button so
let's move ahead and save the program
and let's see if this thing works or not
you can see the next button present over
here it says next question it is present

need to style this quiz box so for that
we are going to use the
first class so the first class is it's

first fine so we'll move back to our
CSS part and we'll write over here dot
quiz underscore box
space header space
title find well right over here font
size font size is going to be 20 pixels
then we have font
weight Point weight is going to be 600
pixels
and we are going to write over here
we are going to write over here color
color is going to be
save it now
and here you can see the
whatever we can say it says simply code
quiz application and the font color is
white
we are going to do the same thing for
timer as well so we'll write over here
Dot
quiz box please
header
space Dot
timer
and we'll write over here display is
flex and we will align the items at the
Center
will justify them as well justify
content
it's piece between we have the width
width is going to be let's see 145
pixels for this timer and we have
height as 45 pixels
let's see
okay it's not visible because the font
color is what we can see
black what we are going to do is we are
going to change the background color
so we are going to write here background
color as
and it looks fine now let's
diminish it a bit
little dark
so what we are going to do is we are
going to put this color over here
save it now and it looks fine now right
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to give the Border
so what we are going to write over here
border border is going to be 1 pixels
solid and
let's use the same color we are going to
copy this RGB value from here
we are going to paste it here save it
and you can see it looks fine there's no
issue now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to define the border
radius so the Border radius is going to
be 5 pixels
and the
padding is going to be 0 and 8 x
save it here you can see it says time
left 15 it looks somewhat same although
the colors are not same because I don't
actually remember the color for this one
the actual color code basically
so it looks fine right now the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to style this particular timer box so
what we have to do for that is
we have to write here Dot quiz
underscore box please
header space
timer then we have the time underscore
text class
so you can see here in the HTML part if
I can show you here is a
okay let me see where it is so it says
timer text timer text is for time left
and then we have timer set for 15. so we
are going to do
what we are going to write over here
font
onto it onto it is going to be 400
then we have the font size the font size
is going to be let's say 17 pixels
and then we have
user select yes
fine save it and here you can see
this is
the time text class let me check timer
text
okay we have to write here timer text
save it and here you can see it looks
fine now
timer underscore text let me check once
text
timer
yeah it's fine
let's do one thing
we'll write over here time text
so that it won't confuse you guys
so we'll write over here time text save
it now
and I guess it's working let's
try to change this size
okay they have this
timer class then we have classes time
text
user select none we have the font tweet
is 400
uh
okay
good I guess so let's move ahead and
what we are going to do is next is we
are going to write here Dot
quiz box then we have
header then we have
timer then we have
timer underscore
I think we are going to write your phone
size font size is going to be let's see
18 pixel
then we have the font weight font weight
is going to be 500 again
and then we have background so
background we have to
mention so we will write over here
background
background is going to be let's see
black once again black on black
I love black basically so that's not the
point right here so we'll write over
your height as
30 pixels then we have width has 45 okay
we are in the wrong track
we have to write your width as
45 pixels
something no okay we forgot to put
semicolon movie
so with what we are done with the width
as well
now we have
to save it once and here you can see we
have this box present over here now we
have to do one thing we have to
color it so color is going to be white
the font color basically
then we'll write over here text align at
the center then we have line height
line height as 30 pixels then we have
border radius so we'll write border
radius as 5 pixels then we have
border so border is going to be
1 pixel solid in nature and
of course black and color
user select we are going to Define is
none again
that's it save it and here you can see
your timer box is complete it says 15
for seconds and we have time left as
value
so it says simply code quiz application
it looks good though right
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to style the
section so by question we mean this
section or we can say bisection we mean
we are going to style this question of
us so this this particular section
basically the other part comes in the
footer section so this is a section with
these two logos what we are going to do
is we have the parent classes quiz
underscore box then we have the section
class so we'll write section over here
and let's define the padding first
padding we are going to let's say right
here 25 30.
20 and 30 again
save it you can see there's a change
ground color we are going to Define so
let's see what's the background color
the background color is white so we are
going to write here background color is
okay so it's
cursor is not a hash FFF it is white
let me see if there is anything wrong
we're going to see okay so we have to do
two things we have to keep the
background as white but we have to keep
the footer background as black fine
so we'll write over here
we are going to do one thing before that
we are going to
go to the header section and
we are going to define the Z index and
position fine so we'll write over here
position as
relative and we are going to write here
Z index as 19.
save it and here you can see it looks
fine
let me check once okay position we have
defined as relative and Z index we have
defined as
here we are
this part let's see if everything is
going correct or not let me check the
code once
we have added the position is
relative and we have the Z indexes
99. fine
oh it looks good
okay
now the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to move back to the section
we are going to style our section again
so we have
this q u e text present over here so
here you can see we are going to style
this question text fine so we'll write
over here
after this section we are going to write
Dot
quiz box please
section space
dot q u e
okay just a second we have to remove
this from here save it now and here you
can see it looks fine now
fine so we are going to style that um
footer section as well that's not an
issue so we'll write over here dot q u e
text now we are going to define the font
size font size is going to be 25 pixels
and then we have the font
weight Point weight is going to be let's
see
500 or let's do it 600 fine because this
is the question text right so we are
going to save it and here you can see
the question text is
bigger in size then we have
to modify these options for that we are
going to check
the class name is option list and option
fine we have two classes over here so
we'll write over here dot quiz box
within the section tag we have this
Dot
option underscore list class
and we are going
to put
padding here padding is going to be 20
pixels and 0 then we have
with thing else so we need something
like we are going to write here
display display as
block
okay now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to
style every option so we'll write over
here
section
dot option underscore list
this Dot option option is the last class
for each option we have remember this
guys now we are going to write here
background
background is going to be
it's the background
okay it's
sort of pink
okay that's a different background Maybe
save it
we are going to
save it
and let's do one thing we are going to
write over here
border border is going to be one pixel
solid
and
I think
fine
okay it's not working
let me check if everything is fine or
not
go back to index.html
and here we'll see we have this div
classes option underscore list and
the other classes
option
so we have this option list and okay so
here's the issue
we have to write it like this and now
you can see
okay let me change the Border color
we are going to keep it a bit
of here you can see now you can
differentiate between the Border color
right
okay so moving ahead let's define the
Border radius so we'll write over here
border
radius border radius is going to be
5 pixel again then we are going to write
here padding padding is going to be
8 pixel and 15 pixel
fine then we'll write over here margin
bottom margin bottom is going to be 15
pixels
and we have the display again display is
going to be Flex
then we have to align item set the
Center
and we have to justify content as
okay space between
save it and here you can see
okay there's a mistake over here we have
three options which are
correct and the last one is coming here
inside HTML 2.0
let me see this is because we forgot to
close the Dev tag over here
our mistake my mistake basically so you
can see we have four
options and we have the cross mark and
the correct Mark present over here it
looks good
I guess so now we are going to write
over here cursor cursor is going to be
pointer
you can see the cursor is also working
fine
now what we need to do is
we need
to
use the last child property so what we
are going to do is
we are going to use it here just
for the footer section basically so we
are going to put
it like option list
the last child of option is this HTML
5.0 fine so we'll write over here last
child
so we'll write last child last child is
going to
take margin
Autumn margin bottom as 0px fine save it
and let's do one thing let's add
onto V so we are going to change the
font size inside you so we are going to
keep the font size as 17 pixels
save it and here you can see the font
looks good
we will copy this from here now and we
are going to put the hover effect
will look nice I guess
so let's
do one thing
we are going to write here color as
so we have to change the color value
save it
and we forgot to mention over
should we are to change the background
color on hoovering as well so we are
going to change the background color
to
I don't know let's do it now
we're cool so what we are going to do is
we are going to
do it black
right
it looks
fine not the best but fine
let's
settle on this
so what we are going to do next is
we are going to use the transition
property over here inside this so we'll
write from
position as all at 0.3 seconds with ease
you can see the transition
it looks cool
so let's move ahead and
going to style these icons as well so we
are going to write here
Dot
option underscore list Dot
option okay we have to write here option
and then we have to write here dot icon
we are going to define the height height
is going to be 26 pixels
then we have the width as 26 pixel again
then we have the Border as
let's say 2 pixel
solid and
transparent
save it
and here you can see
we are going to change the Border radius
as well
so we'll write
radius as
5 pixels
in
okay let me check what the class name
for the stick and okay so we have one as
item icon tick and the other one is icon
cross so what we are going to do is we
are going to copy it from here we are
going to
paste it here
and we are going to write here
color border color is going to be
let's use this one
looks odd so let's change the color
let's change it to this one
save it I think it looks good now
or maybe I don't know you guys can let
me know in the comment section or in the
chat section as well if you are
going through the video live so we have
to write here okay we have used
color twice so
let's do one thing let's make it color
alert is not visible as
I thought it will not be
let's change the color
okay so we have to change the color for
take only
so we'll write over here tick
save it
check we have to write here dot
technically
right here like this
now and it looks fine so here you can
see it's green in color
not the green we wanted all
now if you guys know the
color code for Green let me know
it's hard so here you can see
the green color is here
we need to make some changes over here
first so let's
copy this border color from here
paste it here
visible
okay we have to copy our GBA as well
so we'll write it over here save it now
and here you can see it's visible now
one thing we need to do is we need to
move back here
slow transparent we are done with the
Border radius we are going to align the
text at the
Center
save it looks good
we have to change the font size
font size is going to be 13 pixels pivot
and it looks fine we have to change the
line height
is going to be 24 pixels
save it
cool
we will
position as
little
okay it looks fine I guess
let's change
the background color to white
right over here
down let's see if it works or not
okay so here you guys can see it's
working fine
now we have to do the same thing for
wrong answer so we have the
classes
save it
okay let me check what the class was
what was the class I don't know it was
cross not wrong
so we'll write cross over here save it
the cross looks fine
we need to change the color and
background color
so here we are with red color
make it bright red let's see if it works
okay I guess I need to change the
background color for this section
to be honest
so the background we are going to keep
which one
I have no idea about the colors so if
you guys are facing any issues regarding
colors
and do let me know
okay it looks fine I guess
I don't know
oh now we have to do one thing we have
to change the RGB value here we are
going to make it red Okay cool so we are
going to copy this RGB value from here
we are going to paste it here
we are going to save it so it looks fine
hey guys
thing let me check if the code is
correct
okay it looks fine here
we need to make it
circular right so for that what we can
do is we can give the Border radius as
okay let's try it save the program and
here you can see let me change this
green color once guys
so let's save it
operate from here we are going to paste
it here
save it now
and that's it we are done with it right
the right and wrong are doing great not
great but they are fine as of now
so basically we are done with the
questions part
what we can do is you can put the
question number over here and so that we
have to write over here
one dot save it and here you have your
question
so these are the four options we are
done with the options as well now the
next part we are going to do is we are
going to do is
footer so we are going to write here dot
quiz box
then we are going to write over here
height
it is going to be 60 pixels then we have
okay width is going to be 100 pixels
of whatever width it has then we have
the display display is going to be Flex
in this case then we have to align the
items at the
Center
finally we have to justify content as
well
space between
ish we need
put
padding as well so we'll write over here
padding heading is going to be 0 and 30
pixels
see but now it looks fine
go back to the HTML part and here we
have
this class has total questions
okay we have this pantac present within
the total question class
so we are going to style this particular
part two of two questions is not visible
over here
let's see
a question says here

to do is we are going to write over here
oh just copy it from here we are going
to copy it from here we are going to
paste it here then we are going to write
over here Dot
total underscore question
space spent so we are going to
style two of two questions fine
so we are going to write over here just
do one thing just make it one of two
because this is the first question in
our original Quizno so we are going to
write it like this
one of two questions so we are going to
write here
display as
flex and user select is
no
you can see it says one of two questions
and next question over here
who we are going to do one more thing we
are going to write over here
footer
Hotel unders question
pan p
p is the paragraph tag so we have to
write here
ish so let me check it once what we have
inside the paragraph tag
so what we are going to do is we are
going to cut this off from here
P tag over here again
so we are going to paste it here save it
one of two questions it says
okay
raise low I'll get back to you guys in
minutes so until then let's finish it
first so we'll write over here total
questions span
P so we'll write over here font
weight font weight is going to be 500
then we have
heading padding is going to be
zerospace 5 pixels
save it and here you can see the one of
two questions is working fine
the display is Flats with this 100 okay
we have to write here width has hundred
percent
save it now the next question goes here
automatically
fine now we have to
edit the first style first so we'll
write over here
we'll copy it from here we'll paste it
here
we are going to write over here
first
okay first okay first child this is what
we are going to write over here we are
going to write padding adding left as 0
pixel
then we'll write over here
footer space Dot
next underscore
but we have to write here height
it is going to be 40 pixels
then we have padding
padding is going to be 0 and 130 pixels
then we have font size
so we'll write over here font
size font size is going to be 18 pixels
then we have font weight so we'll write
over here font weight
Point weight is going to be 400 pixels
and border border is going to be
none
then after border we have outline so
we'll write outline

nine we are going to mention the font
color as well font color is going to be
white I guess let's check
okay it looks quite big for now
phone color is white and the background
color is
red
so we are going to write your background
background is going to be
red
Ing we have written 130 pixel it looks
fine now
you have to provide the Border radius as
well so we'll write over here border
let's provide the Border first so we are
going to write a one pixel
solid and red the same color border fine
we are going to write here
border radius
order radius is going to be 5 pixels
and we have to write here
cursor
cursor as pointer then we have to write

transition
you have to write you all
zero point three seconds and
e
now we have to put the hover effect as
well so what we are going to do is we
are going to
okay
copy it from here my bad
we are going to paste it here we are
going to use the over effect so we'll
write Hoover over here and we'll
change the color on hoovering the mouse
button
so we'll write over here
background
background we are going to put red first
and we are going to change the red color
up to a bit
that's it nothing else we are going to
do
make it a little bit darker because it's
not evident
the color we have to change so we'll
write
border
so let's write over here one pixel
solid and we are going to copy this
color from here
save the program
and
you can see it looks good now fine maybe
good but I'm not sure about this
background color and border color on
Hoover effect so you guys can create it
on your own you guys can use better
colors than me of course
so let's move ahead and now what we are
going to do is we are going to create
the result box but before that let me
check if everything is right or not
next button is done right
we need to
see we need to color it as black that's
the thing we are
we forgotten basically we forgot this
this box footer

okay now we need to change the color for
this
uh what we can say
question numbers
so we are going to write your colors
okay
you know within this pen tag maybe then
it will work so one of two questions you
can see we need to add an image over
here first
of the simply code logo basically we are
going to add or you can add any other
logo as well
so let me check if everything is fine or
not
to
everything else is fine there's one
thing where is this quiz box
right here display
in line
changes nothing
but here you can see
that's the change it will get
so basically we are done with this part
as well now the next thing we are left
with is the result section
fine so let me show you what the result
section is
choose any one so this is a result
section this is completed and sorry you
got only
this is because of the JavaScript part
how many questions I got correct or how
many questions the user got correct is
because of the JavaScript part basically
we are going to do the HTML and CSS part
right now so let's move back to our HTML
file and we'll put a comment over here
so basically we are done
this div tag now yeah so we'll write
over here
comment so let's say we are writing
result box so that I can

two more buttons so we are going to use
these buttons now what we can do is
first of all the div tag is closed fine

need to add the photo over here fine so
let's add the photo first and then we'll

you can see the image over here the
images
too big to handle right so what we are
going to do is we are going to style
this image
we'll move to this section
okay we are going to write here
puta
now I forgot the class name for this
image the class name was image1
right here
going to be 200 pixels save it
a the image
okay
check
it's working now we don't need this div
tag not just to use it not an issue
so we have to reduce the height of this
image as well
all right we are going to
put let's say 100 pixels
300 pixels is big
so we are going to put it 50
and we need to reduce the
width
so simply code
okay we are going to do it

buttons as well right so what we are
going to do is
we are going to add buttons so the
button class
we are going to write over here
button with classes
restart again
and we are going to write here the
button name is
play
quiz
fine
save it and here you can see the button
okay we have used the
let me check if we have used the restart
button previously so yeah we have this
restart button
and we have used the same class again
we are going to use
another button
okay so we have to write here div
class is equal to buttons
we have to cut this from here
paste it here
you have to add another button
with classes what was the other class
let me check the other class was
uh quit
okay it's going to be a new class
basically I guess we haven't used the
quid
quit class it
right
so yeah we have the quick class as well
one class is quit and the other class is
restart so we'll write over here quit
and what's the other button we
wait quiz so we'll write over here
quiz
fine
let's check it out okay both of them are
here
we have to write here quit
save it now
okay both of them are here both are
working fine
now it's time to style them
so basically we are going to style the
whole
a result box fine
so this is uh buttons everything is fine
we are going
here now we are going to styler
a result box we'll write the first thing
we are going to write here is
Dot
let me check the class name once the
class name is result underscore box
so we have to write here
okay result underscore box
we have to copy it from here
we have to mention this class here as
well
at the initial where we mentioned all
the class names
just to bring it at the center
save it now and here you can see
let's move down and
so the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to put the background color
as white
now you can see it's completely visible
now we are going to put the width width
is going to be let's say 450 pixels then
we have the padding
padding is going to be 25 pixels and 30
pixels
then we have the Border radius border
radius is going to be 5 pixels then we
have the
display as Flex
and we have a line item set
enter
and then we have to justify the content
here as well so we'll write a justify
content as
space between
we have to mention Flex direction as
well so we'll write over here Flex
direction as
column
B it looks fine so we'll align the text
as well so let's say we are going to
write a text align at the
Center
okay
text align at the center now we have to
manage this icon fine so this icon we
are going to manage
the second we are taking talking about
so we'll write over here
result underscore box Dot
icon
size
100 pixels
and then we have color
color is going to be
origin bottom margin bottom is going to
be 10 pixels
save it and here you can see it looks
okay
thing we are going to do is we are going
to
style this text whichever text we have
like you have completed the quiz and
sorry you got only one out of two
questions or one out of five or one out
of three whatever it is
it's not a concern for now so let's do
this we are going to write here
okay dot result underscore box Dot
complete underscore text
on size font size is going to be 20
pixels
and we have to mention font weight as
well so font weight is going to be 500
save it
looks fine
now we are going to write here Dot
the result box Dot score
underscore text
this pan
we are going to write here display as
Flex
now we are left with
what we are left with the paragraph and
that's it
dot core
let's put margin over here as well so
we'll write over here
margin margin is okay this mistake we
are going to write margin over here
margin is going to be
10 pixels and
zero
David let's see
let's change the font size as well we
are going to write your font size font
size is going to be 18 pixel and we have
the font weight which is going to be
500 pixels
or you can say 500 again so it looks
fine
okay now we have to write here DOT score
underscore text space
span space p
we are going to write your font
weight as
600 and then we have
a font weight we have let's go back and
let's see whatever
things we have so we have one and two
within the paragraph tag right
so we are going to write here
padding padding is going to be 0 and
4 pixels
save it you can see you got only one out
of two
not an issue but let's move ahead and we
are going to write here dot result
the score box
please Dot
buttons we are going to do
we are going to write here display as
Flex
margin
is 20 pixels
and zero
result
underscore box
Dot
buttons please
button
margin margin is going to be 0 and 10
pixels
right height is going to be 40 pixels
and
if it runs so here you can see loops
fine right
padding we are going to give reading we
are going to give let's see 18 pixels
let's do one thing let's not give
padding as still like this we are going
to do it 0 space 20.
now the text is at the center
border we are going to remove we are
going to write here
as none
outline we are also going to write here
is none
font weight we are going to change font
weight we are going to put it as
500
the font looks good
border radius
for the radius we are going to write is
5 pixels
border we are also
let's see what's the Border in this
particular
will
call it and blue so it looks fine I
guess
we have to change the cursor as well so
we'll write over here cursor as
pointer fine
uh we are done with it
almost done
and we have to write here
transition
0.3 second with
these buttons have the same class name
so if you can see here the class name is
restart for replay quiz and quit for
quit quiz and the class name is the same
for exitquizing
continue quiz fine
so that's why
let's do one thing let's
find the code for buttons button restart
so here are the buttons what we are
going to do is we are going to copy this
buttons from here and we are going to
paste them together so that you guys
won't face any difficulty or even I also
don't face any have to face any
difficulties
so this is
the last part now we are
almost done with the quiz right
so what we are going to do is we are
going to write here
the last thing we are going to write
here is
let's write over here
so we have to write here inside the
result box
will write
transform
Translate
from
minus 50 percent
deposit
we've tried here minus 50.
and then we have to mention scale here
as well
so we'll write over here
so first scale we are going to write
here what 0.9
save it
and here you can see we are done
obviously this size is different here in
this case so we are almost done so if
you want to see
everything from this start
so we'll write over here
what we can write
display as none fine save it
a
let me check
oh
the front end of our application is
almost ready
we are done with everything
we are done with the info box we created
the info box
let's
so here you can see it is the info box
we'll move to the result box
result box
I'm going to write here
this play as
if we are going to remove this
I mean so you guys can
see like we can
we can do is we can put display as none
for
let's do one thing
that's the reason it's not going so what
we are going to do is we are going to
put it none here
you can see so
what we are going to do is we are going
to show it from the very beginning I'm
going to do it guys so let me take you
through
here let me just put it as display is
none
save it so this is the initial point
let me show it side by side
sure
so this is the initial point the start
quiz and
fine click on start quiz so you could
get this rules and regulations page
so for rules and regulations we need to
remove this save it now and here you can
see we we have our rules and regulations
page or we can say rules and regulations
box
and after this we are going to put it
back here save it
we have the quiz box fine so click on
continue it takes you to the quiz
and we are going to remove this one now
save it and here here you can see it's a
quiz box
which is
somewhat same so here you can see the
quiz box
it looks fine yeah
and we have this simply code logo as
well here and here in both the cases the
next question
we have almost everything is almost the
same fine
now the next thing is
let me just remove this one as well and
we will go back to
result box and here we will write
display as
Flex so here is a result box click on
next question
here is a
result box so it says you got only one
out of two the quiz is completed
cool it looks nice right
