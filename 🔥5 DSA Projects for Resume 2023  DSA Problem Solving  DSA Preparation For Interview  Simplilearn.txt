hey guys it's anusha from simpler it's
my pleasure to welcome you all to this
session
today we will learn the five data
structure and algorithm projects for
your resume
in this video we will discuss of 5
excellent data and algorithm projects
for our resume which will help you to
understand the requirement of data
structure and algorithms and also with a
job interview from fresher to top level
experience
so let's get started before we move on
please subscribe to our simplyland
youtube channel and hit the bell icon to
get more update on the interesting and
amazing videos like this
do you guys know which is the algorithm
used to create a google maps is that a
depth by search breath by search or a
kruskal stay tuned with us to know about
that and if you are aware of the answer
please mention it in the comment box
eventually when job placement knocks the
do students often get confused about
which project to add on their resume
at that time you may go for some of the
project related to data structure and
algorithms
data structure and algorithms are the
basis for some of the technologies like
blockchain big data and most commonly
required concepts in the interview
despite of your branches
now let's have a look what are the
benefits you are getting in connecting
the data structure and algorithm
projects
the first one is uh you will get to know
the all the real world use of the data
structure and algorithms and the second
one is uh it will help you in your
placements
when your resume has some of the project
related detected algorithms the
interviewer will get to know that you
are aware of some of the concepts of
data structure and algorithms and also
most of the questions in the interview
will be related to that algorithm
so whenever you do projects on data
structure and algorithms ensure that you
are well aware of all these algorithms
like its space complexity time
complexity in its best case average case
and worst case
with this let's start with the list of
projects on data structure and
algorithms
we have five interesting projects that
is a snake game
a cash flow minimizer sudoku game file
zipper and a map navigator let's explore
one by one snake game as we all know
snake game is one of the popular game on
nokia phone which was released in the
year 1998.
today there are over 300 snake like
games just for ios
you can also build a snake game just for
yourself by using a linked list concepts
of data structure a linked list is a
linear data structure in which elements
are not stored in the continuous memory
location
this game is very similar to a single
linked list
assuming that the snake it is the linked
list tail and snake tail is the linked
list yet
whenever snakes eats the prey an extra
node is added to its state that is an
external is added to linked list 8
this process is continue until the snake
hits the boundary or itself
the second project is the cash flow
minimizer
cash flow minimizer is a net balance of
a cash moving into or out of a business
in a specific time
we are building an application to
minimize the cash flow using the graph
concepts
for example let us assume three friends
friend one friend two friend 3
friend 1 has to give 4k for friend 3 and
2k for friend 1
and friend 2 has to give 3k for friend
3.
we can minimize the flow between friend
1 and friend 2 by direct pay to friend 3
by friend 1
so we can create an application with the
same mechanism for transaction list
between n number of friends
the third game is a sudoku solver
sudoku solver is one of the most popular
and interesting puzzle solver game which
are often found in the newspapers
this came as a board where we have to
fill up integral values
with the help of a backtracking
algorithm we can build a sudoku solver
a backtracking algorithm is a technique
for solving the problems recursively by
trying to build solution incrementally
that is a one piece at a time
backtracking algorithm will start with a
starting point
then an intermediate checkpoint
a point not getting a feasible solution
and end with a feasible solution
every piece of board will start with the
starting point and reach the
intermediate checkpoint
if the solution is not feasible it will
backtrack to starting point and this
process will continue until we get a
feasible solution
the fourth project is a filezip
if you guys remember there were a game
called yct where we used to compress and
write cds and dvds
at that time there were no pen drives so
these are the applications were most
useful
you can also build your file zipper
software using a huffman greedy
technique or greedy huffman algorithm
a greedy often algorithm is a lossless
data compression algorithm which uses a
greedy technique for its implementation
this algorithm is based on the frequency
of the characters appearing in the file
the offman encoder algorithm will accept
the input file and encode it into a
oftman coded file and stores it
the user can decode the file if they are
needed
last but not least our fifth project is
a map navigator
google map is the efficient application
for showing the shortest path from
source to destination
this is the most popular application is
built using a digital algorithm
we can also build the same application
for the metro
we can consider the stations as nodes
and distance between the stations as the
edges by using the digital algorithm we
can also find the shortest time path or
shortest cost path
as we all know register is the efficient
in finding the minimum distance between
the nodes using the edge values with
this we have reached the end of this
session today we have learned some of
the interesting projects for your resume
and its algorithms please like this

family for more interesting videos
