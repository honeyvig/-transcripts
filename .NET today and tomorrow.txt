excited because right over here in the
back we have Scott hunter and Mike harsh
with Beth masse I want you to grill them
all about dotnet let's go to that right
now
hey guys this is Beth and I am the
product marketing manager for dotnet and
I'm here with Mike and Scott you guys
want to induce yourselves sure Mike are
Sean Matt GPM on the windows platform
team it's got Hunter the director of
p.m. on the.net team all right so we had
some amazing net announcements today
didn't we indeed okay so I think the
number one on hacker news all day has
been the open sourcing of WPF win forms
and when you eyes ammo library yeah what
is that thing okay so yes it's being
trending on one spot on hacker news all
day which has been awesome that's I
think there's like 25 comments already
so it's been awesome to see so there's
been some comments on Twitter to some
folks have talked about what is the
story with uwp why is that not being
open source so there's a little bit of
naming confusion and so I just want to
straighten that out a little bit so
windows UI sam'l is the official name
what we're calling the UI stack that's
in uwp so the UI that you know is in
built into Windows for the UW PE program
model we're calling windows UI sam'l
that name is actually reused that is the
the name of the new gate control package
that we released a build and that is
what was the first part of Windows a
sam'l it was open source today that will
be the project on github that we
eventually put all of the windows UI
controls and the rest of the windows UI
sam'l framework into and so timing wise
that will you know kind of happen
throughout 2019 okay gotcha so so not
everything is open right away but
whereas we make more code available in
the company much the primary thing ever
leave the controls today what's what's
available is a set of the controls and
the things that are in the windows UI
library the good package today those are
all open sourced and then we're gonna be
rapidly adding more controls to that and
then a little more slowly but still
hopefully in the next year all of the
rest of the framework so the app layout
self will actually be there as well yeah
and we know the layout engines all of
the data binding all of the things that
make a UI framework or UI framework not
just controls awesome and I know this
was like one one really big ask from the
commune
so it's really nice to see this happened
today so really exciting do we already
have pull requests and everything
actually so there's some really
interesting discussion I've been paying
a lot of attention to the WinForms repo
so I I'm kind of I should admit I I
started my first job at Microsoft in
2000 was as a p.m. on the WinForms team
so I worked there for about six years so
I have a lot of a lot of passion for the
wind-borne space and so I've been really
staying attention very close to that
that repo today and there was a I think
two really interesting discussions I
mean Oren had the first boy request that
Scott did on stage that was really cool
to see one kind of spontaneous thing
that happened the community today was
some of the icons so the wind forms had
to work all the way down to Windows 98
and Windows 8 didn't have a built-in
hand icon okay and so there was a
hard-coded resource and that meant that
you always got the hard cut resources
and if they changed system you didn't
get the new ones and so there was a pull
request to say why don't we update this
and I use the hard-coded one anymore
because you know done that quest really
works down to Windows 7 obviously
Windows an idea hasn't been supported
for a minute and so that that was a
pretty cool thing to see and then
there's this other thing called a task
dialogue which is uh it's a Windows
feature it's like a super message box
and there was basically a discussion
around adding a new class for that to
both WinForms and WPF so you can get
kind of a super message box so it's
already like the community is kicking in
good things are happening well okay so
let's talk a little bit about done at
core three and it's supporting WPF and
WinForms it's pretty cool too right yes
why what's the big benefits that of that
Scott what do we get when dotnet core
was created the the it was meant to
solve some of the problems we've learned
over the years building done in
framework the primary one being I'm
sorry for my my boy you're sick as a dog
um the primary one being how many done
your frameworks can you have one mission
so you know we technically support two
today dotnet core - have you done it
framework - and I'm a 4 X 3 5 is
actually a variant of - so there's
always been only 2 versions on on a
Windows machine at a time so what have
benefits sheet with core is obviously
you can have as many cores side by side
by side as you want no longer you have
to worry about risking an application
breaking because of framework changes I
think and you know we don't try to break
anybody's applications but the reality
is fixing a bug
maybe you depend on a bugging you don't
know you depend on a bug that happens I
mean stuff just happens we want to give
customers more control another cool
thing you get without in a core is you
don't even have to depend on a framework
being on the machine you'll be able to
actually take your winform WPF
application compile it down to a single
eggsy that is self contained contains
the framework your application all of
those things and I think what it really
means was as a developer you can decide
to be on the latest version of a
framework and not worry about IT having
to go and update all the boxes so it's
like xcopy deploy for WinForms it is
awesome
and then there's one final other you
know big advantage I think and that is
core is where we will try new api's and
so the latest greatest api's are in core
today some of the new c sharp features
will only be in core so if you want to
if you want to be on the bleeding edge
of api is the bleeding edge of language
features core is the place to be
that said diner frameworks not going
away it will never go away i said this
my talk today i'm like it's part of
Windows you have a lot of applications
are Microsoft my laptop called visual
studio.net framework right so it's yeah
but it will be supported as long as
Windows is support okay so the idea is
that dotnet framework itself is going to
be safe and reliable and always support
hit on Windows ok and that dotnet core
will have more of the bleeding edge
features if you want to take something
you can you can deploy it with the app
so you don't risk breaking other
applications and so that's why we can
move faster with donut court right and
you can be on there's two diamond core
trains there's the LTS train which is
the long-term supported train which
about one of those comes out a year ok
and there's the I want the every other
month MIT's got it faster track so you
can choose which track of core you want
one Apple yes are we on like no.21 2.1
2.1 ok and so the next LCS will be 3.1
ok gotcha
so we'll ship a 3.0 sometime in the July
August timeframe I would hope of of 2019
and that means that the LTS build would
show up somewhere in the October
November time frame
if we hit those dates so what about on
the server side I mean we've got have to
have some improvements in dotnet four
three four asp.net developers - right
that's the biggest misconception I think
that people had we were so heavily
focused on talking about desktop at
build this year yeah we were so excited
about bringing winform the wp uptick or
that we didn't talk a lot about the the
server the server is just as exciting as
to me as the as the client-side one of
the coolest features we're gonna have is
something that we've been it was called
it was codenamed laser and this was
letting you actually write c-sharp code
in the in the browser and this is not
like fake c-sharp code this was actually
the Assembly's download and running in a
sandbox browsers are using webassembly
okay and we've been showing that for the
last year so the first flavor of that
will ship as part of core 3 as well
it'll be part of a Hispanic or 3 your
code of luxury runs on the server but
the programming model is still the
programming model where it appears that
your C sure you're writing c-sharp in
the browser I see inside of the HTML
inside of instead of that so you write
is they're called razor components right
great great UI it's all in c-sharp and
so you have a full stack web development
with C sharp after like right JavaScript
at all you don't have to rely on angular
react view you can don't have to write
JavaScript I mean we're not trying to
this is not a war against JavaScript I
love to use the skills that you have if
you're if you have a lot of c-sharp
skills and you wanna use those in the
browser bang
you know you those in the browser it's
you know what context switching
sometimes do you know I mean I think
that's why the appeal of node you know
no js' cuz you're just using javascript
on both sides right so please c-sharp
developers can enjoy that as well I
think that's fantastic
actually there's a question here that
kind of relates to asp.net are there any
modification and requirements to move
asp.net MVC core to project 2 core 3 can
it be done now so the best way to answer
that question would be we just shipped a
snake or 2.2 today as well so not only
do we have the three Oh announcements
right we just had the 2.2 announcement
what I would tell the customer is they
should move to 2.2 first all we did for
three oh the three Oh bill that came out
today basically has the exact same
espenak or 2.2 bits I see that shipped
is part of 2.2 ok so there's no benefit
to move to 3 yet won't be till later
this
not later this year sometime next year
actually start having the next
innovations beyond the 2.2 stuff they'll
start showing up in the 300 bids but
today your best bet is to stay on 2.2
but we aren't anticipating any major
like changes that you would have to make
our goal is to make it as easy as
possible to move I mean there'll always
be some breaking changes 202 3 oh is
there's some breaking changes we
assemble the product differently than we
did before I mean if you're asking a
customer the Astra networks have
traditionally came as NuGet packages and
so there was a core and then there was a
spinet core which is kind of separate ok
now we're shipping the whole thing as a
monolith again and that's that's to
enable a bunch of cool scenarios we have
partners like Red Hat
that have a version of.net core they
ship we went asking a quarter being part
of that so I'll ask you can build from
source so cool so how will we acquire
like this is the wind forms in WPF is
that gonna also be like NuGet packages
or how is that gonna work it's it's you
just you just go download the 300 SDK
and I've done it new wind forms and
you're you're good to go good right so
I'm gonna show a little demo I can do a
little demo I'm kinda gonna be intrigued
reporting a twin forms out of here I'm
gonna take wind forms up on framework
and you're gonna report it to core yeah
so I've got a first off on it and he'd
also preface preview one is pretty rough
I mean we knew it was gonna pretty rough
we went we primarily focused on the
actual runtime so most of the work has
been done in the core three runtime the
tooling is a little bit behind us okay
meaning that file new in vs 2019 doesn't
have wind form for core or WPF or core
will have more previews it will have
more previews we don't have we don't
have visual designers okay yet but I'm
gonna show you how you can actually
build a core project and actually use
the designers from the full framework
application so if you look at my laptop
I've got visual studio 2019 here which
is required for core apps core 3 apps
and if I run it this is a memory
matching game you know you have you keep
clicking these things until you find the
the ones that match and you click
through and and so we thought hey let's
pledge support this decor so it's gonna
be look crazy what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go here my command prompt
and I'll do dinette new WinForms and
I'll say outputs we'll do matching game
core so that Biscay builds me a skeleton
of a wind form application encore so
let's go back to our solution and we'll
go add that existing project so now we
have a core win for map in here and I
said it in I start a project
it runs in builds hello doesn't it core
awesome but really what I want to do is
I want to get that that game running
over here so I'm gonna cheat a little
bit okay so one of the features we've
had in core for a long time as our
project system is pretty cool that if
you look on the screen here I'll get the
forums the program CS and whatnot if I
look at my project file they're not in
the project foot just points to the
folder it points at the folder and we
glob in all the c-sharp files I can also
add a glob in from somewhere else so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cheat a
little bit here I'm gonna go take all
the all the all the code let's just
erase it and then let's go back and open
that that CS project again and I've just
four let's screw this up on stage let's
paste some code over here and what I'm
gonna basically do is paste in a item
group that tells the system to basically
include files from a particular folder
so in our case we'll just erase this
there you go so as I say that notice
that all the files from the full
framework app just showed up in the core
app oh that's pretty cool so I'm Cheney
I'm a liasing into the existing project
I see so any coaching's that makes these
files happen in both the full framework
and the core application
it's got good engineer's don't cheat
they're efficient so now the next thing
is if I build this I'm gonna see a
couple errors so let's do a build and
first off those I get a duplicate type
assembly company attribute attribute and
that's because in a dot in framework
application we typically have a
properties app with an assembly info
okay in core we said why have a file
that was basically place to put metadata
we said in corylus for the metadata in
the project file and so what's happening
is in this particular case I'm trying to
dot a course trying to dynamic the
generate generate one from the project
file and so there's two of these things
inviting so we'll tell it to generate
assembly info false better now my
matching game uses this game logic and I
need a reference that as well so I'll
just come over here my reference
so you're basically switching project
systems and so you're kind of doing some
manual changes around the project system
it's so good if not the source code
exactly so the source codes all the same
now that reference is there and now I've
got the exact same app running on core
cool and it works just the same as it
did before okay so that's a little
manual because we don't have all the
tooling yet but as you can see guys you
can take some of your apps that you have
today and you can see if they're running
on core and then they perform and that
kind of thing then they read those have
instructions on how to do this come on
both one forms in WPF right and also if
you hit more than just project system
issues you can you can use the API port
tool to find out which API is right part
the party aren't supported
and you know the set of API is it's
going to be in 3s and flick baked yet
too so if you open an issue with the API
we can we can take a look at that I
think that back if you look at my my
gaming logic DLL or assembly if you look
I actually had a pointing problem and
because I had a porting problem you can
see that I installed the microsoft
windows compatibility pack that's a
nougat package so donít core by itself
as it was designed to be cross-platform
which means we can't ever put Windows
specific things in a diamond core yeah
so we have a new gate package we put out
a while ago and then in the two to
actually the two one time frame I think
and what it does is it basically brings
a lot of Windows things back it brings
registry back brings directory services
backs to management back and so if you
try to pour some your code and you find
API is missing the first thing to look
at is go and grab this NuGet package
stick it in in my case the game actually
saved your high score in the registry I
see so I brought this in the registry
got it
alright so that's good that's cool so
there's another interesting announcement
and feature of Valcour 3 that i wanted
to ask you about these things called
sam'l islands yes yeah sam'l island so
so Sam Islands is a Windows feature
ok that first shift in the release
that's I think he's just starting the
wallet now internally we called it
redstone 5 I forget what the actual
official misfit the marketing team picks
forgettable names on purpose such
Windows 10 and there will be some some
additional improvements on that feature
that are coming out and spring release
that's not for Windows but basically the
idea is you can take a piece of windows
UI sample control and you can embed it
in a WinForms or wff or anything with
really MH wins it's effectively an h1
house okay and then you can start to use
new UI features that's what Scott
Hanselman showed on stage today with the
signature control that's the main canvas
in the toolbar from from the windows you
guys am a librarian just plop that into
an existing app so that's that's what
that feature is all about and that works
in both on eight core three apps as well
as done that frameworks cool so
basically you're saying I could take my
app and
take up you know onesie twosie approach
I'm moving it to Windows 10
yes I mean the you know our goal here is
to really bring all these platforms
together so you know you can use any
feature in any app type regardless of
where you started from you know you
shouldn't think of it them as different
platforms it's just one set of API is
you can choose from based on what you
want to do so I can get a modern browser
in my WinForms out there right okay
that's very similar to that concept is
very similar we do with enas minute
years ago we call it one asp net which
was hey you might started with a web
form application but you want to add NBC
or you want to add signal are well now
we don't care if you start with the wind
for map a WPF application
you wanna go dad add a saml UI control
boom just to do that right let's choose
the UI tech that you're comfortable with
that's fantastic
yeah and get all the features or have a
giant codebase and you don't obviously I
want to either start from scratch or you
write correct large things if you know
what WinForms is like 2002 right I mean
it started from the beginning and in WPF
is late 2007 8 so these pieces probably
apps are probably about that old they've
got some yeah but they're probably
business critical mm-hmm and you know
they have to be modified and they have
to be updated there's still a lot of
people you know actively doing when
foreign ws development there's you know
over 1 million monthly active which was
developed yeah it's two minutes I think
is more than that but so so do we get
like performance benefits as well as
part of being on the core runtime so you
you will get some performance benefits
primarily and in the standpoint that
we've uh you know obviously a unicorn
core has been performance has been a big
push with us you've seen us take the web
stack and be in the Tekken power
benchmarks and as a result of that
there's been features added the language
span mm-hmm
there's been modifications to some of
the bcl-2 make some of those results
happen you might ask well why did you
make those same changes into that in
frame work well the reality is like we
we change from the file API is to fix
bugs that were none in framework but I
can never put it in your frame or
because it would break stuff I see and
so there are API improvements also
dynacord open source so anybody can
contribute and so maybe something that's
too small that we would not look at but
somebody who makes up a formas fix from
the community and we accept it
so you will find that you know core is
gonna be a little faster than done
different work yes so um kind of a
discussion going on on twitch right now
what we should kind of address maybe um
so how does uwp fit into kind of all of
this you kind of started to say like
before what the example the sam'l
library is um what is how is this whole
thing kind of fit together with you WP
so you should really think about
basically if you have that when forms of
your application and you're happy with
that and you want to add some you know
new Windows 10 features to a desktop app
and you haven't existed that's how that
you can start adding those features I
mean there's many of the 1rt api's you
could you could use already with Tim
Islands we kind of closed most of the
gaps of things that you can't use an
existing application if you want to
build an application that you know is
fully top-to-bottom brand new and modern
you can't you can start with UDP
application there are there's a lot of
investment we're doing in the UI stack
there to to kind of address some of the
gaps that you know customers have told
us about for building line of business
applications you know like shore up that
some of the data story and form
validation that we're actively working
on but the real reason that you would
pick a UDP to start with especially if
you don't if you're building a new
application is you can target other
Microsoft devices if you want to go to
an app on Xbox or service hub that's
your that's your route for that got it
okay so zamel islands are really desktop
related only got it okay that's very
cool
cool all right so uh I want to talk
about a couple more announcements Scott
I want to show one more demo real quick
I don't know one second Wow two demos
from mr. hunter well we showed before we
showed making that that game yeah using
wind forms oh this is gonna be the
browser let me shrink this so it fits in
the screen for everybody we also took
that same game it just happened to be
that that game was written in a great
way where all the logic of the app was
written inside of that game logic
assembly or class library so it was very
easy to go take the same UI and build it
in the web and so I shared that that
same project
it's a Dutton standard 2 class library
they shared it across a blazer app and
here I have the same game
running in the browser oh that's so hot
that's cool
that's so hot so Wow that I thought I
would just show that that that is the
goal is you know whatever you are you
want to build whether it's desktop UI or
web UI
you know cores gonna be a great place to
be for that that's cool and we keep
innovating and innovating and bringing
in more work load snare like we have ml
net as well for machine learning I think
she runs on some yeah some done core
stuff and so in the blog post on done in
cor three today we talked about getting
serial port access in IOT for Linux
we're gonna do some fun IOT stuff today
there's crazy stuff all across done now
that's very cool um so actually let's
ask here's a question from no content
really cute handle I like that
well dotnet native also become for WPF
and wind forms now since it's on dotnet
core so you want to talk a little bit
about what net native actually even is
so Mike yeah so dot n native is the
ahead of time compilation story that you
do yeah it's used today and so if you're
super familiar with it from developing
you there's definitely some quirks
around it because it basically looks
over all your code and basically ahead
of time compiles it to x86 or or arm
your there's some some features in net
like reflection if you don't have a type
there that it's already been generated
you basically will you know kind of get
a Miss you mouth exception there's some
some bad things can happen there on the
flip side dude you'll get a bunch of
great performance out of it so it is a
very interesting story but I believe
that Scott can talk about the the äôt
story for done at core is going to go in
a slightly different direction
I believe yeah we haven't really
announced that direction but I will I
will talk about you said which is a
great point as we started building the
web assembly work that's the Blazer
stuff you need a neo T solution and like
do we use dotnet native or do we use
something else
currently the Blazer work uses mono
actually okay because they that that
runtime had more support for web
assembly type types of things the one
thing we want to be very good at we
wouldn't be very clear about is when we
do a new native implementation
we'll do it where dotnet can be done at
all the time like Mike said I
that native made some sacrifices for
security and performance by removing
parts of net whatever we do in the
future will give you an A ot ahead of
time compiled it actually runs all of
your damn code so it might mean that we
have to use a interpreter along with
some of the native code
Thanks ah but I want to make sure that
whatever dotnet we give you is the full
net and then if you want to go dial some
of it down if you want to go turn
reflection off for security reasons or
size of device or whatever you can do
that but because you made this decision
to do that you understand that you know
there's less compatibility there than
there was before no surprises oh but I
don't think the äôt wave will be after
the done in court three waves
okay so we'll ship tonic or three with
blazer running on the server side and
hopefully we'll start previewing some of
the hey ot stuff after that cool and I
think to close the question a little bit
for no content there basically we want
to make sure that the AOC story that we
develop a core also applies to TP so you
have again one can you know what all
this is about having a consistent done
that story everywhere and we want to
make sure that we kind of close that gap
we've slowly been trying to get to what
we call 1.9 which is you know one set of
compilers one set of garbage collectors
one set of jitters one set of api's I
see you continue to see us shrink and
share stuff more and more across them
the various runtimes today the runtimes
would be mono done at core done in
framework and write native gotcha
so like and and because open source is
really kind of like change to that
culture so now we can actually kind of
do this now right
I mean before it was easier easier but
it takes them a ot is hard so it'll take
some time you know take some time cool
all right by the way skull crusher for
life you are awesome
did he just build that demo while in the
middle of the session nice so that's a
shout out to Scott nice job dude one
more question here can I now use WPF
and/or wind forms from powershell core
and or on Linux or Mac so I don't
actually know how to answer the
PowerShell core question the Linux or
Mac is so basically wind forms and WPF
still rely on a bunch of windows API is
for input/output for drawing and so you
know those are still
Windows desktop only components so we
have nothing more to share there as far
as announcements I'd like to add to that
though I people asked this question all
the time it's like we've been talking
about Titanic or three and desktop for a
while and Psyche hey you're gonna make
WPF cross-platform or you make WinForms
cross-platform I don't really think you
want a WinForms app looking like a
WinForms app on a Mac or a Linux machine
so I I think we haven't decided or even
the industry's not decided yet what the
best cross-platform UI story is and so
while it sounds great to say WinForms
could run on a Mac a Mac user would go
why do I have this weird X I don't have
the dots over on the left side I that
doesn't feel like they match well why
did you make my my Mac look like Legos
95 like a wins not whereas I it would be
it makes making a Mac look like Windows
95 so I don't think these are the right
technologies for that
I don't think Microsoft today has a
story on what cross-platform UI is
that's something that Mike and I would
love to work on in the future but we're
not there yet and so I but yeah these
are Windows Tech I think for the power
show and that PowerShell core unns on
Windows Mac and Linux so yeah you could
probably call some I mean there's
probably you know a bunch of types like
if you wanted to go use the system dry
dock drying recs you could you know like
there's a bunch of types that are don't
actually have you know UI backing I'm
sure you could use inside but you know
if it's good if it's going to you know
basically if it's one form it's gonna do
anything each one related or you know
doing vogue it's not gonna work yeah
that's not gonna work cool okay make
sense um okay how close is dotnet core
to to build self-contained executables
it's it's similar to go Ling that's a
good question
yeah so that's that's kind of a long
road maps discussion again so what we'll
do in the three Oh time frame is we will
give you a will have some some
technology we have they will basically
take the assemblies that make up your
application and compact them into a
single eggsy
okay it still has all those individual
components there does compact package
better into a single XE for you okay
the go question is more of are we going
to provide native eggsy's
on those platforms and that comes back
to the AFT store we talked about earlier
for webassembly and for dotnet native
and what
um ahead of time compiled a of t is
something we are definitely looking at
post the three old wave okay great
exciting all right so one more question
here are you going to enable enable
application domains and DLL unloading so
app domains is a good one that is that
is something that's obviously as we've
been working with partners to port their
wfe1 farms apps it's come up in it
no it's pretty rare that people actually
need that this kind of process level
isolation like features but there
there's some API is an optimum that are
useful and so we're working to create an
app domain class that has a lot of kind
of API functionality that you know more
or less but doesn't actually have the
kind of code isolation of an optimum but
it has some of the additional features
that people who found people using from
that perspective a lot of customers use
abdomens today that load extensions and
like even visual studio albums you're
using domains when you install some
other extension individuals to you it
lets them load some third-party dll's
into the application and you can unload
them we're gonna build a new library on
top of core for doing that very cool it
won't be up to mains abdomens actually
combined a whole bunch of random stuff
together and some of you didn't work
very well and so we don't want to bring
the stuff that didn't work very well for
to the core but but like just adjusting
things together that we you know and at
we could make a nap after main API shell
a sort of shim it would use the you know
do we do the loading unloading but but
you know so would be API compatible with
your existing code but then could call
the the new better functioning actually
if he has other covers but we give you
the same functionality that most people
want to use at the end which is loading
extensions
well we're building a new API right now
for that Co as a general shout out to
any API questions the best thing to do
is to use API port on your on your code
and you know either send us a report or
share that via a github issue so we can
we can keep track of these things
because now we have a public place if
you track it really helps us steer the
roadmap yeah we had a blog post about
yeah I don't I don't know it off my head
the URL we had a blog post nothing in
August that alia on the team put up and
we actually had a tool you could
actually run just pointed at your eggsy
and it would basically look at the the
api's and all it
so you felt safe it would show you the
output what it was gonna send and then
you would press send it sends us the API
is that information helps us a lot to
know what what API support okay so that
we can take a look and say hey we know a
lot of people use API X we're gonna
support it and this is not my stupid
basically just says these API is many
times not necessarily what you use them
for any variable minutes or anything
like gotcha
okay that's awesome that's awesome
privacy spell let me throw a question in
just yeah myself of it it's a common
question would you like to host the next
session okay another one that comes up a
lot is what is our story for dub CF I
thought before I wait heard show up on
the screen I thought we just we just
talked about talking about WCF a lot of
data framework applications are using
dub CF or they using.net remoting we're
not bringing either of these
technologies to core at this point but
we are looking at alternatives there is
G RPC which is an RPC model which is
very similar to a remoting or a WCF
model okay
and so the asp net core team is working
with the g RPC project themselves to
make that thing have first-class dotnet
support and actually make it like it
like it feels very similar to like an
asp net or something else would so we're
looking at that okay and we're also
potentially looking at our the purchaser
part service model which is the guts the
low-level bits of dub dub CF that we
could bring forward without bringing all
of dub see how so we're we're looking at
at various angles of how do we solve the
RPC problem because that is it's a valid
concern and we need to have one I'm done
yet that's that's a good point
do you guys want to talk a little bit
about the dinette foundation
announcement today before we little bit
of time hear of anybody that should talk
about a dozen foundation announcement
the chairman of the diamond foundation
should really talk about this so yeah
today so I just hope they're talking
about done then let's give let's talk a
little bit about the Donette foundation
and I think you know who better to talk
about it than us because we're on net so
one of the announcements was about the
governance model changes okay so
basically expanding the board from three
to seven people and six of them being
able to run anybody that has contributed
anything to any dotnet foundation
project can run
or or can vote I think that's going to
let the foundation really scale its
efforts more right so why does this like
really why do I care as a developer
well you care about your platform you
care about the longevity of your
platform and the size and the health of
your ecosystem right so that's kind of
what the foundation is about in general
writes that center of gravity for open
source around net and if we have more
people that have a stake in that and are
volunteering to do something they're
passionate about and help that move that
forward we're only going to have more
growth and more success with a platform
so that's how I took it
and yes I am the appointed member on the
board from Microsoft so I have huge
passion in this area so I I think that's
gonna be like a fantastic new era for
for.net well I think another big point
in the dungeon foundation is its
historically if you look at the last
couple of years the tight-knit
foundation feels more like the Microsoft
dinette foundation yeah yeah and with
the governance model really is about is
about making it equal for everybody
there's only a a single Microsoft
representative that has to be in the
foundation the rest of it is community
elected so it is not heavily tilted
towards Microsoft the foundation
historically has also been funded by
Microsoft and it's gonna go to a self
funds I come more of a independent
foundation that's run by the community
and not something that you know you
could interpret the old the older
version of the foundation is more of a
Microsoft run thing right and I think
there's like even like rules in there
like we're only 2 max I think board
members can be from the same company so
yeah Zack do you get stacker yeah so
that makes it even more open more fair
and get better the idea is to get more
ideas as well from other companies as
well and to be more open it to be more
or less Microsoft I mean we're you know
we're we're writing this open source
wave and we want the the net and the
dotnet foundation to be as open as
possible and I think there's just a lot
of things that we can do right when we
have that you know extra money we have
those extra bodies we can scale more we
can have you know different types of
examples we can help you know help our
community do the things they really want
to do do so I think that's pretty cool
so I'm excited it's been sitting on the
front page of hacker news all day as
well so exciting yeah
I'm actually pretty excited about that
so so we worried about voter fraud for
any of the position we only use done yet
for that so your phone so there is a
question here so there's looks like
they're having a discussion of what are
the benefits of joining the board so
that's actually a really good question
and when Scott asked me me I was like
first of all why me and then I was
thinking about it really though it's
it's a it's a volunteer position and you
really are about directing the platform
directing the ecosystem it's really
about making choices that are going to
benefit net and when I say dotnet I mean
the platform itself as well as the
community around the platform so that's
that's kind of what you why you would
join the board you have some passion
around dotnet open source and you want
to help the community and that's that's
how I see it joining the board I am
excited I have some ideas and I can't
wait to see who else is going to be on
that board so elections will start in
January so yeah if you guys want to run
we'll have all the information on and
dotnet foundation org websites about
that so that's very cool cool are you
gonna run I guess we have one more stuff
and we have one right slight slot from
Microsoft you see the competition cool
so we got a couple more questions here
let's go ahead and say any plans for UI
automation for core or uwp so we do have
UI testing for for you to BP and for
Windows apps with one app driver I'm
assuming you're actually talking about
the UI automation class though I'm
assuming that would be I'm not sure
there's there's a bunch of different
scenarios that you automation you know
it can be used for accessibility tools
you can use for testing it can be used
for for actually doing some other
scripting of scenarios so I think I I
don't think there's any plans right now
for any of the frameworks to have you
automation at least in UDP but it would
be really into know what the scenarios
they're looking for because that's the
thing that we probably have a good
answer for based you know
cool well is there anything else so you
guys want to say to the dotnet community
out there on Twitch before we wrap it up
big thing is download done in cor 3 try
the bits out give us feedback I mean the
reality is this is preview 1 I said it
was really early really raw but you know
we have like 10,000 people that ran that
tool showing us what API is they they
needed what we need is more people to
try it and give us feedback well and and
definitely go downloading up core to 2
which is released today so make sure you
get on those do bits so thank you so
much Mike thanks thanks Scott thank you
alright thank you
