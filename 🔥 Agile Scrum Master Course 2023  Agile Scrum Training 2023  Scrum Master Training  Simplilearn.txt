what is the purpose of Sprint review
option A is to review and and update the
product backlog option b is to review
and update the Sprint backlog option C
is to review and update the definition
of done and option D is to review and
demonstrate the work completed during
the Sprint now you can pause this video
and answer in the comment section below
all right guys now let's start with the
first topic which is who is a scrum
master so a scrum Master is not your

continuous Improvement and protect the
team from external distractions
ultimately a scrum Master plays a vital
role in enabling the team to deliver

methodologies and scope of PS P so here
we wrap up with the top five scrum
Master certifications for 2023 let us
look at a time in the late 90s what was
happening with software development
firms so they used to follow waterfall
methodologies so there used to be
expression like sir we have a problem so
what happened so our client want a new
feature to the software we are already
Midway creating the software we can't
add the feature so what does it mean so
the is a scenario where the change is
asked so why change change may be
because of adding certain features
removing certain features modifying
certain things already given what is
wrong in that why can't we do the change
so now Point here is not about doing the
change itself it's about the effort
additionally takes cost money in terms
of which is going out the effort then uh
the scope which is going to change at
the same time you also need to put more
more efforts which will delay the
project so now is it okay so '90s it was
okay today is it okay a big question
mark so why is that not okay so we need
to understand that very clearly right I
knew we should not have used the
waterfall methodology for development so
is that an issue with the waterfall
methodology so answer is no if it is
today's scenario answer would be yes if
it is 90s answer would be no so what
Chang in this 20 years or 15 years the
Dynamics of the market changed the
behavior of consumers changed so if you
look at anyone who is using any product
it may be a software product or a
hardware uh like if you mobile phone or
a television or any application mobile
application or application used on your
systems the upgradation of the new
features and functionality of that is
improved more and more and consumer
wants it more and you have a very less
time to respond that is one thing second
thing there is lot of competition if you
do not respond quickly competition will
take over so for you to sustain and grow
it is very essential that you understand
this Dynamics and you need to respond
quickly which was bit difficult when it
comes to approach what is called
waterfall model now how do we address
this so what is that waterfall model is
all about why is it difficult for us so
the methodology where waterfall model is
used involves teams following a series
of steps and only going forward after
the previous steps are completed so
there is a wait time involved so until
the previous steps are completed only
then I can move to the next so it is a
slower thing it would take certain
longer duration so it is best used in
the scenarios where the teams are small
and the project is expected to move in a
predictable manner so predictability is
very important when we follow waterfall
methodology predictability the variation
should be as as lesser as possible so
what is the predictability I'm speaking
about as I create this product as I
results comes up if it takes 6 months
one year 2 years 3 years it's okay so
this is how the product would look like
the predictability how the product would
look like how that particular output
would come so when is that going to come
is it okay if I bring that result after
2 years is that okay so if everything is
okay that way without very less without
any variations as such very less
variations then it's fine so because of
following waterfall model uh what is
that methodology what is that flow we
need to understand that so requirements
Gathering and documentation is the first
thing what used to happen which is true
in agel methodologies also but the main
difference here is the requirements
Gathering and documentation happens in
detail a comprehensive one now once that
is signed off only then it is moved to
the design now based on that requirement
which is gathered which is full
comprehensive then the design will
happen based on that the consideration
of process the products the people the
environment then the design happens
which is again a detailed design now
once the implementation starts if you
find any deviations the correction needs
to be done since the design is in detail
the deviation possibili is as less as
possible but the challenge comes up when
the Dynamics in the market when the
Dynamics of customer changes customer
are asked for change then you may
require to do the change now when you
want to do that change you may require
to do the change only after
understanding what would be the impact
of this change in the entire output
which you're going to create which is
very comprehensive one so because of
this it consumes time it consumes extra
effort so it may be a scenario where the
scope of work is reduced as well even
after that this excise has to be done
which will delay the project so this was
okay so when this model when uh the
things were done things were taken up
for changes it was okay because the
consumer Behavior as I mentioned there's
a lot of wait time for the consumers
also so there was less competition but
today it is not I need to go quicker so
because of this what are the
disadvantages which has came up to the
consumers or to the organization who
actually follow waterfall methodologies
in today's scenario so what could be
those so making changes would be
difficult as I mentioned earlier so then
it doesn't focus on IND use your client
customer perspective value so today I
think more and more we're speaking about
creating a value in the consumer
perspective customer perspective and the
time it takes for Consumer to realize
the value how long it takes the more it
delays in realizing the values by the
consumer there is a delay in terms of
making your product impression better in
the consumer's mind so competition will
take over so your existence will be in
bigger threat so testing phase is
delayed until most of the project is
completed because because it has to
follow step by step wait the things to
complete and then testing happen then
measuring the progress within the stages
is difficult so why is it difficult
measuring the progress within the stages
because the deliverables or the metrics
what are defined are defined to measure
at a milestone and at a end of the phase
to understand whether everything is
delivered as part of it now let us look
at how agile is going to help us to
address these disadvantages mentioned in
waterfall model so what is agile the
basic meaning of agile is to move faster
be flexible respond to change Etc but to
accomplish this there are a lot of
methodologies now there is something
called agile Manifesto on 12 principles
of agile which we need to understand so
following this accomplishing this can
only help us in becoming agile so in
2001 agile was introduced so that's
where the term agile came into picture
where people start realizing what is
agile and why should we adopt that agile
methodologies so while it was introduced
so agile Manifesto was also released
it's a set of principles used in project
management and software development so
basically there are four points which we
need to understand very correctly very
clearly so that we can able to
understand what is agile is all about
right it enables team to deliver value
to their customers with ease so agile
team deliver work in small but usable
increments then evaluation of the
requirements plans and result result
takes place continuously this allows
teams to respond to changes quickly now
change was one of the scenario what we
were speaking about now responding to
change quickly is one of the
disadvantages what we spoke about and
here it is addressed it is considered to
address that is very important now when
we respond to change quickly it is not
that I just quickly responded but I did
not address that problem or that
scenario it is very essential to address
that scenario as well effectively and
efficiently so now agile is a concept
right so it has a detailed Manifesto
based on which all the agile
methodologies are created so what is
this agile Manifesto is all about so it
is created it was created during
February 2001 so which details out the
values and principles of agile processes
which says there are some values which
is mentioned in the left which has more
weightage compared to the one which is
in the right now when we say this for
example let us take let us go one by one
individuals and interactions over
process and tools so are we saying we
don't value the process and tools that
is not the case now let us look at what
were the typical issues or challenges
anyone would have expressed regarding
the processes so delay maybe bureaucracy
and they cannot have a flexibility to
move faster so basically delays because
of uh the approval which is not
happening because of the processes now
how do we address this so can I
eliminate the process itself answer is
no because in the absence of tools and
processes none of the things which we
can do easily can exist so it should be
there process and tools should be there
the way it should be defined it should
also ensure there is individuals and
interactions encourage to have the
individuals and interactions while
having the processing tools so next is
working products or comprehensive
documentation so when we say
comprehensive documentation as I
mentioned in the waterfall methodology
during the requirement Gathering during
designing there is a detailed
documentation which is made so which
take lot of efforts in creating those
now while delivering the challenge what
anyone was faced was the change which is
coming up and making changes to these
documentations which is an additional
effort now if you have a working
products if I have a bigger product in
that a module of that I keep creating
every small small modules of it and
start integrating to the base model now
I will only focus on that documentation
for that particular model working piece
which I'm going to create in the next
iterations then my documentation changes
are less and also the way I'm making the
documentation is initially I would have
a full skeleton of the entire product
which I'm going to create the road map
and upon that I'm going to making the
detail documentation for that only for
that working piece rather than the full
product itself then these working piece
documentation which I'm going to create
as I create the working pieces I'm also
getting the feedback because I'm doing
the interactions with the users the
consumers the end users so I get the
feedback I keep making the changes
quickly and then documentation will
become accordingly the small pieces of
documentation which happens with those
small small small working modules which
are created and those are Consolidated
over a period of time by the time the
product ends you have a comprehensive
documentation the project hence you have
a comprehensive documentation so it uh
saves lot of time so documentation is
important but the way we accomplish the
documentation is one by one not in one
go next is is customer collaboration or
contract negotiation so any engagement
or any relationship or any business can
it happen in the absence of contract
answer is no there should be a contract
now how this contract should be when we
want to follow in agile it should allow
the customer collaboration why are we
collaborating to understand what
customer is required to understand what
customer needs is fulfilled right so now
this requires a lot of flexibility in
the contract itself so that commercial
is one area which gets impacted and
there should be guidelines for that also
in the contract so that during the
collaboration during the change during
the effort being put customer is also
informed what is the change which is
going to happen in terms of commercial
as well as time and everything so that
it is documented in the contract so
there is no confusion responding to
change or following a plan now I cannot
have a rigid plan as we were speaking
about waterfall methodology so I we need
to go like this only So based on the
scenarios changes so we required to
change your direction and move faster so
responding to change requires a specific
flexibility which is required in the
plan so that you I don't have a plan
which is very rigid and that provides
some flexibility that's how I can able
to create my plan so that I can able to
move or respond to that specific
scenarios which are changing so this is
called agile Manifesto and this agile
Manifesto has 12 principles associated
with this now keeping this agile
Manifesto on 12 principles all the agile
meth theologies have created their own
approaches and framework now let us look
at what are those 12 principles the
agile principles so agile principles so
here are some of principles that need to
be followed to make a processes agile so
first principle is about customer
satisfaction so one need to satisfy the
customer through early and quick
delivery of the product now someone who
is hungry if you give them a water or a
food immediately a piece of bread at
least there is some satis action there
is some realization yes I got it what I
need so energy is back so it is very
much required to ensure seeing things in
a customer perspective and customer is
satisfied so customer satisfaction is
not a result of the survey what I do
it's about how I deal with the consumer
what is that impact the perceptions I'm
building with the consumer and what do I
know about my customer do I really
understand the pulse of my customer how
Associated am I how close am I how am I
collaborating with the customer customer
that will help you to understand how
satisfied your customer is it is very
essential to consider customer
satisfaction and the second principle
would be welcome change so changing
needs need to be addressed even late in
the development process so change can
happen anytime now these changes should
not become a challenge so there should
be a flexibility in your design itself
which will bring in so that is the
reason I think when you move faster so
it doesn't mean that you eliminate or
you just keep introducing the defects
and move faster no that is not allowed
so whenever there is a change in the
feature Whenever there is a change to
some specific product functionality
accommodating that should become easier
whatever the methodology I follow that
should help me in terms of accommodating
so I should be welcoming changes it's
okay for me to have the change so that
is not a challenge anymore for me so
principle three deliver frequently so
Ure software is delivered frequently
focusing on shorter time scales as I was
mentioning while discussing the
manifesto point like I keep creating a
smaller piece of product modules so that
I keep putting into the base model and
integrating those and ultimately once
all the features functionalities are
integrated we have a product with all
the features and functionalities so this
needs to happen more frequently so the
release of those working P should happen
more frequently more repeatedly so that
customer is seeing those working piece
and experiencing and giving their
feedback
so quick changes to those working piece
making that will become easier then work
together so when I say work together it
is very essential that developers and
business individuals need to work
together through the course of project
which means involvement of customers
involvement of suppliers involvement of
your own team everyone should work
together each one should understand each
other's perspective view if there is no
proper understanding about each other's
perspective view it is quite obvious
what was expect what was delivered would
not match so there should be correct
understanding to have that correct
understanding one should work together
collaborate so they should speak Express
it is very important so feedback has to
be given by consumers regularly
similarly organization who is doing the
project should also keep giving the
feedbacks to the suppliers to make
necessary changes and once it works
together in a Unison I think that would
help in terms of bringing out the
results the way it is required that
would help customer to get the value
motivated team so projects need to build
around motivated individuals and they
must be trusted to get the job done
means when will the team get motivated
when the work what they are doing is
acknowledged when the work what they
doing the results are seen experienced
and then feedback is given there is an
opportunity for Learning and
contribution their contribution is
acknowledged only then team is motivated
when there is a motivated team when team
feels there is someone with whom they
can look up to is quite obvious team
will also come up with certain set of
innovation in their mind giving their
feedback as well involving themsel in
terms of getting the results what is
required so it is always essential to
ensure the team which is involved in
creating the products is always
motivated so I think when we say team
the conflict also come across there may
be a clash between various different
thoughts and preferences so one cannot
just shy away being a manager one cannot
shy away from it he or she should
involve sit with the team resolve those
put things in the right direction so
right interpersonal skills are very
important here next face Toof face
interactions so which helps in terms of
most efficient means of communication
which helps in terms of giving a proper
Clarity in terms of what is required so
that I sent an email I expect the person
to do it that is not the case what we're
discussing about so more and more
interactions which should happen face to
face so that each other understand what
requires to be done and there is a quick
feedback which can happen when that
particular interactions conversation
which keeps happening so one can
understand other perspective view as
well and working software so it is a
primarily the deliverable which you're
speaking about which has to come
regularly so more and more working piece
as it comes customer can give feedback
based on their experience on this
working piece instead of just imagining
something and then giving the feedback
so it should not look like an hypothesis
or something which is in the Dreamland
so I told something the person who heard
VIs visualize something else it should
not end up that way instead of that give
the working piece expect the consumer
the user to give the feedback so that it
helps in terms of creating that
particular product ultimately which is
usable and which is going to create
value to the consumers so next is
constant pace so agile process promotes
sustainable development so it should not
I did it and I sleep I did it and then
I'm waiting for something else no there
should be frequent deliverables which is
happening so there should be constant
moment from left to right from beginning
to end so that the deliverables which
are expected keeps happening so that
consumers or users are realizing the
value of it so it should be constant
Pace the velocity the speed which needs
to be adopted then good design agility
can be improved by focusing on technical
excellence and good design so when we
say technical excellence and good design
it is very essential to understand
inside towards what is that product
being delivered inside towards what is
the techn technology being used Insight
towards the processes the capabilities
skills so all this comes together when
people sit together and focus on
creating that product or services so
they are putting the effort towards
designing it appropriately so that that
will fit for purpose so since things are
moved step by step in terms of creating
a working piece the detail designing of
that small working piece would happen
which can happen quicker as well and
since these are going and fitting into
the archit Ure which is basically open
architecture kind of scenarios what we
speaking about so all those modules what
you create you keep plugging into it so
that you were designing that small piece
was quicker so instead of Designing the
entire system as a whole in detail
you're just creating that small small
pieces and fitting into that
architecture which is open so pluggable
so that gives flexibility as well and
changes to the design will become easier
if it's not working and the agility
helps in accomplishing that Simplicity
the amount of work that's not being done
is to be minimized meaning when we say
Simplicity doesn't mean less right so
the appropriate number of tasks the
minimum number of task which needs to be
done and mostly I think all nonv value
adding activities and processes would be
removed it has to be removed so the more
optimized more simpler in terms of
handling things is always good so that
only those what is required to be done
are done so it is very clearly visible
and there will be Clarity
self-organization so when we say
self-organized teams who is not capable
of everything but when you look at a
team as a whole each one has different
different skills many skills not one or
two skills many skills which they are
complimenting to each other so they come
together they discuss together they
focus on the architectures requirements
and design and address it together so
team is also owning the ownership is one
thing when it comes to picture when we
say team so here since team is actually
taking up that ownership and organizing
themsel to accomplish the results the
products what is required so then obious
obviously the results will happen the
way it is needed and they will become
accountable as a team so they cannot
have a blaming scenario where because of
one or two members it is happening they
should collaborate better they should be
self-organizing what should happen so
next is reflect and adjust so when are
we going to reflect reflect upon what is
that happening learn understand keep
learning it having a reflection to that
what is happening means responding to
that so that Improvement can happen
quicker Effectiveness can be improved by
the team regularly reflecting on it so
team is also understanding team is also
having that accountability to ensure
that necessary adjustments necessary
actions are taken to make those changes
and Corrections quickly so these are
about 12 principles so which supports
which helps that accomplishment of
Manifesto points the four Manifesto
points what is mentioned so keeping
these four Manifesto points four values
which is mentioned in Manifesto and then
12 principles so keeping these in mind
any agile methodologies have their own
approaches and they accomplish all of
this so further let us look at some of
the uh advantages what would be there
when following agile so we looked at the
disadvantages what we have when we
follow waterfall so did we overcome
those the disadvantages what we had in
waterfall did we overcome that using
agile so what are the advantages of
agile so agile is helpful in terms of
handling large amounts of interactions
between client and project team because
because it is throwing lights on it the
importance of interactions the
importance of collaboration the what is
that self organized teams it is spoken
more and more then improve transparency
to caims in every phase of the project
how this transparency because customer
is seeing those products the products
with features and functionalities are
seen they're experiencing it and based
on that they're given the feedback there
is nothing something hidden like when I
go with waterfall till the end of the
project customer don't know what is
going to come out as a whole but here
since the working piece is given
regularly customer is seeing it the
users are using it and giving their
feedback so interactions increased so
visibility towards what we are creating
a results is more right then the
delivery of the output is predictable
and can sometime be earlier than
expected because we know what is being
delivered more and more clarity users
are obtaining at the same time the team
which is creating is obtaining because
of it the pulse of the customer the
directions are clear accommodating
changes which was a challenges in it was
a big challenge in waterfall methodology
has become easier here so then the cost
of the project are predictable and
follow a rigid schedule so it is very
easy to handle the schedules because
more and more you interact and more
iterations or in creation of small small
working piece of a product working
module of the product so now as you
progress in that you understood the
environment better you understood the
clients better the customers better the
expectation better and moving faster so
that will become easier for you now you
have become predictable You can predict
easily what is that going to happen
ultimately so more and more visibility
you start getting so handling things
will become easier so then it allows for
changes to refine and reprioritize the
product backlog so when I say product
backlog we need to understand the
various different user stories what is
return to deliver so that is a list of
deliverables product backlog what are
there since we already know what are the
things needs to be created so this helps
in terms of prioritizing those changing
the priorities based on the change
scenario and then taking the pace taking
the speed accordingly the client can
provide the priority of features
allowing the team to ensure maximum
project value so since it is visible
what are the user stories what are the
effects written what is that order
priorities order of priority what we
kept now the change scenario obviously
tells us do we really need to change
this priority of which feature has to be
done first so that will become easier
because you have the list only changing
that order in the list and then going
forward accordingly integration is not
an issue because we have the base model
which can integrate all of this together
with no issues now then by focusing on
needs of the users the team can deliver
value to the customers so users are
involved more often so user pulse is
understood what user requires is clearly
understood so delivering that value to
the customer will become more easier and
simpler so so then project is broken
into smaller units with high quality
development testing and collaboration
because you have the flexibility so
since you have better visibility you can
able to do this and you move one by one
iteration by iterations you progress
further so those were the advantages of
adopting agile now keeping that agile
Manifesto and 12 principles of Manifesto
so what are the types of typical agile
methodologies would come across so there
are few which we're going to look at as
part of it which we need to know so
these agile methodologies definitely
considers the agile Manifesto points and
then they demonstrate it in their own
way now agile methodology perspective
let us go one by one so some of them to
look at the first one is XP that is
Extreme programming so this is the
framework that enables teams to create
highquality software and improves their
quality of life so it enables software
development with appropriate engineering
practices so and then when is it
applicable so it is applicable to the
scenario where changing software
requirements to handle risks caused due
to new technology while working with a
small extended development team to use
technology to allow automated unit and
functional tests so that is about
extreme programming so next let us look
at kban so kban is a methodology which
is used to design manage and improve the
flow of system it is actually called as
pull system so visual system so
everything which is actually put on a
board and it is visible to everyone what
work need to be done what is in progress
who has to do it is very clearly visible
so organizations can visualize their
flow of work and the limiting their work
in progress so what is limiting what is
stopping is clearly visible so generally
if I look at whenever I'll just take a
scenario of a meeting and minutes of
meeting which always discuss about it
now when the there's a minutes of
meeting shared with many people who have
participated in the meeting there are
certain action items given to them for
example now these action items will have
a Target day to complete and accordingly
those needs to be closed now when the
next meeting happens when you look at
that action item status majority of them
are not addressed what could be the
reason is that people are not sensitive
about answering or addressing those so
more than that the prioritization
changes so one important thing we need
to understand how kban works here is it
is a visual system compared to that
minutes of meeting which is not visible
to us always the Conan board is visible
to us always so one which is visible to
us always makes us put a conscious
effort to close it because our name is
indicated on the board the work need to
be completed is mentioned against our
name then we need to take it up and then
close it so it pushes it it we will put
a conscious effort because it is visible
and I cannot build stories telling that
why I did not do why did I not consider
this as a priority rather than consider
something else as a priority so this
compound straight away addresses it and
then it's also called as pull system
because people pull the work from it and
then complete right so where is this
applicable it can be used in situations
where work arrives in an unpredictable
fashion so that means it gives lot of
flexibility in terms of adopting to the
changes which are happening the Dynamics
environment so it is also used to deploy
work immediately without waiting for
other work items so since it is visible
I think things can go smoother easier so
that people are owning it rather than
just disowning it so now let us look at
lean so when we say lean it is very
important for us to understand that
value is always in customer perspective
and elimination of waste these are the
two things mainly spoken about so lean
is a set of tools and principles that
aims to identify and remove w waste to
increase the speed of process
development it focuses on maximizing the
value to the client ensuring waste is
minimized so when you look at visualize
a processes process interfaces and the
flow so the interface certain way so
unless the output of one process or
procedures getting into another process
so that flow should be smoother like
many pipes connected together and water
is Flowing so let us assume series of
pipes which is of around 1 ft in terms
of diameter of each of the pipes water
is flowing in between if you have a pipe
which is of half a feet now what happens
to the downstream after that half ft
pipe the entire capacity in the
downstream even though it has 1 ft
diameter pipe it leads to the waste
underutilized capacity because this has
become bottleneck now such bottlenecks
such the one which contributes to the
waste has to be eliminated that is very
important so value should be seen in the
consumer perspective and that value
would happen only through the series
value streams then in this value stream
the identification of the constraints
and bottlenecks and elimination of waste
now what are the contributors of waste
so waiting time more often changing
things moving from one place to another
place allowing defects to flow which
leads towards rework so all this
likewise many things which actually end
up in giving the ways so one has to
visualize understand realize what are
those nonv valuing activities and
eliminating those is very important
right so now when is it applicable lean
principles apply to any sector where
there is waste of any form so it can be
applied easily so one needs to know that
so it should effort which needs to be
put with the objective to accomplish so
your are ability to move faster your
ability to create that product which is
more efficient so only you can achieve
it the effective results can happen only
when there is a lesser delays or lesser
waste non valuating activities that
needs to be understood and eliminate
those so next one of the popular
methodology would be scrum so scrum is a
framework that is used by teams to
establish a hypothesis trying it out
reflect on the experience and adjust it
is used to enable teams to incorporate
practices from other Frameworks
depending on the team's requirement it's
a simple framework which speaks about a
product owner a scrum Master a
self-organizing team so some of the
terminologies what it uses is Sprint
daily scrum product backlog Sprint
backlog so it's very essential to
understand this framework simpler and
able to adopt it is also very easy when
is it applicable it is used when cross
functional teams are working on product
development when work is split into more
than one 2 to 4 B
iterations so these iterations are
called as Sprints Small Time boxed
iterations so this will also help in
terms of accomplishing the results
provides that flexibility and able to
move faster then Crystal so Crystal is
an approach to the software development
that focuses on people and their
interactions rather than tools and
processes it is aimed to streamline
processes and improve optimization it
works on principle that projects are
unique and dynamic each requiring its
specific methods so where is it
applicable it focuses on strengthening
teams communication it also focuses on
continuous integration active user
involvement and configurable processes
so these are the few agile methodologies
which are there which are more popular
more heard however we can come across
many other methodologies like safe Agile
which is a scaled scenario for more
complex projects so likewise we have
many methodologies uh which
organizations adopt and these are few
for us to understand we often think of
high levels of collaboration and
flexibility as well as iterative
environment in which requirements evolve
alongside the changing needs so as a
result we also tend to conceptualize
agile as an approach that helps
development teams across various
Industries deliver new features faster
but how do we get there what does
history of agile enti and how can
knowing the history of agile help us
better understand the methodology and
its positive impact on today's
development World let us look at it so
now historically if you see the aall
approach was fine it was delivering the
required value but it required teams to
stick to the requirements and scope of
work set out at the very beginning of
the project
and not make any changes or additions
along the way as the project progresses
and following that fixed plan could
prove trouble sometimes comparing to the
scenarios which we had earlier which is
today the trouble is more challenges
more so reason being waterfall
methodology prioritized bringing a
complete product to Market meaning it
could take years before teams finish the
project in hand the scenarios of change
delay in responding to problem
resolution meeting changing Market
requirements were challenging which led
to introduction of vile methodologies so
the various development methods like
scrum rapid application development
extreme programming dsdm featur driven
development and pragmatic program were
introduced so it all started early I
think in 2001 it was introduced however
it all started in the spring of 2000
when a group of 17 software developers
in Oregon to discuss how they could
speed up development in order to bring
new software to Market faster so they
recognized two key opportunities that
achieving this goal would make possible
so reducing the time to the benefits for
those users in order to resolve the
product Market fit and development
problems secondly getting feedback from
users quickly to confirm the usefulness
of new software and continue to improve
on it accordingly so further these group
of 17 developers met again at a ski
resort in Snowbird Utah us so they
created popularly known as agile
Manifesto so which laid out four key
values so which says individuals and
interactions or process and tools
working software or comprehensive
documentation customer collaboration or
contract negotiation
responding to change or following the
plan are valued
more now further between the time when
it was introduced till today agile has
become popular and Adoption of that has
increased reason being the flexibility
the agile brought into the system so
several organization across the world
started using it but what happened
further so agile gave the result but
there was a challenge so there were some
isues that agile pH to handle widespread
usage that is mainly Whenever there is a
scalability requirements so what is that
scalability challenges it is quite
obvious how can an implementation of
agile for large and more complex project
and how hard the process to scale a so
this was not clear the very reason the
challenge which come across which the
practitioners actually faced was one is
lack of of experience with agile
methodologies little understanding of
Frameworks methods and how to implement
them next large scale coordination so
when I say specific project a small
project it was easy implementation of
agile and then going forward all the
Frameworks what I mentioned earlier it
was easy but the moment you want to do
scaling to the bigger organization the
complex environment the coordination
collaboration dependency management
between usually uh distributed teams
geographically distributed teams was
challenging and thirdly having a clear
understanding of what needs to be
completed in the Sprints and what the
bigger picture
is so fourth aligning the entire
organization and managing commitments so
definitely organization required a
alignment the products or Services which
are being produced by the project needs
an
alignment so the need of alignment was
basically to ensure the organization
gets the value out of whatever they have
invested so fifth unrealistic
expectation with respect to speed of
delivery so unable to respond to this
particular scenario so that organization
can able to respond quickly so it was
not happening so time to benefits I I
was mentioning about so generally
earlier we used to speak about time to
Market but today it has been placed by
time to benefits how quickly the value
of that particular product or Services
introduced to the market is realized by
the users that is very
important so the framework of scaling
agile there are various different
Frameworks so some of the most effective
ways to scale agile would be large scale
scrum which is called as LS scaled agile
framework disciplined agile scrum at
scale Nexus scrum the Spotify model so
when I say less the large scale scrum it
is a way of scaling agile and scaling
scrum to large and big product
development groups it has been used
since 2005 in different software and
Hardware products in Industries such as
Banking and Telecom so when it comes to
scaled agile framework so it is a set of
organizations and workflow patterns
intended to guide Enterprise in scaling
lean and agile practices
so it is made freely available by scaled
ajal link which retains the copyrights
and registered
trademarks so the disciplined agile
delivery which is also called as dad is
a software development portion of the
disciplined agile toolkit so Dad enables
teams to make simplified process
decisions around incremental and
iterative solution deliver so D Builds
on many practices by Advocates of Ailes
oft development including scrum agile
modeling lean software development and
others so scrum at scale so scrum
originally if you look at outline in the
scrum guide is a framework for
developing delivering and sustaining
complex products by a single team so
since its inceptions its usage was
extended to the creation of products
processes services and systems that
require the efforts of multiple teams
whereas scrum scale was created to
efficiently coordinate this new
ecosystem of teams it achieves this goal
through setting up a minimum viable
bureaucracy via scale-free
architecture now coming to next one the
NEX is Scrum so this consist of multiple
cross functional scrum team working
together to deliver a potentially
releasable integrated uh increment at
least by the end of each print based on
dependencies the teams May self organize
and select the most appropriate members
to do specific work so lastly the
Spotify model which is basically people
driven autonomous framework for scaling
agile while emphasizing the importance
of culture and network this methodology
uses squads tribes chapters
guilds the foundation of which is cod
which acts like scrum team so further
let us look at the our Focus area of
this particular video video which is
basically what is scaled agile
framework so scaled agile framework as I
mentioned earlier consists of collection
of principles best practices and
processes that would enable large
organization to adopt agile
methodologies so it would help them
deliver products and services of the
highest quality
faster so safe is best suited for
complex projects that involves several
large teams at projects program and
portfolio levels the current version of
safe is version five which has seven
core competencies based on which it can
help organizations the large
organization in specific so safe as
certain core values which are basically
alignment built-in quality transparency
and program execution so when I say
alignment so I was mentioning about
aligning with business business uh
requirement business strategies so it is
needed to keep Pace with fast changing
disruptive competitive forces and
geographically distributed teams while
empowered agile teams are good even
great but the responsibility for
strategy and Alignment cannot rest with
the combined opinions of the teams no
matter how good they are instad
alignment must rely on Enterprises
business objective so it also need to
require
to keep up with the change the
compettion and then the Dynamics across
in the environment where organization is
doing their business so next is buil-in
quality so buil-in quality is basically
to ensure that every element and every
increment of the solutions reflect
quality standards throughout the
development life cycle so quality is not
added later building quality is
prerequisite
of lean and flow without it the
organization will likely operate with
large batches of unverified unvalidated
work which leads to the product or
Services which is not okay and also that
would lead towards excessive rework
which is not good and slower velocities
which is not allow the organization to
respond quickly to the Dynamics of the
market so third one is transparency so
transparency which basically need to
enable teams to rely on each other there
should be trust which needs to be built
So based on which high performance can
happen so wherever the trust exists so
when the business and development can
confidently rely on each other to act
with Integrity particularly in terms of
responding quickly or to work out a
solution for resolving something which
is actually not allowing things to move
forward so without trust no one can
build high performance teams and
programs
the confidence needed to make reasonable
commitments is very very
essential so fourth is program
execution so safe focuses on working
systems and business outcomes which
mainly for example for teams to execute
and continuously deliver value safe
places an intense focus on working
systems and business outcomes so this is
because while many Enterprises start the
transformation with individual agile
teams they often become frustrated as
even those teams struggle to deliver
more substantial amount of solution
value reliability and
efficiently so delivering Solutions with
better value reliability and efficiency
Effectiveness is very very essential and
here we're speaking about ensuring the
scalability to the bigger organization
so program management plays a very
important role so that requires lot of
of communication collaboration so
without better execution of that without
handling it better things cannot go the
way it is
required so various competencies safe
recommends so safe competencies involves
team and Technical agility agile product
delivery Enterprises solution delivery
lean portfolio management organizational
agility continuous learning culture and
then lean AG leadership so when I say
team and Technical agility so agile
teams are high performing and cross
functional Business Solutions are built
by business and Technical teams
delighting customer with high quality
output so this requires an able team
which understand agile Frameworks which
follows it which complies with it and
also technically sound so agile product
delivery which actually refers to the
scenario where the customer is at the
center Center of organizations product
strategy so development is based on
Cadence and releases on demand exploring
Integrity deploying and innovating
continuously then Enterprise solution
delivery so building big system with the
help of lean coordinating and aligning
the entire supply chain evolving the
live system continuously requires to
ensure the visibility of entire
Enterprises and providing solution
accordingly lean portfolio management
which basically focuses on aligning the
strategy funding and execution
optimizing operations across the
portfolio decentralized decision making
powered by lightweight governance then
organizational agility a lean agile
mindset is created across the Enterprise
it is very essential for example I
working in a project I have an attrition
if HR does not understand my Project
Dynamics and if they are not agile me as
a project organization becoming aile
will not help similarly the one the
procurement similarly the processes so
very essential for all the organization
units to become agile so that business
operations are able to complement
contribute that speed or the change what
is required so opportunities and threats
are addressed quickly so risks are
identified and addressed quickly so they
are worked on it so risk management can
become easier with the involvement of
stakeholders continuous learning culture
so in this scenario everyone learns and
grows together exploration and
creativity are a very important part of
organization where there should be
Innovation creation execution maybe I
think I come across certain terms like
intelligent risk taking so learning
through
failures failure should lead towards
inquiry not towards blaming so this
these are all the things which are more
and more discussed when we want to make
an organization a learning organization
The Continuous Improvement of solutions
services and processes is everyone's
responsibility then lean agile
leadership so by modeling desired
behaviors inspiring others aligning
words actions and mindset to lean agile
principles and values lead change and
guide others so this requires lot of
accountability and ensuring the correct
information well informed IND uals to
take forward
things now how does safe work so safe
considering those competencies what we
looked at the seven competencies so let
us see what happens in each of the
competencies how does safe work using
this competencies so firstly let us look
at team and Technical agility which
basically uh involves an agile team of 5
to 11 members which helps defining build
test and deploy products so this is done
by dividing the task into small easier
to manage time boxed iterations right
then scum team led by the scrum master
and supported by product owner plan and
then deliver the product in increments
so further after delivery they have a
retrospective to determine how the
iterations went and how it can be
improved this is incorporated into next
iterations planning
phase so the method used here could be
scrum or kban so both are popular the
combination of this can be used so scrum
basically helps in ensuring that things
moves in iterations and everything is
visible and delivered whereas Conan
supports in terms of making it more
visible and able to manage it
better so agile product delivery so a
large organization usually consist of
several agile teams each led by their
respective scrub master
so these teams together represent Agile
Release trins also called as art so they
usually involve 50 to 125 people so art
are cross functional and involve
everyone who understand customer needs
and can help with building and
delivering the solution required so art
uses an agile delivery practices like
the one used by the teams to deliver
value to the customers so it uses time
box iterations called program increments
or pis which usually involves four to
five
iterations all the teams they get
together to plan their work during Pi
planning events so they should work
together they should have full
visibility while doing it so three major
components which are required when we do
AEL product delivery is release train
engineer then project management and
then system architect so release train
engineer represents the coach of the art
facilitated the pi planning process the
project management provides the vision
for the project and backlog of the tasks
system architect provides architectural
guidance for the process and then the
teams then make plans regarding what
they would be able to deliver so the
program board is also drawn up to
determine dependencies between the teams
which also goes through program
iterations the as I mentioned
earlier then after every iterations the
art shows the integrated output to all
teams through a system demo so after the
pi is complete all team get together to
retrospect event called the inspect and
adapt
events so further a continuous delivery
pipeline is set up based on the art
DeVos practices are also used to ensure
values available on demand I think the
term DeVos is becoming more and more
popular today which actually providing
that visibility need for collaboration
need for cultural
transformation so which helps in terms
of bringing that agility across the
organization as well as learning
organization so one of the principles of
devops itself says continuous learning
there should be continuous
experimentation and learning risk taking
intelligence RIS taking and also we come
across piing the concepts like seman
Army concept like introducing failes
into existing systems and learn what can
fail and what is the solution for it and
that can help in terms of becoming more
resilient and reliable system so devops
has become popular and Adoption of that
discussion on that is uh become more
common across the
organizations so next Enterprise
solution delivery so Enterprise solution
delivery let us look at a scenarios
where a single art may not be able to
deliver an appropriate solution
a solution train which coordinates
multiple arts and suppliers would be
able to provide Solutions in large and
complex scenarios so meaning
consideration of Enterprise as a whole
seeing end to end organization entire
visibility so basically what is that we
are trying to achieve so alignment we
discussed about which requires the
objective of organization because
organization is investing so whatever we
do at various different level should
complement to each other rather than
contradicting so the complimenting
thought or complimenting visibility can
happen only when someone has a bigger
visibility Enterprise word by
Outlook then uh the three major
components that are required in
Enterprise solution delivery would be
solution Management Solutions architect
and solution train
engineer the solution management holds
content Authority or what needs to be
built solution architect handles the
architecture across the Arts solution
train engineer enables coaching and
facilitating of solutions train
events so next is lean portfolio
management so lean portfolio management
provides ways of creating and combining
strategic themes and portfolio Vision
this enables solution development to be
aligned with Enterprise strategy so the
moment I say lean firstly we should keep
in mind that it's about creating value
to the stakeholders that is first thing
second thing is elimination of waste now
when I link this to strategy when I link
towards the organization's directions
what it sets and while going in the
directions I should ensure no defects
are actually moved downstreams or are
eliminated when it goes to
Downstream so customer should see the
value it is very important and
identification of all the contributions
of waste as has to be done and
eliminated so this ensures there is a
value in organizations value stream
which also ensures that these value
streams remain funded so funding plays a
very important role so next is
organizational
agility so when I say organizational
agility it should ensure the
organizations various business units in
the organizations should be with that
dynamics of agility which organization
is going through which organization is
moving through as I mentioned earlier if
you you have a project where you have
you have adopted agile methodologies
it's quite obvious for your pace for
your flexibility for your speed other
business units which are working with
you to support you should also
complement to that they cannot become
slower they cannot have their own pace
of doing things like in your project you
have a procurement you have a
recruitment you have some claims to be
cleared from a CH maybe you're dependent
on certain tools and environments now if
these are not agile if these are not
responding in the same flexibility or
same speed what the agile project team
requires then obviously things will not
flow further now when I say agile
obviously we introduce products or
Services quickly to the environment now
someone needs to manage we have
operations now can operations manage the
products or Services which they are not
aware of now even there the agility
required as I keep introducing the new
products or services to the
environment operation should also be
well informed and educated about it so
that they can monitor and manage them
effectively and
efficiently if they fail I think users
will not have a good experience your
product or Services may have a great
features functionalities but however if
Whenever there is a query about that
product features or functionality
Whenever there is an issue the incident
which user actually calls the first
point of contact for any users would be
the operations the moment operations
fails to respond with the right clarify
ifications or rights resolution quickly
then obviously user experience will
result in not a good way I think
customer satisfaction or customer
Delight will be at stake so even
operation should become aile so rest of
the business units which are supporting
like funding we spoke about if funding
is not done in agile way obviously the
things cannot move smoother or easier so
everything across organization should
become agile organizational agility has
to be ensured so enabling portfolio with
strategic agility making change in the
direction depending on the
scenario then encouraging the growth of
lean thinking people and agile teams so
people should be working towards
ensuring creating value always every
task every transactions what they do
should be enabled through it so they
should also know whatever we are doing
how this particular task or the work or
the results what I am creating results
in value addition or value creation to
the organization does it really align to
the organization's requirement is it
fulfilling maybe customer as a
stakeholder or my own organization the
business unit which is actually
investing on this project so in that
context or in that perspective everyone
should be aware of that alignment the
directions The
Vision then focusing on value and
helping with organizing and
reorganizing building an environment for
the flow of value across the
organization so everyone should realize
value so value is what value can be
defined in the perspective of every
individual's background and every
individual's requirement because it's a
perceived one so there may be real thing
what we have created but perception is
different so the perceived versus what
is actually created should be as closer
as possible so zero deviation is
expectation but difficult but however it
should have a tendency towards it it
should actually be very near to that
pursued reality but but two things
involved one is that I create a features
and functionality for my product or
Services which fulfills customer
requirements customer may not know not
well educated not aware of it and don't
know how to realize that
value how to know how these features and
functionalities can be used so now if
you educate that customer the user how
to use it what are the values it can
create and do some uh exercise in terms
of educating training coaching customer
can visualize it and understand that
that is one possibility
second thing is customer is very matured
and our product does not have features
and functionality required so these are
the two scenarios which requires lot of
interactions and engagement so that
increasing in terms of usage of product
and services and realizing those values
so this has to be encouraged more and
more so further continuous learning
culture so when we say learning it's
quite obvious organization should keep
maturing individuals in organization
should keep keep maturing in terms of
capabilities in terms of ability to do
new things innovate the knowledge the
capability skills competences so that
can be possible only through learning so
learning should be continuous so this
ensures an atmosphere of innovation and
constant Improvement until organizations
becomes a learning organization so
meaning at every level each individuals
each professionals each Engineers each
executives invest their time in learning
they learn through what they're doing
they go through formal training they
bring in that formal training learning
into the actions here forther they learn
so continuous experimentation creating
an hypothesis working on those
hypothesis aligning that to the
requirement of organizations and seeing
how is it complimenting to the
organization requirement so seeing
through these are very essential so the
organization which is having the culture
of continuous learning can can sustain
and grow continually there is no
question of looking back if organization
has a scenario of not learning they will
fade away they may fail to exist so it
is very much required to understand the
market dynamics continuous learning
there capabilities and skill enhancement
continuous learning year Innovations and
making things better continuous learning
so continuous learning helps
organization to be there in the industry
and continue with the competition
so next is lean agile leadership so it's
quite obvious leadership plays very
important role it's about guiding it's
about owning it's about showing
directions it's about ensuring everyone
does the task everybody is motivated so
the leaders must embody teach and
exhibit lean and agile principles and
values so firstly they should understand
what it is they should be aware of it
they should have an exposure to it they
should have full awareness of it as I
was learning about continuous learning
culture in the previous point so leaders
should do that first so only then I
think the followers will actually have
learning adopted to themselves and
things move smoother and better and this
should happen across the
organization so by doing this it is
quite obvious organization can become
better agile organization is
complemented to achieve the objectives
and goals what they wanted to
accomplish and uh there is a safe
configurations which one needs to ensure
which involves essential safe R solution
safe portfolio safe and full safe so
when I say essential safe it acts as the
foundation for all safe configurations
and is the easiest starting point for
implementation so large solution safe it
is used for building large and complex
Lex Solutions whereas portfolio safe
provides principles and strategies that
can enable business agility in an
Enterprise so when I say portfolio it
should be understood as portfolio of an
organization as a whole the service
portfolio the product portfolio the
business portfolio so understanding of
that and complimenting to that is very
essential so full safe is a
comprehensive configuration that
includes all competencies and ensures
business
agility so advantages and disadvantages
of safe so advantages involves enabling
decentralized decision making it eases
collaboration across cross functional
teams it ensures decisions are made with
strategic objectives in mind so
disadvantages include additional layers
of oversight which makes it resemble the
waterfall
approach the top- down approach can
limit understanding of the software life
cycle and cause was bad planning so
visibility providing that visibility is
very
essential then larger planning cycles
and roles that are fixed in development
Cycles have a look at certified scrum

Sprint planning is like a well-crafted
map that guides your agile team towards
achieving their goals it's that pivotal
moment where the team comes together
charts its course and sets sale toward a
successful and productive Sprint if you
are new to Agile or just curious about
how teams stay on track and deliver
incredible results you are in for a
treat Sprint planning is a fundamental
event in the Gile framework and trust me
it's a game changer now if you ever
wondered how agile teams manage to stay
on top of their game and deliver
exceptional results Sprint after Sprint
then you have come to the right place in
this video we'll not only introduce you
to the concept of Sprint planning but
also show you why it's the heartbeat of
any successful agile project but before
we begin if you enjoy watching these
videos and find them interesting then
subscribe to our Channel as we bring the
best videos for you daily also hit the
Bell icon to never miss any updates from
Simply learn so let's start this video
with what is Sprint planning Sprint
planning in agile is a meeting where a
team of individuals decide what work
they will focus on during the upcoming
time frame called a Sprint the team
discusses the task they can
realistically complete within the
Sprint's duration usually two or 4 weeks
they consider their capacity priorities
and past performance to create a clear
plan for achieving their goals it helps
the team stay organized and on track to
deliver valuable results by the end of
the spring
but why is Sprint planning so crucial
the first reason is alignment and focus
Sprint planning brings the whole team
together to define the Sprint cool this
clear objective aligns everyone's
efforts and ensures they are all heading
in the same direction with a laser focus
the team can deliver meaningful results
every step of the way the second is
prioritization agile teams have a
never-ending list of tasks in the
product backlog Sprint planning is where
they cherry pick the most valuable ones
for for the upcoming Sprint by
prioritizing wisely they tackle high
impact items first delivering value to
customers sooner the third is customer
planning during Sprint planning the team
considers their capacity the amount of
work they can realistically handle in
the Sprint this ensures they don't
overload themselves leading to better
productivity and happier team members
the last is collaboration and ownership
Sprint planning is a collective effort
it encourages open discussions where
team members actively participate and
share their expertise this collaboration
Fosters a sense of ownership and
accountability for Sprint's success so

find the course link mentioned in the
description box below let's briefly walk
through the typical Sprint planning
process the first step is pre-planning
during pre-planning the product owner
prioritizes the items in the product
backlog they also ensures that the users
tools or tasks are well defined and
contain enough information for the team
to work on the second step is Sprint
planning meeting next comes the actual
Sprint plan meeting it's time boxed
usually lasting 1 to two hours per week
of the Sprint in this meeting the
product owners presents the prioritized
items and the team discusses them
seeking clarification where needed the
third step is estimation and commitment
once the team understands the
requirements they estimate how much work
they can complete based on their
velocity this process helps them commit
to a realistic amount of work they can
achieve during the Sprint the last step
is breaking down tasks with the
commitments in place the team further
breaks down the user stories or task
into smaller actionable tasks this makes
it easier to track progress during the
Sprint before we wrap up let's share
some best practices and tips for
successful Sprint planning tip one is
regular meetings hold Sprint planning
meetings consistently at the beginning
of each Sprint this ensures a predictive
aable schedule and keeps the team on
track the second tip is involve the
whole team involve the entire
development team in the planning process
this encourages collaboration diverse
perspectives and a more accurate
estimation of work capacity the last
step is keep it focused maintain the
focus of Sprint planning on what can be
achieved in the upcoming Sprint avoid
discussing future Sprints during this
meeting to prevent distractions so that
wraps up our discussion on Sprint
planning in agile remember Sprint
planning is the backbone of a successful
Agile development process enabling teams
to deliver value consistently and
efficiently so before we go and
understand what is the scrum itself so
let us look at the history of scrum
where it started how it started So Right
Down the Line during 1986 the name scrum
is first introduced by the management
experts yujiro nonaka and Hiro takauchi
so Japanese so now this terminology
introduced but later in
1995 Jeff suland and Ken Shar creates
the early version of what would become
the agile methodologies so now earlier
1995 so need for agile was sensed and
was spoken about I mean why do we need
AEL methodologies in future what would
be the Future Organization which would
look like so that would trigger in terms
of what kind of approaches we may
require to have so further 2001 the
agile Alliance is founded and first look
on scrum the agile software development
with scrum is published so then further
down the line 2002 the scrum Alliance is
founded by Weber and certifications are
added then later 2006 the scrum ink is
created the certified scrum courses are
taught so people started getting
certified on uh
scrum then later 2009 scrum.org is
created which offers the professionals
scrum series of
certifications then 2010 the first scrum
guide is published so which made
available to everyone so from then I
think uh the more and more people start
adopting scrum methodologies now
interesting part is the journey started
from 1980s till 2010 various changes
which has happened to this particular
methodology but one thing we should keep
in mind is same 20 years back or 15 20
years back if if we go the need for aile
was not seen so it was spoken but need
for ail was not spoken much but today we
are speaking about it more and more the
reason is I think the change in the
market condition the increase in the
competition the need of responding to
the change which is asked by the
consumers or the market variations has
become more and more important for
organizations and service providers if
they don't respond to the change they
may lose out in the competition so their
survival is at stake so it is very
essential for them to understand this
Dynamics and respond to those scenarios
quickly so that's where the adoption of
agile the benefit of adopting a gel were
realized and scrum become
popular so what is Scrum so let us look
at that so now scrum is a framework that
enables teams to work together means
collaboration is very important while we
become agile so with scrum team one can
look I mean see The Experience so
learning from experiences happens so
those are captured self organized
working on problems so they walk
together they discuss brainstorm reflect
on their victories means any
achievements has to be celebrated
acknowledged quick wins recognized and
their losses to improve so wherever the
things doesn't go good necessary
Corrections has to be done I think scrum
approach would help in terms of doing it
quicker better
then some of the benefits using scrum
would look like steam can provide
project deliverables and in an efficient
manner so in time we're completing all
the features and functionality so the
the entire model the methodology what is
there which helps in accomplishing those
then further time and money are used
efficiently so time is very important
giving results in the mentioned schedule
is very important ensuring results are
coming up effectively is important
efficiently the performance of that
products now since we are creating those
small piece working piece in every
iterations so that experience of using
that would also be there and quick
feedbacks will come back so that time
and money is
saved and we are doing in time so
projects are divided into smaller units
called Sprint so the iterations what I
speaking about the quick iterations of
activities which happens during the
adoption of scrum when organization
adopt the scrum methodology so it is
called as Sprint it's a time box
iterations which will have a set of
subset of product backlog taken as a
Sprint backlog and those users stories
and epics are delivered as part of that
Sprint and then those are reviewed on a
daily basis as part of daily scrum
meeting and also we have other meetings
which will happen when we go and look at
scrum methodology how this happens I
think we'll get better
visibility work best for fast moving
projects now whenever we need to respond
quickly whenever we want to move faster
now remember when we say moving faster
means it doesn't mean that we can allow
any defects to happen we can ignore
something we cannot do that we need to
ensure everything is taken care at the
same time all those results what are
created has to be
acknowledged right confirmed yes it is
defect free so all those which is
supposed to be addressed are taken care
and things are moving faster and better
and the results are according to what
was actually expressed as a requirement
it is fulfilling
those then scrum meetings provide the
team great visibility since there is a
daily scrum meeting which keeps
happening people speaks about what they
have done from the previous daily scrim
what is that they have accepted they
will complete and what is complete is
everything is complete or something is
pending if it is pending why is that
pending and what is that you are going
to do further before the next daily SC
meeting so these are discussed
understood so that there is a quick 15
minutes meeting which gives the insight
and further wherever there is a
dependency deviations which occurs
further maybe scrum Master sit with them
separately to understand that in detail
so daily scrum meetings give the quick
insights so that it increases the
visibility what is happening on
ground constantly involves feedback from
clients and customers as I mentioned
earlier while discussing about agile and
active involvement of customer is very
essential so customer should give the
feedbacks whenever that working piece of
the application or a product is given so
only then uh whether the product or that
module what is created is having that
features and functionality which helps
him providing necessary requirement
fulfillment is that happening or
not then making changes based on
feedback are very easy because everyone
is informed and they are aware of what
is being changed and what needs to be
changed
then individual efforts of the team
members are given Focus yes individual
efforts is essential at the same time
each team member cross skills we call it
a self-organizing team as I was
mentioning earlier so each team member
will have a different different skills
different different capabilities and
also cross Skilling within the team is
encouraged so that the ownership on
individuals deliverables and team as a
whole working together to deliver some
features functionality can also be
accomplished
right then scrum team involves product
owner scrum master and then scrum team
so each of these are different roles
having their own objectives to
accomplish with the specific directions
and each of these cannot be merged like
for example the roles and
responsibilities of product owner cannot
be given to single individual who is a
scrum master so both the roles cannot be
given a single individual because it
conflicts the objectives of both the
roles so thinking about putting this one
of the team member becoming scrum Master
product owner thinking in that angle is
also something which is which will not
work which will not give the required
results so now what are these roles what
are the responsibilities where is the
focus of each of the roles so let us
discuss on that now when it comes to
product owner so the product owner is
primarily responsible for maximizing the
ROI by determining the product features
prioritizing it into a list what needs
to be focused on for the next print and
constantly reprioritizing and refining
it so the key points what we need to see
here is so one is determining the
product features maximizing the ROI the
second one and then reprioritizing and
refining the product backlog now why is
that needs to be done so maximizing Roi
in the sense obviously product owner
should closely work with the business
and have an Insight towards what is that
business require what is that customer
require how it helps customer to
accomplish that result so that it helps
the justifying that investment what
they're doing with the products features
and
functionalities then U speaking about
reprioritizing and refining it it
depends on what features needs to be
delivered in what order so there is
already an order which is defined So
based on the change scenario you can
reorder it and product owner has at
ownership and responsibilities so the
entire focus is on ensuring the right
product backlog prioritizing it and also
adding that user stories and epics into
product backlog depending on what makes
sense to the business so the scrum
Master the next role helps teams learn
and apply scrum to obtain business value
means scrum Master closely works with
the team so he or she helps remove
impediments what is
impediments something which stops
to move forward something which doesn't
allow to deliver things the way it is
required something which stops right so
that needs to be eliminated that needs
to be understood what are the
impediments so when we say impediments
what are the impediments we can think of
the skills and capabilities of the team
that is one thing maybe the testing
environment maybe a process so many
things comes as a bottleneck or
impediment which stops things to move
smooth forward so scrub Master should
work on it identify that and support
team or guide team to overcome those so
protects them from interfaces that helps
the team to adopt agile practices so
encouraging team to adopt agile
practices and ensuring they demonstrate
it and provides the recorded value as
its move forwards so since scrum Master
focuses one side in terms of making
scrum team to work whereas product owner
is looking at the entire product backlog
and working more closely with the
business so they need to have a good
handshake uh to ensure things go well
but these two roles cannot be merged
because since it has a two different
angles and two different Dynamics so
spending time accomplishing both the
things may become very challenging and
conflicting and prioritizing will also
be difficult then scrum team is a
collection of all the individuals who
work together to deliver the
requirements of the stakeholders so
self-organizing team what I was
mentioning what we were discussing
earlier so these teams comes together
each of the team member will have
various different different capabilities
so they contribute at the individual
level and as a team as a whole
complement or contribute towards
ultimate output and outcome and value
what they need to create and this team
should have a clear understanding about
the deliverable what is being done so is
that deliverable what features and
functionality what they're thinking is
that going to create that value
ultimately what is need to be achieved
the requirements fulfillment which is
which needs to be happen to the
customers so they need to have that
understanding the direction should be
clear to the
team so there are certain artifacts to
look at when it comes to scrum so let us
look at that so now we speak about the
artifacts which are the components of
the scrum process that can improve
transparency and understanding of the
work so there are three artifacts mainly
which we call it as uh product backlog
Sprint backlog then uh product increment
so so let us see what is this one by one
so when I say product backlog so it
consists of list of new features changes
to be made to existing features the buck
fixes changes to the infrastructure and
several other activities that the team
needs to deliver to ensure a particular
outcome so this list of product backlogs
comes with required features and
functionalities what needs to be
delivered so the prioritization of this
has to happen in what order what needs
to be delivered so the product backlog
is the full list which needs to be
delivered as part of this project and as
the project progresses a lot of new
backlog item would be added to the
product backlog as the Dynamics of the
particular scenarios keeps changing so
keeps adding reprioritizing additional
items to the backlogs are added
depending on what are those
Dynamics so further looking at a Sprint
backlog so Sprint refers to to that
short period of iterations right so
which team aims to get a given amount of
work done so it helps teams deliver
working software in a frequent manner so
Sprint could be between 1 to 4 weeks
long depending on what is the
deliverable is so Sprint backlog is a
subset of product backlog so that
prioritize item what is taken into
Sprint which is a Time boxed iterations
the Sprint backlog contains the task the
team aims to complete to satisfy the
Sprint goal so what is that Sprint goal
so each of those iterations the time box
iterations will have a specific
objective to accomplish so the Sprint
goal is the objective decided for the
Sprint as an outcome of negotiation
between the product owner and the team
so what can be delivered how long it
takes to deliver so when it has to be
delivered the target may be given by
product owner but is it possible
feasible to complete it there there is
some negotiation which happens there so
they decide they agree yes we can do do
it we cannot do it if at all we can do
it what is that it takes in terms of
effort time and cost everything is
decided discussed so that objective of
that particular iterations is agreed
upon so once it is agreed I think team
should first identify the task from the
product backlog that need to be
delivered to achieve the goal so these
tasks are then added to Sprint backlog
so there should be an agreement between
both and once it is added once it is
agreed as part of that Sprint the
deliverable the output of the Sprint
would be the one which needs to be
completed as part of it the objectives
the goal the results which a specific
working
software then product increment so this
refers to the combination of all product
backlog tasks completed in the Sprint
and the value of the increment of
previous Sprints now when we speak about
lean lean speaks about elimination of
waste it speaks about value streams now
in each of the prints as we have a
working software being being delivered
now each of these piece should keep
complimenting to the what is the one
which is already delivered and what is
being delivered in future so keeping
that in mind every deliverable will be
implemented or configured in such a way
that there is no specific bottlenecks
there is no specific constraints which
arises so these needs to be kept in mind
which requires the entire visibility
into what is that ultimate objective we
are going to accomplish so in this
product increment all those combination
of the product backlogs task which is
being done should keep this in mind team
should be very clear about it so I in
the first Sprint I delivered something
in the Sprint to I delivered something
but I cannot integrate them they cannot
work together it will lead into the
further issues and then complications
that should not happen so when we say
agile it's about moving faster fine so
responding to change fine but that
should not lead towards further
complexity it should make things simpler
smoother so scrum is stressing on that
part so an increment refers to
inspectable usable work done at the end
of the Sprint it represents the step
towards overall goal or vision of the
project as I was mentioning then the
outcome should be in usable condition
even if the product owner doesn't decide
to release it so it should be an usable
condition so two things we speak about
so one is uh release other one is
deployment now people usually get
confused between release and deployment
so release about this part what we're
speaking about product is
usable so it is released product is
usable but only after deployment user
will have an access to use it so that is
a difference release makes that product
usable whereas deployment makes it
available to the user to use so this
difference people should know so release
doesn't mean that it is already
available for user to use so this
understanding of the difference should
also be there so that one can understand
what it means by release as well and
what it means by deployment that's why
when we speak about DeVos we keep
speaking about cicd in cicd we speak
about uh continuous integration
continuous uh delivery and continuous
deployment so in continuous delivery
you're speaking about release basically
so once it is released it becomes usable
so once it is deployed it is available
for user to use and that's about the
scrum artifacts now let us look at scrum
framework how that scrum framework looks
like in entirety so what are the
components comes into picture already we
spoke about the scrum approach itself
what it is now we spoke about
understanding artifacts then we spoke
about roles in scrum the activities for
each of the roles we understood now
where do we see all of this when we look
at a scrum framework so that picture let
us see so when we say scrum framework
already we spoke about the product
backlog we can see that it is in the
left side in the beginning we have a
Sprint planning so we spoke about Sprint
the time box iterations and from the
product backlog the items which is
moving towards Sprint to a specific
Sprint what needs to be delivered which
become Sprint backlog now the backlog
items are taken and scrum team work on
it and does a daily scrum meeting and
once the deliverables of that particular
Sprint happens then there is a review on
it then the increment is delivered and
at the same time that retrospective what
was planned versus what is delivered
that is checked if you look at from
Sprint review so you have a
retrospective to check what is planned
versus what is being delivered at the
same time the review points will come
and get updated to product backlog as
well to the product owner so product
owner should be aware what is delivered
what is spending to be delivered and
that increment is further delivered so
these increments what is delivered to
production what is deployed in the
production should have values that
integrate cretion which happens both all
the increments coming together to
provide that fulfillment of the
requirement as well as creating that
value what is required so product
backlog is the first step of scrum
framework is a set of list of tasks to
have successfully achieve the goals of
the stakeholders we discuss that while
discussing on product backlog so further
Sprint planning happens where the team
determines the task from the product
catalog they will work on and aim to
deliver during the Sprint now this is
negotiated understood agreed and then
moves towards Sprint to get delivered
then Sprint backlog are the tasks
discussed during the Sprint planning
means the previous step and also during
the script planning and then add it to
the Sprint backlog once it goes to the
Sprint backlog as part of the time box
iteration Sprint the deliverables should
happen now scrum team the scrum team
which is actually self organized
organzing team as we mentioned maybe
five to 10 nine members of Team working
on the task in the Sprint backlog and
they will also have a daily scrums where
the team also discusses for 15 minutes
on the events where the team member
synchronizes activities and plan what
they aim to achieve in next 24 hours
what is accomplished against what is
discussed in previous daily scrum and
then if at all any further discussions
need to be done in the correction of
those that can be taken as a separate
meeting not as part of the daily scrum
so generally daily scrum meeting would
be 15 minutes it should not go more than
that it's an indicative time so quicker
updates to understand what is
happening then uh the Sprint review
happens where once the Sprint is
complete so Sprint review happens which
involves the team the scrum master and
product owner and stakeholders to
understand what is being agreed upon and
what is being delivered so reviewed is
that fulfilled in the entirety that is
discussed and then during this meeting
the team shows what they accomplish
during the Sprint it allows time to ask
questions make observations give
feedback and provide suggestions right
then the product owner also presents the
product backlogs talk to the
stakeholders to get feedback for
upcoming Sprints and about things
related to the backlog now this one
Sprint is complete for the next Sprint
what should be the prioritization so the
product owner has to speak with the
stakeholders so that there is a good
understanding good handshake that what
needs to be delivered and what is the
priority in the given
list then Sprint retrospective happens
so after the Sprint review Sprint
retrospective happens so during this
meeting what went well like past
mistakes potential issues what are the
new ways to handle them which are
required to be done correctly in the
next iterations or next prints needs to
be identified data from found from here
are Incorporated when planning the news
Sprint so it's works like a Lessons
Learned what went well what did not go
well what is that we did for those what
did not go well so what is that learning
we have in these iterations so how can
we ensure that in the upcoming
iterations the same mistakes are will
not repeat so those can be uh discussed
documented and then consider while
moving to the next
spring then the increment is a workable
out which is given to the stakeholders
so this is where the user actually sees
that workable piece working item and
then they give necessary feedback as
well on the particular application piece
or software
piece then there is something called
scrum board which is used during this
flow of scrum right from product backlog
to the creation of that increment so let
us look at what is a scrum board which
is used during the scrum practice so
scrum board is a physical or virtual
tool that helps team to visualize items
in the Sprint back clock so it helps in
tracking what is being delivered what is
in progress and what needs to be
delivered further so it shows all action
items during the daily scrum helping
keeping the team focused on tasks that
need to be completion and the priorities
of those the scrum board is usually
present in a place that's accessible to
all team members it is a visual board
right and can be physical whiteboard and
stickers or virtual software tools which
can be used and displayed on the screen
so the scrum board is divided into
different slots like to-do in progress
and done so when new Sprints are started
the existing board is reset and new
scrum board is created so since it is
visual system I think it is taking the
thought from kban so visual system
always works effective because the
moment I know I see something is uh put
against my name that I need to complete
this it's quite obvious to me me that I
will put efforts to complete it so it's
a conscious effort what I will put it
works on my Consciousness so something
which is not visible to me it is that
out of sight is out of mind so I will
not work on it so I may there is a
tendency to forget so if I see it
regularly if I have that feeling or that
vipes which comes to every individual
that someone is everyone is having a
visibility to it something is pending
against me so I'm answerable that
consciously that comes to the mind so
people start working on it and closing
of that will happen quickly so
everything is visible there is nothing
hidden there are two main approaches to
project management the traditional
waterfall approach and the agile
approach originally agile developed as a
way to better manage software
development projects agile emerged in
the late 1990s specifically in response
to the challenges encountered when
managing software development projects
using the traditional waterfall approach
specifically addressing the burdens of
heavy documentation and frequent changes
in requirements agile techniques and
best practices began to emerge and gain
prominence in software development
projects this led to a meeting in
February 2001 in Park City Utah where 17
leading software developers wrote what
has become known as the agile
Manifesto let's review the agile
Manifesto for soft W development
together we are uncovering better ways
of developing software by doing it and
helping others do it through this work
we have come to Value individuals and
interactions over processes and tools
working software over comprehensive
documentation customer collaboration
over contract
negotiation responding to change over
following a plan that is while there is
value in the items on the right
we value the items on the left
more before you take your agile scrum
Foundation certification exam I
recommend you memorize these four lines
we call them the statement of value and
you can see that on the right hand side
those are items that are more relevant
for the traditional or waterfall
approach and on the left you have those
things that are more agile in nature
let's review each of these four lines
individuals and interactions over
processes and tools clearly any project
requires processes and tools however
individuals and their interactions
deliver better results when the emphasis
is not on the processes and the tools
working software over comprehensive
documentation documentation here refers
to things like status reports progress
reports detailed specifications
which do not really demonstrate any real
progress or value therefore the emphasis
is on working software that can be
delivered and
demonstrated customer collaboration over
contract
negotiation organizations need to be
flexible and accommodating rather than
following detailed definitions listed in
contracts responding to change over
following the plan in agile small pieces
of working software are delivered to the
customer incrementally and the customer
is involved in the project from the
beginning to the end so in agile we are
responsive to the customer and willing
to make even midcourse Corrections in
order to deliver to the customer the
value that the customer
wants remember you will be tested on
these four lines so again I urge you to
memorize them in fact knowing these four
lines and having a feel for what they
mean will actually help you get to the
correct answer on many questions in the
exam here we can see what it might look
like to manage a project using the
waterfall approach you can see that the
system and software requirements would
need to be identified and documented
upfront that would be followed by the
necessary analysis and program design
work then comes the actual coding and
testing that's Then followed by the hand
off to the customer or to
operations as you can see there is a
heavy upfront cost of
documentation as well as the status
reporting that would need to be done
during the course of the project you can
also see that it would be difficult to
respond to change in this kind of an
approach in fact the sish group issued a
study that showed that software
development projects using the agile
approach succeed three times more often
than when using the waterfall approach
the Standish group defined project
success as being on time on budget and
delivering all of the planned
features the study summarized as follows
the agile process is the universal
remedy for software development project
failure software applications developed
through the agile process have three
times the success rate of the
traditional waterfall method and a much
lower percentage of time and
overruns now let's talk about strum
versus agile firstly let's have a look
at
methodologies now agile is a set of
principles that are iterative and
incremental agile has a number of
different methodologies you can choose
from there's XP Crystal Canan even scrum
for that matter let's talk about scrum
now scrum is an implementation of the
concepts of agile so basically most of
the the important components of a child
can be applied to scrum as well it
provides the customer with incremental
builds that are delivered to the
customer in the span of 2 to 4 weeks an
organization can be agile but not
practice crumb however an organization
cannot practice crumb without being
agile next up let's have a look at
projects agile is more suited towards
project projects that have a spa
development team that consists of
experts whereas on the side of scrum
it's usually better suited for projects
that are subject to a large amount of
change and that do
rapidly next we have leadership now for
a child a project head takes care of all
the tasks and has a very important role
to play in the process of a j a project
head represents the entire team and is
responsible for getting issues resolved
by assigning them to the appropriate
members of the team in scrum there's no
leader there's a scrum master who can
overall guide the scrum process but the
team addresses issues by themselves it
usually involves cross functional and
self-organizing
teams next up we have flexibility agile
is relatively more rigid than scrum and
cannot handle changes with these it also
requires a lot of upfront development
process and changes within the
organization with scrum you can enable
team
delivery agile requires frequent
deliveries so that they can get feedback
from the end user this in turn will help
make the product better the product is
delivered as well as updated on a
regular
basis with scrum after a Sprint feedback
from the client for a build is provided
to the team SC scrum involves daily
scrum meetings to review and get
feedback to determine the next steps of
the project the next Sprint is only
planned by the team after the current
Sprint is
complete next we have
collaboration with agile collaboration
involves face-to-face interactions with
team members of other cross functional
teams for scrum daily standup meetings
take place with specific roles like
scrum Master product toner and the scrum
team and finally we have design with the
Gile the design as well as its execution
It's relatively
simple with scrum the design and its
execution can be Innovative and
experimental so you might be wondering
which one should you choose now among
both these options there's one thing
that will remain common agile now what
you can decide upon is which which agile
methodology you'll be choosing is it
lean is it Canan or is it scrum now if
you do want to know more about how scrum
and Canan are different from one another
you can check out our video scrum versus
Canan Canan comes from the Japanese word
can bam which literally means
signboard like scrum Canan is a popular
agile framework that is a visual system
by which the work can be managed with
ease as it
progresses Canan uses something known as
the can ban board to make these things
possible with this you can easily
identify bottlenecks and then fix them
cost effectively at optimal
speeds the main focus with can ban is
transparency since everything related to
the tasks are on the board everyone can
keep themselves updated dated it also
ensures the teams focus on their current
tasks until they're done this limits the
amount of work that's in
progress so on the can band board work
is divided into smaller more manageable
pieces the work that's needed to be done
is written on a note or card and placed
on a board columns on the board help
represent where each item is with
respect to the workflow now let's have a
look at what these are in
detail let's find out how Canan
works now the board consists of three
major
components there's the to-do list which
represents items that need to be
completed the ongoing column which
represents items that are being
currently worked on and the completed or
the done column now these represent
tasks or items that have already been
completed now although this is a
physical representation of the board
several organizations use software
versions of the board that replaces the
sticky notes with cards that can be
moved from one column to another as work
progresses now an example of such a
software is Trello so if you want to
learn more about Trello you can check
out the link I'll be adding to the live
chat in a
moment
at this point you guys must have
realized how similar these two
Frameworks sound so let's run through
some more of their
similarities let's find out how they are
similar firstly they both have
principles of lean and agile which means
reduction of waste and both of them are
time boxed and iterative approaches that
enable product delivery in an
incremental manner
both these Frameworks aim to reduce the
amount of work in progress this forces
the teams to ensure that they focus on a
smaller set of tasks this also makes
blockers and bottlenecks a little more
visible in both cases the work is
divided into smaller more manageable
units both of these Frameworks use pull
scheduling now this means the products
are only built based on demand rather
than
forecasts transparency plays a major
role in both these Frameworks by helping
them Drive process
Improvement and in both cases the
release plan is continuously optimized
and finally both these methods aim to
deliver releasable software often and
earlier than
expected so now that we've reached
Midway let me ask you guys a question do
you guys use scrum or camand in your
workplace or do you use these software
for personal reasons what exactly do you
use these for let me know in the live
chat now let's have a look at how these
two Frameworks are different from one
another firstly let's have a look at
Cadence Cadence refers to the amount of
time in a Sprint or before a release so
when it comes to scrum the entire
project is divided into time constrained
iterations that is into smaller
manageable
units but when it comes to can ban it's
even driven the next criteria we're
going to have a look at is release
methodology in scrum releases take place
after each Sprint which usually takes 2
to 4 weeks to complete for Canan
releases take place in the form of
continuous delivery
they happen in such a way that changes
like new features configuration changes
bug fixes and experiments get to the
users in a safe quick and sustainable
manner next up let's have a look at how
changes are addressed in both these
Frameworks in scrum no change can be
made while the Sprint is in
progress once it's complete changes can
be considered in the Sprint plan and
then added to the Sprint
backlog with Canan changes can be made
at any time and incorporated into the
workflow now let's consider the metric
that's being measured in scrum for
planning and process Improvement
velocity which is the measure of the
work that can be completed by a team in
a Sprint is the key
metric in can ban lead time is the key
metric this represents the period of
time between a new task Tas appearance
in your workflow and its final departure
from the
system next let's have a look at how
teams work in these Frameworks in scrum
you need a cross functional team to
achieve your goals in a Sprint in canvan
cross functional teams are optional but
specialized teams that focus on
particular aspects of the workflow are
required now let's talk about new
additions in scrum just like handling
changes you can't add any items between
a Sprint or
NRA in can ban new items can be added to
the board as long as there's capacity
available for
it now let's have a look at the job
roles Within These Frameworks scrum has
three major job roles product owner
scrum master and scrum team with can
band you don't have any specific job
roles now let's talk about
representation or moreover let's talk
about how data can be
represented with scrum the Board needs
to be reset once a particular Sprint is
complete with Canan the board stays
persistent throughout the entirety of
the
project and finally let's have a look at
project link with scrum it's better
suited for longer
projects and with Canan projects that
can be completed in a shorter period of
time are
better so which one should you
choose now selecting from these two
methods is mainly based on the
requirements of the team do you expect
your project to be shorter do you want
to make changes at any time you don't
want to set up job specific roles then
can ban is the framework for you you or
do you want a long running project with
different job roles and involving cross
functional teams scrum is the answer for
you based on the differences we
discussed in the last topic you can make
an informed
decision now let's have a look at some
of the popular companies around the
world that employ both these
Frameworks some of the companies that
have successfully implemented scrum are
Facebook General electronics and Adobe
companies that have implemented Canan
are semmens BBC and
sap have a look at certified scrum
Master CSM certification training course
some key features of this course include
two days online virtual classes twoyear
membership with scrum Alliance 20 pdus
and 16 scus includes CSM exam fees as
well by the end of this course you will
be skilled with scrum and agile
methodologies importance of agile scrum
life cycle scrum terminologies daily
scrum and review roles involved in scrum
and distributed scrum so hurry up and
enroll now one year of experience is
preferred to enroll into this course so
hurry up and enroll Now find the course
Link in the description box and what I
want to do team is I want to before we
get into the user stories I want to go
to the Whiteboard and I want to just
give you a little bit more
information the might help us in
organizing our discussion that we're
about to embark on
here so a word that is not in our slides
is themes themes are
epics and user stories grouped together
you know similar epics and user stories
grouped together for planning purposes
so an epic is Big um you would never do
an epic in or pardon me a theme in a
Sprint it's too big um so it's used for
planning
purposes below that I would put epics
epics are low
priority large user
stories meaning that an ethic will
eventually have to be disaggregated into
multiple user
Stories the reason it would be low
priority is because if it would if an
epic was higher up on the product
backlog um it would have to be more
detailed that's when you would break it
down so epics are usually going to live
at the lower uh priority levels of a
product backlog and as user stories are
completed and the Epic rises in priority
it will eventually be broken down into
um more manageable user stories so great
big low priority user stories then we
have user stories themselves eles user
stories are
functions or
features that the product owner wants to
have developed a user story turns into
working
software that provides value to the
customer and um and the product owner is
the customer voice the product owner is
the one who would accept or reject
completed user stories and then there
are
tasks and a reminder when we were
talking about the Sprint planning
meeting we said the Sprint planning
meeting is uh got two parts to it the
first part is selecting all of the users
stories that are going to be included in
the Sprint and then disaggregating each
of those user stories into
tasks that's done in the Sprint planning
meeting and then those tasks are the
things that are actually then done when
the uh work of the Sprint
begins user stories can be estimated in
story
points or ideal days most teams favor
story points they might start with ideal
days but they will then usually end up
going to story points um tasks are uh
estimated in I Ideal Time which is
usually ours okay so now back to our
slides so at the top left a use case
could be an example of a user story so
it's something that um the user wants to
do and how the system should support it
um like um a use case could
be um select and pay for items in a
catalog now that could actually be an EP
or maybe a theme because maybe it would
get disaggregated into log on screen uh
catalog uh shopping cart and checkout
but so the use case could either be a
standalone user story or it could
actually be uh a number of user stories
um that would result from it below that
requirement it could be a functional
requirement a technical task or even a
bug fix so I'm going to go back to the
Whiteboard and a product
backlog is going to have a lot of user
stories that come from the
customer right whatever the customer
wants
them but the team may know that it has
to do some development work in order for
the user stories to even be able to work
you know there's some system level
nonfunctional requirements that need to
be done and so there could be Tech user
stories and then can you see this low I
can't see your chats but then there
could also be defect user stories there
could even be risk user stories now what
could happen is that um the product
owner ranks these in priority so this
one first then that one then that one
and the team says well the only thing is
is that um we have to do some
development work before we can actually
do user story too and so what we really
need to do is insert that before the uh
the second priority user story and so
the priority of the user stories in the
product backlog while it might start
with just being you know simple
functional user stories coming from the
uh product owner it will evolve until it
includes some other things that are also
considerations when it comes to to uh
priorities because of you know successor
predecessor relationships dependencies
and things like that are um
considerations a user story be uh back
to the the uh screen um bottom left now
the user
story um can use a fictitious user or
Persona to help uh the team or the the
team and the product owner to get an
idea of okay who's going to be doing
this function uh what are they going to
need in order to be able to complete the
function Etc so you try and um come up
with an actual well a fictitious but a
person who's actually doing it to kind
of get out of the realm of you know
listing requirements and you know specs
and things like that and say okay what's
the user experience need to look like
top right template a portion of a user
story is um let me back up so a user
story card um is usually going to
contain um a brief description of the
user story using some kind of a metal
language format like we're suggesting
right here as a user or Persona I want
this feature so that I can so not unlike
our um estimating session here as a
frequent traveler I want to eat grapes
so I can be healthier in the one that we
uh didn't do uh the inventory system as
a customer okay there's a a user I want
to get cash back so I don't have to wait
in line at the bank okay here's another
user story as a
consumer I want the shopping cart
functionality to easily purchase items
online and maybe that could be customer
as well um as an executive right as a
suit I want to generate a sales report
so I know which departments need to
improve their productivity as a buyer so
you can see I I tried to come up with
these different roles right here
executive buyer sales rep Etc
um and that's the format as a type of
user I want some kind of goal um or
feature and uh so that's some kind of a
reason um the below that connect connect
the dots by writing all of the user
stories necessary to
uncover the entire use case so like we
were talking about right here if you
want to be able to purchase items online
from a catalog that might be uh multiple
user stories in order to support that
use case and so of course um we would
want to be able to connect the dots and
see where all the user stories fit in
into the overall goal of the project or
release and the stories
um excuse
me um are grouped to form an epic or
higher level story so epic or theme um
stories can then be split into child
stories or task and so that's what we
covering before right so you have um
themes up at the top that's the biggest
grouping if you will used primarily
for um you know high level planning
purposes so you have your themes then
you have your epics which are large user
stories um low priority and they're
going to have to be broken down into
smaller user stories like in the
question that we had at the end of the
the last section where
um the product owner needed something
done and the team said well based on the
size of this user story it's going to
take three Sprints to do well a user
story has to be small enough to be
completed within a single Sprint so a
Sprint can contain more than one user
story but a user story cannot span
Sprints so that feature or function that
was in the question was probably more
like an epic it was something that would
need to be uh disaggregated into smaller
user stories or perhaps it was more of a
use case that would need more than one
user story in order to actually deliver
the overall use
case let's see as a product supervisor I
want to see an unfinished part
list at the end of the day so that I can
reallocate work the next day great user
story description well done verage
um did you hear that team as a product
supervisor I want to see an unfinished
part list at the end of the day so I can
reallocate work the next day that is a
well-crafted description of a user
story
now here are some things that I want you
to memorize you were hoping I was done
with the memorization part so I want you
to
um remember that we have to invest in
our user
stories and I was going over to the
Whiteboard and I didn't change cameras
so let me do that I recommend um you
know figuring out how you memorize best
so that you can if um well not if you
wanted to what I recommend is being able
to write out all of this stuff on plain
white scrap paper in about 14 minutes
because that's the amount of free time
you have in the tutorial when you're at
the uh or when you're taking the test um
exen does a little bit different you
maybe won't have a tutorial the only
time you'd have a tutorial is if you
were at a center taking a test um exen
has other options like you can do a
paper based test um uh where you get a
third party you know a buddy or somebody
who will agree to sort of proor the test
for you or you can do it on your laptop
all by yourself and they have soft where
that watches you while you're taking the
test and they require you to take the
laptop and do like a 360 so that um they
can verify that you don't have any cheat
sheets up on the wall or anything like
that but the point is is um you got to
have this memorized um whether you're
going to dump it out on the paper or not
um when I took the test um I actually
did the paper based option um and that
was because of some kind time
constraints and it was the quickest way
to get me into the test and so I didn't
write out any of the stuff I'd memorized
but I had it memorized and I had it
memorized well enough that I could kind
of recall it in my mind's eye okay so
we're talking about user stories and you
have to invest in your user stories you
know I like memorizing things by
creating these charts that have the
first
letter of the word or phrase that you're
memorizing in a separate column and then
I make up a story you know that uh um
reminds me that I've got to have in in V
this one is pretty easy probably just
invest Works um but so let's go over
that I stands for
independent
independent meaning that each user story
stands on its own um you don't have when
we're doing scrum you don't do a user
story that won't result in working
software we just talked about the
description of user stories right so
it's a user that needs some kind of
functionality for some kind of a reason
and they're all independent will they
work together of course they'll work
together if that's a necessity but um if
you developed a log on screen you could
demonstrate working software for the
login screen there might be another user
story that is um you know has to do with
displaying uh the catalog and being able
to flag or select items that you want to
purchase but there'd be working software
for that would they work together yes
but each user story would
complete um or result in some kind of
working software and they have to be
independent
negotiable negotiable in the way the
user story is going to be implemented
the product owner doesn't dictate to the
team the team doesn't say it it's only
this way and we don't want to hear
anything from you so there are
discussions about the size and
implementation for each user user story
so the product owner can't make it so
detailed that there's no room for
discussion and the possibility of you
know the team coming up with Solutions
other than what the product owner was
attempting to dictate
um V stands for
valuable meaning each user story has to
create value for the customer or the end
user e it has to be
estimable as an estimat except estimat
is not really a word it's
estimable um and asses for small has to
be small enough to be done in a single
Sprint if we're doing two week Sprints
has to be able to be done in two weeks
or less if we're doing four-week sprints
it could be a larger user story but it
would still uh have to be done in four
weeks or less and then the last one the
t is testable every user story needs to
be testable and it needs to be testable
at two levels remember our triangle
needs to be testable at the intrinsic
quality level unit tests Etc and also
testable at the extrinsic level which is
the customer point of view which is
acceptance so every user story uh has to
be
testable okay so that's invest and so
let's add that to our list of things to
memorize
invest and then the next one we have
here is um the three C's of a user
story so the first C team is
card so user stories should be able to
be written on a 4x6 in index card or
some uh media similar to
that
card the the second see is
conversation the user story card is the
item that is used for the team and the
product owner to talk and discuss in
order to make sure that the product
owner and the team are on the same page
when it comes to what is actually
supposed to be developed and um uh what
you know so what it's supposed to look
like at the end which leads us to the
third one which is
confirmation each user story essentially
has to have acceptance tests um in it
itself so card 4x6 conversation that's
the starting point that's where uh the
team and the product owner discuss and
then eventually there will be acceptance
tests included on the user story card um
in order to be used during the Sprint
review to um assure that it's acceptable
that there's
confirmation okay so oh let's add that
to the memorization list
so three
C's all right now I've got an example
here of a user story
card so we're looking right
here and if you were to go out on the
internet and search um user story cards
um they would be similar there would be
some differences of course
um but typically what you're going to
have is you're going to have a title or
a name for the user story and then
there's going to be some kind of unique
identifier like user story 321 then
there will be the description like we
just talked about as a librarian I want
to have the facility of searching a book
by different criteria so that I will
save time while serving a
customer then there might be some other
descriptive words or links to other
information
that might be necessary and then there
would be acceptance criteria or tests
sometimes these get included on the back
of the card but the point is is that
they are on the cord on the card rather
then there will be an estimate of size
it could be ideal days or story points
as I mentioned most teams do story
points that's more likely what you'll be
tested on as opposed to
um ideal days but you know we'll cover
both so you
understand uh the
differences um there is probably it's
not listed here but there's probably
going to be a
um value point assignment this is where
the product owner um kind of determines
in a relative way the uh value of the
stories just like we were doing in
planning poker the product owner might
say well this story is twice as valuable
as uh this other one comparing them
together and this is what um these value
points are what's used to uh prioritize
the user stories that's supposed to be a
v as in value points and then typically
there's also going to be a indication
sometimes it's just by colors um it
could be words uh that has to do with um
you know where the story came from did
it come from the customer that would be
considered a functional
requirement um if it came from the team
that would be from the technical domain
I'm trying to write where
from uh you know it's not me team it's
the
mouse
clearly it's hard to uh do that that's
from where from um here it's got uh
custom Tech you could also have defect
you could maybe have risk um and then
there's also going to be an X
Factor um which would
be some kind of word probably like
um stable um
erratic um
incomplete something like that to uh so
the team is designating the user story
in uh respect to to the amount of
uncertainty or risk that's associated
with that user story and because all of
that's a part of the story right the
story is going to be turned into working
software there may need to be uh some
efforts to actually figure out how to
actually do that user
story so that's the X Factor um over to
the right here on the same chart we have
some comments
about um if you are using a software
package excuse me like Trello or jira or
something like that excuse me the user
story cards will generally be able to
contain more information using you know
dynamic links and things like that um
could even include things like the
responsible team member or depending on
how you're doing it you would break the
user Story down into tasks and you might
have team members assigned to various
tasks for the user
story um okay so that's typically what a
user story card is like sometimes
they're cards sometimes they're like on
sticky notes and they're put up on a can
band board if you're using can band to
track the
project if you have a story that is too
large to be completed in a Sprint it's
going to have to be subdivided or we
call it disaggregation
into um smaller user stories and there's
uh three ways that we're proposing here
that you could go about doing that you
could split it based on operational
boundaries for example as an operator
one needs to manage reservations which
could be split for example there could
be one portion that is uh that has to do
with making a reservation another one
that has to do with modifying it and yet
another one that has to do with
cancelling it so um that could be split
into
in this construct here three separate
user stories you could also separate
based on exceptions or crosscutting
concerns for example in the beginning
develop only one main path like accept
repayment for a
loan then address exceptions like what
if a person um
overpays then um come up with a user
story that recognizes that and processes
a refund and or gives the option of
allocating the overpayment to a future
payment or something like that and then
also um um adds on other concerns like
the tech access restrictions or record
name of operator so maybe um you know
when you're working on uh accepting
payments or processing refunds it's
going to check on um who the operator is
or track that that so that if at a later
time you know who was it that gave this
uh refund here well you could look and
see you know okay the the operator's
name was recorded or maybe you put some
restrictions so that maybe not everybody
um is allowed to do a refund and so you
would have levels of users that have
different
privileges okay and then down at the
bottom split Based on data boundaries
for an example you know as an accountant
one needs to enter balance sheet
information um which could then be split
into summary
information and
separately um uh receivable details or
you know maybe you could have AP you
know so you could have different
portions of the
overall
um balance sheet um activities that need
to be done so enter AR enter
AP Etc
make sense so just to kind of uh prompt
you give you some ideas about what to do
um in a scrum project if you have the
scenario arise where a user story is
being estimated by the team and it won't
fit into a Sprint it's too
big now when it comes to determining
value for user stories this is primarily
owned by the uh product owner right and
it always comes back to money but money
you know the value can be looked at from
different points of view so new Revenue
obviously you know getting new customers
and having them buy
stuff um well below that there's another
consideration incremental Revenue uh so
somebody's in the process of placing an
order um maybe there are some premium
features that could be add-ons at that
point in time um or maybe added later on
so you have an existing customer who
actually
buys um more of or enhanced parts of the
existing thing they already purchased or
are in the process of purchasing
retained value so this is
um you know retaining customers so that
they don't go to a
competitor and then the bottom one is
operational efficiency you know how
could things be done to speed up the
process of whatever it is um so that the
cost of delivering uh the product is
reduced so this then leads us to a
discussion about priorities recognizing
that there are some priority concerns
that come from both the customer domain
as well as the technical
domain
and there are some prioritization models
um if we look right here there is value
based
prioritization and the hierarchy of that
would be high value followed by high
risk followed by high value and then low
risk followed by low value and then low
risk so you know we might have written
this a little bit differently but that's
value based prioritization and this is
primarily the product owner with maybe
some input from the team just simply
deciding um what he or she wants the
most listening to the team say well you
know there's some you know greater risks
with this user story than that and so
you'd probably want to uh persuade the
product owner to take care of high-risk
stuff first um because that would have
an a uh oh excuse me sorry an impact on
the future things
that need to be
done there's the the Cano model uh which
looks at each of the user stories and
classifies them as being mandatory
linear or
exciters and the mandatory items are
those user stories that are musts and
they'll never move Beyond move the
customer the end user Beyond neutral
it's if they're not there it creates
just set satisfaction if the the you the
product owner and the team has done a
good job in identifying what are the
mandatory or threshold items um you
would see that
um um it just gets it to neutral that's
what's expected for the product linear
items um user stories are those user
stories that as they are implemented
progressively throughout the project and
added to the features set it will linear
increase customer satisfaction and it
can be you know in their absence
dissatisfaction all the way up to high
implementation creating a great deal of
satisfaction for the customer and then
the third category is exciters and
delighters um and those are features or
functions those are user stories that
are not mandatory and the absence of
them will never result in satisfaction
going below neutral but by adding them
um you could create excitement and
Delight for the customer these would
typically be things that
are features that would be included in a
premium version of the product or maybe
add-ons that are promoted you know at
the point of sale you know if you
thought about this because it'll really
help you or
whatever so that's the Cano model and
then there's weager relative waiting
method
and um this is all using numbers so each
feature is given a value for its benefit
and it's penalty given a value for
penalty meaning what's the pain if that
feature or function is not
included and then there is um um the
cost side and the risk
side and then those are all calculated
together and results
in excuse me a ranking or a hierarchy
which gives you the priority for the uh
user
stories um we also talked about Moscow
didn't we did we talk about Moscow uh
Moscow is another prioritization model
must
could I said that differently must
should could won't Moscow mscw must
should should could
won't and we talked about that one thank
you for that
confirmation does it seem like a long
time ago or is it just me I know it was
just last weekend but it's like last
year okay so now let's talk about
velocity um uh Priyanka that is exactly
right
um so velocity is the capacity of the
team to complete
work in a single
iteration so the team has estimated the
user stories uh for size or ideal days
and um the Sprints are going to be three
week weeks in duration obviously not all
user stories can be completed in a
single Sprint and be done with the
project well I guess maybe I shouldn't
say Obviously well I'm saying that I'm
thinking well maybe you had a very small
short duration project so you could but
the point is is that uh it's the team's
capacity to um complete work in a given
Sprint and it
is an observation it's not a prediction
so if we're working on Sprint
five and we're working on determining
what our velocity
is then then um it would be the average
of the previous four
Sprints if there were any uh outliers
you you would disregard
those
um and so it's an
observation if we look over to question
or uh box number two here velocity is
used to deal with um determining how
many user stories we are going to to
include in a given Sprint and also how
many Sprints are we going to need to
create a release or a set of user
stories and here's an
example in box number three a team
completed five user stories that were
sized 5 3 8 13 and
two two user stories each sized five
were left half complete what is the
velocity of the
team and the answer is either going to
be 31 or
36 31 is the sum of the completed user
stories um if you were 36 you were
claiming half of the two that were five
uh so that would be a total of 10 so you
claim half of it which would be five
would take you to 36 but it's not going
to be 36 because the only thing that
counts
towards progress is working software so
even if the team had finished nine out
of 10 story points for a user story
meaning it's almost done and then the
Sprint ends that doesn't get counted
towards
velocity and you don't mess around with
velocity um you can mess around with
your estimating and you can mess around
with um you know what user stories are
going to be completed in a Sprint but
you don't the the velocity is not
variable it is what it is based on past
performance when it comes to levels of
planning we have What's called the
planning onion and let me walk you
through this here up at the the broadest
area is the vision level so the vision
level that's the suits right they're the
ones that have the strategy and
objectives for the company and where
it's going and so they have that overall
big vision for the uh
company which is likely going to include
products and each product should have a
road map my example of that website that
I'm uh working on has uh three versions
um which make up the product road map
version one is the free site version two
is the membership site and version three
is the um uh the pay referral
commissions uh uh version of the site
and the product road map is then
supported by
releases so for my project I have three
releases so all of the user stories
needed for the free version are in
release one all of the additional user
stories that are needed for the um uh
paid version the subscriber
version uh and then also for version
three those are all releases three
releases and then for each Sprint we
will be pulling user stories from the
release that we're working on a release
is likely going to take multiple Sprints
and um and then the Sprints are
populated by the individual user stories
which are then disaggregated into
tasks and we do the excuse me the daily
scrum which is the daily level of
planning and coordination so we call
that the planning
onion we already kind of talked about
the release and road map um concept here
so let's just review this quickly um
priories high level epics and determine
goals and releases so we'll use epics
and themes in order to group things
together you know what should be
included in what release so what are the
goals for the releases then the first
bullet point establish goals of release
based on market demand regulatory needs
or customer
expectations for each release you want
to estimate the target
stories repeat until the target stories
are assigned and iteration
length I should that's it's blending
some things here um be able to estimate
velocity and then uh assign stories to
the Sprints so we keep estimating the
user stories and we keep organizing uh
that until we can do that we can come up
with an iteration length or Sprint
length and then figure out what our
velocity for each Sprint is and then uh
assign stories to the uh the Sprints uh
the the next bullet down iterate until
the user stories and release date meets
conditions of satisfaction
so that's a definition of done or
acceptance for the release and try not
to pack too much into a release backlog
so
um just like you would not want to pack
too many user stories into a Sprint you
want to have the timelines appropriate
and uh what are included in the uh
events uh make
sense okay so here a little bit more
about release planning on this slide
here um you've got the product backlog
here on the left and then we might come
up with a release plan which could be
flipped and could be looked at uh
horizontally and you probably plan um
about three releases in
advance um or at least you're doing more
of the detailed planning on that uh
because things are going to emerge when
we do you know Sprint one that's going
to help in Sprint two and things that
happen in Sprints one and two that are
going to help um release three and then
you've got um you know your subsequent
releases where we're just doing very
high level planning it's called rolling
wave planning where we do detailed
planning for things in the future in
tandem with doing high level planning
for things in uh the future did I say
that right detail planning for things in
the near term in tandem with highle
planning for things in the
future um and we talked about deciding
as late as possible I believe meaning
that it's better to actually plan the
later uh
releases uh for purposes
of uh making sure we have more
information uh the most information
available okay so
estimation let's start at the top left
the principles behind estimation
understand the cone of
uncertainty which is an estimate or best
guess to begin with and then
progressively becomes more accurate in
fact let's just take a break and look at
the cone of uncertainty so at the very
beginning of a project there's going to
be a high level of
uncertainty um if I were to draw this
chart I would make it a little bit more
like this so clearly you're going to
drisk the
project as early as you can and then
eventually all risk disappears when the
project is done risk is
uncertainty okay below that the only
estimate that matters is the one given
by the
team supported by this uh comment here
nothing is impossible for the one who
doesn't have to do it so the product
owner is like team come on you can do
this the team's like no we know what our
velocity is no the product owner says
I'm telling you there's no way that that
can't be done I know you can do it I
trust you I believe in
you but the product owner doesn't have
to do have to do the work okay top right
overestimation and underestimation is
always going to be an issue that we deal
with it's more likely that we will
underestimate than
overestimate and by looking at our
velocity from iteration or Sprint to
Sprint um there could be some
information that is um showing us that
we're underestimating for example
meaning um we're thinking we you know
the user stories are smaller than they
are and that we can get you know a
certain number done in this Sprint and
then there's a fail well that would mean
then that would be discussed during the
retrospective and then we would do
something different going forward which
might include doing some reestimating
scrum estimating is not necessarily more
difficult however scrum exposes bad
estimates sooner which is a good thing
when we were doing our um uh planning
poker you could see that um the first
time as a team you know we didn't know
each other we didn't know everybody's
thoughts and concerns and those kinds of
things you know get shared and absorbed
as a project goes on and so there's a
higher awareness of that so um what we
would say is that um using estimation
techniques scrum estimation techniques
might be um more inaccurate at the
beginning of a project but they will
quickly become very accurate and as the
um project advances
forward let's see is there a question
here can velocity be increased over a
period of time for the project yes it
can now it's not that it can it will
increase if the team is learning how to
work together better and better you
would expect that if I can just use my
mouse here if we were
tracking velocity so this would be um
points completed over here uh let me
just do pts for points and down here is
time and we go from Sprint to Sprint
right you would expect that maybe you
know the first couple of Sprints the
team would be learning how to work
together and there would be a steep
curve and then it would kind of flatten
out and maybe have you know a slow rise
going forward as the team emerges as a
high performing team they get better at
their cross uh functional Behavior you
know somebody's shck the team just keeps
chugging along um other things you know
just um oh
sorry there I bumped the thing on my
screen there
um um so the team you know learns how to
work better together and you know their
estimates become more accurate Etc and
you would expect a high per a high
performing team to have a uh a result
like this for velocity where there's
quick Improvement and then it kind of
stabilizes and then begins to tick
upwards okay we talked about the cone of
uncertainty let's talk about ideal time
um when we do estimating for user store
um we do it in ideal days when we do
estimating for tasks we do it in ideal
time which means hours I think that's on
the Whiteboard or it was on the
Whiteboard oh it was on it um so ideal
time is the amount of time it takes to
complete a piece of
work but that's based
on the notion
that the team member or members are
available to do just the work with no
distractions or anything at all so
assuming that um prian could sit down
add a keyboard and code for eight hours
without taking a break for lunch no
phone calls no discussions no no
meetings of any kind just work eight
hours how much could be done in that
eight hours by Priyanka that's what
ideal time is but the thing of it is is
that there is no such thing as somebody
being able to spend every minute of
every day only doing work there will be
um
distractions so it has to be converted
into aapse time now we don't convert it
to aapse time at the user level but we
do convert it to a lapse time when we
are dealing at the task
level and what that looks like is you
know for each team member you're going
to have to do it separately because some
team members have more distractions than
others some might have other duties that
pull them away um whatever the case may
be um you determine how much time in a
given day a team member is available to
do work so say it's five hours out of
eight for one maybe it's six hours out
of eight for another maybe it's four out
of eight but you figure out what it is
and then you take the average and that
average availability is used then to
convert Ideal Time into elapse
time um I should have circled this box
here because we talked about this as
well um and then I already mentioned
this here only considers actual work
time not the distractions so that's the
concept of Ideal time when it comes to
story points it's different than that
they are a measure of size relative to
each other so we were doing planning
poker this morning where um we were
looking at grapes versus apples and then
we were looking at oranges and and what
else do we have watermelons and coconuts
and we weren't trying to figure out how
much much time it would take to eat
grapes as opposed to how much time it
would uh take to eat a coconut it's
clear that it's going to take longer to
eat a coconut because there's more
effort involved so we have a sense that
it's going to take more time but
comparing the coconut to our Baseline of
two right we came up with a baseline of
two for the smallest user story We
compare eating coconuts to that Baseline
and we say okay you know what it's going
to take more effort to uh eat the
coconut than it is to to eat grapes or
apples um so you can do it like we did
you can also
triangulate um for example when we did
our planning project this morning or
this morning for me rather at the
beginning um oh that's not it that is
the daily standup here it
is if I had said Team I want you to pick
a small user story a medium user story
and a large user
story um and then we would then compare
other stories to those three and so we
would kind of triangulate on it um let's
say that we did uh you know two was
small uh I'm sorry I'm saying that wrong
grapes was small apples were medium and
coconuts were large well if we then
looked at Orange and we said well you
know orange is um smaller than Apples
but bigger than grapes so we would know
this would fit in between grapes and
apples
um and so let's say you know we had
apples at five and grapes at two then we
would say an orange is probably going to
be
three and the values you know now I used
um in our example the modified Fibonacci
series uh what we do in scrum and Adel
if we're using story points we're going
to use um a nonlinear scale for the
values so down at the
bottom here there's the modified
Fibonacci Sequence the way the Fibonacci
sequence works by the way
um um it's
the the value is the sum of the two on
the right so let me break this right
here because this is a modified
Fibonacci so 13 is five plus eight eight
is three plus 5 five is 2 plus three and
three is 1 plus two if we were doing the
real Fibonacci series this wouldn't be
20 it would be 13 + 8 which would be
21 um and I don't know why some use
modified Fibonacci and others not but
that's just kind of a common thing to do
if you're doing planning poker you give
everybody seven cards 1 2 3 5 8 13 and
20 um another nonlinear scale is
doubling 1 12
4816 um you typically don't go too far
to the left with the values because um
that either means that you're being too
granular or you've got stories that are
probably too big and they need to be
disaggregated now somebody just chatted
here um should some buffer time be
included in the actual
estimates
um let me answer that question first by
going back to Ideal time and then I'm
going to come back to story points and
answer the question when we're
estimating in ideal time we don't add a
special amount of time that we would
call a buffer we just allow for the
distractions and the interruptions which
could look like a buffer right you're
saying you know um you know Priyanka if
um based on your duties in the
organization and our
uh work day of eight hours you're
typically available to be doing your
project work five out of those eight
hours so when we are converting ideal
time to elapse time um you know we will
be building in extra time based on
distractions and interruptions we would
not call it a buffer but that's
essentially what we're doing now when it
comes to user stories that we're using
story points it is different um the
points are for the entire amount of the
work and why might we need to have some
extra time for a user story well it's
likely going to be driven by uncertainty
there might be other uh things that
impact it but that's the main
thing sorry
team so when the team is estimating the
size of the user story they will be
including in their discuss question and
estimates any extra time or buffer time
that would be needed for uh that user
story to be completed so do we
accommodate um uncertainty when we're
using story points yes we're looking at
the The X Factor and if we've got an
unstable user story then we're probably
going to um say you know this is going
to be a bigger user story than one
that's similar but has uh much less
level of
uncertainty um so that's the story
points let's compare the
two um Ideal Time uses things like hours
and days which is easier to explain
outside the team right the suits like
things in days and hours everybody's
estimate may be different not a bad
thing it's easier to do at the beginning
because we're oriented to think about
time um and it does kind of shine a
light on wasted time story
points um are harder to explain outside
the team um you know the suit says well
um how long is it going to take to do
user story 301 and our answer is um well
that's a 10 user story Point user story
and the suit's saying what does that
mean tell me how long it's going to take
um so the suits have to be converted to
uh uh story points now here's the thing
it's a lot easier to get consensus when
we're estimating in story points and
once we get good at it it's going to be
much
faster we have to remember it's not
comparable across teams so you know a
team working together will have its own
kind of system for sizing the stories
and another team that might even be
working on the same project will have a
CO a whole different uh scheme and so if
the velocity of one team is 25 and the
velocity of another is 50 it doesn't
mean that the team with the velocity of
50 is able to do more work than the
teams whose velocity is
25 and we did um when we got our day
going um we started with um uh a
planning poker exercise and so you know
we used all of the team members so we
selected the team the product owner was
there to answer any questions um the
team discussed each of the story cards
and then um decided what their vote was
going to be and then everybody voted at
once if there were outliers they were
discussed and um the reasons for that uh
those variances those outliers um were
then part of the discussion and then we
did another round of voting and we would
keep doing that until we had our
estimates converge or we reached
consensus on
them okay so advantages of planning
poker it's fun it's quick it gets the
whole team involved the the team
understands um a little bit about all of
the stories everybody contributes his or
her expertise and the discussion during
the estimation provides Clarity in the
direction approach and even a bit of
design if we were in the same room team
and we were doing a planning ER activity
like we did uh at the beginning of our
day uh together um we would be able to
you know model it a little bit better or
if we tried to unmute everybody but you
could hear the background noise I've
tried doing it it doesn't really work
but you get the idea that if the team's
discussing and things like that you
would actually get to the point where um
your estimates would converge and the
team would say okay this user story size
is you know whatever it
is okay so we need to wrap things up for
the day so we are ending right here and
that means tomorrow when we get together
we're going to be doing slide 20 you're
starting with that which is Affinity
estimating and let's see Affinity
estimating we go through that we're
going to talk about tracking progress
using um information radiators and then
we're going to talk about what we do
when we find variances between between
the plan and the actual results and then
we'll have our quiz so we're almost
finished um I think we're good on time
have a look at certified scrum Master
CSM certification training course some
key features of this course include two
days online virtual classes two-year
membership with scrum Alliance 20 pdus
and 16 scus includes CSM exam fees as
well by the end of this course you will
be skilled with scrum and agile
methodologies importance of agile scrum
life cycle scrum terminologies daily
scrum and review roles involved in scrum
and distributed scrum so hurry up and
enroll now one year of experience is
preferred to enroll into this course so
hurry up and enroll Now find the course
Link in the description box now let us
look at a typical scenario of an
organization where the need of user
stories would come in so looking at this
scenario say an organization would have
a scenario where the existing products
are sold very well in the market and uh
they may think about introducing new
product or they may think about
introducing a new feature or
functionality to the existing product so
the scenario what we are considering is
it says our previous product sold really
well in the market now let's think about
new products so we'll need to make sure
we can understand the requirements and
fulfill their requirements now how do
you do this so how are you going to
understand the consumer requirements
user requirements and how is that going
to help the user to accomplish the
requirement and fulfill the need
whatever is required to be fulfilled so
user story helps one who understand the
user stories would look at the
perspective of the users and these user
stories provides those Insight towards
what user would exist so as we go
through we will understand in the
perspective of the users the
requirements and how user story is helps
in terms of fulfilling those
requirements this requires certain
amount of visualization let us see what
it is so what are user
stories user stories are an agile
software development project management
tool that provides users with simple
natural language explanations of one or
more features written from the end users
perspectives so for a given product we
may have many end users so we may
develop an application within an
organization and use that application
for an organization that is one scenario
second scenario is we create a product
we sell it and employees of our customer
organization will become users of those
products these are the two scenarios so
having these scenarios what kind of
product it is what is the objective of
this product which is going to fulfill
so let me assume an HR application which
is used for submission of claims from
the employees so what is that
requirement so these application should
accept the claims submission from the
employees of the organization and then
that needs to be processed and the
claims needs to be uh cleared now what
will happen now the user Community if
you visualize there is an user as an
employee of an organization who submit
claims so there is an user in the
finance perspective who is going to
deposit the money similarly there is an
user who is going to approve so many
such user interfaces we will see the
existence of the roles of users we will
see who would be using these particular
applications so in their perspective
there should be an interface provided
there should be some privileges provided
through which they would do their
transactions and activities when we
write the user stories we don't write
them in detail so a user story doesn't
go in detail it just mentions how a
certain type of work will bring value to
end user so what is this role specific
end user would be doing at that
particular role in this particular Pro
what is the transactions involved so the
end user in this case could mean
external end user or even internal
customer or colleagues within the
organization so looking at these points
if I look at the same application HR
claim processing application who are
this internal users the employees of
organization so who are these external
maybe the people who sold this
particular application to our
organization so they have installed it
they manage it there is an
Administration role for this particular
product that is a role similarly another
set of internal users maybe someone who
is like from Finance from HR so in each
of these roles perspective this
particular product should provide the
interface and then there should be a
transaction in their perspective which
is very important so user story should
explain this in very brief so that it
helps in terms of visualizing what kind
of interface has to be provided and why
would this particular role use it that
is is very important so user stories
also form the building block of agile
Frameworks like epics and initiatives so
what is this epic what is this
initiatives let us look at it now epics
refers to the group of user stories
where the large amount of work broken
down into user stories so many user
stories together forms epics which will
provide certain Insight towards how
these user stories are connected with
each other so simp similarly initiative
refers to combination of multiple epics
forming that initiatives so which is
very essential to group so managing
perspective it will become easy and also
looking at the objective what is that
particular group of user stories group
of epics are going to accomplish so user
stories can also help ensuring that team
work to goals of the organization
through epics and initiatives it should
be looking at the objective exactly what
is the directions we are getting into
and how these combination of user
stories so as an employee I'm submitting
my claims so what is that required in
that user's perspective there should be
a story so I as a finance person I'm
going to clear these claims I'm going to
pay the money deposit the money so that
is that particular role needs certain
interfaces and that visualization
requires how this interactions happens
so user story should help in terms of
understanding those so the requirements
for making user story a reality are
added later after discussing with the
team so we made an user story we created
an user story it doesn't end there so
there needs to be a discussion which
happens further to decide yes it is a
valid user story so this will also helps
in terms of prioritization which needs
to be taken up first so user stories are
recorded on potit notes or an index card
or a project management software and
this would help in terms of
prioritization or for tracking as well
so what is the advantages of user
stories
so advantages of user story involves it
helps in delivering high quality content
because what is required to be
accomplished in the user perspective
that will be very
clear eases collaboration with team
members because finalization on the user
stories and understanding of the user
requirements would happen after
discussing with the team members each
one would give their own uh viewpoints
and uh prioritization of particular user
story or keeping a specific user story
or not considering that user story would
be based on the feedback which team
provides this cannot happen in terms of
having team members together and
speaking about it helps understanding
users better so user roles are discussed
users requirement is discussed and what
is that they're going to accomplish
through this user uh interface that is
also discussed so user role is
understood user requirement is clearly
understood by writing an user story this
will also help in improving
transparency because since the
collaboration is happening since the
user story is not just taken just like
that the discussion happens and that
will have an interaction and
collaboration so definitely improves
transparency so now it reduces risks so
when I say risk it's obviously
uncertainty so it reduces risk because
the clarity one would have about the
requirement of users so accordingly the
features functionality of the product
are defined so that they can fulfill
those user requirements then supports
iterative developments as I mentioned
earlier the collaboration the
transparency everyone working together
and in the agile perspective users
stories epics and initiatives gets into
the specific iterations only after this
discussion with the team members and
after prioritizing it so the user story
will be there in the product backlogs
which will be prioritized based on that
particular scenario of requ m in agile
scenario so as when we say agile it's
quite obvious we need to be flexible to
the changing scenarios so since we're
working together and when we go for an
iterative mode of approach is quite
obvious we're going for it to get
adopting to the changing scenario so
that we can select that particular
features functionality by pulling that
particular epic or user story as a
priority in the given list so that
prioritization making will also become
easier focuses on oal Communications
means lot of interactions happens while
discussing on user stories so since
people are doing itally so there is some
Personal Touch also established good
collaboration can get established so us
story also provides that visibility
because of that people working together
in a collaborative manner invest in user
stories so what is invest so investing
in user stories so what does that mean
so it is a concept that helps creating
meaningful user stories so it stands for
independent negotiable valuable
esteemable sized appropriately testable
so when I say
independent so whenever we write the
user story that should be
selfcontained if at all possible to
avoid dependencies on other user stories
so it should be independent of one
another so that each of them can be
developed and delivered separately so
negotiable so when we say negotiable
user stories can always be changed or
ritten so at any given point in time so
we should be able to do the
modifications required so that should
support the flexibility associated with
the agile methodologies so since
requirements often evolve changes and
this changes comes for various different
reasons so how do we change this user
stories or modify this so that it can
fit into the requirement so that
adaption can happen to the changing
requirements so story should be
discussible and should be open for
negotiation for any change scenarios so
next valuable when I say valuable it's
quite obvious we're speaking about value
what is being created for the users or
consumers so a user story would
represent the goal or an objective an
end user who is going to look for means
value is always in the consumer
perspective so now I created certain
features functionality is fine but did
that really create the value to the
consumers so the value realization plays
an important role So Stories must ensure
there's a value being added to the
consumers and customers or users always
otherwise user story doesn't make any
sense so estimable so when we say
estimable one should always be able to
estimate the size of the user story so
sometimes developers may not have the
experience required to size the
particular situations or needed for an
user storage reasons may be anything it
may be not having specific Insight
towards it or don't know how to estimate
there may be someone specific who needs
to understand the scenarios and then
come and discuss reasons may be anything
so stories if they cannot estimate then
it will become difficult in terms of
handling it better so it should give
some visualization so it should be
estimable and can be divided into tasks
so now small means sized appropriately
so user story should not be very big or
should not be too small and then uh how
do we decide on this size so now when we
say uh any user story that can be
completed by a developer in single
iterations then can we call it as two
bck quite obviously that is again
indicative so user story should be
subdivided into two or more small
stories into multiple pieces multiple
stories small small stories so that it
can be handled better so story should
not be too big and should be complet
within 40 hours or 3 to 4 days this
numbers are indicative so not
necessarily you should be fixing with
these numbers so just an indicative to
show you that what would be the focus
when I say us the story and what is that
effort it would take to accomplish that
now
testable so when we say user story is
testable one has to ensure that
development is complete and has been
done correctly so means one once you
create a user story so that needs to be
articulated in such a way so that it
becomes measurable when it's a testable
obviously there should be metrics a
Target metric which can be created which
will help me to State yes this
particular requirement is accomplished
so they should have an acceptance
criteria that can be tested to check if
they fulfill the customer need so then
how to write user story this is very
important uh point to look at so how to
write the user story so writing user
stories comes up with a specific
template with a simple language so what
is it so now as a role I want to so that
so you keep filling it so typically role
means what the specific user role who
would be using that particular product
and their requirements which are being
fulfilled so that is the role the name
of the role we are going to put it here
so the role refers to an individual that
would be interfacing or interacting with
the system now uh want to when we say
want to the want or action which
represents the behavior of the systems
so what is that it's supposed to do this
action would be unique to each user
stories now so that this refers to the
benefits or results that nonfunctional
and external to the system as a result
what would happen what is that we are
trying to accomplish out of it so let us
look at an example how does it look like
as a CEO I want to track my subordinates
progress to ensure organization goals
are met similarly
if we take the reference to those
examples what we discussed earlier like
we took the example of HR portal so caim
processing requirement now this can be
same user story as an employee of an
organization what can I write so as an
employee of this
organization I want to submit my claims
online so that claim processing will
become smoother easier faster without
any errors so that can also be an user
story so which gives certain
visualization what kind of users are
there and what is that they need so the
moment you write the user stories you
should visualize that rule it is very
important so there is three C of user
stories which we uh call it as card then
uh conversation and then confirmation so
when we say card card provides a written
description of the user story so what do
I mean by written description of the
user story so same thing the user story
what we just saw as an example example
so that can be written on a card so this
will help in planning and estimating so
what and that will also gives that
visualization of users and their
requirement so that that can be
articulated further and also estimated
so that it can uh looked in the
perspective of invest what is invest
what we discussed so it is independent
it is negotiable it is valuable it is
estimable it is sized appropriately
means it's not should not be too big too
small the examples what we saw was
appropriate and testable so now when we
see this particular user story is it
fulfilling all those points what we
discussed in invest that is very
important now this card whatever the
description is provided should elaborate
on that very clearly so then further
what happens
conversation after the user story is
written in a card and given and it is
shared with the every individuals who is
participating in that conversation so
then there will be discussion so
conversation represents discussion
between users team product owners so
this helps in terms of whatever the user
story is written is it making sense is
it in line with the user's expectation
and at the same time whatever the
understanding we have maybe as a product
owner or the team member a developer is
my understanding correct then user
perspectives so whatever the user story
is written is that user story is
speaking about the requirement which
needs to be fulfilled as they require so
this helps to build a shared
understanding between all those
individuals so that there is no
confusion further so once people
Converse together once the stakeholders
Converse together then you will confirm
confirmation so this represents the
condition that need to be satisfied to
ensure that the Story meets all
requirements so you are confirming so
all the stakeholders are agreeing to
that so firstly to summarize this 3 C's
refers to card conversation confirmation
card provides the user stories which
actually represents as we took an
examples which will capture that so that
it also fulfills the thought of invest
then uh conversation is required to
understand what is this user story
speaking about is that a real
requirement so confirmation further in
terms of confirmation from users as as
well as all the stakeholders before you
go and develop or execute that so what
is life cycle of user story so when we
say life cycle so we may require to
understand a life cycle starts when you
conceptualize when you visualize when
you say this is what we requireed to
accomplish they should be conceiving
someone should conceive that idea so it
may be related to a problem it may be
related to a specific product for an
opportunity what is seen so whatsoever
the reason it is there is a scenario
where something is conceived trigger may
be a problem trigger may be some issues
what is being faced trigger may be an
opportunity what is seen so then the
initiative the trigger which actually
pushed towards creation of the
requirements and user stories so the
life cycle of user stor starts from
there so how does it go so it
involves right from the point pending to
Todo then discussion then developing
confirming and then finished so when I
say pending I'm basically saying user
stories in their most basic forms where
they are created after communicating
with the user and the project team these
acts as a reminder for further
discussion so first level of
understanding on user stories in the
basic form so which will help in terms
of further discussion and taking a call
on that so will there be a possibility
that this user stories will be modified
as as we progress answer is yes and no
both so it may be modified but
discussion is further which goes on from
this basic understanding of that
particular user story so further
discussion is to elaborate on that make
sense out of it and confirm so then
after discussion with the stakeholders
users stories that need to be addressed
are decided and put into Sprints so in
between the point where we said pending
to to do so in between this there is a
lot of discussion so where decision is
happening here so decided and put into
Sprints means there is a prioritization
also which is happening so now
discussion at this stage user confirms
users confirms the requirement and
acceptance
criterias so acceptance criterias helps
in terms of once you test that
particular user story after executing
you will check based on these acceptance
criteria so that you can conclude the
requirement is fulfilled the end users
are shown a preview of upcoming features
so that they understand yes this is what
we were expecting they can provide their
feedbacks necessary feedbacks or
insights whatever is required to be
provided so then once the discussion is
complete the team would be able to
design and Implement features to fulfill
user requirements so once user concludes
yes this is what we were expecting and
there is a sign off during the
discussion then features are developed
and implemented so that it can goes to
that product which can be used so then
after developing confirming so the end
user confirms the user story features
are confirmed to testing environments
Alpha versions and acceptance criterias
are looked at before saying yes it is
confirmed user is accepting so that will
happen as part of confirming means that
features or functionality what was
written user story so that specific
users are using it and concluding or
acknowledging yes this is fulfilling our
requirement and this is according to the
acceptance criteria what we discussed
and agreed so that is very important so
we write a user story fine but users are
not agreeing to it that is not a good
scenario to be with user should accept
and confirm then finished so the user
story is completed at this stage for new
requirements or new features a new user
story must be created any new features
or new functionality I'm required to add
to this particular product then I would
write another users story and the same
life cycle starts continues and this is
not an ending thing so as I keep
modifying the features as I add new
features and as I look at improving the
performances so I keep writing the user
stories now one question keeps coming to
me so we write a user story while
fulfilling the requirements fine as a
specific user I want this easy to
narrate that so how are you going to
look at a scenario where there is an
improvement of something so whenever we
are going to discuss about Improvement
of something it is quite obvious we need
to look at it what is that Improvement
user is looking at now when I'm uh
submitting a particular request or
accessing something it is taking some
time means there is some delay now user
experience can be enhanced by reducing
that particular time that is Improvement
as a user the user story basic user
story doesn't change but in the
performance perspective you may require
to visualize that so problem statement
has to come in accordingly user story
has to be articulated then once the user
story is written it is required to put
the user story mapping so user story
mapping represents and arranges user
stories that help with understanding the
systems functionalities the systems
backlog planning releases and providing
value to the customers so typically this
involves arranging or organizing users
stories based on the priority along the
horizontal axis so will horizontally
when you move so you will say which one
is the priority which user stories are
priority first thing which I need to
focus on so vertical Arrangements
represents how in the given specific
user Story how the activities
perspective task perspective subtask
perspective further down how it gets
elaborated to improving the levels how
it goes forward so now let let us look
at an user story mapping with an example
of let me say net banking services
provided by a bank for account holders
when I say net banking service it is
quite obvious it is also has to be
provided through having a product uh
which banking application would use so
but here we need to visualize the users
Journey while accessing the net banking
portal viewing the Account Details
paying bills like utility bills doing of
transactions within that particular
portal net banking access the moment
they do like generating statements or
transferring money to one of the benef
beneficiaries Etc so all this
transactions what is being done so in
this user story map let us see how does
it look like so few activities are
considered here like uh logging into the
account means net banking portal will
come in then one would input their
credentials and then they log in now
that journey of the users in a specific
activity what they do is visualized Now
log to account in the sense obviously
one has to go to that portal so go to
login page then enter credentials login
ID and password so once that login ID
and password is entered obviously there
is a process engine which runs behind to
provide the necessary access now if that
credentials are not uh working or if I
don't remember it reset password as an
option immediately
now as I go through further from this
subtask in all the particular columns
which I have given here as you go
through this as I deep dive into it
further it goes on so until the person
gets an access to the account and then
start doing the transactions it goes up
to that level so I can keep writing the
subtask further so manage account so you
would go to account page once you access
it then you'll select the specific
account because you may have many
different account types which is there
with the bank you may be having one or
many so so in the scenario you have more
than one obviously you will select that
account and Account Details will be
displayed to you so this user will not
do but user will get that so we are
visualizing that and further after
Account Details are displayed what user
would do then further you would keep
visualizing that so some of the
transaction like generating statement
transferring money so even for that the
steps are written so going to statement
page then selecting the account for
which you need a statement then
selecting the period from when to when
the statement one is requiring and then
uh further clicking on it and
downloading that particular statement or
choosing an options mentioning that I
need this in an email or I need an OD
copy of this so similarly transferring
money so you will go to that specific
wage where you need to transfer the
money so you may have the beneficiary
there in the list already added if you
have added earlier or newly you're
adding a beneficiary so there are
various types of transfers like so
International transfer you will have
local domestic transfer you will have
within a bank accounts being within a
same bank bank a two consumers so from
me if I'm a consumer transferring money
to another consumer of the same bank and
wice ver that is one of the options
second is a bank consumer having an
transferring a money to some other bank
account of someone else that is another
scenario or transferring money for my
own account in another bank so various
scenarios you come across so then
limitation are depending on what kind of
beneficiaries are these what is the
limitations and how are you going to
authenticate them so the moment I
visualize a specific transaction and
activities of user stories what are the
things an user can do then I can keep
writing mapping this to each of those
flow and see how the flow happens so
this flow helps me to bring in all those
features and functionality and also
prioritizing them so can I say
the beneficiary option would be the
basic thing which consumer would give I
think initially if I go back when
actually net banking features were
provided by the bank the basic thing was
just viewing the account that was the
given statement download was given
otherwise there was no opportunity to
transfer money there was no opportunity
to do something beyond that so now as we
see today the lot of flexibility has
brought in with lot of new features
functionalities in the net banking or
mobile banking options so they evolve so
as they all it is quite obvious we may
require to keep adding those features
functionality by rating the user stories
this is how the enhancement happens so
overall if you look at user story
mapping helps in terms of understanding
not just the user story of one
transaction Associated transaction in
the user story what happens throughout
the journey that will help so this will
also support to understand and visualize
what needs to be created to ultimately
give that access to the user so the end
to endend flow should be visualized and
also needs to be prioritization and has
to be looked at as well now what are the
advantages of user story mapping so the
advantages wise helps with prioritizing
work as I explained in the example
similarly the focus is on user value the
moment I click on web page
www.abc
bank.com now the bank page will come I
will have an interface of login I will
go and click on login now from the point
I open a browser and input that URL and
then click on login and login page comes
in how long it takes so there are many
things which is involved the browser
things are involved the system from
which the person is accessing is
involved so removing that part so
thinking that both of them work working
well and what should be the response
from the server where this particular
website is hosted that experience needs
to be looked at so that's how you look
at user value in the transaction now
once I put a credentials now how quickly
the authentication happen s what are the
checks the bank portal does to ensure
that the person who is logging in is is
a genuine user is it just a password is
there any capture codes is there any OTP
sent or is there any secret code the
person has to put in so likewise many
things are involved while giving that
experience to the user so and today's
user if you just put in various
different checks points they understand
because they are very educated
so why all those things like capture or
OTP scenarios came in so these are came
in because more and more informed the
people has become then their ability to
hack also improve so more and more
levels added to ensure that only that
genuine user will enter the user account
similarly when you visualize any product
and user journey in the users's
interest what are the things which is
going to create value that needs to be
understood
so only that experience will help for
the user to realize the benefit then
road blocks are highlighted so as we
visualize this journey so this will tell
me so what would stop me to move forward
is there any concerns is there any
constraints like for example if you want
to activate a beneficiary but for some
limited period you can only send the
limited amount of money why is that done
by chance if the beneficiary is added by
that individual who is not a genuine
user so we are actually holding it right
so by the time that freezing time
whatever is given so by the time the
message goes to the actual consumer
telling that there is a user activated
like this and if at all if it is not a
genuine user obviously the person can
call to the bank saying that this is not
the uh beneficiary which I have added
there's something which is not correct
so they are giving that space so how did
they visualize this has to be done so as
we looked at the Journey of adding a
beneficiary it's quite obvious when
beneficiary is added if by chance
someone who is not authorized adds it so
who is going to disbenefit obviously
user will be dis benefited so that
blocks that constraints are visualized
similarly in making or creating that
features functionality what should be
the basic features or in the product
should be ready only then I can add this
feature even that will be visible right
so roadblocks will be highlighted and
that those will be made visible so that
easy for you to move forward
prioritizing and ensuring that it goes
in the flow required to accomplish that
value so then ensuring team unity
because everyone will have an
visualization user stories and mapping
reads a lot of discussion brings the
people to have a common understanding so
obviously that Unity the collaboration
would come in focus on constant
Improvement so Improvement is the key
whatever you do you you just adopted a
waterfall methodology you have just
adopted an agile you write user stories
you raise EPS you write bringing that
various different methods to do
something whatever you do whether it's
product or a service or a process or
specific uh transactions task reports
whatever we make so all that should help
in terms of identifying the
opportunities for improvement and making
that improvements that is very
important there are three distinct roles
in scrum the scrum Master the product
owner and the development team the scrum
Master assists both the development team
and the product owner the scrum Master
works with the product owner to maximize
return on
investment the scrum Master empowers the
development team by fostering creativity
removing impediments and coaching and
mentoring as appropriate the product
owner is responsible for project success
by defining the project Vision
requirements and
priorities the product owner has to
resist the temptation to manage the team
or add more important work after a
Sprint has
begun the product owner has to be
willing to make the hard choices during
Sprint
planning the development team is
comprised of five to nine members with a
mix of roles and has the autonomy to
self-organize and choose how best to
meet the goals of the product owner and
is responsible for the same a scrum
Master is a skilled servant leader a
scrum master has very little formal
Authority however he or she is expected
to assist the team achieve the intended
outcomes without interfering with the
team's
autonomy the scrum Master facilitates
the scrum ceremonies such as Sprint
planning daily standup Sprint review and
Sprint
retrospective the scrum Master removes
obstacles or impediments faced by the
team the scrum Master is also a pro
process coach and Mentor the scrum
Master must not be a line manager of the
team the scrum Master is not to be a
Taskmaster either the scrum Master is
not a technical or design Authority nor
is he or she a decision maker for the
team throughout the course of the
project the scrum Master must not do
anything to rob the team of its
empowerment and ability to
self-organize let's talk about the
attributes of a scrum Master scrum
Masters need to exhibit responsibility
even though they are not solely
accountable for the team's output they
will consider it their responsibility to
remove anything that impacts the team's
productivity they will try to enable the
team to do the best that it
can they are
humble they will work in the background
and let the team take all the glory they
will use we statements
and seldom use any eye
statements they are able to set aside
their ego and shower all their attention
on the
team they are by Nature collaborative
they will encourage the team to have
conversations among each other and with
other stakeholders outside the team they
will nudge all the right people into
getting involved and work together in
trying to solve problems they are
committed to the team cause even if
being a scrum Master is a part-time task
for them they will give the highest
priority to the team's needs hence the
scrum Masters work allocation especially
if they are part-time needs to take this
into
consideration they are able to influence
they are naturally good communicators
and able to convince others to adopt
different approaches they apply various
techniques to mobilize organizational
resources when required walk the
political tight rope when required and
in general do whatever it takes to get
the team the assistance it
needs they are
knowledgeable it is clear that as
process coaches for the team scrum
Masters need to be experts in the method
they may not be the technical or domain
experts however they are knowledgeable
enough to be able to have productive
conversations about the project being
done by the team tasks for the scrum
Master the scrum Master is a crucial
role and it is important for you to be
able to be clear about exactly how the
scrum Master serves the team scrum
Masters are servant leaders this means
that they put the team before themselves
and assist the team for example they set
up ensure that the scrum ceremonies are
effectively carried out they ensure that
there is smooth flow of information
within and outside the team team and
that there is a spirit of collaboration
in decision- making and problem solving
scrum Masters must make it their mission
to resolve issues that hinder team
progress it doesn't matter what the
nature of the issue is a scrum Master
needs to mobilize the right resources
within the organization to resolve those
issues in a timely manner and escalate
promptly if that does not
happen we need to understand that in the
short duration of a Sprint even a few
hours of being stuck can make the
difference between a successful and
unsuccessful
Sprint scrum Masters protect the team
they ensure that the team is not
Disturbed or asked to deviate from their
commitments if pressure mounts due to
unreasonable expectations they will step
in and push back on the team's behalf
they will also play the role of
Peacemaker when conflict arises by
encouraging the parties to to focus on
the issue discuss the issue with an open
mind and resolve the conflict finally
scrum Masters are the process coaches of
the team they use their understanding of
agile methods and scrum in particular to
guide the team through the dos and
don'ts of
scrum they ensure that the team stays
true to the principles of Agile
development scrum Master roles scrum
teams before we discuss the role of a
develop V ER on a scrum team let's talk
about the desirable characteristics of
scrum teams they should be small and
Nimble team size should be no less than
three and no more than nine so that
would be six plus or minus three
exceptions are possible but
uncommon the small attribute makes the
team Nimble and improves productivity it
avoids the phenomenon Mike con calls
social loafing and instead produces
focus on work the team size should be
just large enough that the team members
are able to produce and showcase a
significant increment of work at the end
of each Sprint Sprint after
Sprint self-sufficient and cross
functional for example if a team needs
user interface development skills
database expertise and service expert
expse all of those skills must be
present on the
team ideally team members are
generalizing Specialists team members
should not only be an expert or a
specialist at one aspect of the
development effort but should also have
enough skills and knowledge to fill in
in other roles as necessary for example
if you are a UI developer you should be
able to Dawn the Hat of a Services
developer if needed if a large team is
to be split up into smaller scrum teams
scrum favors feature teams over
component
teams autonomous and
self-organizing teams choose for
themselves how they are going to
organize and meet the goals of the
product owner no one gets to dictate to
the team how to get their work
then the team decides in collaboration
with the product owner the product
Direction and the pros and cons of
different
approaches let's talk about some key
decision points or factors to consider
when assembling scrum teams feature
teams over component teams the first
issue is whether it's best to align team
members based on features or components
scrum favors feature teams over
component teams for example it's best to
avoid putting all of the UI developers
together and all of the API or Services
developers together why because each
feature or user story will require both
the UI and services or API organizing
based on components will reduce the
incentive to collaborate the only reason
component teams may be justified would
be if the components are likely to be
used by multiple other
teams assemble the right people it's
important to get the right mix of people
together for the team the right level of
technical and domain expertise teams
will naturally have both senior and
junior level developers this works
perfectly as there will be stuff that is
more appropriate for the junior
developers and stuff that is not also
one of the risks of a small team is that
the team may miss out on broader
perspective and dissenting views one way
to work around this is to deliberately
favor diversity in all aspects gender
ethnicity personality traits Etc
it may take some time for the team to
advance through the storming stage of
Team development and develop the trust
necessary to work effectively together
but it can be done once a team has been
formed it's best to preserve and assign
whole teams rather than individuals to
projects it's best to avoid assigning
team members to multiple projects at the
same
time distributed team a distributed team
may be unavoidable
those based at the same geographical
location should be collocated in the
same team room and Technology processes
and ground rules should be put in place
to overcome the disadvantages of all
team members not being
co-located plotting team size and
productivity will likely result in an
s-curve you can see here that a team can
actually be too small or too large
Remember The Sweet Spot is six plus plus
or minus 3 first you need to have a
strong understanding of scrum and agile
Concepts as a scrum Master you need to
ensure that your team follows the
principles of agile and scrum you need
to have a clear understanding of
different teams and phases within scrum
to ensure you can understand and teach
the usage of framework to the
organization properly in short having a
detailed understanding of the system sys
and terminologies is mandatory a scrum
certification can also greatly help with
this more on that in a little bit you
need fine-tuned organizational skills
you need to be able to structure the
team and plan out their actions to
ensure everything stays organized and to
make sure everything stays on track you
need the ability to plan things out you
should be able to ensure that the team
stays on schedule and all the tasks are
completed successfully you could also
use online project management systems
like monday.com nutc and Sam 9000 to
keep things organized you need to be
familiar with the technology the team
uses you need to ensure that the team is
able to complete their project in a
timely manner this can be done if you
have an understanding of different
technical terms and processes that the
team is involved with hence some
technical familiarity and training is
really important you also need to have
the ability to coach and teach the team
to follow scrum properly for teams that
are new to the scrum methodology your
ability to teach them the different
concepts terms and principles play a
very important role in the future
success of the team you need to be able
to tell the team not only what it needs
to be done but also how and why you also
need to be able to encourage the team
members to work together and improve
themselves you may also need to work
with individual team members to maximize
their potential you need to have the
ability to handle conflicts and resolve
them quickly considering how teams are
filled with people with different
personalities ideas and working Styles
it is only likely that they may clash
with each other every now and then if
disagreement cannot be handled among
themselves you need to be able to figure
things out if left unsolved this could
inhibit the entire team's progress so
you must be able to negotiate and
resolve the conflict in a way that
satisfies everyone and finally you must
be a servant leader a servant leader
puts the needs of the team before their
own and helps each member to perform the
best of the their capabilities you need
to be both a leader and the team member
you need to be the part of your team
while making sure they can successfully
fulfill their
requirements now let's talk about
certifications to become a scrum Master
at a certified one at that one of the
most important things you can do is to
get through the certified scrum Master
test this test tests your understanding
of different principles and processes
that are the part of scrum process
moreover to take this test you need to
have completed an inperson or an online
course thought by a certified scrum
trainer or certified agile coach you'll
also need to have at least 14 hours of
face-to-face interaction with the
aformentioned trainer or a coach have a
look at certified scrum Master CSM
certification training course some key
features of this course include two days
online virtual classes two-year
membership with scrum Alliance 20 pdus
and 16 scus includes CSM exam fees as
well by the end of this course you will
be skilled with scrum and agile
methodologies importance of agile scrum
life cycle scrum terminologies daily
scrum and review roles involved in scrum
and distributed scrum so hurry up and
enroll now one year of experience is
preferred to enroll into this course so
hurry up and enroll Now find the course
Link in the description box welcome to
scrum interview questions tutorial from
Simply learn I am CMR Chandra Mr a
certified professional in itl V3 expert
itl for managing professional PMP Prince
to practitioner Prince to Agile
practitioner agile scrum master devops
and kid 5 so as part of this tutorial we
are going to understand the TP typical
interview questions which would come
across when someone faces the interview
for any of the roles in the scrum so
question number one what is
Scrum so scrum is a framework that
enables team to work together so with
scrum teams can learn from experiences
self organize working on problems to
reflect on their victories and their
losses to improve so this is a simple
framework which will provide a better
ability and methodology one can able to
handle it better so scrum is very well
defined articulated and this provides a
better insights and capabilities
building XIs is very easier and roles
are well
defined so Define the roles in scrum so
what are the typical roles we come
across in scrum so one of the roles we
come across is product owner so product
owner is primarily responsible for
maximizing the Roi by determining the
product features prioritizing it into a
list what needs to be focused on for the
next print and constantly reprioritizing
and refining it so what happens is
whenever we may require to deliver it is
very important for us to have the
requirements clear what requirements
needs to be fulfilled to fulfill that
requirements the products what is
produced should have a specific features
and
functionalities so product owner will
have the list of features and
functionalities which needs to be
created when product comes out as a
result of a project so product owner
owns this primary responsible to ensure
these list of features are identified
and those are prioritized as
required so next role we can think of is
Scrum master who helps teams learn and
apply scrum to obtain business value so
scrum Master helps removing impediments
impediment is anything which can stop
things to flow smoothly so protects them
from interface and helps the team to
adopt agile practices now scrum is one
of the methodologies for agile
approaches and practices now remember
the term agile itself is not a practice
it it refers to indicate that move
faster become flexible respond to change
be flexible now scrum methodology
especially scrum m should understand
this Dynamics and ensure the team
understands this and scrum Master should
guide the team to adopt these
methodologies and ensure the results are
accomplished accordingly so next role is
Scrum team so scrum team is a group of
individuals who work together to deliver
the requirements of the stakeholders so
scrum team is generally of the size like
five plus or minus 2 who are
self-organizing so various different
capabilities ities the scrum team
members would have so each of their
capabilities complement to accomplish
the results required so question number
three what are the responsibilities of
the scrum
team so scrum team is self-organizing as
I mentioned earlier so it is a
self-organizing team that has five to
seven members and the responsibilities
would include the development and
delivery of working products during each
Sprint now we're seeing the new
terminology Sprint so what is the
meaning of the Sprint now Sprint refers
to an iteration a time box iteration
which will have a specific deliverables
to be accomplished as part of it so
self-organizing team takes that specific
working piece what needs to be delivered
so that is a Sprint backlog we call it
as so from the product backlog the
features functionalities which needs to
be delivered as part of this specific
iteration called Sprint time box
iteration and those Sprint backlog items
are are delivered the output of the
Sprint would be the features what is
been taken a working piece working
product so to demonstrate ownership and
transparency for work assigned to them
so they own it the entire thing assigned
to them there is there should be
ownership so ensuring the success of
daily scrum meeting by providing crisp
and correct information so scrum has one
uh event there are five events basically
so one of the events which happens daily
is daily scrum meeting where the team
comes up with scrum master so they would
speak about what is that they have
accomplished from the previous standup
to till now is there anything which is
stopping them to move forward so giving
the crisp updates specific summary
updates so that scrum Master understands
the status so any specific U changes or
any specific support which are required
scrum Master would discuss separately
with those individuals and get it done
so it should be minimum 15 minutes
meeting when we say daily standup
meeting so scrum team collaborate with
each of the team members they work
together and they self organize so next
question the differentiate between ail
and scrum now it is very essential to
understand the terminologies differences
so if we just end up with looking at
wrong understanding of each of the
terminologies then explaining will
become difficult so what does it mean by
agile and what it is when it comes to
the terminology called scrum the term
agile refers to ability to move quickly
and easily by becoming more flexible and
adaptable this is what the meaning which
gets associated with the term agile so
many times I have seen people answering
agile is a methodology agile is a
iterative and increment methodology and
also I think when you search through the
popular search engines you may come
across that which is wrong so agile is
the terminology which is used to state
to move quickly and easily by becoming
more flexible and adaptable this we
should keep in mind so so if the
question may be like what are agile
methodologies then you can come across
like one of the agile methodologies is
Scrum and you can go on on various
different methodologies what we have so
scrum is an agile
methodology right the term scrum is the
name given to the agile meth methodology
which enables organization to become
agile right so to become agile obviously
there are various methodologies scrum is
very popular so that is the main
difference so further if you look at
agile Manifesto and 12 principles which
acts as guidelines to become agile so
there is something called agile
Manifesto Four Points clearly
articulates what needs to be focused on
to become aile and that support that is
supported through the 12 principles
which guides so scrum is used in
projects where requirements are
constantly changing means I want to
become aile so I adopt scrum so this
definitely has to align to Agile
Manifesto and take the guidelines
whatever is mentioned in 12 principles
of agile Manifesto then looking at
leadership perspective roles perspective
so Manifesto mentions the required
collaboration interactions to become
agile whereas scrum defines the roles
like the scrum Master the product owner
the self-organizing teams which is cross
functional self-organizing team so these
are the main three roles which scrum
defines now generally when we say
projects we come across the role like
project manager so do we see such
project managers in scrum answer is no
because the scrum master who engages
with Team
regularly more than management they
focus on doing facilitating role to the
scrum teams so that things can be
delivered the way it is required and
more flexibility is given to the team to
take the calls to accomplish the results
so scrum Master facilitates whereas the
product owner as I mentioned earlier
looks at the product backlog and
prioritizes and Pro provides what are
the features functionalities needs to be
created in the next iterations So
speaking about flexibility definitely
agile manifestor mentions the required
focus on working software and focusing
on changes so that that's the focus
Direction what it provides so scrum
approaches enables teams to react to
changes quickly the scrum methodology is
made such a way the team understanding
that can able to react and those changes
and modifications are made visible to
the the team so delivery perspective
Manifesto provides necessary guidelines
on frequent delivery of product or
software so scrum with time boxed
iterations called Sprints builds
delivers to the users regularly and
upheld agile principles that is very
important so delivery here is as per the
users requirement as per the customer
requirements because customer when we
want to become a child customer has to
involve very closely stakeholder has to
to collaborate without that you cannot
become
agile so next point is about
collaboration agile Manifesto stresses
on individual interactions and customer
collaborations So based on this if you
look at in the scrum how are they
demonstrating this so there are various
events which happens in scrum so as I
mentioned earlier we have daily standup
meetings and other scrum events like
Sprint retrospective Sprint reviews
daily standup meetings which happens
like Sprint planning which happens
regularly so it it becomes a reason for
collaboration and everyone to discuss
and take the call so question number
five what are the main artifacts of this
Crum process Now product backlog so
which consists of list of new features
changes which are uh looking
organization is looking for uh to bring
into the existing features changes to
the existing features bug fixes changes
to the infrastructure and several other
activities to ensure a particular
outcome so product backlog so then we
can speak about Sprint backlog a subset
of product backlog so the Sprint backlog
contains tasks that the team aims to
complete to satisfy the Sprint's goals
so set of product backlog things are
taken put into Sprint backlog and those
are the features which are supposed to
be produced as a result as part of that
particular Sprint the team first
identifies tasks from the product
backlog that need to be deliv to achieve
a goal so these tasks are then added to
the Sprint backlog so the team first
identifies tasks from product backlog as
per the priorities the list which is
prioritized in the product backlog that
is taken put into Sprint backlog and
then those are delivered so next you can
think about product increment the
product increment is the combination of
all all product backlog tasks completed
in the Sprint and the value of the
increments of previous sprints
the outcome should be in the usable
condition even if the product owner
doesn't decide to release it it is very
important each of the increments which
comes out so needs to fulfill this now
question number six how are the product
and Sprint backlog different from one
another product backlog versus Sprint
backlog let us see few differences so
product backlog is the list of items
that needs to be completed for
developing the product which is the list
of all the features function it
Consolidated one whereas Sprint backlog
is a list of items to be completed
during each Sprint which are taken from
product backlog the backlog when it
comes to product backlog the backlog is
collected from the customer by product
owner and assigned to the team whereas
in Sprint backlog the teams collects the
backlog from the product owner and sets
up the time frame for the
Sprint so product backlog is specific to
end goal ultimate objective whereas
print backlog is specific to that Sprint
specific iteration called Sprint in
scrum what is that we're going to
produce as part of
it product backlog is based on customer
Vision whereas print backlog will vary
based on the product Vision defined by
product owner so priortize list you take
from there product backlog so product
backlog is independent of Sprint backlog
whereas Sprint backlog is dependent on
product backlog reason you we know
already I explained
so this this is the prioritized list of
backlogs we take from product backlog
and create this specific product as part
of Sprint which become Sprint
backlog so product backlog refers to
until the project is complete the
product owner maintains the product
backlog for a Sprint backlog when it
comes to Sprint backlog each new Sprints
as backlogs added by the team as each
prints are initiated so next question
who is the scrum master and what does he
or she do so a scrum Master promotes and
supports the adoption of scrum in the
team scrum Master helps everyone to
understand the theory practices rules
and values in the scrum so scrum Master
is playing the role of facilitation
enablement right so scrum Master ensures
the team follows scrum values principles
and practices removes blockages that may
hamper the progress of the project
protects the team from being
distracted ensuring the team delivers
value during every Sprint so next
question what happens in Daily standup
sessions so daily standup sessions are
the discussion which are done daily that
takes place under usually 15 minutes in
duration the objective is to understand
what went well what tasks are completed
from the last standup session what tasks
are pending and the obstacles the team
was facing
if at all any uh specific task is not
accomplished for certain reasons so what
are stopping them stopping the team to
accomplish that that needs to be made
visible so that separate meeting can be
held to discuss on that and do the
necessary Corrections by taking proper
actions so the objective of this daily
standup meeting is to understand the
overall scope and status of the project
further individual discussion can be
taken up after the daily standup
sessions as I mentioned earlier if at
all if you find something is not
accomplished as per the plan now how do
we ensure that is corrected and why is
it happening is there anything any
support is required by the team to focus
on that so something like that can be
checked on question number nine what is
Scrum ban so scrum ban is a development
methodology that is a combination of
scrum and Canan so this can be used to
meet the needs of the team that aims to
minimize the batching of work and to
adopt a pool based system so kban is
called as pull BAS system so which
actually helps in terms of visualizing
what work is in progress and since it is
a visualized visualized system it is
visible to everyone so it works uh in
terms of making people become conscious
to take that work and get it closed
quickly so it's also called pull system
because work is pulled from the
particular list so and this Conan
approach or methodology or thought is
applied in scrum we call it as scrum B
so combination of this definitely helps
in terms of making that entire Journey
successful and supports the scrum
methodology so scrum B includes the
structure of scrum along with the
flexibility and visualization of kban so
scrum B is used by the teams that need
to be structure of scrum that has the
structure of scrum and the flexibility
of a flow based
method like
Onan so question number 10 what is
Sprint zero and Spike so the term Sprint
zero refers to the short amount of
effort put for creation of vision a
rough skeleton of the product backlog so
now we do this whenever we need to
understand certain things how things
looks like to get certain insights so
this also includes Insight towards
estimating the release of product so to
get some vision would get some clarity
right so this Sprint zero are required
to create project skeleton alongside
research spikes keeping minimal design
develop a small number of stories
completely have low velocity and be
lightweight So speaking about the spike
so spike is set of activities used in
extreme programming I think uh this was
introduced there in extreme Pro
programming that is one of the agel
methodologies so involving research
design investigation making proof of
Concepts Etc so the objective of spike
is to reduce the risk of technical
approach by gaining knowledge which
helps understanding requirements and to
improve reliability so more aware we are
more clarity we have I think putting
step further will become easier so
informed decisions you can take so next
question what is Scrum of
scrums now scrum of scrums is a
terminology used for SK agile techniques
which is required to control and
collaborate with multiple scrum teams so
when will we come across uh the need for
collaborating between multiple scrum
teams so these are the scenarios where
organization as a complex structure
complex in nature where you may require
to handle
them together all of them uh together
for accomplishing the common objective
for business various scrum teams you
would have so scrum of scrum helps in
terms of better collaboration and handle
them easily or better way better control
it is best used in the situations where
teams are working together on complex
assignments just visualizing the system
various different deliverables which are
not a simple deliverables which we can
do with a simple scrum team instead we
have various different deliverables
which needs to be made and Dynamics are
too complex so bigger projects then
scrum of scrum approaches can be taken
so scaling the agile methodology to that
level so it is used to establish the
required transparency collaboration
adaption adoption to the required scale
to ensure the products can be developed
and delivered so whatever the products
are delivered whatever we consider to be
delivered so those needs to focus on the
business objectives which is very
essential so what is user story
mapping so user story map mapping
represents and arranges user stories
that help with understanding the systems
functionalities the systems backlog
planning releases and providing value to
the customers so first of all we write
user stories to understand the required
features functionality in the user
perspective now if you map those user
stories which US the story link to other
user story which functionality links to
the functionality determining that will
become easier
so now user story Maps arranges user
story based on the priority along the
horizontal axis on the vertical axis
they're represented based on increasing
level of
sophistications so this will help in
terms of handling in a regular flow in a
specific flow not regular flow specific
flow so that things can be done in order
with full clarity so question number 13
what happens in Sprint
retrospective so after the the Sprint
review so Sprint completes so Sprint
review happens the Sprint retrospective
is done so during this meeting the
Lessons Learned what went well what
mistakes we did what were the issues so
is there any new way of doing things so
all these are discussed so that these
necessary Corrections can be considered
in the upcoming iterations the Sprints
so data from ear is incorporated when
planning the new Sprint so the learning
what you had you're going to collect it
what went well what went wrong what was
supposed to be the best approach and how
did we approach it is there any other
way of doing it so these are discussed
and very essential to do it at the end
of completion of each of the Sprints
review question number 14 what is
empirical process control in
scrum so empiricism refers to work based
on facts experiences
evidences observations and
experimentation so empirical process
control is established and followed in
scrum ensuring project progress and
project interpretation is based on facts
of observation so actual facts and
figure is very important any decisions
what we make any uh progression what we
make should be always based on on ground
facts and actual pictures we should not
deviate from it so these rely on
transparency observation and adoption
obviously when you're working on the
data on ground reality so you working on
the actual one it is transparent it is
on the obsorb data the mindset of the
team and the shift required in thought
process and culture are very essential
to accomplish the agility required by
organization so mindset of the team is
very
essential and Adoption of process
compliance to the process the culture
the behavior obviously plays a very
important role when you do something
within the organization so that needs to
be done as per the need which should
complement to the business
objectives very important and that
should be based on facts not on some
thoughts or assumptions or ideas so next
question is what are some drawbacks of
using scrum so scrum requires
individuals who have
experience without whom the project
risks will have a risk of failure so one
does not have a
capability difficult scrum request team
to be collaborative and committed so
people collaborating individuals
collaborating itself is a big challenge
in many organizations so bringing this
into the place is very important when
you want to adopt scrum so scrum
requires teams to be collaborative and
committed to ensure the required results
they should work together and also they
should collaborate with customers
stakeholders the less experienced Crum
Master can can cause the failure of the
project so be careful scrum Master is
the one who is facilitator we should
understand this who enable the scrum
teams who ensure scrum teams goals the
way we need them to work if scrum Master
doesn't understand this Dynamics does
not have the clarity on this obviously
the he or she can not enable to team to
become that if tasks are not well
defined the project can have any
inaccuracies scrum works better for
smaller projects and would be difficult
to scale to large complex projects
that's where we were discussing on few
questions before this scrum of scrum we
discussing about when it becomes a
complex project which those needs to be
handled together which will become
complex so next questions what are the
skills of a scrum master so a strong
understanding of scrum and agel concept
scrum Master should have fine-tuned
organizational skills so when scrum
Master is working with self-organizing
team with various different capabilities
so unless the organization skills
interpersonal skills if scrum Master
does not have working with them will
become difficult so scrum Master should
be familiar with technology that the
team uses basic understanding of that
how it works the Dynamics associated
with that and scrum Master should have
an ability to coach and teach the team
to follow scrum and its methodologies
and very clear about the terminologies
artifacts and all the event what happens
so scrum Master should have an ability
to handle conflicts and resolve them
quickly so conflict is a scenario which
would happen for various different
reason however when conflict occurs the
scrum Master should not shy away from it
own it to resolve in the interest of the
project whatever is being done it is
very important scrum master has to be a
servant leader so it is not like I'm a
specific manager or leader of certain
kind and I'm doing this with certain way
no I'm actually facilitating I'm guiding
I'm showing certain direction to the
organization so that so to the team when
I say organization I'm speaking about
scrum team so that they are enabled to
take up the specific project and
accomplish the results accordingly
question number 17 how can Discord be
dealt within the scrum team now the root
cause of the issue need to be identified
and addressed complete ownership needs
to be established when you deal with
this and try to diffuse the
disagreements so emphasizing on the
focus area that complements the project
so here when we take up any of the
discussions any of the opportunities or
any actions what we take everything
should be revolving around objective of
ultimate objective of whatever we are
doing so when we need to resolve
something when we get into the root
causes always it helps to look at the
actions in terms of eliminating those
causes so once the causes are eliminated
it is quite obvious you can able to deal
with it and address it with easily with
the right set of actions so emphasize on
Focus areas that complements the project
in the sense that should be the ultimate
Direction not my individual interest not
that individual interest I favor this
person I favor that person that should
not be the case so favoring the solution
or favoring that solution I'm okay with
this particular technology I'm very
happy with this technology not such
thoughts it is the direction what is set
I should move things in that direction
so to establish a common understanding
and to guide the team to the
Direction performing continuous
monitoring and providing complete
visibility very very important so next
question what is the user story so user
stories are an agile software
development project management tools
it provides the team with simple natural
language explanations of one or more
features written from the end users
perspective now for example I'm a
account holder in a
bank so what is the facility a bank
would give to um account holders there
is ATM banking there is net banking
there is Mobile Banking and there is
over the
counter now when bank is working on
creating certain specific features or
specific mobile app to the account
holders now what are the things user
needs that needs to be visualized now if
I say the role here is account holder as
a account holder I want to download the
statements of every
month as a account holder I want to
download the statements every month this
is what my requirement is how will you
facilitate this this will provide the
Insight
towards how
the bank what are the features and
functionalities and how this
requirements can be fulfilled by the
bank and what features functionality the
particular mobile app should have so
that account holder can download the
statements so user stories will provide
that insights what every users so
account holder is not just an user here
there are many users when it comes to
mobile app of a bank we have uh people
who monitor it manage it who develop it
so they need to have Clarity on what
exactly they need and that needs to be
written as part of user story that what
features functionality can be easily
determined out of
it so user story does not go into detail
it just mentions as I gave an example it
just mentions how a certain type of work
will bring value to the end user the end
user in this case could be an external
end users or even internal customers or
colleagues within the organization so if
I an organization I produce an HR
application I create an HR application
uh for claim processing which I don't
have till today so that is for internal
users in the bank example I'm speaking
about external
customers so user stories also form the
building blocks of agile framework like
epics and
initiatives these help ensure that the
team work to the goals of the
organization through epics and
initiatives so further the requirements
for making the user stories a reality or
added later after discussing with the
team so to write a user story The
involvement of the team members are very
essential they should discuss and come
out and agree yes this is the features
functionality which should be there user
stories are recorded on post it notes
index cards or project management
software whatever is feasible and
whatever is available there next
question how are the user stories epics
and tasks different so user storage
provides the team with simple
explanation of business requirements
create ated from the inducer perspective
as we saw the few examples in the
previous questions epics are the
collection of related user stories
they're usually large and complex so
these epics are created with specific
objectives in mind and user stories are
grouped so that will form an epic
whereas task refers to the one which are
used to track work so they are used to
further broken down from the user
stories so there's a smallest unit in
the scrum used to track work a person or
a team or two people usually work on the
tasks so these tasks or these through
this task I think the features
functionality what are required to be
accomplished are done so question number
20 what is Sprint now as I mentioned
earlier in the question number four so
Sprint is the terminology used in the
scrum I think we explained various
different concepts as we went through so
Sprint is the terminology used in scrum
which refers to time box iterations so
we understood what is this iterations in
scrum approaches when we are going
through that the creation of specific
module or feature which is part of a
product is done during the Sprint the
duration of Sprint varies between a week
or two so means it's a short duration
simple few features functionalities are
taken and created so what is
velocity so velocity is the metric used
in scrum that is a measurement of the
amount of work that is completed by team
during the Sprint so this is helped to
measure how how things are moving how
faster they are moving it refers to the
number of user stories complete in
single Sprint so this speaks about that
speed so or velocity velocity uh how
faster we are going how slower we are
going this helps to vary the variations
we can do in that velocity uh depending
on what business need so what are the
responsibilities of a product
owner so product owner Define the vision
of the
project they anticipate the
needs of the customer and to create
appropriate user stories so they don't
write user stories as such they
definitely have a set of people who
should get involved the team uh to write
the user stories lot of discussion has
to happen brainstorming has to happen to
write user stories but product owner is
accountable so product owner has to
evaluate the progress of the Project
based on this backlog what project
product owner has and has to be liened
for for all product related questions
the team may have certain questions the
Sprints as the Sprint progresses the
scrum team may have certain questions
clarification relating to the user
stories those needs to be
clarified what is burn up and burndown
charts so generally when we say chart it
is a graphical representation so burnup
chart is a tool that is used to track
the amount of work that has been
completed so it is a bar chart the
amount of work completed the the height
of the bars keeps increasing in Burn of
chart based on what is
completed which will show the total
amount of work the need to be done for a
Sprint or a project so it is it is a bar
chart where each of the bars keeps
increasing in its height as number of
things get delivered
increases so burn down charts typically
again a graphical representation a bar
chart so what is pending to be delivered
it show was that now initially you have
a bigger bar and as the project
progresses the height of the bars
reduces indicating what is that is
pending for deliver it is a
representation of how fast the team is
working through the user stories it
helps you to understand that so it shows
total effort against the amount of work
for each
iterations which is helpful for you to
see to that what is spending to complete
question 24 how is estimation in the
scrum project done so for the estimation
of user stories is done based on its
difficulty a particular scale in which
which is used to assess the difficulty
of user stories so you to analyze how
difficult or easy is that some of the
scales which are used like numeric
sizing 1 to 10 t-shirt sizing like SM ml
XL fibos series or dog breeds based on
their value so many such approaches are
taken what are some risks in scrum and
how are they handled so first of all we
should know what is risk so some types
of risk in scrum are related to budget
people
Sprint product knowledge and
capability now when we say budget risk
of uh increase exceeding that allocated
budget taking more looking for more
variations I estimated for X it is going
like X+ Delta X so can we control it you
need to look at that so you to assess
that risk and what possibilities the
cost can escalate people related like
team members need to be of appropriate
skills and capabilities if they lack
that obviously uh difficult it's not
about just skills and capabilities the
culture the behavior the attitude the
energy the Synergy that collaboration
what people will have then Sprint
related in terms of duration and
deliverables exceeding the duration
addition of scope to that Sprint in
between so that challenges that
difficulties so product referring to
user stories and epics having ill
defined user stories and epic not
properly articulated there is no proper
visualization when you look at that user
story not understanding so no nobody's
explaining it
correctly so then U knowledge and
capabilities so it is not just related
to the people here it's a entire system
everyone was who is involved with the
specific resource with its capability it
can be technology capabilities also so
when I say risk it basically involves
identification assessment analysis and
defining risk response plans and
implementing them now when I say assess
assessing the risks should be
qualitative as well as
quantitative so depending on the impact
and probability of a risk if it is a
high impact risk obviously we require to
do both qualitative and quantitative
if a simple one with a very less impact
you can take the call accordingly to
what extent you may require to analyze
and have the response plans for it so
once you have implemented and defined
and implemented the response plans quite
obvious you should keep monitoring it
and manage the risks now risk impacts
and probabilities may vary as the
project progresses so we may require to
keep assessing the identified risk and
keep identifying the new risks as you as
we progress in the project so these are
done on a continual basis right from
starting of the project till completion
the reason I told it is essential to
understand that the impact of the risk
is based on the proximity of actual
occurrence of the risk now for example
if you start uh working on something
nothing is delivered at the at the
moment now if specific risk of PE not
people not available or customer is not
involved initial stage very initial
stage so risk impact is accordingly
project would delay in entirety or
requirements not very clear it is
delaying something of that sort of
impact you will have now as the project
progresses almost like 50% of the
project complete now the there is some
uh challenges or risk associated with
issues are occurring related to
customers involvement now your mid of
project so again you will have a
different kind of impact 50% is
delivered now you need to progress
because active involvement of Stak
holders including customer is very
important when you are becoming aile so
when that is not happening as an example
I'm taking the involvement of customers
the collaboration part of it if that is
not happening now here the impact level
is not equal to the impact level when
you when this happens in the starting of
the project same type of risk what we
are assessing so that is the reason each
of the risks you should keep
assessing the identified one keep
assessing as the project progresses and
check on is there new risk is introduced
as the project is
progressing so next question what are
some popular tools used in scrum so
these are the list so we can think of
Gab Zoho Trello jira software yix where
is version one so now what I'm saying is
these are the tools technology tools so
when we say tools we cannot just limit
our thought to technology tools so what
exactly this tool does what are are the
techniques used that we need to be very
clear right the metrics what is measured
and methodology of measuring it and what
processes are used what steps are used
so what needs to be used so unless we
are clear relating to specific type of
project usage of these tools may not
make any sense you cannot even implement
or customize this for the requirement
what you are trying to accomplish so you
be clear about it when you're selecting
the tool so 27 how does Crum Master
Tracks Sprint
progress so we have various different
events which happens in scrum like daily
scrum meetings scrum retrospective scrum
planning scrum
review and checking on the defects which
are escaped density of the
defects burn down uh Sprint burn down
velocity so so checking all of this uh
provides the better insight to scrum
master so that tracking the progress of
the Sprint will be become
easier so how to deal with the scope
creep now before we understand the
dealing with scope creep we need to
understand what is scope creep so the
term scope creep refers to the change
which is uncontrolled and added without
checking the impact on the constraints
like scope time cost now what happens is
you will be uh doing certain or
delivering certain
features now you are forced or you are
influenced or without your knowledge
some additional things are put in place
so which may impact later it may add
value it may not add value later doesn't
matter but it may lead in terms of uh
impact your cost time and uh schedules
which is
unexplained and uh that extra effort
what you have put in extra cost what you
have put in uh will become like uh not
recognized by customers and you will not
get anything paid for it so scope to
avoid the scope creep to deal with it
one has to ensure close monitoring of
Works being done on day-to-day basis
because scope creep can happen through
team members influencing team members
are influenced by consumer because of
that it may happen so understanding
communicating the vision to the team for
ensuring the alignment so that team is
very sensitive about that changes what
is happening then capturing reviewing
the project requirements regularly
against what is delivered to emphasize
to the team and customer about the
requirement signed off so that someone
will not come
and uh influence you or uh make that
additional things to be delivered they
need not push you right ensuring any
change introduced to go through change
control so no changes without any proper
approval by the authorities so that only
those what is required to be implemented
is implemented and that is done formally
through the formal change request so
avoiding gold plating so it is bit
different thought process when we say
gold plating so we were doing the
projects are trying to add certain
things into the scope to please the
customer as an example doing something
additional providing some additional
features and functionality for which we
are not paid so scrope creep is not a
terminology used for it but gold plating
is the term used but however since it is
an additional scoping so we just added
here so don't say that when the moment
scope creep we says that is not gold
plating gold plating is a different
direction so just to explain you along
with scope creep what else would happen
to where the additional uh deliverables
would come in which is gold plating so
question 29 what is MVP and MMP which
means minimum viable product and minimal
marketing product so now minimum viable
product is a concept of Lean Startup
which stresses upon the impact of
learning while performing product
development so this allows one to test
and understand the idea by getting
exposed to the initial version of the
product for Target customers and users
so to accomplish this one has to collect
all the required relevant data and learn
from the collected data so the thought
behind MVP is to produce a product to
provide access to the users and to
observe how the product is used
perceived and understood this will also
provide more insight towards what the
customers or users needs
are so when it comes to minimal
marketable product this refers to the
description of the product which will
have a minimal number of features that
addresses the requirements of the users
MMP would help also the organization
reduce the time to Market because you
have the clarity what is that we may
require to provide the question number
30 what does DOD means definition of
done right so DOD refers to the
collection of deliverables which
includes written codes comments on
coding unit tests integration testing
design documents release notes Etc this
would add variable and demonstratable
values to the project development so D
is very helpful to scrum while
identifying the deliverables to achieve
the objectives of project for the stated
reason Above So defining the steps
required to deliver the iterations the
usage of appropriate tool like burndown
to make the proc is more effective
ensuring ontime feedback throughout the
Project Life Cycle ensuring the walkth
through of the product backlog items are
done and understood correctly so then
creation of checklist for product
backlog item ensuring the dood is
defined to become task oriented
involving the product owner for
reviewing during the Sprint and Sprint
retrospective that is about DOD the next
question how can a scrum Master be a
servant leader so very important thing
to understand so what is the meaning of
the servant leader the term servant
leader mainly stresses on service
orientation which a leader should
demonstrate so today we say every
organization is service organization
even an organization who is producing
card if there is no service
orientation they cannot sell so more
stresses on being service orientation
the scrum Master needs to be facilitator
a guide a mentor Etc this helps the team
have increased involvement and
empowerment so now question number 32
how can one coordinate between multiple
teams so one of the most common
approaches for this is Scrum of scrums
meeting so where members representing
each scrum team discusses the progress
performance issues risk Etc together
this is complex structure what you're
speaking
about the frequency of these meetings
must be predefined well articulated well
defined
generally scrum Master would represent
the particular scrum team on behalf of
that scrum team they would go and
represent the meeting representing the
meeting besides having a chief scrum
Master whose responsible is coordination
and collaboration among all scrums who
facilitates these meetings have a look
at certified scrum Master CSM
certification training course some key
features of this course include two days
online virtual classes twoyear
membership with scrum Alliance 20 pdus
and 16 scus includes CSM exam fees as
well by the end of this course you will
be skilled with scrum and agile
methodologies importance of agile scrum
life cycle scrum terminologies daily
scrum and review roles involved in scrum
and distributed scrum so hurry up and
enroll now one year of experience is
preferred to enroll into this course so
hurry up and enroll Now find the cost
Link in the description box so explain a
in brief if this is the question what
would be the typical answer so the term
agile refers to ability to move quickly
and easily by becoming more flexible and
adaptable so most of the times I have
seen people say whenever I ask the
question what is agile they say agile is
a methodology the term agile itself is
not a methodology it actually refers to
this flexibility adaptability so all
those methodologies which are there
defined for agile for example scrum so
they have have an approach towards to
become agile and do the projects in
agile way so this requires adoption and
Adoption of continual changing scenarios
in modern dynamic business environment
which means the flexibility and
adaptability is required because of the
changing business environment the
Dynamics to quickly adopt to the change
to become flexible agile approaches are
required it is very essential for
organization to become agile for their
sustenance and growth there are various
agile methods and practices that focuses
on iterative development typically any
agile methodologies follows iterative
approaches requirements and solutions
are obtained through self-organizing
cross functional teams collaborating so
collaboration is very important any of
the agel methodologies we come across we
speak about cross functional
self-organizing teams so this is the
basic details one should know when they
hear the term agile so question number
two explain the difference between a
traditional waterfall model and agile
testing so when we say agile and
waterfall it has two different Dynamics
all together so agile model is a
continuous iteration life cycle model
for developing and testing software
whereas waterfall is linear sequential
life cycle model for developing and
testing the
software so similarly the rigidity so
agile methodologies is flexible way of
building a software which provides lot
of flexibility Whenever there is a
change adopting to the change will
become very easy adapting and adopting
for the change scenario whereas in
waterfall methodology it is bit
difficult it is rigid because it's very
much structured any changes which comes
in adopting that and changing things to
according to the change Dynamics
requires changing many things which
makes it very tedious and rigid so
thirdly collaboration so agile model is
highly collaborative that's what it
approach considers mainly towards
software development where involvement
all the members involvement of all the
members like customers uh uh maybe the
team members the project managers so
their active involvement is very much
required so that things can be handled
better so whereas waterfall model
generally don't insist on that so it is
least flexible and follow sequence of
steps which are predefine and that
doesn't allow the team to collaborate
even the collaboration happens it will
have a limit ation because everything is
defined and one has to follow it and
comply to it there is no opportunity or
options to change anything so easily
when it comes to Waterfall model then
processes the entire process of
development is divided into iterations
which are of short period so that in
each of these iterations the working
model working piece of that product will
come out so in waterfall approach the
software development process is broken
down into several phases sequential
phase linear phases so things which has
to be delivered in each of the phases
are very well defined and accordingly it
happens so
changes changes may be made even after
the initial planning is completed in
agile approaches or in agile whenever
whoever follow agile it is easy to adopt
to that change scenario whereas in
waterfall approaches development
requirements cannot be changed once the
project development begins it will
become difficult because everything is
defined in a comprehensive way detailed
so that small changes may impact other
parts of the the products or
descriptions which is defined so
software development is a collection of
many different projects which can happen
in agile whereas waterfall software
development is completed as a single
project or deliverable so testing
testing is performed in same iterations
as programming or building so within
that iterations since we build the
working product all the testing will be
done within that so that one would be
fully informed about that product which
is is being developed in the dations so
that users can give the feedback quickly
whereas testing phase is
separate in waterfall approaches but
however testing can be built in parallel
in waterfall also if it is planned that
way but still it does not give that
flexibility as it is there in the agile
because the product will not be
available to the users to give their
feedback so that necessary Corrections
cannot be made so whatever testing
reveals in waterfall methodologies the
corrections will be done by the team
limiting to their understanding whereas
in agile since users are very closely
involved working model is ready so the
feedback is straight from the users in
their perspective so that Corrections
can be made and ultimate product will be
very much useful to the people who are
going to use that product ultimately so
question number three what are some
important parts of agile
process so here are some of the
important principles that need to be
followed to make a process of agile so
one is customer satisfaction so very
much important one has to ensure
customer is satisfied customer sees the
product gives the feedback the uses it
gives the feedback necessary Corrections
are made in time so that quick delivery
of the product can be made according to
the requirement of the customers which
would result in high customer
satisfaction then changing needs so
agile welcome changes so any changing
needs will be addressed even late in the
development processes in the entire life
cycle of the project wherever the change
comes in taking that changes making that
necessary changes will be easier when it
comes to Agile delivery frequently so
ensuring software is delivered
frequently focusing on shorter time
scales which is very well uh understood
the full clarity of the product and the
working piece of the product will come
out of the iterations so as I mentioned
earlier as well quick feedback from the
users will also obtain so that products
which are delivered will be as per the
customer requirement so agile approaches
helps that way work together so agile
Manifesto emphasizes on working together
collaboration so that each one of them
contributes so developers and business
individuals has to work together through
the course of the project so that
necessary outcome can be
created so motivated team so projects
need to be built around motivated
individuals and they must be trusted to
get the job done so as I mentioned in
the previous Point collaboration is very
important so we cannot ignore team as
well who is actually actively involved
in creation of those products so they
should be motivated and their active
involvement is very much required face
Toof face conversation is most efficient
means of communication so since theel
methodologies whatever is defined
actually emphasizes on having the face
Toof face conversation collaborating
better uh contrib in proactively and
involvement proactively is very
essential so conversation communication
plays a very important role so working
software working software is a primary
measure of progress which will be
delivered in each of the iterations so
that users can give the necessary
feedbacks so constant piece agile
process promotes sustainable development
because all the products which are being
developed used feedback obtained are in
real time so people actually know what
is being produced
and what is that they can expect as it
progresses so Clarity is also one of the
things and that pace has to be
maintained and agile approaches helps to
accomplish it so good design agility can
be improved by focusing on technical
excellence and good design as you
progress as the changes comes in as you
adapt and adopt so since it has the
flexibility technically as well as
process wise as well as any of the
configuration wise it is easy to do the
necessary changes and have the design
which is required to accomplish the
ultimate results Simplicity the amount
of work that's not being done needs to
be minimized so we say Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication means what is
that required to be done consider only
that not anything else above or below
that so whatever we may require to do
focusing on that the minimum thing what
need to be done will be done and has to
be done when one follows AEL
approach self-organized the team is
self-organized so self-organized teams
provides best architectures requirements
and design because they having various
different capabilities come together
contribute together with their
capability with a different capability
multi skilled as well will be present in
the self-organized team reflect and
adjust Effectiveness can be improved by
the team regularly reflecting on it
because as I mentioned earlier in every
iterations there are feedback obtained
testing is is being done in each of the
iterations as it progresses so this will
help us in uh terms of providing the
Insight towards how is it progressing so
that will help in quickly doing the
necessary Corrections which are required
to be done so next uh question number
four explain iterative and incremental
development in aart so incremental
development when we say the process is
divided into many small workable
increments so which can be done one
after the other each each successive
increment Builds on the top of the work
done in the previous
increments over time functionalities are
added based on what was already created
so iterative development involves the
development of system by following
repeated Cycles or iterations based on
the results from the most recent
iterations of the process changes are
made this helps the project evolve over
time so the term evolve is the one which
one should keep in mind it is not that
I'm just going that is my
destination yes definitely that is a
destination while progressing there are
lot of variations which happens those
variations has to be considered and
accordingly the necessary deviations or
Corrections adjustments has to made and
things to be progressed further which is
very important because of this iterative
approach it helps to become adaptable
and flexible to adjust to these varying
conditions so that's where project
should evolve it cannot go in a straight
Lane it has to evolve based on the VAR
ation while progressing towards the
destination or the results what we are
supposed to accomplish so agile
definitely iterative plus incremental so
agile involves consideration and
creation of working product in an
iterations which is part of the overall
final products the consolidation of all
the products which are produced in each
of the iterations will become part of
the ultimate results ultimate product
each iteration is an enhanced working
increment of the final product this
process continues until all the products
functionalities are satisfied so
organizations and user can use and
experience the product and provide
feedback that can be incorporated into
next iterations so each iterations when
the working product is produced those
things are used by the users
experience uh they will look at the
features and functionality and based on
the requirement what they're supposed to
fulfill they may also give the feedback
for necessary Corrections or they add
new requirement to it because the
minimum requirements what is being
fulfilled by this product maybe some
requirements which are not expressed
earlier there is an opportunity to
express at this point in time to State
we can involve some of the features of
these kind in the next iterations so
that we can able to make this product
better so such kind such a conversation
the incremental iterative approach helps
or allows or provides that opportunity
to express so causing product road maps
to be built produced tested and
confirmed before the next iterations so
that's where before we move to next
iterations there will be better Clarity
in terms of what is produced what we are
supposed to produce further and what is
that modification we supposed to do so
that product can ultimately fulfill the
requirements so question number five
what are the different types of agile
methodologies so there are various kinds
of agile methodologies some of them are
brief here so let us go through them one
by one extreme programming so it is a
framework that enables team to create
high quality software and improves their
quality of life it enables software
development with appropriate engineering
practices so next is
Canan this method is used to design
manage and improve the flow of systems
organizations can visualize their flow
of work limiting their work in progress
so basically Canan comes from the Toyota
system so here when we use the term
workflow the work in progress so this
will help in terms of monitoring what is
happening what work is in progress what
work is completed and it uses a
visualized system so one can see it what
is happening so it also enables the
individuals who are doing it to know
what is that pending against them and
they can pick it up pull it up and then
complete it lean lean is a set of tools
and principles that aims to identify and
remove waste to increase the speed of
process development it focuses on
maximizing value of to the client
ensuring waste is minimized so lean uh
principes Le approaches says the flow in
a flow if there is any bottleneck that
needs to be removed so this bottleneck
would limit the flow and that would add
towards the waste so identification of
the waste the the reason for that
creation of the waste or who is the
contributor of the waste and eliminating
those causes and moving forward this
will help in smoothening the flow at the
same time improving the system for
better outcome so that's where Lan is
become popular and well acknowledged so
scrum is a framework that is used by
teams to establish a hypothesis try out
reflect on experience and adjustments it
is used to enable teams to incorporate
practices from other Frameworks
depending on the team's requirement so
that's about scrum scrum is bit popular
and it is mostly used for smaller
projects the bigger the project more
complex I think scrum would not help but
scrum is very popular uh in software
development organizations so where uh it
has a simple U five events three roles
and uh three artifacts so it helps uh to
adopt and uh adapt to the changing
conditions and it has become a proven
practice now crystal crystal is an
approach to software development that
focuses on people and their interactions
rather than tools and processes it is
aimed to streamline processes and
improve optimization it works on
principle that projects are unique and
dynamic so next question what are the
principles of agile testing so testing
continuous ly to ensure the product
improves continuously so as we know when
we progress when we adopt when we follow
agile approaches there is a reason
because we need to Able we should be
able to respond to that changes quickly
we should be able to understand what is
going right what is not quickly and do
the necessary correction then and there
itself so testing continuously become
very important because as we develop as
we test we can reveal any any of the
issues any of the defects in the product
what we develop so that it reveals so
obtain feedback continuously to ensure
the product meets business requirements
so looking at the performance does this
features functionality of the product is
helpful to accomplish that business
requirement so this feedback comes from
the customers and users when we produce
that working piece of the uh product so
all team roles testing development Etc
need to be involved in testing process
so one cannot work in isolation there
should be very uh good collaboration
people from various different teams
working together complimenting to each
other very essential to become a j so
the active involvement of business teams
and representatives can provide quick
feedback for each iterations so clean
and simplified code ensures it is defect
free during
iterations the documentation created
must be limited into a particular
iterations so when we speak about
waterfall approach the documentation
will be very comprehensive for the
entire project
but the moment we speak about agile the
documentation will get limited to what
is being produced in the iterations
which is very important so what is being
produced in iterations and that is based
on the actually what is produced
something I planned in for the
iterations some changes happen we
developed it created it there is a
feedback which is coming up
documentation is limited to that so
Corrections which can be made to the
documentation will be easier and quicker
so along with development and
implementation testing is done to ensure
the product is defect free continuous
involvement of users ensures the final
product matches their requirement which
is Ultimate uh need so question number
seven what are some agile metrics that
need to be focused
on so some of the popular metrics which
are used are measuring burndown of
deliverables which is usually
represented using burndown charts
similarly we have burnup chart also
where as we complete the task the height
of the bar keeps increasing in burnup
charts but most popular is burn down so
that what is to be delivered will be
easily visible so the velocity lead time
cycle time code
quality code covered in unit
test deployment success rate net promote
score so these are the basic metrics
which are really needed when we are
speaking about the velocity and speed at
the same time how quickly we are able to
produce what is supposed to be done and
planned are we going accordingly or not
so this will help in terms of uh making
our job as per the need so metrics has
to be selected very carefully so metrics
is not just a number it should have an
interpretation and that interpretation
should actually complement to the
business needs and requirements so
metrics should have and clear
description of what is this measurement
is all about and what is that we're
going to understand from that measuring
that Matrix so next is what is Canan so
Canan system is visual system which
helps better management of work as work
moves through processes so it is it
visualizes and provides visibility into
the process workflows and works passing
through the processes So when you say is
a v it is a visual system so there will
be board or a display system where each
of the tasks which needs to be
accomplished are displayed there and the
person who is who supposed to complete
it and what is the status of it so
people would look at it pull the work
and complete it so since people pull
that work it is also called as pull
system so because the new works are
pulled in taken up from the list for
execution and move them from in progress
status to done so Conan since it is a
visual system it also makes people more
conscious about what is spending against
them what work is pulled that is also
visible so there there is no reason for
anyone to say that I did not do this
because of XYZ reasons since it is
visible it is my job since I pull that
task it is my job my ownership to
completed it becomes like that so that
discipline comes into place so tracking
the work will also become easier as the
workflow is clearly visible and put on
the display board modern organization
can also use the digital display system
systems we're seeing this more adoption
in many many organizations today because
it the value of using it the
contribution of it is seen by
organization and Canan playing it roles
in the organization and it's very
essential to have this practice so the
goal is identification of constraints
that is potential bottleneck in the
process and ensure they are addressed
this ensures that the workflow becomes
smoother and more efficient I think I
mentioned the reasons question number
nine what are some popular agile tools
so some of the tools which we keep
hearing uh today when whenever uh people
say we do Agile is uh some of these are
listed here like jitb jira software
Trello Zoho codic verizone one and many
more I think uh before we choose a tool
it is very important for anyone to
understand what is that they require
first and what tool can help them in
terms of accomplishing it so it requires
a lot of uh uh analysis uh assessment on
the tools and the comparison with what
is being done in the organization and
how this tool would suit that
organization's requirement is very
essential so tool is not first the
requirements the need analysis and then
what tools best suit the environment
that is the step only then selecting the
tool makes sense however studying the
tools and comparing the tools and the
features functionality will also help
defining uh what needs to be there in
place in the organization when they
become agile or adopt and adopt set
practices what are the obstacles to the
agile
process so some of the obstacles that
one could face are not having the
appropriate or sufficient tools and
Technologies so it is quite obvious
organization struggle not having the
right tools and Technologies as I
mentioned earlier it is very important
to understand what what is our need
first and what tools suits best at the
same time I also mentioned study the
tools and Technologies and what do they
offer and what do we have do we really
need that additional things the Gap
whatever we find do we really need those
in our environment is that Dynamics is
there in our environment that needs to
be
understood the lack of active
involvement from the customer so when we
say agile involvment of all the
stakeholders are very very important
because the changing needs comes from
users and customers whenever the
iteration is complete working piece is
delivered if customer doesn't respond or
explain or provide the feedback then
moving towards the next iterations will
become difficult it is very essential
the active involvement of the
stakeholders and very important
stakeholders is users and
customers the team members lacking in
skills and capability so one has to
ensure the team members are groomed with
the right capability and that should be
evaluated on a continual basis so that
organization can handle things in an
agile way and contribute towards the
projects what is being done and become
agile some of the obstacles further if
you can look at is the inability to
design system based on unseen
requirements so this unseen requirement
is very Dynamic so when they will crop
up we will not know but however the
systems what we design should able to
provide that uh opportunity whenever
such variations happens you can able
easily adopt or invol or take that
particular new requirement and plug in
so otherwise one cannot become so rigid
there should be flexibility adapting the
agile culture to the organization so
culture plays an very important role so
a lot of resistance would come across to
adopt the new way of doing things people
may not appreciate uh the agile way of
doing things so it requires a lot of uh
effort motivation and uh making people
to understand why the organization has
taken up the task to make it agile and
building a culture where people would
think in agile way and contribute to the
organization question number 11
differentiate between agile and scrum so
the term agile as I mentioned earlier
refers to ability to move quickly and
easily by becoming more flexible and
adoptable whereas scrum is an agile
methodology which enables organization
so organization can become agile so
agile Manifesto and 12 principles acts
as guidelines to become agile whereas
scrum is used in the projects where
requirements are constantly changing
aligning to Agile Manifesto and 12
principles they should follow what is
told in Manifesto and principles so
agile Manifesto mentions about the
required collaboration interactions to
become aile whereas scrum defines the
roles the scrum Master the product toner
and cross functional self organizing
teams who are involved in making the
project delivering the project in agile
way so agile Manifesto also mentions
about the required focus on working
software and focus on change whereas a
scrum approach enables teams to react to
changes quickly so means how to become
flexible what is that we need to
consider to become flexible is defined
in Manifesto means stress on it whereas
scrum follows with that approach one can
become easily flexible so delivery the
manifestor provides necessary guidelines
on frequent delivery of software so
where scrum with the Sprints it build
builds are delivered to users regularly
and upheld agile principles so
collaboration agile Manifesto stresses
upon individuals interactions and
customer collaboration so scrum does it
through various events like daily stand
up meeting and other scrum events like
Sprint meeting Sprint retrospective
whereas people sitting and discussing
about writing an user story The epics or
selecting the product uh from the
product backlog to the Sprint backlog so
various events which happens in scrum
demonstrating that uh point which is
stressed in agile Manifesto about
individuals interactions and customer
collaboration by are demonstrated with
various different events in scrum
methodology so next question what are
some popular agile
certifications so some of the popular
agile certifications are PMI ACP
certification which is offered by PMI us
scrum Master
certification then certified scrum
Master prints to Agile
certification then scrum product owner
certification so next we will move to a
scenario based questions so before we uh
go and answer the scenario based
questions let us look at the scenario
what what the scenario says the manager
X was having the discussion with the
team about the upcoming event the event
was scheduled to conduct a online
marketing campaign to increase the sales
due to increased competition and rapidly
changing customer
behaviors the campaign is very crucial
and organization has decided to do it
more
often this is done through the online
platform the organization has the
requirement of integration with
organizations website with all the
features and
functionalities the various roles
involved in the marketing campaign are
marketing manager marketing team
campaign coordinators creators of
content and browers for campaign and the
participants of the campaign all of
these roles should have access to
platform through registration so that
they can have the required access and
make the marketing campaign successful
besides marketing manager has stole the
reports needs to be generated which
depicts the number of campaigns
conducted responses registrations
conversations Etc so this scenario
speaking about uh the marketing uh
challenges or problems what organization
has and through that problem statement
they wanted to ensure to the marketing
campaign and also they want to have an
online platform uh to to make this uh
marketing campaign successful and also
speaks about the various different roles
involved in this so let us look at what
are the typical questions which would
come across in such
scenarios so first question says can you
write a user story from the perspective
of marketing manager and participant so
firstly we need to understand what is
this user story is All About so in the
perspective of marketing manager is
something anyway we will look at it what
it is but user story is the one which
depicts the
requirements assuming the role as a
specific role I need to do this I want
to have this it it gives that an
explanation so that one can easily
understand about that requirement what
need of consumers or what need of
business this particular features
functionality is going to fulfill so let
us say what is that user story uh
relating to marketing manager and uh
participants so yes why not here are few
examples marketing manager us a story
says as a marketing manager I need to
assign the activities Tas to the team
members so now whenever we develop that
platform there should be an access to
marketing manager and marketing manager
can able to assign the activities to the
team members so what feature that
particular platform should have has to
be defined and designed accordingly and
this is the requirement the participant
perspective as a participant I need to
register for the campaign so now there
should be registration page obviously
and then whatever the process needs to
be follow to create that uh registration
for the participant that needs to be
made and this simple us of story helps
into to visualize what features
functionality has to be there when we go
and create that product and
services so this will help understanding
the requirement thoroughly and creating
the designing the features accordingly
and visualizing the flow as well so next
question is agile the best approach to
make a marketing campaign and why so now
question arises should when we do
marketing campaign why should I follow
agile why not I do just like that why do
we need agile what is that essential
need because already I mentioned the
need of agility uh requires I mean
whenever there is an adaptability
whenever there's dynamics of changes
whenever I want to become uh someone who
can able to become competitive because
competition is also responding to the
Dynamics of the market quickly I should
be there in that business so obviously
uh does uh this question make sense the
can this marketing campaign can be done
in the agile way so obviously yes
because the agile approach is the best
way to go with for marketing campaign
reason being the rapidly changing uh
behaviors of the consumers which has to
be understood and detail should be put
in their perspective and accordingly the
features has to be provided so always in
the consumer perspective customer
perspective secondly with increased
competition the organization has to
consider the unique differentiator to
sustain and grow there should be
uniqueness that needs to be understood
and that requires exercising
continuously and uh creating the
products accordingly so this marketing
campaign would help to understand that
so next question what are the typical
product backlog items so for this what
could be the typical backlog items means
the list of user stories list of epics
which can help in terms of defining the
features and
functionality the typical backlog items
may include the features like
registration page login page campaign
contains platform to conduct campaign
assess requirements so likewise we can
keep writing so user stories helps us to
list what is that we may require to
develop in this product so this requires
a lot of collaboration and discussion
only then I think uh that will become
more visible next question is what are
the some considerations made while
selecting the items for product backlog
while selecting the backlog item to each
iterations from the backlog the backlog
item has to be prioritized definition of
done for those items to be selected
value delivered Improvement
considerations Etc has to be made so
prioritization is very very important
what features functionality I should
develop first and how it makes sense to
my business how users will be helped how
customer will get benefited so these
will help in terms of having those
features functionality developed in such
an order where for that moment that
features and functionality are available
we're not just jumping into everything
and doing it one by one in a order in a
prioritized list so it is very essential
to prioritize defining uh the definition
of done and selecting the items
accordingly and then what value it
delivers understanding that and
improving next question is the
involvement of marketing manager
required during the project and why it's
quite obvious marketing manager
involvement is very essential because it
is a marketing campaign yes the
involvement of marketing manager is very
important and crucial and it is a role
who will have the full visibility into
the requirements to be fulfilled and on
ground realities besides one cannot
become agile without the active
involvement and collaboration of
customer users with agile teams so here
we come to the end of this full course
