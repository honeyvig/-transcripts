hey everyone I'm sure you're all aware
that every application that we use today
has something called the front end which
is the user interface and the back end
which is the software that accesses data
for us and finally we have the database
to store the data now these three
together form something called as the
full stack so hi guys welcome to this
video on what is full stack by simply LA
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update so
here's what's in store for you first
we'll have a look at what front end
development is then we'll see some of
the front end
languages then we'll move on to some
front end libraries and
Frameworks then we'll see what backend
development is understand some of the
popularly used backend languages and
Frameworks and finally we'll have a look
at the database so now what exactly is
front end every time you open a website
it has several UI components and once
you click on a particular icon say sign
in in this case you get navigated to the
signin or the login page right so what
happens is that all of these items
facilitate navigation and
utility these are colle collectively
called as the front end so the front end
is the visible part of the website or
the web application which is responsible
for user experience the user directly
interacts with the front end portion of
the website or the web
application so now let's have a look at
some of the front end languages so I'm
sure you've heard of HTML CSS and
JavaScript so these are collectively
called the front-end languages when it
comes to HTML it defines the structure
of websites and formats the web pages it
also defines text documentation so let's
look at a simple example so here I've
made use of the H1 tag which is the
heading tag in HTML and I've displayed
the message hello welcome so
correspondingly my website displays the
same message so HTML is responsible or
it defines what is being shown on the
website next up is CSS now CSS is a
stylesheet that allows you to alter and
style different in web components beat
size font spacing Etc it makes the
content on the website look more
decorative correct so now if you have a
look at the code here I've added some
styling I've changed the font style to
italic I've made the text bold and I've
changed the color to red and again
correspondingly all the changes are seen
on the
website moving on we have JavaScript now
JavaScript is a very powerful client
size scripting language and it is mainly
used for enhancing the interaction of a
user with the web page so again if you
have a look at the code here I've
created a form wherein the user can
enter their name and I've also displayed
the message please enter your name as a
result and input box is made available
where the user can type in their name
now this is facilitated by JavaScript so
as I mentioned earlier it is used to
make web pages interactive and bring the
web applications to life so next let's
have have a look at some front end
Frameworks and libraries now most of
these are JavaScript Frameworks and
libraries first we have react then
there's angular there's view there's
jQuery and then there's bootstrap now
all of these help develop the front end
of the application however when it comes
to react angular in view it's not
necessary that you must know everything
to create a website one of them will be
sufficient however the usage of react is
on the rise and most of the developers
prefer using react jQuery and bootstrap
are also powerful Frameworks that can be
used to create interactive web pages now
that you know what front-end development
is you must be wondering how the data is
being fetched and how this data is being
presented in front of you on your screen
correct now this is all facilitated by
the back end of the application so let's
understand what backend development
is now backend basically refers to the
server side development of the
application it is responsible for
managing all the database with the help
of queries and apis so every time the
user makes a request it queries the
database and retrieves the data from the
database and presents it to the user and
lastly it ensures data
consistency so now let's have a look at
some backend languages and
Frameworks firstly we have node node and
expressjs are packages provided by Java
script then there's python which is a
very popularly used language python
Frameworks like Django and flask are
popularly used to create the back end of
applications then there's Java and Java
provides spring and Java server faces
which are also used for backend
development then there's cop which
provides Frameworks like asp.net core
and asp.net MVC and other popularly used
backend languages are PHP that's Pearl
and Ruby database is the collection of
interrelated data which helps an
efficient retrieval insertion and
deletion of data from database and
organizes the data in the form of tables
views schemas reports now some of the
commonly used database Management
systems are MySQL there's postra SQL
there's Microsoft SQL Server there's
Oracle database and then there's mongodb
but how can we at simply learn help you
if you wish wish to make a career as a
full stack developer then a
certification will come in handy for
that you could head to our official
website and look for fullstack
development courses now we offer the

lives easier to cope with the changing
demands with respect to user experience
in security web development needs to
take a robust and efficient approach
this video tells you what the future of
web development will look
like so let's begin by understanding
what web development is a web
development involves building and
maintaining website and other web
applications a web developer is expected
to convert a web design into a website
they're responsible for how a website or
web application looks and function ions
from its user interface and page layout
to backend systems for Gathering
data so a lot goes into building a
website there are several tools
Frameworks and packages that help create
web
applications HTML CSS JavaScript are the
basic languages required to develop a
website JavaScript offers several
Frameworks and libraries like react
angular and view JavaScript and
environment like nodejs and
expressjs node is an open-source
crossplatform runtime environment that
allows developers to create server side
tools and JavaScript applications
knowledge of the basic command line like
npm node package manager is
essential but I'm sure you're aware of
all this so what's going to be new well
according to experts there are four
major future Trends in web development
so let's start and decode them one by
one first up is
typescript typescript is a superet of
JavaScript and is an objectoriented
programming language in simple terms it
is just JavaScript with other impressive
additional features typescript supports
all JavaScript libraries and Frameworks
within increase in code complexity
JavaScript had to fulfill the
requirements of oop hence that lead to
the introduction of
typescript typescript helps with quicker
code development thus improving
performance there are a few improvements
with typescript that give it an upper
hand over
JavaScript only at the time of
development does typescript bring out
compilation issues this reduces the
chances of mistakes occurring at
runtime a property of typescript is that
it is strongly typed or enabled static
typing static typing allows type
correctness to be checked at compilation
time in JavaScript this isn't
possible typescript is nothing but
JavaScript and some additional features
I.E es6 features some of these features
are interfaces generics name spaces null
checking and access
modifiers typescript supports
intelligence which provides active hints
at as the code is added so considering
all these advantages typescript is
something that will be widely adopted by
teams across the
globe next up is web assembly web
assembly is a new way to run on the web
web assembly or WM is the second
Universal programming language that all
web browsers can understand and run
however you're not going to be writing
scripts in web assembly yourself it's a
low-level Assembly Language designed to
be very close to compil machine code and
very close to Native
performance what this means is practice
is that JavaScript is no longer the only
language you can run on the web web
browsers can run any language now if
that language has a web assembly
compiler even traditional desktop
languages like C++ and rust can be
compiled down to W ASM with relative
ease WM currently runs in 94% of users
browsers with ie UC Browser and Oprah
mini sport being the main things holding
it back as per usual however it's backed
by developers from Mozilla Microsoft
Google and apple and support in modern
browsers is fast
moving next up we have package
managers packages a package manager a
package management system is a
collection of software tools that
automates the process of installing
upgrading configuring and removing
software packages for a computer's
operating system in a consistent
manner it typically maintains a database
of software dependencies and version
information to prevent software
mismatches and missing
prerequisites npm is the package manager
for the node JavaScript platform it puts
modules in place so that not can find
them and manager dependency conflicts
intelligently it is extremely
configurable to support a wide variety
of use
cases Yann is another package manager
that replaces the existing workflow for
the npm client or other package managers
while remaining compatible with the npm
registry it has the same feature said as
exciting
workflows while operating faster more
securely and more
reliably lastly we have JavaScript
dialects compiler to JavaScript there
are many JavaScript dialects like coffee
script dot Babel typ scrip and spel that
offers better features that JavaScript
and ultimately compile to JavaScript it
is likely that these languages will be
the
future there are several other
predictions like better appreciation for
web stand
less client works and more focus on
personal projects and the need to know
more languages regardless the future of
web development looks more promising
than ever if you wish to make a career
as a web developer start now so where do
you think the future of web development
is headed let us know in the comments
