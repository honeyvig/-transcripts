1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,940
so Lumiere and welcome to another

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,400
tutorial my name is Tammy Bakshi and

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,730
today I'm joined by Scott D'Angelo thank

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,340
you very much Scott for joining in today

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,179
really glad to have you on the show

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,080
would you like to quickly introduce

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,859
yourself

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,410
yeah I'm Scott D'Angelo I work for IBM

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,519
as a developer and I produce code

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,910
patterns that's great so just in case

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,769
you were actually watching around last

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,960
week I published a video with retire T

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,630
he's also a part of your team code

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,280
patterns of course being little building

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,690
blocks of code that you as developers

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,670
can take from people like Scott for

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,590
developing them and actually implement

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,969
them in your apps and modify them

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,649
probably want to or even combine them

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,809
and make your own applications brother

21
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,329
quickly Scott specifically what kinds of

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,640
technologies are you passionate about or

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,460
interested in well AI I'm fortunate

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,920
enough to work with IBM's Watson tools

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,140
and so I get to work with artificial

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,379
intelligence and machine learning and I

27
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,280
think today we're going to demonstrate

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,860
something that uses virtual reality

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,360
which is another fascinating topic

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,920
absolutely thank you very much Scott

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,380
that's right Oh Scott here is very

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,530
interested in virtual reality VR and of

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,570
course I actually have a youtube

34
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,000
tutorial on virtual reality and it was

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,590
done with Michael wooden who used toward

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,090
for IBM as well they will link to that

37
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,229
down in the description below

38
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,360
in fact that wart that Michael did has

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,240
now been adapted and applied as a code

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,560
pattern that you can go ahead and

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,380
download from the IBM website and Scott

42
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,210
over here is gonna be showing that to us

43
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,549
it only show us how exactly this VR

44
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,070
application works in fact if you at home

45
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,110
don't have an actual VR headset no need

46
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,299
to worry you can use one of these Google

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,070
cardboard or practically any kind of

48
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,140
cardboard headset that you get and you

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,750
can actually

50
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,780
and on your own phone I'm actually take

51
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,750
a look at virtual reality without having

52
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,000
to have any fancy hardware or headsets

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,340
and the best part is this isn't just any

54
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,290
virtual reality application this is

55
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,450
combined with IBM Watson speech to text

56
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,700
and text-to-speech to create a kind of

57
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,110
speech sandbox would you like to

58
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,850
elaborate a bit more on how exactly that

59
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,340
works yeah so basically we use speech to

60
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,970
text and the lesson assistant tool to

61
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,270
implement voice commands so the idea of

62
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,490
being in virtual reality you know you

63
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,070
can have a handset you can use various

64
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,050
artifacts to manipulate the virtual

65
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,820
reality but what in the real world we

66
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,980
naturally affect the world with our

67
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,810
voices we ask for things we interact

68
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,880
with our with our voices so this is a

69
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,610
way for you to use the Unity game

70
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,130
development engine along with IBM's

71
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,070
Watson a speech to text and the Watson

72
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,930
assistive tools and implement voice

73
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,730
commands to have the virtual reality

74
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,280
respond in any way you want that's great

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,140
no no what's Howard's the cutting part

76
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,640
where we're gonna take a look at a demo

77
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,830
the application in action and then also

78
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,209
take a look at a demo we'll go a little

79
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,010
bit into the code and show you how you

80
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,380
can actually modify it to work with your

81
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,760
own objects to work with your own

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,560
commands and then from there if you'd

83
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,970
like to deploy on their own virtual

84
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,160
reality headset or even on the Unity you

85
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,390
can go ahead and download the code

86
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,040
pattern in the description below let's

87
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,420
head over to code create a large black

88
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,989
box

89
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,210
create a large red box

90
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,310
destroy move up

91
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,079
create a large red ball

92
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,849
I'd like to do something up here on the

93
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,530
mountains for fun create a large green

94
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,860
ball

95
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,549
so your unity project has lots of assets

96
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,150
all the icons graphics tools we're

97
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,040
really interested in the script that

98
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,680
does all the work so if we look in the

99
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,200
scripts directory we have speech sandbox

100
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,870
streaming and this is where we

101
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,269
instantiate our speech to text and our

102
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,189
Watson assistant using credentials which

103
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,650
we can set in the in the unity editor

104
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,750
and the instructions for that are in the

105
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,790
github repo and of the readme you set

106
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,820
these credentials you instantiate your

107
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,039
speech to text and your Watson assistant

108
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,630
and then the the script will do all the

109
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,440
work to translate your voice commands to

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,060
text and then send that text off to the

111
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,009
Watson assistant service so here in

112
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,500
unrecognised we see where the speech to

113
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,919
text services is getting some some data

114
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
and once it gets some it sends it off to

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,460
the conversations message method and

116
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,620
that's where the intents and entities

117
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,099
are extracted using the Watson assistant

118
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,199
service so you can change these intents

119
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,690
and entities to be whatever it is you'd

120
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,330
like you can have any intent any verb

121
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,169
like create destroy up whatever you can

122
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,650
have any entity of the size of the ball

123
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,340
the color etc so if we go into the on

124
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,530
message method will see that you can use

125
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,240
the parsing of these intents and

126
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,880
entities and once we're inside there

127
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,409
let's see here so here the on message

128
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:25,260
method is where we we look at these

129
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,599
intents and entities for example if the

130
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,630
intent is move we can go ahead and call

131
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,430
our game managers create object first if

132
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,440
the intent is move we call game in

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,300
manager move object and that's where you

134
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,789
implement the logic to move the object

135
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,259
so if you're implementing your own

136
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,630
commands you'll you'll put that method

137
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,340
into your game manager or whatever and

138
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,659
that's where it will happen if the

139
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,340
intent is create first we're looking at

140
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,430
materials working at scale we're trying

141
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,409
to figure out some of the entities

142
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:58,289
around it and then we call game manager

143
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,090
create object so this is another method

144
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,449
that

145
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,639
implemented that you can look up but the

146
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,469
main point is that here is where you'll

147
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,289
add your own voice commands move create

148
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,930
destroy you can replace them you can you

149
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,939
can add wherever you like and then in

150
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,650
the game manager that's where you call

151
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,360
the method associated with with that

152
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,300
voice command so pretty straightforward

153
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,400
it's all open source code you can you

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,139
can modify it in any way you want use it

155
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,199
in your own application and you'll be

156
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,180
able to implement whatever voice command

157
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,469
you want you'll just have to also go to

158
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:29,999
the Watson assistant add your own

159
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:32,099
entities your own intents you can play

160
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,499
around with that as well alright so

161
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,060
thank you very much stop for joining in

162
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,490
today and helping me out demonstrating

163
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,020
virtual reality and how you can actually

164
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,180
take even things like the cardboard or

165
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,699
even the actual proper virtual virtual

166
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,039
reality headsets like the HTC vive I

167
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,839
know ahead and create your own
