1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,760
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,679
tutorial my name is hannah bakshi and

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,839
this time we're going to be going over

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,799
well

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,040
drawing with blocks

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,759
multiplayer uh and so

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,559
well the i just told you the title uh

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,440
and so this app may sound weird at first

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,279
but after you see it you'll see why it's

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,279
a little bit practical i mean not

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,920
exactly this app but you can i'm just

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,800
teaching you a method uh of basically

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,439
creating multiplayer games uh on how you

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,200
can update players x and y uh and their

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
player id in a database uh retrieve it

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,480
use it in your app uh and so essentially

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
this is sort of swift databases part

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,360
four

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,160
uh and so basically what we're doing is

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520
it's simply put an app where people are

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,079
a little square you are a little square

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,520
other friends of yours are little

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,680
squares also on the screen on their own

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,559
little computers all of you can move up

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,760
right

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,520
left or down

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,600
you can even place blocks you can

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
continue to move

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,559
and then all of you have to collaborate

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,479
together to draw something with those

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
little squares uh you always appear

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
right on your own screen and all the

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,400
other players uh

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,159
look black uh and same on other screens

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,680
and you can relay this anywhere in the

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
world some person in india could be

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
could be on a computer playing this and

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
some person in like the us could be

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,520
playing this in some person in canada

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,759
and some person italy in some person

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,119
wherever else

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,040
uh and then

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,439
uh so they're all going to be uploading

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,799
their information to a database

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
retrieving from a database every one

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,920
second uh and so it's going to be pretty

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,439
nice uh and due to the fact that if i

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,439
were to refresh every one millisecond

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,759
which i did try

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,720
it just gets so laggy to the point that

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
you can't even play the game i have to

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,720
refresh every one second which does

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,799
create a little bit of stop in between

54
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,439
everyone's uh everyone seeing the

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,040
players move but again it's a pretty uh

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
rudimentary sort of just moving so it

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
doesn't make a big of a difference there

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
anyway so now let's explain exactly how

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,879
this thing works uh and then we will get

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,480
to the mac part where we will see all

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
the source code

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
and so again as with all of our swift

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,640
databases we have three n's swift

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,840
php

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
and of course

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,640
mysql

67
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,560
now

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
how exactly

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
are we going to

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,480
make an entire game out of these

71
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,800
three different things mysql is going to

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
help us store everything

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
php is going to help us access all those

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
all that sort information and swift is

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,599
going to do all the main stuff

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
and so first of all let's just explain

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
we have

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,640
one database

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,680
called let's just say

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
drawing

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
under that we have two tables and so

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
this is a database

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,040
but under this we have two tables first

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,200
of all we have our blocks table

85
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
and we have our

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,120
second

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
players

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
table

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,239
now in our players table

90
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,280
we store the players x

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,239
y

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
and p id

93
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,879
in the blocks table we just store x and

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,840
y of each block

95
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
now in swift

96
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,440
what we're doing is every one second

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,959
we are first of all

98
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
actually let's just now sit down first

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,640
of all we have

100
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
a lots of php files

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,760
set player

102
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,840
we have get player

103
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,639
that players

104
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,000
we have get blocks

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,560
and we have remove blocks

106
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
okay so now how are we going to work

107
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,479
with four php files

108
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,639
one that sets stuff inside of our

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
players gets stuff inside of our players

110
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
gets stuff inside of our blocks and

111
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
removes all of our blocks

112
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,440
first of all what we're doing is in

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,280
swift

114
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
actually let's just make this one second

115
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
so it's not confusing for you

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,720
first of all what we're doing is we are

117
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,960
getting all players from the database

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,840
and

119
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
then

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,880
actually

121
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
we are getting all players

122
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
and putting them on screen

123
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
or actually wait just a minute

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
just remembered something if you get

125
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
players before you set them you can't

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
actually move

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
so

128
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,919
what we're doing

129
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,320
is we're taking our oh yeah one more

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,199
thing this is optional but just because

131
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,440
i wanted to i actually used the ns

132
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
speech recognizer class

133
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
and i included voice control so you can

134
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,039
say up up up left place right left down

135
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
upright up down something like that

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
uh and you can control this app with

137
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,919
your voice but anyway continuing

138
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
uh so what we're doing first of all is

139
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,319
we're taking your own player

140
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,720
own player

141
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
we're taking all the information about

142
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
this player

143
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
and we're uploading it to our set player

144
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,600
function

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
or actually php file

146
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,639
what this is doing is it's going

147
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,319
to our players

148
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,919
and setting

149
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,440
or actually

150
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
what it's doing is first of all we are

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
giving it the player id our own player

152
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,440
id

153
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
our x and our

154
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
y

155
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,199
and so what will happen

156
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,280
is it'll take that

157
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,639
delete

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,720
the pid that's already there

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
and insert it fresh

160
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
so it'll delete the already existing pid

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
and insert a new one fresh every one

162
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
second

163
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
into our players database

164
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,039
in our get players which is next

165
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,840
what we're

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,720
doing

167
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,360
is we are basically putting these on

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,240
screen basically

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
and we are just putting all these

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,039
players on screen

171
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,720
and so what's happening is we are

172
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
contacting

173
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
this php file which will give us the

174
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
result

175
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,680
and what this is doing is it's taking

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,759
all this information from the players

177
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,440
database

178
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,520
and so swift is able to put all the

179
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,919
players on screen

180
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
but in between there's a little step

181
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,919
which isn't related to database

182
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,400
databases is we are removing the players

183
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
we're moving all the players off screen

184
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,639
we're wiping them putting them new from

185
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,479
the database every one second we're

186
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,120
doing that and so every one second their

187
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,479
positions are being changed

188
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
next what we're doing

189
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,879
is we are essentially

190
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
just getting all blocks again

191
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
so what's happening is our get blocks

192
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
php file is going to give us information

193
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,560
from

194
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
our

195
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,800
blocks database so if i just

196
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,039
do this

197
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,640
now this is a bit messy but i'm just

198
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
trying my best to just really quickly

199
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,919
explain this to you

200
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,599
so what's happening is our blocks

201
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
database which with the x and y for each

202
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
block is going into our php which is

203
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,399
giving it to swift

204
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,720
which will draw all the blocks on screen

205
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
again

206
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
again blocks and players are different

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
blocks are the things that players are

208
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
placed down players are the actual live

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,720
people that move

210
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
then finally there's an extremely

211
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
different function

212
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,560
called remove

213
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,839
so let's say you're done drawing that's

214
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,800
it

215
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
and let's say you all are done drawing

216
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,959
and you say okay that's it let's start

217
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,160
fresh now

218
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
what's going to happen is this remove

219
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
function

220
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
will go over here

221
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
to the remove

222
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,800
blocks function

223
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
actually i'm just gonna make this dotted

224
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,200
real quickly

225
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,200
so that you can see it

226
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,920
okay so what's happening is this remove

227
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,279
function is going down to remove blocks

228
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
and what this is doing is it's wiping

229
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,519
the database clear

230
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
it's going over to this database and

231
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,399
it's saying okay delete everything

232
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
everything

233
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,680
every single little detail inside of

234
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,839
that database will be wiped out

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,160
like that

236
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,920
and so with all these combined

237
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
we have an efficient way

238
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,760
of creating a multiplayer

239
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,360
app

240
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,880
which allows you

241
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,560
to move around

242
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
place down blocks

243
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,560
and allows millions of other people as

244
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,240
well to move around and place blocks

245
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,760
there's really nothing else to explain

246
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,120
so we'll get right to the mac part now

247
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,600
uh but there is one more little demo

248
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,160
that i want to give you

249
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,519
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going

250
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,320
to switch over to my projector after

251
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
just a second it's going to work to my

252
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
projector uh and i'm going to simulate

253
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,320
this with my mac mini and my my normal

254
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,640
mac uh and so

255
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,320
there's going to be two different macs

256
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
uh i'll label them uh on top

257
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
and then we'll be able to see how this

258
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,160
app actually works where i'm going to

259
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,079
demo the actual voice feature etc etc so

260
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,399
let's get straight to the demo now

261
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
so welcome back to the demo and now that

262
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,200
we have two macs on the projector uh

263
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
over here my friend and me

264
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,240
uh and so let's get started i'm going to

265
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,320
open up my app and then he can open up

266
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,839
his app so

267
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,920
right as i open up my instance oh load

268
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
it up quite quickly this time anyway he

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,240
can open up his as well

270
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
and then we can get to the actual demo

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
of things

272
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,240
okay as you can see we can move around

273
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
uh we're completely free to do that

274
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,959
i can move wherever i really want

275
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,800
and as you can see my square on my

276
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
screen is red his square on his screen

277
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,959
is red

278
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,240
so that i know who my block is and he

279
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
knows who his block is all the other

280
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
blocks will be black

281
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
so you know that they're not yours as

282
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,959
you can see over here though uh we have

283
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,639
the x y and player id values uh for both

284
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,600
of us

285
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,639
so

286
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,360
i am pid 3 he is pid4

287
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
and then of course we can move wherever

288
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
we want we can place down blocks i'll

289
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
make a quick 2 by 2 square

290
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
uh and so that was actually quite quick

291
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,399
but i'm going to do that a bit slower

292
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,000
now i'm just going to move to the right

293
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,079
just to show you that you can even

294
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,680
do whatever you want really i'm just

295
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,360
going to place

296
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,519
good move up

297
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,440
then place

298
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
move right

299
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
then place

300
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
move down

301
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
then place

302
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
it's that simple to add stuff then we

303
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,760
can add some corners to our drawings

304
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,839
to make it look

305
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,639
nice

306
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,040
right so then we can do this sort of

307
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,440
stuff

308
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
place

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,279
and my friend can also help me that's

310
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,040
the best part about this app you get to

311
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
collaborate

312
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,639
and so it doesn't take that much time

313
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,160
now it wouldn't be an app without a

314
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
special feature and what's that special

315
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,639
feature in this app well it's voice so

316
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,160
now i'm just going to demonstrate the

317
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
voice feature really quickly

318
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
and i'm going to actually sit a bit slow

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
so you can understand

320
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
so there are commands for like up down

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,600
left right upright up left down left

322
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
down right

323
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,040
there's also place block uh actually

324
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
just place there's also clear and

325
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,320
there's also stop to stop voice

326
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,639
recognition

327
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,320
anyway let's get started so let's just

328
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
move our character up for a second so we

329
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
can see him

330
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,639
uh and so now uh let's just continue to

331
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,680
control with voice

332
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,680
place

333
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,880
up

334
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,200
place

335
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,320
up right

336
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
right

337
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,240
place

338
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,399
place oh wait no

339
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,720
right

340
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,560
right

341
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,800
down

342
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,399
place

343
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,320
down right

344
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,800
place

345
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
down

346
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,720
place

347
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,920
down left

348
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,720
place

349
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,279
left

350
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,720
place

351
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,680
left

352
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,399
left

353
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,680
place

354
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,399
left

355
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,720
place

356
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,519
up left

357
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
place

358
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,680
up

359
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,240
place

360
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
stop

361
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,880
as you can see that was a simple

362
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,920
demonstration of the voice uh and so i

363
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,440
demonstrated most of the commands but

364
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,959
there are still

365
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,880
there is actually this still one command

366
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
left and so i'm going to finish this

367
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,519
cube

368
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,720
actually this rectangle uh and also show

369
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
you that last command

370
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
so let's just control its voice now

371
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,079
again and as you can see my friend can

372
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,480
also move again it's multiplayer we can

373
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,839
do whatever we want i'm just going to

374
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,600
continue to control a voice

375
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,120
upright

376
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
place

377
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
stop

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,680
my friend can place the other one and

379
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,519
now let's just move on out of the way

380
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,839
up

381
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,480
up

382
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,399
up

383
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,160
stop

384
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
now my friend can also move out of the

385
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,360
way so we can actually see this feature

386
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,480
and now watch this

387
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,279
clear

388
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,639
stop

389
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,360
and it removes all the blocks

390
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,199
stop

391
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,480
okay there

392
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,399
and stop also stops the voice

393
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,480
recognition from happening and that was

394
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
actually really simple uh a

395
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,959
demonstration it makes the app look easy

396
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,680
to program but it's not that easy i'm

397
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
gonna tell you that much so now we can

398
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
actually get to the mac part in which i

399
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,160
will be explaining the code behind all

400
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,399
of this uh and then i will also be

401
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,160
explaining the database and behind all

402
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,800
of this and let's get right to it

403
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
so welcome back to the mac part now i'm

404
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,279
going to be showing you the code for

405
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,720
this app

406
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,839
sorry uh and so let's get right into it

407
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,120
as you can see i already have the xcode

408
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,000
project open and this is a very simple

409
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,720
ui just two lines to separate this part

410
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
from this part uh the little controls

411
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,919
the remote features i call it over here

412
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
uh the blocks over here the database

413
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
gets printed onto here

414
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,199
and then the player's database gets

415
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,280
printed onto here

416
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,079
it's the simple sdy i could think of

417
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,160
nothing really

418
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,760
extraordinary

419
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,880
in here

420
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,760
but the code is where it's at as you can

421
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
see in our code we are actually i'm

422
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
blocking the commands with my face so

423
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,960
let me move my face around uh so we are

424
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
first of all importing cocoa nothing

425
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,280
else required or kokoa uh

426
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,799
not sure how you pronounce it i just say

427
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,080
coco

428
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,039
uh for app delegate i am implementing

429
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
from s object ns application delegate

430
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,600
normal but then i'm also implementing

431
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,080
from ns speech recognizer delegate so i

432
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,640
can recognize the commands

433
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,240
up up left upright down down left down

434
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,520
right left right stop place and clear

435
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,679
all those commands in this array over

436
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,640
here

437
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,240
but just before that we're also creating

438
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,880
a variable called sr which is a new ns

439
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,559
speech recognizer so that we can

440
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,919
actually recognize our speech

441
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,440
and next we are just declaring our

442
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,760
window nothing special that's automatic

443
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
from xcode

444
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
but then we're also declaring our up

445
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
button down button left button right

446
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,120
button and space button and actually uh

447
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
this used to be where you can actually

448
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,559
click the keys on the keyboard but that

449
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,160
didn't really work out

450
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,360
so i just renamed uh sp uh space on the

451
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,240
keyboard uh to space as an ns button so

452
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,760
that's why it's called space and not

453
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
like place or something but that doesn't

454
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,679
really matter

455
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,840
continuing we have our blocks text view

456
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,600
and our players text view know what are

457
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,320
these well it's uh these little database

458
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,440
printing text views

459
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
next we are creating a var players which

460
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,039
is an ns image view array which is blank

461
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,600
at first same thing for blocks then we

462
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,160
are creating players data as an nsra and

463
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
blocks data as an nsra

464
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
then we are creating this player meaning

465
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,400
your own player as an ns image view

466
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,640
then we are creating x for your own

467
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,039
player as zero and y for your own player

468
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360
is zero you are setting your own player

469
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,320
id by default to two

470
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,559
i mean i could set it to one i mean

471
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,000
nothing will happen

472
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,640
uh then we are just defining a bunch of

473
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,160
urls now first of all our first url uh

474
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,360
is the players get url which is simple

475
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,600
it's just

476
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,240
www.tenbashi.comgetplayers.php nothing

477
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,720
special but then we have a computed

478
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,679
property first the setting url because

479
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
of course when i'm actually setting i

480
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
don't want to have to give the x and the

481
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,440
y and the pid i just want the computed

482
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,679
property to automatically make a url

483
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
with the x y and player id inside of it

484
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,480
so what i do

485
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
is i create a computed property called

486
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,640
player set url as a string

487
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
when gotten

488
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,520
it will actually just return

489
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,039
setplayer.php but with the parameters x

490
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,880
as the x variable

491
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,000
y is the y variable and pid as the p as

492
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,960
the player id variable

493
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,200
then same thing for blocks get urls just

494
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,120
a simpler url 10abac2.com

495
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,880
getblocks.php this will return in json

496
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,360
format all the blocks as x's and y's

497
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,400
however the set url is a bit different

498
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,159
here when it's gotten we are just

499
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,600
returning tenant action.com

500
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,240
setblock.php

501
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,440
with the parameters x as the x variable

502
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,679
and y is the y variable

503
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,280
or the coordinate variable

504
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,000
and in order to remove a player uh we

505
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,159
are giving uh the

506
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,080
uh url for tanningbackshoe.com

507
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,679
deleteplayer.php with the pid parameter

508
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,080
as the player id let me check my diagram

509
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,640
yes i told you about that

510
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,280
uh and then uh for our block removing um

511
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,120
php uh script we are just saying uh

512
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,600
attended actually.com slash delete

513
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,679
blocks.php

514
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
now

515
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
actually before this used to be

516
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,400
a computed property because

517
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
it used to ask you which block to remove

518
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,760
but now that that's not required we can

519
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,400
just change it to this

520
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
next as you can see we are creating our

521
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
game timer which is equal to a new ns

522
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,480
timer which we will be talking about in

523
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,320
just a minute then i'm just declaring

524
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,159
some rudimentary functions called data

525
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,559
of url first of all this will return the

526
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,960
ns data of any nsurl

527
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
but you just need to give the url as a

528
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,039
string so this will essentially just run

529
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,600
any url but it will also return the data

530
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,240
returned by from that url so you can use

531
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,960
it

532
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,720
anywhere else then a data to json uh

533
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,799
function which will take any data as ns

534
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,760
data

535
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,159
uh return any object because we don't

536
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,320
know what's going to be returned uh and

537
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,280
then it'll uh do use a do statement and

538
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,480
it'll return

539
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,280
try ns.json serialization.json object

540
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,159
with data the data and then give it just

541
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,960
dot mutable containers options

542
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,799
we're not

543
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,240
converting this to anything because of

544
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,799
course we're just returning any object

545
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,720
but if there is an error that is caught

546
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,039
just print out that error uh and then if

547
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,039
nothing gets returned then just return a

548
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,840
blank array

549
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,480
next i'm just going to scroll down here

550
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
and over here we see

551
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,320
our application did finish launching

552
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,000
function

553
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,080
now first of all what we're doing is we

554
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,360
are running our players set url

555
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,799
uh so what this is going to do is it's

556
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,360
going to take our own player at x

557
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,720
coordinate 0 and y coordinate 0

558
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
and it's going to push that into the

559
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,159
database

560
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,120
along with our player id

561
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
then what's going to happen

562
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,760
sorry

563
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,280
is we're going to say 4i in data to json

564
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,520
specifically the data of the url our

565
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,400
players get url

566
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
so what this is going to do is going to

567
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,480
get the data of the json the data

568
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
from the website

569
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,159
that returns all the players x y's and

570
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,960
pids and it's going to take that data

571
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,240
and and ambiguous data convert it into

572
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,280
json or an ns array

573
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,960
and then what we're doing is we're

574
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,039
looping through

575
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,360
all of that um

576
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
data

577
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,720
and then all we're doing really

578
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,799
sorry we don't need this extra parameter

579
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,440
okay

580
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,360
so next uh what we're doing is we're

581
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,840
creating a var vowel

582
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,880
uh which is equal to an integer of i as

583
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,480
ns dictionary

584
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
uh we are getting specifically the

585
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,039
player id as a string and then

586
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,360
converting that to an integer as i said

587
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,600
and then we're forcing that as an unwrap

588
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,320
then we're taking the date of url uh

589
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,240
first of all we're deleting this

590
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
specific thus

591
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,600
we're deleting all players from the

592
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,440
database

593
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,919
now you might be asking

594
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,760
how does our app work if we're deleting

595
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,080
all the players from the database

596
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,919
well it's simple

597
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,360
the client

598
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,159
from which that player is running from

599
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,600
should be able to within a second

600
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
upload himself

601
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,919
back onto the database

602
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,520
so it doesn't make a difference

603
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,840
and then once this is all done we have

604
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,120
our own final player id

605
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,039
the reason we're also removing the

606
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,039
player is let's say there's an inactive

607
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,240
player that has quit their game

608
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
this also acts as a refresh meaning

609
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,480
inactive players that don't have a

610
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,320
computer don't have a compliance don't

611
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,400
have a client still playing will be

612
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,159
removed but the ones that are still

613
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,600
playing will be added back onto the

614
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,440
database from their own client

615
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,880
so it also adds a quick refresh

616
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,120
after that we are setting our game timer

617
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,039
to a new ns timer with the scheduled

618
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,919
timer uh with time interval every one

619
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,960
second we're targeting ourself or to do

620
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,360
the update function with no user info

621
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,679
meaning nil and we're making sure that

622
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,200
it repeats

623
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
after that we are just removing our own

624
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,080
player from the database

625
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,640
next what we're doing

626
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
is in our update function first of all

627
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,720
we're setting the player's text view and

628
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,440
the blocks text views string values to

629
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,720
nothing

630
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,840
then we are setting our own player back

631
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,080
into the database and so this is going

632
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
to do is going to delete our player from

633
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,279
the database put it back on from the php

634
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,440
end

635
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,840
then what we're going to do

636
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
is we're going to map through all of our

637
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,279
own windows sub views

638
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,760
and then what we're checking is if

639
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,559
the

640
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,840
current

641
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,799
uh

642
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
thing we're on in the map if the current

643
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
object or on in the map

644
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,520
is kind of class and as image view

645
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
meaning it's a player or block just

646
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,600
remove it from our view

647
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,840
wipe all the players and blocks off of

648
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
the view

649
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,400
then set this player to a new s image

650
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,000
view with a frame of an nsrect of our

651
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
current local x and y values coordinates

652
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,640
and set the width and height to both to

653
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,400
50.

654
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,200
then reset our players array to just

655
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,360
nothing like a blank array set our

656
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,320
player's data to the data json of our

657
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,799
data of url for getting our player for

658
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
our player get url

659
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,240
and then convert that to an nsra

660
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,480
then loop through all of our player data

661
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,840
create a final dictionary

662
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,919
the final x out of that dictionary take

663
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,919
the final y out of that dictionary take

664
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,120
the final pid from that dictionary

665
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,039
add it all to our player's text view

666
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,159
with x as the final x then a pipe etc

667
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,279
etc

668
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,880
and then append

669
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,840
this

670
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,159
an ns image view

671
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,159
with the specifications that we just got

672
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,600
from the database into our players array

673
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,640
then also append our own player into the

674
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,480
players array

675
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,039
after that just map through the entire

676
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,640
players

677
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,279
array and just check actually first of

678
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,080
all

679
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,960
set

680
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,640
all of them

681
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,880
to that they want a layer meaning they

682
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,120
uh they want to have a layer so we can

683
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
set their background color

684
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,440
then take their layer

685
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,600
uh force unwrap it

686
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
and send its background color to first

687
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
of all

688
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,919
if it's your own player red or else

689
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,600
black

690
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
simply put

691
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,360
loop through the entire players

692
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,640
if it's your own player set it to red if

693
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,880
it's someone else's player set to black

694
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,200
simply

695
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,399
next we're just looping through our

696
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,720
players array and we're adding all of

697
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
our players onto our view

698
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,679
then we're doing the exact same thing

699
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,559
for our blocks we take our blocks uh we

700
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,399
get our blocks data

701
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,679
as data json of the date of url of the

702
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,559
blocks get url as an nsra

703
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,720
we're setting our blocks to an to a

704
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,559
blank array

705
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,919
then what we're doing is we're looping

706
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,360
through our blocks data again we're

707
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,200
getting the final dictionary the final x

708
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,520
the final y putting it into our blocks

709
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,760
text view appending it to our blocks

710
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,080
array as an ns image view with all that

711
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,240
data that we just got we're mapping

712
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,159
through our blocks and setting them all

713
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,480
to a blue color

714
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,600
and then we're just looping through our

715
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
blocks and adding them to our view

716
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,600
and that's all that we're doing in our

717
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,760
update function and no wonder sometimes

718
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,679
it takes up a bit too much memory

719
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,399
anyway continuing then we have just a

720
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,159
few functions first i'm going to show

721
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,360
you my ib actions

722
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,279
so this is the first one when you click

723
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,840
on the up button all it's doing is it's

724
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,200
increasing your y value by 50.

725
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
that's all it really needs to do because

726
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,960
then the update function will take care

727
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,520
of uploading it to the database etc etc

728
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,559
that's it

729
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
that's not the up buttons job

730
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
after that if you click on up left

731
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
it'll just simulate clicking the up

732
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,159
button once then the left button once

733
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,360
that's it

734
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,080
upright same thing simulate the up

735
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,799
button then simulate the right button

736
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,840
if you click on down however uh it will

737
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,600
actually decrease your y value by 50.

738
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
if you click on down left

739
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,320
i will click on it will simulate down

740
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,840
and simulate left

741
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
if you click on down right it will

742
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
simulate down and it will also simulate

743
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
right

744
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,200
if you click on left it'll decrease your

745
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,039
x value by 50.

746
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,880
if you click on right it'll increase

747
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,080
your x value by 50.

748
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,559
if you click on space however or not

749
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,120
space the place button it'll run the

750
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,840
place block at position function

751
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,679
which will just get uh the data of url

752
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,760
for the blocks set url which will

753
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
automatically put in the x and y values

754
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,600
for us and so that will append a new

755
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
block into our database and then our

756
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,960
update function will take care of

757
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,720
drawing that on the screen for us we

758
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,279
don't need to

759
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,840
and then if you want to delete all the

760
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,120
blocks it's just going to get the date

761
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,600
of url for our blocks remove url then

762
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,320
what's happening is this command it ib

763
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,640
action is when you click on start a

764
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,480
voice recognition

765
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,720
uh it'll actually set the sr's delegate

766
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,440
to self it'll set the sr's commands to

767
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
the commands that we allow it

768
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,200
and it'll tell the sr to start listening

769
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,080
or the speech recognizer

770
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,720
then we have an inherited function uh

771
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,640
from ns

772
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,159
speech something

773
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,399
yes and a speech recognizer delegate

774
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,720
uh and it is speech recognizer from a

775
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,840
sender did recognize command

776
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,440
and so it's going to happen is this

777
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,799
function is always called when it

778
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,799
recognizes a command inside of that

779
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,880
command list

780
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,760
and so if it's stop it'll just uh stop

781
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,679
listening the sender

782
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,640
that's it

783
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,039
however if it's not if it contains up

784
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,279
then it'll simulate up if it contains

785
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,919
down it'll simulate down if it contains

786
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,320
left it'll simulate left if it contains

787
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,360
right it'll simulate a right click

788
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,919
and if it uh cont if the command is

789
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,399
equal to place uh it'll place a block at

790
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,679
the position

791
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,840
however if the command is equal to clear

792
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,519
it will just delete all blocks

793
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,240
that simply

794
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,679
anyway so that was actually pretty much

795
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,159
all of the code there was here uh and

796
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,679
again if i didn't already show this to

797
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,919
you in the application will terminate

798
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,039
function

799
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,159
uh we have the date of url uh player

800
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,200
remove uh thing and so

801
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,760
that means whenever you exit your app

802
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,399
it's going to just remove your player

803
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,760
from the database because we don't want

804
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,360
to cluttering up and then whenever

805
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,039
someone joins they're going to have an

806
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,279
entirely different pid just because you

807
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,080
couldn't uh close your own instance

808
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,600
uh and so

809
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,559
uh next i'm going to show you actually

810
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,120
i'm not done code sorry about that

811
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,799
i'm just going to make my face bigger to

812
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,320
talk to you for a second

813
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,480
uh yeah so now that i've shared the

814
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,320
xcode part with you

815
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,000
i'm actually going to be showing you the

816
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,279
database

817
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,440
and php and well not really the php the

818
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,320
php way too many files to go over but

819
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,960
again there will be the php files down

820
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,880
in the description uh but i will be

821
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,720
going over the database i will be

822
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,679
simulating using php meaning i'm going

823
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,240
to open up an instance of the app

824
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,919
then i'm going to insert something into

825
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,840
the database and you'll see it magically

826
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,480
pop up on the app as well

827
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,320
uh so i'm going to make my face a bit

828
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,399
smaller i didn't want it that big

829
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,840
uh and i'm going to come over here

830
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,159
and now over here i'm going to go um

831
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,960
yes godaddy because that's where i host

832
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,679
i love godaddy

833
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,120
then if i go to sign in uh into my

834
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,159
tenure backstreet account

835
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,679
yeah might just take a little time

836
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,040
sometimes my wi-fi is just

837
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,200
out of this world

838
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,040
okay

839
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,760
so now if i click on my web hosting

840
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,839
go into here

841
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,839
let's just go straight into our database

842
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,359
uh and yep of course

843
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,839
showing my password

844
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,280
it's going to load

845
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,560
uh and now i can go to phpmyadmin

846
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,960
and it will automatically redirect

847
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,839
me over here

848
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,879
and then

849
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,720
we have

850
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,560
over here

851
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,960
uh where'd it go drawing players

852
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,040
database and as you can see we have our

853
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,640
database as you can see there's no

854
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,800
players online right now so it's of

855
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,640
course going to give me an empty set but

856
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,320
our blocks

857
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,400
are also empty because i had cleared it

858
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,599
in the demo

859
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,040
but let's just say i run my app okay

860
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,920
and let's just go to our players

861
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
nothing right now right just wait for

862
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,280
the app to load up

863
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,160
uh and you will see that our players uh

864
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,680
get populated with one entry uh which is

865
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,520
the new entry that we just put in right

866
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,440
now so

867
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,160
for that to load up

868
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,000
yeah sometimes it'll take a little while

869
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
to load up

870
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,040
i just memory clean real quick

871
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,000
okay there we are

872
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,800
now that it's loaded up uh we can see

873
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,440
over here that there is an automatic

874
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,839
little block there and i'm just going to

875
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,040
move

876
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,320
up sorry i'm just checking if my

877
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,560
camera's in sync okay uh so now i can

878
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,359
move up i'm going to move up right a bit

879
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,880
uh and now

880
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,320
i'm going to go to my database players

881
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,520
boom

882
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,839
i have my own player id my x and my y

883
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,520
value which is also being displayed over

884
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,599
here in the database

885
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,359
now watch this

886
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,640
magic

887
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
i'm gonna make this block

888
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,960
go down without clicking a button in the

889
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,280
app i'm just going to change this y

890
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
value over here can i change this here

891
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,119
no

892
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,960
but what i can do

893
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,320
update

894
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,200
uh

895
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,599
this so

896
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,880
oh wait i think there is a different way

897
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,200
so if i

898
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,400
no

899
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,240
better idea what i can do

900
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,720
is go to

901
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
tanmaybakshi.com

902
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
set player

903
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,160
with a player id of 2 to x 0 y 0. now my

904
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,119
player should theoretically

905
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,000
just jump down

906
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,839
well that isn't really the case and this

907
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,520
is due to the fact the update function

908
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
is running so rapidly with the local

909
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,560
variables that it does move down but in

910
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,119
just one second it moves the thing back

911
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,040
up

912
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,680
uh and so i can't really demonstrate

913
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,320
moving that with database because then

914
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,640
our app wouldn't really work uh but then

915
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,280
yeah so let's just uh

916
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,720
idea let's add a block

917
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,040
at

918
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,800
x zero y zero and watch this no block

919
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,040
over here right no block over here

920
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,359
go

921
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,800
and a block

922
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,560
just appears

923
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,960
amazingly

924
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,560
and now if i were to do 50

925
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,839
50

926
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,040
it should appear i'd say

927
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,560
over here yeah just a diagonal across

928
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,960
from it

929
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
and it worked because of course we're

930
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,839
inserting these blocks into the database

931
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,280
and because we're inserting these blocks

932
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,000
into the database it's like yeah i

933
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,880
should

934
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,560
totally put these on screen now because

935
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,400
they're in the database probably someone

936
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
else put these in but it doesn't know

937
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,640
that i'm just inserting these injecting

938
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,960
these into the database

939
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,240
now if i delete these all from the

940
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,079
database

941
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,640
of course

942
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,839
um

943
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,400
uh it will say two rows deleted and then

944
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
they're all gone

945
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,920
and so it's pretty much that simple i

946
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,079
guess i could also emulate putting in a

947
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
new player uh that should work as well

948
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,119
pid 3

949
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,880
0 0

950
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,200
and then

951
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,839
uh yeah and as you can see it emulates a

952
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,000
little player and so yeah this instance

953
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,160
of the app is actually regularly

954
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,960
updating the database uh and so what's

955
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,920
happening

956
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,079
while it's updating we have local

957
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,520
variables that are storing the x and the

958
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
y

959
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,920
now the local variables completely

960
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,320
override what's in the database

961
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
and so what's happening is when i change

962
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,359
try to change the location of my player

963
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,800
in the database

964
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,599
my app is taking that local x and y

965
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,680
coordinate and it's uploading it back

966
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,839
onto the database overriding the change

967
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,839
that i just did

968
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,000
so there's really nothing i can do

969
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,320
even if i were to delete the player off

970
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,920
my app would just be like nope local

971
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,160
variables rule it just insert it back

972
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,920
into the database i don't care sort of

973
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,640
thing

974
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
and so i don't really have much control

975
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,160
over it

976
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
but of course

977
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,400
i can continue to control my voice

978
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
like this so watch if i go if i place uh

979
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,520
there will be a block here and i can

980
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,320
show you my blocks array on my database

981
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,960
that it will come up so

982
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
place

983
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,359
stop

984
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,320
now as you can see our app says that at

985
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,040
150 300 we've placed a uh blue block

986
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,640
let's just see what our database has to

987
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,000
say

988
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,760
exactly the same if i were to change its

989
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,720
coordinates to x0

990
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,400
which i cannot do

991
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,079
but if i were

992
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,079
then it would actually just move it

993
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,640
to the center to the edge of the screen

994
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,200
if i were to move it to zero zero

995
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,400
down to the

996
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,640
bottom corner over here of the screen

997
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
and of course uh a really nice way to

998
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,839
refresh as i said uh is if there's

999
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,680
something that i like to call dead

1000
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
players for example

1001
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,760
i have this app

1002
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,640
command option escape i have to force

1003
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,839
quit this app for some reason okay

1004
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,200
now what happens

1005
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,440
is this app does not have enough time

1006
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
or at least i haven't tested this it

1007
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,640
shouldn't have enough time to call

1008
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,599
application will terminate

1009
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,400
and so what will happen in turn

1010
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,040
is the database still has this player id

1011
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,280
now this is completely unnecessary other

1012
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,160
players will be annoyed because there is

1013
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,800
they have to join with one player id

1014
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
ahead for no reason

1015
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
and so a really nice way to remove this

1016
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,839
due to the fact that our app is

1017
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,119
constantly updating into the database

1018
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,839
if you go to the sql side click delete

1019
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,119
now if there's any players that are

1020
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,200
that are actually on their client it'll

1021
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
just immediately push it back on if

1022
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,520
there aren't it'll remove

1023
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,160
all those access players and so that's

1024
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,800
just a really quick uh nice feature for

1025
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,720
that one more thing really quickly let's

1026
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
just say i restart this app

1027
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
just to show you that the php end also

1028
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,560
works i'm just going to run the

1029
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,560
getplayers.php

1030
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,880
get players.php and it shows us that

1031
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,280
there's a pid 2 with x0 and y0 i can

1032
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,960
also get the current blocks

1033
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,200
uh so x 150

1034
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,720
y 300 i think i can also set yeah i can

1035
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
definitely set them

1036
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,800
i'm not exactly sure if this is the name

1037
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,319
but let's just try it anyway

1038
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,480
yeah so let's just see what our urls is

1039
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,640
there

1040
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,280
set block sorry

1041
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,400
so now this should add a block at 0 0.

1042
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,160
it did

1043
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,440
due to the fact

1044
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
that our php file actually works and

1045
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,640
inserts stuff into our database

1046
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,240
and that was it for this video again if

1047
