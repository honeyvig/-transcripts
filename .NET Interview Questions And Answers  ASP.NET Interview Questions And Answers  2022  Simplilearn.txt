get started
we will look at the first category of
asp.net interview questions that is
beginner level interview questions
what is
asp.net asp.net is a server-side
technology used for developing dynamic
websites and web applications on the
internet
it also produces data-driven web
application
microsoft released asp.net in 2002 to
build dynamic websites and web
applications using the.net framework
what platform does asp.net use
asp.net is a cross platform which works
on the dotnet framework and runs on
linux windows mac os and docker
what is the asp.net lifecycle and lists
the types of lifecycle
when asp.net pages run it goes through
several steps of the lifecycle which
performs a series of actions like
initialization running restoring and
rendering
lifecycle is classified into two
categories
application lifecycle and page lifecycle
in application lifecycle the user
requests for accessing the application
page lifecycle has faces like
initialization restoring execution and
page rendering
what is mvc
so mvc is basically a software
architectural pattern that divides an
application into three main parts
that is model view and controller
model helps to create the data domain of
the application and represents the
public properties and business logic of
the application
view view represents the data tables
charts and diagrams by collecting the
data from the model
controller the controller helps in
handling the user interactions and
controls the flow of the application
list the languages used for asp.net

the request
using an iis computer one can work as a
web server and provides functionality to
deploy asp.net web applications
it is also responsible for providing
responses to the request made by the
users
list the types of application lifecycle
application lifecycle is of 5 types
application start object creation http
application dispose and application end
application start is a method that you
execute when a user makes a request
object creation contains all the
information about current request and
browsing information
http application processes all
subsequent requests sent to the
application
dispose
dispose is responsible for releasing
manually unwanted resources
application end helps to unload the
memory of an application
list the advantages of using asp.net

related transactions
what is the role of page directives
page directives describe the attributes
of specific page file for the compiler
below is the syntax of page directives
where code file specifies the name of
code behind the file
and debug enables or specifies
compilation debug
and client name specifies the class name
of the page
and decline target browses the server
controls
list the types of states in asp.net
staten asp.net is used to store the
information between request and to
retrieve it when required and holding
the information
asp.net provides four types of states
application state cookie state view
state and session state
application state in this state all
collections of web pages and files in a
single directory on a web server
cookie state it stores the information
on the client machine view states
view state states the state of web pages
and its control
session state this state is used to sort
the application data

mechanism to identify the capabilities
of a client browser coding can be easy
by adding run nut is equal to server
attribute
controls can interact with the client
side scripting
explain about event bubbling
even bubbling is used by data bound
controls when a parent control contains
child controls and when an event occurs
in the child controls it bubbles the
event to the parent this is called even
bubbling
even bubbling is classified into two
categories on bubble event that handles
the even data
rise bubble event that sends the event
data
list the most common built-in objects of
asp.net

basic web form page
data caching it is used for caching the
data of the data source controls
what are break points
breakpoint helps to specify the runtime
to run a line and stop the execution
it is used to examine and perform
various debugging functions and methods
now let us look at some of the advanced
level interview questions
list any five web controls in asp.net
web controls are html elements used for
script tagging and functionality for web
forms and pages
the five web controls in asp.net are as
follows
html controls html server controls user
and custom controls asp.net server
controls
asp.net ajax server controls
what are button controls
button controls in asp.net are used to
display a push button on a web page
this is the syntax for button controls
where you provide button id
and run at server and the text is of the
type button
what is range validator and its syntax
range validator checks the input values
that lie in between the specified ranges
the validator has three main properties
that is type minimum value and maximum
value
this is the syntax of range validator
wherein we have provided minimum value
as 1 and maximum value as 6 and it is of
the type integer
what is a thread priority
in multi-threading its thread has its
own priority that gains access to cpu
resources
whenever a thread is created in c sharp
it always possesses some priority
it is mainly used to set a value
what is the role of postback in asp.net
pushback is a request sent from a client
to the server from the page on which the

the property and behavior of web
applications
it also helps to manage settings each
file of a web configuration is an xml
file that contains a set of
configuration elements
explain client-side script events
client-side script runs on the browser
and speeds up the execution of the page
some of the client-side events are as
follows
on click it is used when the control is
clicked on focus it is used when control
receives the focus
on change is used when the value of
control is changed
on blur is used when the control loses
focus

and set cookie sliding expiration as
true and keep the cookie protection
encrypted and cookie less is equal to
user
what is form-based authentication
form-based authentication is used to
edit the web configuration files and add
a login page to authenticate
it is used for web applications
form-based authentication also provides
a way to handle authentication using
custom logics in asp.net applications
define the types of configuration files
right
configuration files help to manage the
settings of a website settings of
configuration files are stored as xml
files which are separate from the
application
configuration files are of two types
web configuration and machine
configuration
web configuration contains the machine
specific value for all settings of the
applications
machine configurations help to extend
restrict and override the settings
list the different types of cookies used
in asp.net
cookies are a small piece of information
stored at the client side the cookies in
asp.net are provided into two types
session cookie valid for a single
session
persistent cookie valid for multiple
sessions
explain the difference between custom
controls and user controls
custom controls is designed for a single
application
whereas user control is designed for
multiple applications custom control is
loosely coupled user control is tightly
coupled
user interface can be changed in custom
control whereas in user controls the
user interface is fixed
then the difference between web
configuration and machine configuration
files
web configuration is automatically
created when application is created
whereas machine configuration is
automatically installed with the visual
studio
in web configuration file inherits
settings from the machine configuration
whereas in machine configuration only
one machine configuration exist
