with the basics of excel introduction to
Excel and the various professionals
using Excel and the perks of using Excel
in your job fields we shall proceed with
this Excel Basics fill course now over
to our training experts for today's
discussion so the agenda for today's
discussion is first we will understand
what exactly is Microsoft Excel followed
by that we will understand the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel the
tools available in Excel how to create a
new sheet etc etc followed by that we
will enter the last part of today's
session where we will have a demo
inventory of Microsoft Excel where I'll
explain the fundamentals of Microsoft
Excel in a practical way I hope I made
myself clear with the agenda now let's
get started with the first point that is
what is Microsoft Excel so Microsoft
Excel is a software product designed and
developed by Microsoft is storing data
in an organized way that is row and
columns and Microsoft Excel is also
capable to manipulate data through some
mathematical
operations followed by that Microsoft
Excel is also used to extract the
insights from the data and represent it
in the form of visually appealing graphs
and charts now we have a basic
understanding or an overview of what a
Microsoft Excel software product is now
moving ahead we will understand the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel so
following are some fundamentals that you
need to know before getting started with
Microsoft Excel so basically when you
install the Microsoft Office in your
computer you will have various Microsoft
products out of which Microsoft Excel is
one of the product so we will be dealing
exactly with that particular product
that is Microsoft Excel so when you get
started with Microsoft Excel this is
what you will see in the first page so
this particular page is called as
Microsoft Excel homepage where you will
be having various varieties of sheets
Microsoft Excel will give you some
suggestions based on the type of sheet
you want to work with we will see this
in a better way through the Practical
session so once you get started with the
sheet you will have some more options so
this particular option is called as the
toolbar menu you will have the file home
insert draw page layout formulas data
review View and help so these are the
tools that you will be using to work on
your data using Microsoft Excel
furthermore we have a toolbar ribbon so
when you select some of the other option
from the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help buttons you will have a ribbon so
for example you can see that I have
selected the Home Tool here so when I
press on the Home Tool this is the
ribbon which Microsoft Excel gives me so
this ribbon has some options in it which
can perform various operations now in a
furthermore detailed way we will have
toolbar groups so when you see in the
previous slide we have a complete
toolbar ribbon so this particular ribbon
is segmented into groups so you can see
the first group as paste Cut Copy format
painter etc etc and the second group is
the font the size of the font and to
increase the size of the font to
decrease the size of the font bold
italic underline etc etc and here you
can see the text alignment so each and
every group has separate functions so
each set is called as a group
and I think you can see a small Arrow
option over here so this Arrow option is
used into the toolbar groups when the
group is not able to fit all the
operations or all the functionalities in
one single provided section so when you
click on this particular Arrow Mark you
will have another dialogue box so this
is called toolbar more options so you
can see that when I clicked on this icon
you can see a new dialogue box which
opens me a new set of operations which
are not able to be fit in this
particular group so we will also see
more about this in a better way in the
Practical session now moving forward we
have cell and address so when you open a
Microsoft Excel sheet you can find boxes
so each and every box is named as a cell
and each cell has its own address for
example the highlighted cell over here
has an address B3 so B is the column
name and three is the r
name and apart from that you can have
the sheet tracker in the bottom left
corner of the Excel sheet where you can
navigate through different sheets and in
the bottom right corner you have an
option of increasing or decreasing the
sheet size so these are the basic
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel that you
need to keep in mind before getting
started so we will have more on this in
the Practical session if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to no more so
now we enter the demo inventory in
Microsoft Excel so we will be using
using Microsoft Excel to create a sheet
of the employees in a company so
basically an employee in a company has
employee ID name and designation salary
etc etc so we will be trying to create
the same table using Microsoft Excel but
before that let us understand the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel through
the Practical demo first so I have
started my Microsoft Excel and this is
how the homepage of Microsoft Excel
looks like so you have a blank workbook
over here if you want to create create a
new workbook you can select new Option
so Excel will provide you with various
variety of sheets you can see money in
Excel adjustable meeting agenda
streaming showers small business cash
flow and many more if you're not able to
find what you're looking for then you
always have an option of selecting the
particular type of sheet what you're
looking for so you have various options
if it's business if it's personal if
it's planners and trackers list budgets
charts etc etc so let's imagine that you
wanted something from business so just
by clicking at business option the Excel
will load a variety of sheets related to
business options so this might take a
while so you can see that the Excel is
loading few types of
sheets so you can see that Excel has
provided us with some online varieties
of sheets for example any calendar
business expenses Channel marketing
budget budget summary report blue
product list etc etc you can see
construction proposal Eno your name it
Excel has C it so Excel will provide you
with some variety of options based on
your requirements
now for this session let's get started
with a plank workbook which looks
something like this since this tutorial
is based on the fundamentals we'll go
with the blank
workbook now over here you can see the
toolbar that we discussed earlier that
has the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so this is the toolbar and under
the toolbar I have selected home and you
can see this is the particular ribbon
what we discussed about this particular
ribbon belongs to homepage and when you
you select file option you'll get back
to home and if you select insert option
you'll have another different ribbon
with different groups etc etc so every
particular tool has different ribbons in
them and remember the extra options that
we discussed when you press over this
Arrow key this is it so when you press
the arrow key you'll have few more
settings which cannot be fit in this
particular section of groups so you can
have some variety of options over here
of changing the font changing some
effects to the text font size and font
style etc etc
apart from this we have also discussed
about the cells in every sheet so this
particular cell has an address so you
can see the address over here which is
B3 so B happens to be the column name
and three happens to be the row name now
we also had a discussion about the sheet
tracker right now we just have one sheet
if you want multiple sheets you can just
feel free to select on the plus option
which will always create you some extra
sheets and you can navigate through
sheets just by pressing on the sheet
name and when you get back to the bottom
right corner you have an option of
increasing and decreasing the cell size
or the sheet size now let's keep it
default with 100% now these are the few
fundamentals that you need to keep in
mind before getting started with
Microsoft Excel now that we know the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel let's
get started with a practical session
which is about the employees details in
a company now let's select this
particular cell and let's type in
employee
details
yeah we have the cell now an employee
details table will have the information
related to employees so the information
will be about name it will be about
employee
number it will be the
designation
and maybe
salary and maybe blood group as
well and uh let's take another one which
is phone
number
yeah so so far so good and uh you can
see that we have some problem with this
particular column the the designation
the name uh the the name of the
designation is practically good but it
is not visible so when you uh when
you're not on that particular cell you
can see that the name is incomplete over
here so you can always fix that you can
just you know manually change the size
of the row or cell or you can also feel
free to you know double click on that
cell which will automatically you know
set the size of that particular cell and
same goes to the blood group just let's
try to double click on that and and same
goes to phone
number
great so you can see that the employees
details are just confined to the first
two cells it's supposed to be somewhere
in the middle right so no problem we can
do that as well we can select all the
cells and we have an option of merging
them you can just select this one which
will help you with merging and centering
that particular data to the center part
so that's how we do it now let's get
started by adding the names of the
employees uh let's add the names
Joe
John uh Mary
Mark
Susan and
then
Jennifer let's type in
Mike let's Tye in
them chef
Jeffrey yeah we have a couple of
employees now let's type in the employee
numbers
yeah we have the employee numbers now
now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet now here we have some sales
data based on a store now what we going
to do is we we're going to add some
multiple rows or a single Row in this
particular data so here you can see the
region wise category Wise statewise
subcategory Wise and there sales and
quantities right now let us imagine that
you must have to add a sale data here
right so let us imagine that on the row
7th you were supposed to add some detail
for example some technology related sale
happened on that day and you missed out
to add it right so how do you create a
new rule now so for example if multiple
sales happened on the same day like 3 to
four and you missed out them so how do I
add three to four rows in between the
existing data right so don't worry about
it it's completely simple all you have
to do is select the row and right click
and press on the option insert now this
will insert one single row if you wanted
to add one single uh row or you know tle
and if you wanted to add multiple rows
for example you wanted to add three rows
Al together then it's also simple all
you have to do is select three
rows and right click and press on insert
and then you have three rows so there
you go so that's how you add multiple
rows in a Excel spreadsheet or that's
how you add one single Row in an Excel
spreadsheet now on my spreadsheet you
can see some data which is the sales
data of quarterly basis and the four
different zones that is north West
Southeast so you can you know make
things look better by hiding these
columns and if you hide these columns
it's critical for the end user to
identify which columns are exactly
hidden right to make things a little
easier for your end user you can select
the columns and then go to the data
option and in the data option click on
the group option so this will group
these columns and you will have the
symbol of minimization which will help
you hide these columns automatically and
unhide these columns automatically now
let's also try to group GH J
columns and there you go now similarly
let's also try to group the row of
North and row of
West then you have the row of
South and row of
East right now all these rows and
columns are been grouped now all you can
do is just click on the minimize button
and those will be minimized similarly
the rul right and to unhide them all you
can do is click on the plus icon and
they will be
unhidden you can also try to ungroup the
columns and rows all you have to do is
select the columns and click on the
ungroup option similarly the row as
well
and that's how you can group and ungroup
now comparing two different columns or
multiple columns happens to be an
important job when you're working in
data analytics as you have to come up
with some decisive decisions based on
the data now if you had to do it
manually then you might end up taking
hours or even days based on the data set
you're working with but if I say that
you can do it within minutes then it
would be interesting to work with right
now we'll be doing the same now we'll
work on a sample data set right on my
screen so here we have column 1 and
column two now our job is to compare the
column 1 and column two and come up with
the result now the first and the
simplest way to do it is use the
built-in conditional formatting which
comes with Excel by default now all you
have to do is select all the data and
navigate to home and in the home go to
Styles group and select conditional
formatting
and in conditional formatting you can
see highlight cells so in that you can
use duplicate values when you click on
duplicate values a small pop-up window
will come on your screen and here you
have an option of choosing whether
duplicate or unique so duplicate means
you're comparing the cells and you can
see there are some duplicate cells which
are present in column one are also
present in column 2 now you can also
check how to uh you know find out the
unique Val which are only present in
column 1 but not in column two so you
can just press unique and there you go
you can find it now you can also try to
you know change the color by filling
with green for The Unique columns and
duplicate cells with color red now this
was the first method and you can also
work out some different ones like uh you
can just directly uh press equal to and
select the cell and equals to and the
next cell press enter and if there is a
match it will give you true if there is
no match then it will give you false now
you can drag it down and see which all
are matching and which all are not now
you can also make some minute
modifications to this so uh if in case
you didn't find the data then you can
say not found so for that uh you can try
if and inside brackets and then you can
give the value as not found if true it's
found first you have to give the True
Values so for true you can write it as
found and in case if it's not found then
you can write it down as not
found there you go close the bracket
press enter and there you go if there is
a perfect match you will have found and
if there is no match then you'll get not
found now so far we have discussed uh
comparing two cells using conditional
formatting and also by us using equals
to operator and trying to uh add some
tweaks to the equals to Operator by
involving with if operator and apart
from those we also have another way to
compare two columns in Excel so another
way is using the lookup functions so
we'll use a simple V lookup function to
compare both the cells so for that let's
type in equals to we look
up space and um select the cell you want
to check for and then the range of
elements you want to uh compare and then
I'll press F4 to log
them now uh you want the data from
column
one and now you want the exact match so
zero press enter so there you go so the
elements which are present in column one
and column two are been displayed here
so but in case if the elements are not
found you'll get an error so let's look
at that simply drag the formula to all
the cells and there you go so the
elements which are matching will give
you the proper result but the ones which
are not matching will give you not
applicable or error message this can be
fixed we can make some minor tweaks to
the same
formula so uh we can add if
error
comma simply write an as not
found and close the bracket so that
should do so we have closed the bracket
and press enter there you go now simply
drag this and soon you can see the the
data which is having no match is shown
as not
found now uh there is another
possibility okay let's get back to
another different sheet so this should
work so uh we we already have the
formula so let's erase that first I'll
erase the whole
data and even this
one yeah now we have the clear column
for so here you can see we have Ford
India and here you can see we have just
Ford and similarly here you have
Mahendra and Mahendra and here you have
Mahendra right so in some situations you
might have to compare two different
columns but the names might be a little
different right so for example uh if
you're working with Oracle and if you're
working with Oracle America and you have
in the first case is Oracle and in the
second column is Oracle America then
those are one same but you have some
minor text changes right just like here
you have for India and here you have
Ford so what if you had such kind of
issues so you can also make some minor
tweaks to it so using the same lookup
formula you can add equals to we look
up and also the comparison cell which is
this one and you're not you're not
stopping there you're trying to add the
wild card here so the wild card is hter
which means if there is anything like uh
if you get the comparison between the
first cell and the second cell which
matches and if there is anything extra
rather than the actual cell please try
to consider it so that's what we're
going to do so after entering entering
the wild card symbol you'll select the
range of columns which you have to uh
you know fetch the data from and then
try to fix them using function key
F4 you're looking from the column number
one and then you're finding the exact
match now you can close it and
enter now let's try to drag
it there you go so you have the data
Mahindra and Mahindra hindai India Honda
India so that's how you try to use now
without further Ado let's get started
with the Practical mode now we have
started our Excel worksheet and here you
can see we have employee details on our
worksheet now all of a sudden uh you
wanted to add employee second name as
well or a last name right so you are a
beginner and you don't know how to add a
column or you know you might be a little
ambiguous right so instead of using this
simple step you might end up creating a
whole new sheet or maybe other
approaches as well which are time
consuming so let me give you this simple
step all you have to do is select the
column so so here you wanted to add a
last name right so B is your column with
the first name and here you wanted to
add a second name or the last name which
is in between the columns B and C so
remember that Excel adds a column always
towards the left side of a column so
here if I if you wanted to add a column
next to V then you want to select the
column C and right click and select the
insert option so that it can be added in
between B and C which is adjacent to B
so so let's look at it right so you have
added the next uh column or a new column
right next to the column V and it's in
between the designation and employee
name now you can add your you know
second name so that's how you create a
new column in Excel now in case if you
wanted to you know create multiple
columns Al together so uh here we have
or here we needed a second name also
here you have a designation and you
wanted to add another column which you
know assigns managers to the employees
right so let's delete it uh Delete the
second column and let me explain you how
what I want to do so here you wanted to
add the second name of the employee and
also the manager of these employees
right so here you wanted to add two
columns Al together right uh and now you
might be wondering could I add two
columns together uh or will it work only
for the one column thing right no it it
works for two columns and also more than
two columns alt together so you wanted
to add two columns here right so select
the two columns you you can select or
you can click on the column C and hold
that left key and drag it along the
right side okay so here I've have
selected two columns and here it's three
right so you can see here uh it's one 0
48 5 6 7 6 are cross 3 C that means you
have selected three columns if if I
navigate on the four you can see we have
selected four columns right now right
click and select on insert and you'll
have four columns in between employee
name and designation now you might have
to add your second name manager's name
manager's employee ID you know and the
department everything or you can add
anything or any number of columns in
between the existing columns so that's
how you add columns in Excel and with
that we have come to an end of this
session on how how to add columns or how
to add multiple columns in Excel let's
get started with our one point agenda
that is how to add two columns in
Excel so first let us assume that we are
trying to add two columns in Excel which
has textual kind of data this type of
data can be added using the concat
function which is a string concatenation
function in Excel so type in concat
press Tab Key to select the function the
first cell that is A2 and next the
second cell that is V2 separated by
comma press enter and there you go now
you can see we don't have a space so you
can modify the formula add
space double codes space double Cotes
comma press enter there you go now you
can drag the same formula across all the
cells and you have it now coming to the
last column where we literally have
numbers right so you can add two
different numbers over here either you
can select the first cell that is D2
plus E2 and press enter and you get the
number or you can use the sum function
tab to select
and
1 two press enter or another simplest
way is select all the blank output cells
so these are the cells where you're
expecting an output of two cells that is
column entire column D and entire column
e right now after selecting the LS of f
column or the resultant column press the
shortcut key that is alt equals to so
this is the shortcut method to call the
sum function and assign the cell values
of individual columns that is d and e
and get the resultant cell in F column
right so remember the shortcut key that
is ALT key now you can see I'm on my
Excel worksheet and I have one table on
my worksheet right now so you can you
know transport closing or you know
converting rows to columns is a very
simple task I'll explain you in two
different ways so the first way select
all the sales that you have on your
sheet and press on contrl C so it will
give you the copy option and then you
can also paste in the same sheet or if
you want you can go to a whole new sheet
and select the paste option over here
but before selecting the actual paste
option you can see a small drop- down
icon click on that
and navigate to paste special and in
this you can see transpose option click
on that or you know make sure that it's
checked and press okay now you can see
all your columns have been converted
into rows and all your rows are
converted into columns so this was the
first way and uh what is the second way
you ask me so it's really simple select
one cell
somewhere and you know you can or let's
create a new sheet as well so here you
can you know write down the formula as
transpose and select the array which you
want to transpose so this is the
array so transpose is basically an array
function in Excel so once you are done
with you know selecting your data press
enter there you go so all your rows are
now columns and all your columns are now
the rows that is how to convert cells
from lowercase proper case in Excel now
let's get back to the Practical mode and
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet so
here we have some text boxes on the
column A and on column B we have lower
and upper okay so um we have a mix of uh
uppercase and lower case in our text so
first we'll try to convert them to lower
case and then we'll try to convert the
entire text into uppercase so for that
you need to press on equal symbol and
select the lower formula
tap and you selected the function and
now click on the cell A3 that's your
cell address and press on okay now all
the letters are converted to lowcase so
we had J in the uppercase which is
converted to lower case now all you can
do is drag the formula to all the cells
and it will be applied to all the cells
right now let's similarly try to convert
into uppercase and tab space and there
you go you have selected the formula now
the cell address
press
enter and drag the same address I mean
drag the same formula to all the cell
addresses and the EO all the cells are
converted to uppercase now that's how
you convert the cells or data in Excel
to uppercase or lowercase in Excel we
have uh already learned some basic
operations which you can do in Excel and
let's Implement our knowledge by working
on this particular data which is coming
in from housing data set now here if we
see some fields we have agent date
listed area list price and this is
basically the data which has been sorted
in newest to oldest order of date listed
so how do we arrive at this so what I
can do is I can just click on data
listed and then I can either go in here
I can select sort I can get into customs
sort and then I can choose the column
based on which I would want to sort the
data so I would look for the newest data
to the oldest data that means that would
be in a descending order of dates or you
could say the oldest date or the
earliest month will be towards the lower
side of your sheet so here we can select
date listed now I can say let it sort
based on Cell values and the order what
we have here so we have newest to oldest
so let's select this I can say okay and
now if you see the date has been sorted
so we have your 1018 2007 on the top so
that seems to be the latest date and as
we go down we will see an earlier month
hour and earlier month than that in this
date listed so we have sorted our data
into newest to old oldest order and
that's based on your date column so the
result shows up here now what we can
also do is we can have different
questions which we would want to answer
so for example I would want to sort the
data in ascending order of area and
descending order of agent name how do we
do that so let's look into this so this
is here I already have the result here
and how did I get this so I'm looking
for ascending order of area and
descending order of agent name so we can
start with any particular column that
does not matter so for example if I look
into this Excel sheet I have my agent
name select this which we want in a
descending order so we could either do a
sort and then go for descending sort Z2
a we could also use the filter option
here on the top right and we could do it
or I could just says sort Z2 a and then
it has arranged the data based on the
agent column being in descending order
now I can go into area and then I can
again do a sort and I wanted my area
column to be used for sorting the data
in ascending to descending and that
basically not only changes the order of
this particular column but for my
complete data so let's do that and now
if you see we have have the data which
has been sorted so we can see how many
values we have here and the area values
which we see and this is how you get
your result so I'll just do a contrl zed
and again and I'm back to my original
data and this is the sorted result which
we are seeing at similarly we can answer
other questions for example sort the
data according to the following order of
area that is we are saying
County Central and then your county so
we can basically choose in which
particular way we would want to do it so
it is County Central and then again
County so if I look into my sheet three
so here I basically have my data which
is having some South County then you
have your Central and then you have your
North County so we would want to sort
the data to solve our problem which is
according to the following order so
first we go for area then we go for
South County Central and North County so
what we can do is we can basically have
area field selected and I would want to
sort this particular data so I have
South County Central and North County so
I can basically go for custom sort
and then I can choose which is the value
or column which I'm interested in let's
go for area we will go for something
like cell values well you can also try
to explore conditional formatting icon
if this is what you would want to use or
we can basically go for just sell values
and here we can say if I would be
interested in first getting my values
for
South County so for example I can say
custom list and then I can basically
given the new list here so I can say
s dot
County and then I would want Central and
then I would want North County so let's
select
this as it exists we can basically say
add and that's basically the order which
we want say okay and then say okay here
and now what we would want is we would
want our data so we can compare that
with the values which we see here it
starts with Kelly you have in the 12 row
something like Lang and that's what we
are doing so we can basically arrange
the data in a particular order by
choosing a custom list and then sorting
your data so that's one more simpler
task what we have done where we have
sorted the data in the order where under
our area column we first wanted South
County then we wanted Central data and
then we wanted North County so this is
how you can do it now let's look into
one more problem so it says find all the
houses in the central area and we would
want to basically apply a regular filter
let's let's see how do we do that so we
can click on this and here we have the
data so the problem statement is we
would want to find all the houses in
Central Area now how do we do that we
can do a sorting but we would want to
use the filter which you see here is
implemented so how do you do it so you
can select this area and say for example
I would want to apply filter I can just
go in here and I can say let's get a
filter on my first row and now I have
filters applied so we are interested in
looking into the Central Area houses
let's go in here it says all these
fields are selected that means it shows
everything wherein your area has all
these values let's unselect this and
then I will only be interested in the
central so let's say okay and then say
okay so now you see the D area filter
has been applied and we are looking at
the central column so what we have done
is we have applied the simple filter and
we are looking at our data at any point
of time if you do not want the
filter then what I can do is I can
select this and I can say well I'm
interested in all the data so I could do
this or you can clear the filters from
area and you get your data back so so
that's in one way you can filter out
your data so let's look at an example of
sort and filter where we might have to
filter the data based on two columns or
multiple columns with different kind of
values where it could be and and or
condition now say for example this is
the data I have and this is the question
which we need to answer such as find the
list of all houses in the central region
with pool and South County without pool
now if it was a simple filter based on
one cell I could have just selected my
header row I could have then applied the
filter and once I have the filter I can
look in area where I have three regions
so I'm only interested in Central and
South County so I can get it of North
County and that's fine but then we have
two different conditions here so we need
need the data in central region to have
the value for pool being true and for
South County the value has to be without
pool now how do we do that so what we
can do is we can first create a copy of
these headers here so let me do that now
the area has to be South County so
basically I can either just select this
and I can choose this
value and then I can select this and
then I can choose Central so that's the
criteria which I have and the pool value
has to be so central region should be
with pool so then this one basically has
to be
true and this one has to be basically
false so South County is without pool so
let's select one of the values here and
this is my criteria now to get my result
uh we can always place your cursor here
and you can check this is M column and
eth row okay so we would want the result
here so let's go ahead and now click on
data and then in filter you have an
option called Advanced and here what I
can do is I can say I would want to
filter the list in the place but that's
not what I would want to do so I'll say
copy to another location and here if you
see the list range will tell me that
this is the data so A1 to J 126 so a to
J column selected and all the rows
criteria range is basically based on
what I've given here so that is
M from 1 to V which is three so I'm
selecting these columns and then I'm
saying all the way whatever criteria
I've given and copy two I'm saying
M8 to V8 so that basically will give me
my filtered result so you could
basically just say okay and now I have
my data which has been filtered and I
have my area which is South County that
is without Pool Central with pool again
South County without pool and then if
you look at your central value that's
pool so this is an advanced filter which
we have applied where simply we have
filtered the databased on two columns
and then we have our result so in this
way you can have your customized filter
applied on two different columns and get
your data which can be either replacing
the existing content or in the same
sheet in different set of columns and
rows you can have your result let's look
at one more example of filtering where
you are trying to filter the data based
on a and condition condition being met
in two different columns and then you
would want to filter out the data for
only specific columns so the situation
is the agents with a house in North
County that should be County area having
two and a single type family family so
we are talking about two bedrooms and we
would basically have a single type
family and here the criteria is that we
would want to only populate these
columns which is Agent area bedroom and
type now what you can do is as I
explained earlier that you can get your
result in the same sheet in a different
location so here I have created these
headers which says agent area bedrooms
and type now this is basically a copy of
all the columns what we have here agent
data listed area list price bedrooms
bath square feet and so on so you can
basically create a copy of the headers
here and this is where we will give our
Advanced criteria to filter the data so
the conditions which need to be met is
we need to look at North County so for
example here in area I can basically go
ahead and select one of the values North
County now the criteria is having two
bedrooms only so let's say bedrooms and
let's say the value should be two and
then basically I'm saying a single type
family so when you would want the single
type family so here under type I can
give the criteria single type so this is
my and condition so we are saying North
County area having two bedrooms and the
type is single family now this is the
criteria which basically means if I
select this this one tells me that this
is M1 row onwards till V two so this is
what we have and we would want to filter
based on this so let's go ahead and then
go for data filter Advanced and here in
advanced it says filter the list in
place now that's not what we would want
to do so I'll say copy to another
location this basically selects the list
range so which is telling me
A1 to J 126 so that's
the columns and rows selected criteria
range is based on M1 V2 which we have
given here and copy to I would say for
example from M7 to p 7 now this is the
area where I would this is the place
where I want the result let's stay okay
and now I get my data which is based on
the question which has been asked that
you would want the agents with a house
in North County area having two bedrooms
and single type family so in this way
you can basically do Advanced filtering
get your data and get it stored in the
sheet anywhere at a different location
well I could have also done filtering in
place and that would have replaced the
data which we have but that's not what
we want we would want the filtered
result in a different place so this is
how you can do some Advanced filtering
we can also use Excel to filter out the
data in one particular column which
might be conditional or say using some
numerical filters now here say for
example the problem statement is that
you would want to display all the houses
whose list price is
between 45,000 to
600,000 or say for example we would want
to filter out the data to something else
say for example let's say I have I would
want to filter out the data between
300,000 and 400,000 so we can basically
update this say for example I'm saying
I'm interested in
300,000
to
400,000 and that's the criteria to
filter out the data now there are two
different ways or there are two easier
ways to do it one is I would want to
look at the list price so I can select
this I can go ahead and do a filter here
and in the list price now this is where
we would want to do the filter ing so
it's pretty easy you can click on this
one and then you can go into number
filters and you can choose between now
that's one easier way of doing it so I
could basically select this I could say
I'm looking for Value which is greater
than or equal to
300,000 and then is less than or equal
to
400,000 so if I just do this I have
applied my filter and I have my data
which which is filtered based on my
criteria right so that's one easier way
of doing it or let me do a control
Z Now let the filter be there which you
can anyways use but what we can also do
is as we have seen earlier methods so
get a set or get your column headers
here and then you are giving two columns
here now the only difference between
my this set of columns which I have 1 2
3 4 and then you have seven and 10
columns and if you see here we have 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 11 right so whenever you want
a add condition you will basically add
the columns where I can give add
condition if it is the same column if it
was a different column then it would be
same number of columns but and
conditions will lie in the same line and
or condition would lie in a different
line now here I can give this value so
I'm looking for listed price being
between 300,000 so I'm saying it should
be greater than or equal to
300,000 and then I can say less than or
equal to 400,000 now that's my criteria
and then I need my here which is in
M7 so what I can do is once I have given
my criteria which I'll be using to
filter I can get into Data I can get
into advanced and then I can say copy to
another location so it is selecting my
A1 to J
126 criteria range is based on M1 to
W2 and then I would want my result from
this particular column so so let's say
okay and now you have your data filtered
out in a different location in the sheet
which has been filtered based on your
and condition so you can filter out the
data in this way or you could just apply
a filter on a column and give the
conditions now let's solve one more
interesting problem and here we would
want to use Excel where we would have an
and and an or condition so say for
example this is the data given to you
and the question is that you would want
to find all the houses in North County
again that's spelling mistake but then
they North County area with a list price
greater than
300,000 and having three or four
bedrooms so the bedroom has conditional
so it has or three and four and then
basically you have list price which is
greater than 300,000 now I could have
obviously
selected The Columns and then basically
gone for a filter so I can just do a
filtering here and then I'm looking for
list price being greater than 300,000 so
which we can always give a number filter
and I can say greater than and then I
can say greater than or equal so I can
say greater than and then I can give 3,3
300,000 and that's basically the filter
which we would want and here I would
want to select the bedrooms which should
be just either three or four so if for
example I go in here and I unselect this
and then I say three and four right so I
am getting my data which is greater than
300,000 and it should have the beding
values which will be either three or
four selected now that's one way of
doing it let's do a controll zed and get
it back to as we were or you can even
just say clear filter so you get your
data back as it was so what we can do is
we can here give the criteria so for
example I have my list price now this is
what I would want as a condition so
let's say greater than
300,000
300,000 and bedrooms should be
three and then I can say greater then
300,000 and then I can say four so this
one basically gives me a situation where
your list price has to be greater than
300,000 and bedroom should be either
three or four so we have given our
filtering criteria now to get the result
what we can do is we can go into Data we
can can go into advanced and we can say
copy to another location so our list
range is selected which is columns a to
J row number 1 to 126 your criteria
range is given in M1 to V3 where we have
specified and we are saying the result
would be in M7 to V7 so if I do this now
I have got the same data which we were
seeing earlier and here the bedroom
values are three or four and basically
the list price is greater than 300,000
so this is a simpler way in which you
can create your filters and all this
Advan filtering what we are seeing it
will be saved with your sheet you can
always go back and change this value or
you could do filtering where one person
has to look into the filter to see what
values have been having said that if you

please click the link in the description
box below how to modify or increase Sal
size in Excel now most of you might
probably want to increase just the sales
as you know just to increase the
visibility of of the text so one of the
easiest way is just to press on the plus
icon on the bottom right corner of your
Excel spreadsheet so this will
automatically increase the text size and
you can see the text more clearly now
apart from that if it's just not that
what you want to do you can also modify
by hovering over to the line between two
columns and right click which will give
you the option of format cells or column
width so either either of these options
will help you to maximize or minimize
your column width similarly you can
apply the same idea for your rows as
well so you can either format the cells
or modify the row height of your cell
and this is another way and another
simple way is to just hold that line and
drag it so it improves your width of the
column and another way is to just over
onto that line and hold it and drag it
to improvise or increase your width of
the cell and same applies to your row so
this is another way so apart from that
there is another way that is format
cells from this particular option in the
home button you can select this and here
you have the row height autofit row
height column width auto fit column
width for example let us imagine that
you wanted to you know just by mistake
you uh you increase the cell size and
you want it to restore it back to the
original thing right so you can just
click on the the autoit height and click
on the autofit column width there you go
it happens in that way and now coming
back to another sist way let us imagine
that you are given a lot of data and you
are told to autoit all the rows and
columns now we have already seen the
format cell option where we will autof
fit all the columns and width of the
colum and also the height of the rows
Etc right but there is also a keyboard
shortcut to do this so all you have to
do is select a cell and press CR a to
select all the cells in the spreadsheet
and once all the cells are selected all
you have to do is press and hold ALT key
and then release it then the combination
of keys that is h o i so your column
width has been now adjusted now the same
formula or the same shortcut key with a
small modification press and hold and
release ALT key now h o and a to adjust
the row height so this is the way where
you can increase or decrease or modify
or autofit all the cells in Excel with
that we have come to an end of this
session on how to modify or increase
cell size in Excel if you have any
queries regarding any of the topics
covered in this session how to add date
in Excel spreadsheet now there are
multiple ways to add date to Excel
spreadsheet for example equals to today
this is a shortcut method and you can
enter done you will have today state but
again there is some problem with this
kind of approach so today's date is 4th
of September 2022 now if you open the
same spreadsheet after today that is
tomorrow or day after tomorrow then you
will have a concurrent date that is 5th
of September or 6th of September right
the date will always vary or get updated
according to time now you you don't want
to change that or you don't want that to
be happening with employe state of
joining right it should be stagnant it
should not vary right so there is
another shortcut way apart from using
the datetime functions there is a
keyboard shortcut where you can add date
to excel that is control semicolon so
this is the shortcut way to add date to
your Excel spreadsheet and this
particular date will not change this
will remain the same constant date
throughout the time now there is a
chance where you might also have to add
time to your spreadsheet that is date of
joining and time of joining right so
there is another simple shortcut where
you can add time by just pressing three
keys that is holding control holding
shift and pressing semicolon then you'll
have the time so this is how you can add
date to your Excel spreadsheet and add
time to your Excel spreadsheet and this
date and time will remain constant it
will not vary like the 2D function that
we have used here now we are on our
Excel spreadsheet now you might want to
you know add uh some extension to your
data since we have sales here you might
want to add the dollar logo right so if
you have like five to 10 rows then it's
easy but if you have multiple rows then
it might be a little time consuming in
such scenarios you might want to select
the entire column right so how do you do
that in a shortest method so there are
multiple methods to do it so the easiest
one the first and the e iest one is
clicking on the column number or column
name so here we have the column name
that is e and if you click on it the
entire column is selected and here we
have numbers so let us imagine that you
wanted to select the row number two
click on number two and you have all the
rows I mean the entire row selected all
the cells are
selected right so this is one way and
again there is another way where you can
just you know uh click on the first
table header and press control spacebar
so the combination key is control
spacebar for columns and if you want to
select the entire row it is shift space
bar so this is the method two and
another method so you might have a doubt
here right so when you click on the
column name or when you click on the row
number the entire row or entire column
gets selected right and you wanted to
select only the cells which have data so
you have another way for that so you can
select the cell now hold the control and
shift key and press the lower Arrow key
to select the entire column with cells
having data so there you go you have
selected all the cells in one single
column with only data and all the cells
which do not have data are not selected
same applies to rows as well control
shift right arrow key or left Arrow key
based on your rows and all the rows with
data will be selected I mean all the
celles in a row are selected not the
entire row and U coming back to the
first question that is adding the dollar
symbol so here we have General so go to
the data type and add
currency so you have rupees here so
currently we are in India so we have
rupees now what is the advantage of
selecting the entire row when you don't
have any data in the 57th row or the
next cell right I'll show you now let us
add the number 100 and press enter there
you go let us add another number like
th000 and press enter so the data
formatting is automatically applied to
all the cells so most of the time your
cells or the data sheet will be varying
you might have to add or remove elements
or numbers right so in such scenarios
this will be helpful so you can see that
I've got some data which is first name
of the employee last name of the
employee and phone number and let us
assume that uh your manager has given
you a task to to identify all those uh
employees which did not give an phone
number so you wanted to identify them
using a check box right like you will be
providing a check for all the employees
that we have received the phone numbers
and you will not be checking the
employees which did not give the phone
number right so let's try to do that so
to include a checkbox you might want to
get into the developer option but for
few reasons Microsoft soft has disabled
developer option by default to enable
developer option all you have to do is
just navigate anywhere on the ribbon
here and right click and then you can
see customize the ribbon option when you
click into it you will be redirected
into the ribbon option and here you can
see the developer option on the right
side right this one so by default you
can see that your developer option is
not enabled to enable it you have have
to check in it and there you go you have
it now so press okay and you'll have the
developer option now go to the developer
option and select the insert option and
there you can see the checkbox now draw
the checkbox
anywhere I'll draw it over here and
there you go you have the first check
box right now if you want you can even
customize
this
so carefully click
it you can edit the
text and write it
as
done okay
now you can even copy this to all the
celles just select and drag and there
you go now you can go ahead and check
all the employees which you have
received the phone numbers and you can
eliminate the ones which did not provide
you with the phone
numbers that's how you can do it and
there's also another option where you
can use this to include it in a formula
since this data is only of 25 rows you
can manually check in the data and you
can leave the data which is you have not
received but what if you had 2500 right
then you might need formula so in such
scenarios you can use a formula so how
do you use that so for example uh if
this particular box is checked then you
will will get a True Value here and if
it's not checked you will have a false
value then you can use that Boolean
value to include in your formula right
sounds interesting now let's try to
implement that you can right click the
cell and you can find format
control then you can see here you have
an option called cell link here select
the cell
link and press okay so here you can see
if you have checked this the value is
true and if you uncheck
this you can see the value turned false
now you can use this particular cell
reference for including this in a
formula now let us also check how to
include checkboxes on Google Sheets in
Google sheet it's really simple all you
have to do is get into the insert option
and you can see a readily available
check box you don't have to use any
developer options over here and there
you go you can just check and check it
now here on my sheet you can see we have
some numbers that is $10 or
$10.20 $22 $ 53.1 two $12 and $110 now
the task is to convert these numbers
into word format that is representing
the numbers alphabetically right this
might be a little curious and we also
might end up searching for a predefined
method which is not readily available in
Excel but there is a way where you can
create a function using EXL VBA or
macros now again creating a macro is
completely complex now identifying the
trouble Microsoft has already come up
with a readily available macro code on
their official website which will
support the various versions of
Microsoft Excel starting from Microsoft
Excel 365 to all the way up to the older
Excel version that is 2010 now you can
scroll down and use this particular
macro function which micros moft has
readily made us available and use this
to create our own macro in Excel VBA now
let's get back to Excel and you can
create a macro using the developer
option now developer options will not be
readily available in Microsoft Excel to
activate developer option go to home and
go to the options menu in the
last and here go to customize ribbon and
here in the second drop down menu you
can see developer option by default it
will not be checked click on the check
option to activate developer options and
press okay now you have your developer
options ready click on developer options
click on Visual Basic and here to insert
a new macro click on the insert button
click on module and a new macro window
is readily available for you now control
V to paste your code and your function
is with the name number to text right
now close the
matro and here your function will be
readily
available equals to and the function
name was number to text press tab to
select the function and select the cell
where you have the data close the
function press enter now drag the same
formula across all the cells and here
you have the text converted from numbers
so here we have $10.20 and you have $102
$22 and no C $53 12 $12 and no cents and
$110 with no sense now that's how you
can convert numbers to words using the
macro which is predefined for excel in
the Microsoft website head back to the
Practical mode and you can see now we
are on our Excel spreadsheet and you can
see we have a column of dates and on the
column B we have age now how do you
calculate the age using the DAT of birth
so this is is completely simple all you
have to use is the dated IF function or
if you also call it as date diff
function based on your choice we also
have a specific entire tutorial based on
date diff in Excel for further
information that video will be linked in
the description box below you can go
through it or you can use the end
screens and I Cuts link to this video to
get back to the tutorial based on date
diff in Excel now let's calculate the
age of these dates or these people with
these date of births so all you have to
do is type equals to and type dated
F and open a bracket we need three
parameters here that is the date of
birth that is the first parameter now
the second one is the today function
because you're calculating the age of
these people as per today right so we
have a today function in Excel press on
Tab to select it and give a close
bracket now comma and if you want to to
calculate the age in terms of days you
have to um you know give d as the
input yeah here it should be D as the
input and don't forget to use the double
codes here and if you use the single
codes there might be an error so use
double codes if you want it in the Days
part you can give days and if you want
it in months you can give months for now
we want in ear so we will be giving y as
the third parameter and press enter
there you go you have the age here in 26
years you can drag the same function and
you have the ages here as you wanted
right so this is how you calculate age
in Excel now on my spreadsheet you can
see some employee data so they've been
assigned a task and they want to update
the task status as done and not done
using symbolic statements that is tick
mark and into marks now how to do that
it is really simple we'll discuss two
different ways the first best way is to
do it by conditional formatting so click
a cell on the task status go to
conditional formatting click on the new
rule yes of course we can use the icon
settings but we want to automate it so
click on the new rule right so here
instead of two color scale select icon
sets now go to the settings here we
don't want the third symbol so select no
cell icon and here instead of percentage
number formula let's add just a simple
number and the second one as well just a
simple number now in the icon settings
select Tech Mark you have various types
of them you know the circular Tech Mark
and let's select the generic Tech Mark
without any outer circles and into here
generate x mark and now let's set the
values when the value is greater than
zero it will be green and when the value
is less than or equal to zero it will be
X and the reference value is zero and
here also the reference value is zero
everything is okay click on okay and
done and here you cannot see the logos
yet we need to add some formula here
which is equals to if click on Tab to
select the symbol and if Cell address C2
is equals to
done then the value should be one else
the value should be zero close the
bracket
enter right now you can see this
particular logo here now drag the same
formula it's done now you can see we do
have numbers you can eliminate those
numbers as well just edit the
rules and here you can see show icon
only click okay and the numbers will be
removed also addit the second one and
there you go the numbers are gone and
only the symbols remain now what is the
second technique the second technique is
available in the developer options you
can activate it by you know uh going
into the options here go to file and
here go to options and here go to
Advanced customized ribbon and in here
on the right hand side you will get
developer options click on the tick box
and it will be enabled now go into
developer options and click into insert
menu click on the form controls or
active X controls select the checkbox
and now just place it over here you know
you can edit this particular checkbox
delete everything drag it as checkbox as
well now you can drag the same cell
across all the functions and you will
have the checkbox as well now you can
click on it and say if it's done or not
now we have started our Microsoft Excel
and here we have our empty worksheet so
dated IF function is majorly used to
find the differences between two
individual dates so it is also called as
dated if by a few people and a few
people also reference it to date diff
that is date difference so anything is
good now to find the difference between
any two dates let's select a few dates
so the first date would be uh let us
imagine that you're an employee and you
wanted to find out how many years that
you've been working with an organization
so for that you might want to need today
and the date where you join the company
right so it might be date of joining and
today so what's the difference right so
let us imagine that you join the
organization somewhere around
2010 0
1
05
2010 and today so for today can you can
give any particular
date let us imagine that uh today is 1st
of January 2021 or
2022
now we have up both the dates that is
the joining date and the current date
which can be the current date so the day
can be anything so you might be watching
this on a different date as well so the
date of that day for today would be a
little different so we'll imagine the
today's date as an imaginary date now we
might want to find the difference that
is in terms of years so you wanted to
find the difference in terms of ears so
here you can find the difference in
terms of ear dat and months as well so
currently let's try to find out the
difference in terms of years so for
years you might want to specify the
third parameter in the DAT function as y
if you wanted months you have to give
the M as the third parameter and if you
wanted to find the days you might want
to give d as the third parameter uh so
we have discussed the third parameter so
what are the first two parameters right
so the first two parameters are the
first date and the last date so the
first date in this situation is your
date of joining and the last date or the
final date which you want here as your
today so let's find the difference so
for that equals to so it can be dated F
or date
def so dat F and the first state which
is the A2 and comma the last state that
is B2 and your parameter third parameter
in terms of air status why close the
bracket and press enter so there you go
you have your date here so it's been
like 11 years that you're working with
your organization so that's how you find
out the differences so we have 11 years
because uh we did not finish the 12th
year completely so if we had given the
month as U maybe six where we have
finished our total years then it will
automatically change to 12 years so
that's how you work with dated F
function in Excel back to the Practical
mode so you can see on my screen we are
on the Excel spreadsheet and on my
spreadsheet you can see dates in column
A and different formats in column C D E
and F respectively Now by default the
data type or the data present in the a
column will be considered as general and
there are a few situations where even if
you try to format the date in your
format like you know the customized
format
you may not be able to do it because
it's still under the general data type
so for that for being on the safer side
what we will do is select the data and
navigate to the data toolbar and in that
you have the text to columns option
press that and remember to have the
delimited icon you know you might be
having the dash as your icon or slash as
your icon for the delimited thing and
select that and next next and here you
can see right it's in general mode so
you can press on date and DMI will be
your date format that is date month and
year now click on finish so it's been
formatted now now let's copy the same
data and paste it in all the four
formats so that will see the different
formats that we can change to or
customize to right so there you go let's
expand the columns a little bit now we
have day month and year so now you might
want to change a couple of things right
for example you wanted to change okay
let's see the menu so the way is to
select the CES and right click and
select the format sales option and in
here you can see the date function and
in here you can see different types of
modifications that you can do to your
data right
so you might want to also change your
dates based on the location so right now
we are in India and imagine if you
wanted to you know change something
based on us or if you have if you're
having your client in us and he wants
the dates in US format you can also
change that so here you can see English
United States and press on that press
okay and you can see it's been changed
to us format where you have years in the
first place months in the second place
and dates in the last place right and
now let us imagine that uh your client
does not want the dates all he needs is
just months right you can also do that
get back to the format sales option go
to custom and here instead of
uh you know uh month date and year all
you can do is just write down month and
year and select okay so you'll have only
month and year not the dates now your
client is being a little more you know
he wants a little more detail and he
wants you to add a lot of granularity to
your data which includes day time Etc
everything right so you can also do that
so the same way go to format sales
custom and here I think it's in date
itself so let's navigate a little yeah
here so you have the day date month and
year press okay so there you go right so
that's how you can do it and now let's
try a little bit more if we have a few
more options
pending so go to format
cells and
custom and you also have
timings so here you have date month year
and timings press okay and there you
have all the timings as well so since
these dates are you know I created them
just a few moments ago to keep it simple
so I did not have to add the diamonds
here so if you are Keen about adding the
Tims you can also do that for example if
you wanted to add the timings of the
employees logged in and logged out you
can also do that using the same format
now you can see that we have the First
Column that is a column and the first
set of that is text and all the other
cells are numbers but as a whole Excel
considers the whole column as a general
data format so why are we discussing
about this so to create a barcode in
Excel you have to make sure that all the
elements in the column are of Text data
type so the first step is to convert
this General data type to Text data type
so you can do that by going into the
data type and selecting text and now all
the elements in your first column A or
type
text now the next step is to convert
these elements into barcode now for that
let's create a new column called
barcode now our new column that is
barcode has been created now the next
step would be is to check for the
barcode font so the barcode font looks
something like this but let me remind
you the barcode font in Excel is not
available by
default don't worry if it's not
available we can download it from open
source so let's go back to
Google so on the Google you want to
search of for barcode font for Excel so
the one that I would recommend is three
of9 barcode
font now you can download this font by
just clicking on the download button
over here now I've already downloaded
this font on my local system let's now
try to install that now the three of9
barcode folder will come in the form of
zip folder you have to unzip that and
after unzipping you'll get the setup
file which looks something like this
which is three of9 new select that and
you'll be having the installer file over
here you can install by selecting the
install button over here so I have
already installed it in my local system
so it is readily available for me on my
Microsoft Excel now we might want to
create the barcode for this particular
cell in A2 so let's create that so to
create a barcode we need to write in a
formula that is equals to double
codes star double codes and ENT symbol
address of the cell that is A2 another
ENT symbol again double codes star
symbol and double codes so you can
either use this or instead of star you
can use brackets as
well so let's try brackets now select
enter now this will generate another
type of code in your resultant cell now
we will change the font for this
particular resultant cell and we will
get our barcode now you can just drag
all the cells so that you can apply the
formula to all the codes I got all the
codes over here now select all the cells
get into the fonts and here select the
barcode font and there you go you have
the barcode for all the numbers you have
in your column A so that's how you
create bar code in Excel spreadsheet and
this spreadsheet has some values of
employees that is their employee ID name
designation Department salary date of
birth and date of joining now our
concern is to highlight some cells which
are duplicate in this or some rows which
are duplicate so for example here you
can see on row number seven we have the
details of Mara and you can see the same
details of Mara in the row number 14 as
well right so you need to eliminate
those cells or you need to eliminate
those rows now you can say there is a
quick way just few clicks and those will
be eliminated that is conditional
formatting yes that is also one way but
I'll show you what's the problem with
that okay so let us select the entire
table and get into conditional
formatting and here you have duplicate
values highlight cell rules where
duplicate values and there you go the
problem so here we have designation
which is duplicated in certain ways
department and salary state of joining
right so there are certain conditions or
scenarios where you cannot directly
identify which is the duplicate row
again you can use the same for this
right so you can select the
entire uh column of employee ID and you
can uh identify the duplicate cells here
since the employee IDs are unique for
everyone so this is a way but let's dig
a little deeper and understand the way
of highlighting duplicates with an
advanced technique so let me cancel this
and for that let's create a new um
column and let's name this as duplicate
flag B
flag so the new column has been created
which is D flag so here we will be using
a simple formula that is Count F and
here press tab to select the formula and
here we will be adding our uh range that
is which range are you considering so
the range will be the employee ID since
employee IDs are unique for every
employee
and and let's press function F4 to fix
it and now uh again the criteria and the
criteria will be the same cell that is
A2 and now close the bracket and press
enter now let's track the same formula
to all the
rows okay now here we have now what you
can do is uh sort it in an advanced way
go to sort and filter and custom sort
and here you'll be sorting by the D flag
and it will be smallest to largest
so now uh you can apply the conditional
formatting to highlight it you can
select the column H or the D flag go to
conditional formatting highlight cell
rules and here you can get into greater
than and give the value as one okay so
all the cells which are you know
repeated multiple times will be selected
here and they will be highlighted with a
selected color what you have given so
I've given red so now you can select
these cells and highlight them or delete
them from your
spreadsheet and now all your data in the
spreadsheet is unique and clean so
that's how you highlight duplicate cells
in Excel on my screen you can see some
data related to students now let us try
to duplicate some of the rows
here
so we have selected the rows 8 9 10 and
11 now we shall copy them and paste in
so now these are the duplicate elements
right now there might be possibilities
about the duplication of class because
all the students all the 10 students are
in same class so there might be a
duplication but we are not looking for
such kind of duplications right we are
looking for the duplication of the
entire Row for example we have the
details of mik over here in the eighth
row which has the role number or serial
number as seven name as mic role number
class blood group and subject scores
percentage round of percentage and total
marks so the entire eighth row is been
copied here and it is in the row number
12 we have the exact same details so
what if you have the exact same rows
duplicated so that's what we're going to
deal with we going to eliminate the
duplicate rowes all completely together
now to carry over this task we have to
select the data from toolbar so you have
various options file home insert Etc so
you need to select the data and inside
data toolbar we have the ribbon and
inside ribbon you have got the duplicate
values or remove duplicates uh option in
the ribbon so select all the data select
remove duplicates and now you can see
that we have all our
uh column names over here and make sure
that you have selected my data as
headers and then select okay and now you
can see that Excel has automatically
removed four duplicate values so four
duplicate values are found and removed
10 unique values remain now another type
of uh remove duplicates can also be done
so you can see that here we have another
data set which has phone numbers or
phone names that phone makers that is
Samsung Huawei Vio Oppo Etc so there are
some duplicate values in this I've copy
pasted them so now you can also do that
so just select all the
data and now go into home and select
conditional formatting and here select
highlight cell rules and inside that you
have duplicate values selecting this
option will help you identify the
duplicate values in your data set but
not to remove them so you can select
that and you can see the duplicate
values are highlighted over here in the
red color now again you can get back to
data and select the option of remove
duplicates and select okay and the
duplicate values will be automatically
eliminated so that's how you delete or
eliminate duplicate values in uh data
set and you can also see that we have
another duplicate in this particular row
and if you wanted to select a particular
row and eliminate the duplicates you can
also do that now for that you need to go
to the same process remove duplicates
and here Microsoft Excel is asking you
if you had to expand the selection to
the entire data set or you want to
continue with the selected data set
itself or selected column itself so for
that you need to select the continue
with the current selection and remove
duplicates and and press okay and you
can see one duplicate value was found
and it has been removed and six unique
values remain so that's how you use the
function of removing duplicates in Excel
so on my screen you can see a simple
spreadsheet with student names and their
marks on my sheet so we will be
calculating what are the total marks
obtained by the students in overall
subjects and calculate what is the
percentage now we will carry forward few
simple inbuilt functions in Excel to
calculate that first we will be
calculating the sum of marks so here
equals to sum
function and select the range of
cells close the bracket press enter so
you have the sum
now so we have to calculate it repeat so
by clicking on the same formula now we
have the total of all the sub objects
for individual students and now let's
calculate percentage so usually we use
the you know divide by option that is
divide the total number of marks
obtained by the total number of marks
available that is we will be dividing 47
by 500 and then we will be multiplying
that into 100 so that's how we calculate
the percentage
so sell G2 divided by cell H2 press
enter and you will up with you know uh
the decimal format that's perfectly all
right now we have also extended the same
formula for all our cells now select
this overall column or select the
highlighted cells right and get into the
data type here you have General so
that's why we have got that uh decimal
format but when you press percentage
you'll have the actual percentage of all
the students according to their marks
achieved so that's how you calculate
percentage in Excel now on my screen you
can see the sales of four quarters from
different regions that is east west
south north and Central now you might
want to calculate the sum of sales
happened from all the regions in q1 or
you might want to calculate the sum of
sales happened in one region of all the
four quarters that is either you want to
calculate the sum of all the regions
from quarter 1 one or you might want to
calculate the sum of all the quarters in
one region right so to do this you have
some simple functions in Excel so you
might say me you have some function Etc
right for that you might want to go into
the you know equals to mode and fetch
some option and subtotal or some you
have to select the function from here
but what if I tell you that there is one
simple easy shortcut where you just have
to make one single click and you'll have
all the sum right right so that seems
interesting so on the top in the home
bar select home and in on the top right
corner you have the editing group in
editing group you have aggregation
function that is summation so you have
different aggregations here some average
count numbers maximum minimum more
functions here you might want to select
the sum and you can get all the
sumission numbers here so I'll select
one cell so the second query where we
wanted to calculate this sum of all the
sales happened in east region with all
the quarters included that is this one
C2 to F2 right so let us select G2 and
select the auto sum option and here it
will automatically select the range for
you that is C2 to FS2 if you want to
change it you can also you know change
it like minimize the number if you just
wanted to calculate the sum of three
quarters you can do that so now we want
four quar so select enter and there you
go you have all the sales of all the
four quarters of east region now if you
simply drag it you will have the sum of
all the four quarters of all different
regions now let us calculate the
summation of q1 of all the regions that
is this one select autosum and it will
automatically select all the cells for
you that is from C2 to C6 right press
enter and you'll have the sumission
similarly you can you know drag it and
you have the numbers here of all the Q2
sales of all the regions Q3 sales of all
region and Q4 sales of all region now
let us try to change the color that you
can have a reference that is it's
different it's it's a total sum or right
you just have a reference to identify
it now similarly to this one as
well
so that's how you implement a to sum in
Excel how to insert PDF in Excel now
there are multiple ways to insert a PDF
into Excel so we will go through a
couple of ways first is here let us
imagine that we wanted to insert some
PowerPoint presentation in PDF format
into our Excel sheet so that belongs to
excel Basics now click on the C where
you want to add the PDF or just click
any cell in the Excel spreadsheet then
go to the option of insert in the
toolbar then navigate to text option
click on it and select
object and here you can select create
from file and then you can browse and
here you have your Excel Basics PDF in
my documents click on that select insert
so here you you can just press okay and
the PDF will be inserted now you can
minimize the size of PDF to fit the
cell there you go the PDF got
successfully inserted into your Excel
spreadsheet now let's discuss about the
second way now the second way is
completely same the only difference is
you can add some logo to your PDF so you
can see it has been added in direct form
of a PDF like what's the first slide of
the PPD but instead of that if you
wanted to highlight it as an icon then
you can select the display as icon
button here and press okay now you don't
have to reformat the size of your PPD or
PDF all you have to do is add the logo
to your PDF and it will also include the
title so this is another way of adding
uh you know PDF to your Excel sheet now
another way so a few times you don't
want the first page of the uh PDF to be
visible or any kind of logo of that PDF
reader to be visible on your spreadsheet
sometimes all you want is some dedicated
image or a dedicated logo right so this
time let's try to add a dedicated image
to our PDF so go to insert again here
you can see the illustrations option
click on picture and from this device so
I will select the simply Lars logo and
now you have to resize the logo a little
bit to fit the cell
there you
go you can uh you know click on the
right click button and add select the
option of Link now um select the
existing file or web page option so if
you are interested to learn more on
hyperlink in Excel we have dedicated
tutorial on that please go through
hyperlinks in Excel by simply learn
which will explain you everything about
hyperlinks in Excel how to insert them
different types of documents to be
inserted and how it works in real time
for now let's try to insert the existing
web page and go to documents navigate to
documents and inside this you have the
Excel basic PDF click on okay and it has
been added to your image so when you
click on it it will open the PDF
document attached to it so when you
hover over to the cell you can see it
will ask you a permission do you want to
continue or not just click on this
ignore the warning so you can see the
PDF has been successfully open now here
on my spreadsheet you can see some data
so this particular data has some color
markings so we have used color codes to
Mark the designations of all the
employees with different colors so for
example blue for manager purple for
senior and so on right now our duty is
to count the total number of employees
present in a company based on the color
code this can be done using filters but
let's try with color codes now we don't
have a readily available function in
Excel to count cells based on their
colors but we can make use of macro now
to make use of macro you might want to
enable the developer options so by
default these will be disabled in Excel
to enable them right click on the
toolbar and you can see this particular
option click on the customize ribbon
option and you will be provided with
various set of options now on the right
side you can see developer options so
make sure the checkbox is clicked to
enable developer options and press on
okay to completely enable developer
window right now when you click on
developer options you can see various
options here visual Basics macro Etc now
click on the macro to create a macro now
just give a name to the macro function
so I'll give simply Lo
and press on create to create that
particular macro function so we have
already created a macro that is Count
colored cells which we will be using in
our current spreadsheet for counting the
colored cells now let us erase the newly
created
function now getting back to the
original code so how does this
particular count colored cells works so
let us understand the function first
then we will try to make use of it in
the spreadsheet so the function name is
Count colored cells as as you can see
and this particular function will have
two parameters current cell and
spreadsheet area so the current cell
will be the cell address where the color
you want to count is present and then
the spreadsheet area so what is the
range of cells where you want to locate
that particular color and count the
number of repetition that is the
spreadsheet area and then comes the
variables used color cell range color
code and color cell count so the the
colored cell which particular cell is
having that particular color and what
color code is involved in that colored
cell and colored cell count so what is
the total count what is the total number
of colored cells you have in that
particular range that is colored cell
count now let us consider color code is
equals to current cell interior color
that is current cell do interior do
color so this is the function which will
identify the interior color of a
selected cell let us imagine that
initially color code is equal to the
current cell's color code okay now we
will have the for Loop and that for Loop
will include colored cell which is a
current cell in the spreadsheet area and
if the colored cell the currently
selected colored cell do interior do
color is equals to the color code that
we have selected then colored cell count
the variable which is used to count the
number of colored cells is equals to +
one initially by default it will be zero
in case if this particular if condition
is true that is the current cell color
and the color code given is equals to
same then the value of colored cell will
increase by one and this particular if
Loop will run as many number of times
the condition is true so let us imagine
that the condition will remain true for
five times then we have obtained five
similarly colored cells in the given
range of cells in a spreadsheet and once
the condition fails then the latest
value present in color cell count
variable will be displayed which will be
a final result so this is how the macro
function works now let's close the macro
window and get back to our spreadsheet
now let us try to make use of the macro
function that we just created so that is
equals to count colored cells press tab
to select the macro function and the
first one is the current cell so this is
the current cell where the current color
is being provided comma this cell range
so our cell range will be from C2 to
c31 right so this is the range where we
want to count the similarly colored
cells that is sky blue colored cells
close the function and press enter now
you can see the function has identified
six reputations of sky blue color in
this particular range of cells now you
can drag the same formula across all the
cells and it will be providing the
results of the same so six senior colors
that is pink or purple color then two
reputations of this particular color two
reputations of trainy color five for
dark blue and six for green right so
this is how the macro function works and
the key point to remember here is this
particular macro will work only for
manually colored cells so there are
situations where we have used
conditional formatting to color a single
cell let us imagine that we have used
conditional formatting to recognize the
employees with salary above 30,000 as
green green color and if we try to use
that particular green color to be
counted by the color count cells
function no it will not happen it will
not consider that color as a feedback or
an input now in future we will also try
to design a macro which can recognize
the colors made by conditional
formatting as well but this particular
function will be exclusively used for
manually colored cells only so for that
we might want to use a few simple
functions in Excel and let's get started
with it so on the first sheet we will
try to add some data so we will be using
data validation in Excel so we don't
want all that list of data to be
appearing on our calendar right so for
that reason let's create a new sheet and
in the sheet let's add a
months and also let's consider a few
years we are not creating the
automatically updating calendar for just
one year let's create for a couple of
years maybe
uh a 10 right so let's add in
January and Excel has this feature where
you can just drag it and you'll get all
the months all together at once so it
should be around December yeah January
February March April May June July
August September October November and
December similarly so we are in 2022
right now so let's add
2023 and a couple of more years maybe
so just control not control shift lower
Arrow key and now drag that to the
December part I think we'll get uh a 12
years so we have
2033 now our list is ready now let's get
back to the original sheet and try to
take month and year as well copy the
sales and paste it here so there you go
we have our months and years now this
will be our self months and years so
here get into Data option and here get
into the data validation option and here
select list option and now it will ask
you for the source now where is the
source this is our source so we are
hiding the sheet from the users now
select okay and there you go now you
have a drop down menu same goes to here
get into the data validation option
select list and uh go to the sheet
number two where we have hidden our okay
select Source now go into the sheet to
where we have hidden our ears select the
range and press okay so there you have
our month and year so months you can
select anyone out of 12 so you have the
scroll bar here and similarly you can
select any year which you want so for
now let's select 2022 and the first
month of
2022 now here our calendar so let's type
in
Monday and the same applies here you can
just drag it until
Saturday and Sunday so you have all that
here right now let's keep it a little
wider so that it's visible a little
clearer
okay not too
wide that should be
good now we will begin creating the
calendar so we don't know what day was
the 1 of U January 2022 of course it's
Saturday but what if we didn't know or
we don't have any idea of the upcoming
years what if if someone asks you what's
the first day of Jan 1st or
2033 so it would be a little difficult
right so let's use the help of few inbu
formulas from Excel to find it out so
you can use the U inbuilt function that
is date to
Value there you go we have our date
value and in date value we will consider
the month and uh the year but before
that let's provide the date value as one
for default which is the first day
so this is our date value and hyphen now
let's press ENT to add the remaining
part that is the month and uh year so we
use ENT and press double codes and
inside double codes press hyphen I guess
we already have a hyphen so instead of
hyphen what we can do is we can direct L
select the month cell there we go we
have the month cell and after that now
we might need the
hyphen hyphen and press the ENT again
now our AO value so there you go we have
our date value function ready press
enter and there you can see some random
numbers over here this is because of a
little formatting error so you can
change it you can get into home and in
home you can see the number group and
select that and inside that you'll have
custom option you can also check with
the date option but let's go with the
custom as we might want to add a few
more extra things to our date right so
here you go so you have date month
year right so we'll also add uh date to
our calendar just DDD they should help
us with the week as well that is 1 John
2022
Saturday right but you can see that it
doesn't go with Monday right here we
have Monday but the date is first Chan
and it is Saturday and this cell is
supposed to be coming here right so
there is some error regarding this so
this position of the week can be fixed
right this position of the week can be
fixed that's what we are going to focus
on in the next step so what we need is
the same formula but with a little
modification to it what we're going to
do is substract this with weekday of
this particular value
right so now what you're going to do is
minus weekday formula tab space and try
to copy the same formula and place it
inside the wig day
function
copy paste and
another yeah it should be somewhere here
so another attribute what we they
considers is the date value uh the day
value that is a few people will consider
Sunday as the first day of a week few
will consider Monday as the first day of
a week so accordingly we have here so if
you're the one who's considering Sunday
as the first day of a week then the
attribute should be one but here we
considering Monday as the first day uh
of our week so our attribute will be
three so tab space to select it and
close the function there you go now you
have the formula ready to identify the
correct position of the week day and the
date value right now usually we might
require or we know that we have four
weeks in a month but sometimes you might
end up having five weeks or even six
weeks according to the arrangement of
the position of the day and data value
so for that let's create six rows to be
on the safer side so for that let's
again cutpaste this formula here to the
first day that is Monday and as we know
this is the perfect day that is 27th of
December
2021 right now our first day of January
2022 is somewhere over here so you are
just going to add one value to it right
so equals to and the cell value +
one enter so there we have our next day
so again you can just drag it to have
all the seven
days there you go we have the perfect
dates and similarly this one so let's
try to select all of these and drag a
little bit so that we have a little more
space to fit in our data
there you go now here you're adding
seven more days to complete the week so
here we'll add the cell Value Plus 7
days to get the next adjacent date right
so the value of the date plus 7even 7
Days of a week to get the next
consecutive date followed by the 2
January we'll have third January right
and now he can do the
same to this one and you'll have the
consecutive days now drag this to all
the four rows so that we have six rows
there you go our calendar is perfectly
fine now now we'll try to do few more
modifications to our date value so
instead of having all the month year and
uh week name we can just keep it as just
the day number right so just get into
numbers again numbers row and here
eliminate all these data and just keep D
for date press okay so there you go we
have our perfect date Arrangement over
here
now we will try to minimize the calendar
length or or we can just you know make a
few modifications to it Monday Tuesday
wedes day Thursday Friday Saturday and
Sunday
right now we will make some
modifications then try to fit
it there you go it looks good now but we
still have one issue to fix that is we
still have a few days from our previous
year that is 2021 and we have a few days
from February as well right so this
looks like a problem
which is fixable so we can make use of
condition formatting here to fix this so
get into home and conditional formatting
and in conditional formatting try to use
a new rule and use a formula to
determine with sales to format now here
we are going to use the month
function month of the first cell that is
e five in my
case not equal to month
of any any cell in between the month so
we'll choose this one and press okay uh
so what you want to do if if the cells
are not equal what you want to do get
into
format and get into
number and here choose custom and choose
as three semicolons or you can also do
an idea of you know kind of blurring the
numbers up so for now while choose to
eliminate the numbers or you know remove
the numbers or keep a blank space when
the condition fails right so we're going
to use three semicolons to fix that and
press okay and press okay so there you
go
having said that if you are an aspiring
data analyst looking for online TR
certification from the expert
universities and in collaboration with
realtime industry experts then search no
more simply learns postgraduate program
in data analytics in collaboration with
IBM from the Purdue University should be
the right choice for more details on
this course please click the link in the
description box below that's how to sort
data in Excel so on my spreadsheet you
can see some employee data and on the
column f and g you can see employee date
of birth and employee date of joining
for example you wanted to sort the
employee data in the form of earliest
joining employee and the latest joining
employee right that is who is the
employee who joined first to this
company and who is the employee who
joined lost to this company so for that
you just need to select the column of
date so let's select both the columns
and go to home and check or verify if
the data type is date or not so
generally the data type will be set to
General by default by Excel so we need
to make sure that we have the proper
data type which is State now that we
have the proper data type select the
entire column and go to the data option
and here select the sort option and in
the sort option select the expand
selection click on sort and here
s by employee date of joining and oldest
to newest that's what we wanted the
oldest employee or the you can also set
it to the newest employee to oldest
according to your requirement but we'll
go to oldest to newest according to the
case study right now just click on okay
and that should be done so Emily who's a
manager is the oldest employee who
joined the company and Chris who is a
traine and it support is the latest
employee who joined the company now
that's how you sort date in Excel now we
are on the Excel spreadsheet so you can
see that I have five different sheets of
the same data so why do we have that so
I'll be explaining you how to sort data
for multiple parameters so firstly we
will try to sort data in the form of
numbers right so let us imagine that
this data is being shared with you by
your manager and he wants you to sort
this data based on the salary numbers so
he wants you to arrange the data in the
form of ascending order or descending
order maybe which will help him find the
employee with the highest salary right
so how could you do that so it's really
simple you could sort the entire data
just within a few clicks so how would
you do that so since you're focusing on
salary select any sell from the salary
column only right select this particular
column and select any sell in the salary
column get into the sort and filter
options and here select this sort of
arrangement you need that is largest to
smallest or the smallest to largest
since the problem statement was to find
the highest salary click on largest to
smallest and there you go so you have
Tony and the designation is senior and
he works in it support and he draws the
highest salary of
80,000 right and there's also another
one which is Peppa and she works for the
analytics team and now the next sheet
let's get into the sheet two and this
time let us imagine that you wanted to
you know uh arrange or sort the data
based on the employee date of joining or
date of birth right again if you wanted
to arrange the data in which you find
the youngest employee or the oldest
employee of the organization you can do
that click on any cell in the date of
birth column and go back to the sort and
filter and here you will be seeing the
options sort oldest to the newest or the
sort the data from newest to the oldest
so since we want the oldest employee
select oldest to newest and there you go
so the oldest employee is Alfred who is
an associate designation employee and he
works in the admin department and he's
drawing the salary of
25,000 so that's how you can sort the
data when you are trying to sort the
data based on date wise so first we try
to sort the data on the number wise so
you can apply the same for your employee
ID salary and if there is any
possibility you can do that as well and
if you want to apply the same sorting
based on dates you can do that as well
using the Sorting function in the same
way now let's get back onto the third
sheet and here now uh single column wise
is perfectly fine there is no issues
with that now you wanted to you know uh
let us imagine that you have two columns
okay let's eliminate a few columns here
maybe we can eliminate the employee ID
and uh
okay let's keep a few columns so we'll
just keep employee name and employee
salary okay so here we are trying to
demonstrate if you are uh trying to sort
the data using one cell in the column B
will it maintain its relationship with
the cell a okay uh that's our query
right so let's see I'll go a little
detail so let us imagine that you wanted
to sort this data based on highest
salary
okay so when you do that will it also
impact the cells in the column A so it
will basically impact but just uh it's a
query right any of you viewers might
have that query will I uh if in case if
I try to sort the datab based on this
will it affect the cells on the rest of
the data set okay so in basically it
will impact so I'll try to you know sort
the data based on ascending
order so there's is the smallest to
largest and you can see uh the Tony and
pepper so since I selected the cell in
the column B it also impacted the change
on the cells of column A so that's how
the Sorting works now we'll get to a
little Advanced um sorting techniques so
here we try to I mean already we try to
sort the data based on numbers based on
alphabets based on U you know uh date
date of birth right so I think we forgot
the uh ascending or you know sorting
based on alphabets let's do that as well
select any um cell in the column A and
go to S and filter try selecting a to z
or okay let's try to Z to A okay so here
you can see the U names are been sorted
based on the descending order from Zed
to a right so so far we tried on
alphabets so far we tried on numbers
date of birth and a couple of more
things so let's dig a little deeper and
try try to sort based on colors right so
for that you don't uh you know find that
uh extra setting here in the regular
sortant filter so you might want to get
into the data option and here you'll
find another sort function which is a
little ad once so that's how you do it
so since we have colored in the cell or
column of salary select that salary and
we're going with cell value so in the
cell values section select the cell
color and here on the cell color options
you'll have green blue and yellow that's
what we have used in our um cells so
let's keep Green in the first position
which is on top and press okay now
you'll see green been sorted to the
first position now yellow and blue are
left out so why is that so because you
didn't provide it right so you can do
what that as well mean you can always
add uh the setting to
it right select any cell go to sort and
add a level and then then again select
the salary and sell values to cell
colors and now the cell color in the
second position would be blue and that
will be on bottom and I can add another
level the same
salary the cell values will be cell
color and uh cell yellow will be
somewhere in between or bottom okay so
based on hierarchy uh it will be
selecting press
okay and there you go so you have cell
yellow and blue at the bottom and green
at the top position as for your
suggestions now we are on the last sheet
so here in this last sheet we are going
to you know um dig a little deeper into
the advanced sorting methods so
previously we Tred to apply the advanced
sorting methods for colors now we'll try
to apply the advanced sorting methods
based on the data set we have here I
mean the data we have in our data set
right so select the sort option and
let's add a few details right so firstly
let's sort the column employee ID okay
so let's have the smallest to largest or
yeah now that would be good now let's
add another level where we will
sort okay uh I think we will sort based
on employee name that would be a little
better so let's try to uh sort it on
employee name here and here will be
employee salary okay now the sell values
and this would be from A to Z and the
salaries will be from smallest to
largest so basically what we are trying
to do is we are trying to sort the
employee list based on employee names
from a to zed so the employees name
starting from A to Z will be ordered
first and another subset of the Sorting
will be done based on highest salaries
that is smallest to highest so let us
imagine that we have three employees
with Nam starting from a and their
salaries are 10,000 20,000 and 30,000 so
how would it sort so it will sort
basically uh in the alphabetical order
first so first three names will be
sorted and then it will also have
another condition to sort the data with
keeping the lowest salary on top and
highest salary in the last right so uh
this is how the algorithm works for
sorting now let's press okay and see the
output so there you go the names are
Alfred and you have the highest salary
here smallest to highest so this is
25,000 next we have Banner Barnes and
Ben so here you might be seeing why we
have Ben in the third position despite
he has a low salary and name starts with
B right so here it is trying to work
based on the alphabets in the order
right so B A and b e it's not just
comparing the first letter it's also
comparing the following letters as well
right so n comes first R comes later so
B is pushed to the second position a
comes first and E comes later so B A
letters are pushed to the first position
and Ben is pushed to the third position
so that's how it works right so
accordingly the set for BA is created
here 3540 next Ben 12 and next you have
Bobby Brian Brock Chris Clark right so
that's how the data has been organized
and sorted based on multiple levels of
parameters you provide for sorting so
that's how you use sorting in Excel so
what is data validation in Excel so it
is a feature by Microsoft Excel where it
can restrict data entry into certain
cells by using data validation and it
will prompt the users to enter valid
data in the cells based on the rules and
restrictions provided by the creator of
that particular sheet now the this would
be a little confusing to understand so
to understand it in a much better way
let's get back to the practical way
where we will start entering some data
validation rules to our Excel sheet and
try to enter data into it now we are on
the Microsoft Excel and this particular
sheet is based on employee ID employee
name employee Department employee salary
fiscal year and work timings of the
employees now we will be applying some
data validation rules to each and every
column and try to enter data based on
the rules we have entered now for the
first one which is the employee ID we'll
enter rules based on the employee ID
number so to apply the data validation
you need to go into the data tab on the
toolbar and inside the ribbon you can
see data tools group and in the data
tools group you have the option of data
validation now select the entire column
go to the data tools group select data
validation option and and you will have
this particular popup menu and here you
can see different types of options so
since we are entering employee ID it
would be a whole number so let us select
whole number option and now here you can
see the option of between not equal to
equal to not between greater than less
than
Etc so let us select between and let us
assume that your employee ID has five
numbers and uh it should be between
10,000 to
11,000 so let us provide
10,000 and
11,000 now select okay and now the new
rule has been
applied so now the minimum value of each
and every employee ID should be equal to
all or more than 10,000 and less than
11,000 and it should have five digits
now let's try to enter a wrong employee
ID that is just one there you go you can
see that Microsoft Excel is not allowing
you to include a wrong number it says
this value does not match the data
validation restrictions defined for this
cell so now you can press retry and try
to enter some number which is in between
10,000 to
11,000
now it is
10,901 and this will take the
entry now let us assume that because I'm
the creator of this sheet I know what
should be entered here but what if I
give this sheet to you and you're the
person who's trying to enter the number
and it shows the error and you don't
know what was the error right to avoid
this kind of confusion what you can do
is you can do some uh ways where you can
provide the message to the user so that
can be done by okay let's select the
sheet again and go to the data
validation and here you have the same
settings now here you have another
option saying input message so before
input message let us go to error alert
now
here the error title would be data
entered is not
valid please enter this is the error
message please
enter
EMP
ID
between
10,000 to
11,000 press okay now when you try to
enter the wrong number it will show that
particular error alert message
see data entered is not valid please
enter employee ID between 10,000 to
11,000 now this is fine but how long
this will be you know what if there is
an option where you just hover over to
this cell and it automatically tells you
to enter the value between 10,000 to
11,000 without having to face the error
yeah even that can be done so you can
select the entire column go to data
validation and here this is the input
message this is where you can do that so
here you can write the message name
valid
data please
enter data
between 10,000 to 11,000 now when you
hover over to any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
show you this message where you can
avoid all the errors just select okay
see when you select any cell in this
particular column it will automatically
tell you please enter data between
10,000 to 11,000 so here you don't have
to face any errors right now let us try
to enter the valid
data
1
9
02 and it will take it as the correct
value and again 1
903 now in case if you try to provide
the wrong number it will show the
error
see so that's how it is now we have
finished the whole number part now let's
get into the employee name where we have
to
provide uh the second type that is text
length now let us imagine that uh in
your company you're trying to provide ID
cards to your employees and you know
that ID card is really small and inside
that ID card you need to include the
employee photograph and your company
name employee ID blood group phone
number address everything and also you
need to include the name of the employee
so what if there is an employee with
very lengthy name like 30 characters 40
characters yeah in India it is really
possible that you might have a lengthy
name so what you can do is you can
provide the text length where the text
is limited to like 15 or uh 20 uh um
characters so you can include that name
in the ID card so you can do that by
allowing the data validation criteria
with text length uh minimum can be
anything so minimum can be one and
maximum here you can provide 15 and
press okay okay minimum will change it
to at least uh
two and yeah let it be one so minimum is
one and maximum is 15 characters and
press okay and uh let us also provide
the input
message
enter character type character
data please enter valid
name and error
alert invalid
data please enter valid
data
okay please enter
characters less than
50 press
okay now let us try to enter a random
name okay uh we'll enter characters more
than 15 here
qu z i uh yeah it's like 1 2 3 4 5
11
okay now this is more than
15 okay I think it's not more than 15
let's try to enter a little bit more
characters yeah now we have entered more
than 15 characters and it is showing
please enter characters less than 15 so
now we can retry and try to enter some
valid
name
um now we have character is less than 50
so it will take as the proper name now
let us try to enter another
name I'm just entering some random
data so another name
maybe great now the next type of data
validation is also done now now let us
get into employee Department employee
department is something really superb so
I'll tell you about it it's actually a
list now let us finish the other ones
first that is employee salary physical
year and work timings after that we'll
learn about uh the list
one now let's come into employee salary
so salary is something where you have to
include decimal points so now let us go
to uh data validation and inside the
values we have already dealt with whole
number
uh text
length yeah now we'll deal with employee
salary that is decimal now minimum is
okay what is uh minimum can be
[Music]
1.0 and maximum can
be 1
lakh or let us put that as 10
lakhs
press okay okay not not just then enter
valid
salary okay now let's change it to
minimum is
10,000 so the employee minimum salary
will be 10,000 and input enter valid
salary
enter
salary
between
10,000 to 10
lakhs let us include a comma here
too now error
alert invalid
salary please please
enter
between
10,000 to 10
L press okay now the message and the
data validation conditions are applied
to this column now let us try to enter
some invalid data first it will show the
error now we need to enter the valid
data yeah now it is taking the valid
data let us provide
20,000 and this has
35,000 now the next one is fiscally let
us imagine that we wanted to you know
work on the employees for current
working year that is 2020 to
2021 and or you can consider 2021 to
2022 not more than 2021 and not less
than 2021 for that you can provide the
year option as well so for that you need
to select the entire column go to data
validation settings and inside here you
have an option of date so uh let us
provide the date option as between and
start date is
01/ 01/
2021 and end date is 01/
01/
2022 and input
message let us provide data as
current fiscal
year Current financial
year enter
date
between 2021 to
2022 let us copy this and go into error
alert error message will be S
invalid
dat select okay now the error message
and uh the data input message and the
data validation rule has been applied
for this column so let's try to enter
some date here you can enter uh 02 of
February
2021 it will take as correct data now
let's try to enter some wrong data which
is apart from 2022 02
02 20 22 it will not take this it will
throw error so that's how it works now
let us try to enter as
2021 and this is March it will take it
now another
data 04 this time and
2021 so that's how your uh date data
validation will work now coming into the
next type of data validation that is
time so we have time here let us imagine
that you are providing some work timings
to your employees that should be from
9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. not more than
that so you want to keep your work life
Balan for all your employees so you just
want them to work between 925 and that
should be fine and anything apart from
that time should be invalid so you can
do that by selecting uh time option
between it should be in between and the
start time will be
09 0 0 and this should
be
uh
17 that is 5:00 p.m. in the
evening and input
message please
enter time
between 9
a.m.
to
okay 5
p.m this should be the input
message
now error
alert invalid
time error message okay
now okay work timings now this should be
okay we can do this as two columns
actually let us
cancel let us copy this and paste it
here you can do it as
login login timing and this should be
okay this should be log
out so this should
be
okay so this will be considered as login
and log out times now let us provide the
login time this should be the right time
and uh let's try to provide wrong
timings 08 now it will not take it it
will throw as error so it's working fine
let us provide 10 now let us provide the
log out time it should be below 500 p.m.
so let us provide five it will take
it
okay let's try to provide something just
1 minute less than
five that is
59 okay there is some problem in this
let's check
it
okay it is taking uh three that is
including
seconds okay let's provide seconds as
well 05 0 0 0
0 okay still there is some
problem
okay we have entered four we should we
are supposed to enter 24hour timing
right
14 okay uh it should be 17 I think this
will work yeah now we are following
24-hour timing here so let's provide
another timing that is
16 30 0 0 this will be valid and and
1530 yes this is also valid now we have
finished almost all types of uh data
validation things that is we have
finished with any value whole number
decimal date timing test length and the
last one is list so this is where things
get interesting now let's cancel this
now select the employee column now if
you're running a company then definitely
you'll not have only one Department in
it you might have multiple departments
right so let us consider that you have a
software development company so in that
the basic departments will be software
development team and software testing
team so what you can do is you can
provide a list so using that list you
can just uh H over to that cell select
the drop down menu and inside that you
can select the option so we will try to
work something like that if we have
selected the entire
column selection okay
yeah let us select the entire column
again go to data validation the
selection contains some cells without
data validation settings do you want to
extend data validation to the sales
yes now let us provide the list
option
[Music]
and here Source you can provide
as developer
and
tester press okay
okay now input message select
one select
one error
alert
invalid
data select from
dropdown
only press
okay now when you select the cell you
can see small drop down icon right so
when you press it you will have
developer and tester option so you can
select developer for first one and for
second one you can select uh tester
right okay this is good for uh one or
two options maybe three or even maybe
like five but what if you have more
departments okay let's go to to this uh
second sheet where we have the
department data so here we have like 14
departments no 15 departments or 15
employee type names so the first one is
CEO second is developer tester quality
analyst system analyst Finance human
resource so so many options are there so
you cannot keep on typing all of them
right so here it is 15 what if you have
like 25 like 50 departments right it
will be tough so for this you have
another option so let me select all this
data and copy this from this sheet to
our employee
sheet let us paste it
somewhere here let's expand
this okay now we have our uh list over
here now let us remove the data
validation from this
column clear all okay now everything is
cleared let's select okay now let us
erase this data as
well now let us apply the list data
validation again from scratch go to
list now here we can select the
source select this particular
cell and drag it until here and it has
been
loaded now go to input
message
data
options select
one from the menu or the drop
down copy error
alert select only from the drop down
menu invalid entry yeah now now let's
select
okay fine now you have the icon here you
have all the provided
options you can scroll down and select
any one out of these you can select
knowledge transfer for the first one and
second one would be system
analyist and the last one would
be human
resources now in the list everything is
fine okay this is showing you the menu
option and everything so but what if you
provide this sheet to your new joiny or
new employee in your company and by
mistake he messes up something like
deleting this okay so we have deleted
systems analyst and when you click on
the options here you don't have systems
analyst in that place you have blank
space right so there is a way where all
your U you know data can be messed up so
to avoid this what you can do is you can
actually um save this data in a
different sheet like I did here like
Department data you can hide this sheet
or you can protect this sheet with
password or something so that nobody can
mess this up so now let us get back to
the employee data and select this column
and uh clear everything press okay and
let us also clear
this and this as well this one too now
let us eliminate the
rowes or
sales the employee yeah
everything okay now we have basically
removed this data from here now let us
try to apply the data validation once
again now here let us select as
list and
uh here let us provide the option let us
let's go to next sheet let us select all
these
options and press okay okay let's
provide input
message data
options or Department
options
yeah now let's select
okay now let's hide this sheet now the
sheet has been hidden and you still have
the
options
developer or let us provide
CEO then we have
developer then we
have
test so that's how you can protect your
sheets as well now this is how you apply
data validation in your Excel now what
is indirect function in Excel so the
name itself conveys that it is something
like a reference function right so it
refers to a cell which is present in a
particular sheet or the current sheet or
it refers to a particular range in the
current sheet or it can also refer to an
entire workbook in a current window
right so you can stay here on the sheet
number one and you can refer something
which is present on the sheet number 10
or 11 you can stay in this current
workbook and refer to something which is
around in a different workbook alog
together so that's exactly how the
indirect function in Excel works okay so
I guess the definition was a little uh
difficult to get let me show you a
simple demo here so that it becomes a
little easier for you so currently I'm
in the cell number A2 right now here I
will implement the indirect function
press tab to select it and now I'll
refer to the cell
C2 and let's enter and there you go let
me properly close the window it's there
so let me implement the indirect
function here so equals to indirect and
press tab to select now I'll be
selecting the cell C2 and inside C2 we
have E2 address now the formula is fine
I have implemented the indirect function
and selected the cell E2 and now if I
press enter see the magic there you go
so in the cell E2 we have the text hello
world so so when I use the indirect
function to refer which is something in
C2 it is indirectly referring to another
cell address that is E2 which has the
text hello world now this one was a
little pretty simpler now let's check
some complicated ones and will move to
sheet number one here we have some
student names and their uh you know uh
marks on the individual subjects that is
math science English computer science
and here
and here you can see I'm selecting the
student names and accordingly I'm
getting their average score and the
total marks obtained right seems
interesting how did I do this so this is
done exactly using the indirect function
so let's do it again so this is how you
do it now here I will be using okay
before we get into this uh we need to do
some fundamentals before we do it right
so the fundamentals are you need to name
your individual columns so here I have
Brian and his marks so I'll select
entire marks of Brian ranging from B2 to
B4 right click and here you can see
Define name and I'll be naming it as
Brian it's already name we might get an
error so it's already named okay let's
add another one
maybe uh Jennifer let's cancel this so
let's uh add Jenny
and her marks will be
96 87 I'm selecting some random numbers
here so
87 so we have the new column here now we
need to name this column Define a name
and it's Jenny so Excel has
automatically selected the name for this
column so let's press okay now we have
our columns ready now here if you see
the drop down we we have Amy bana Brian
Brock Emily Jenny John everyone over
here right so the columns are named the
individual columns are named so now the
student name so here you can use some
simple trick called Data validation here
select the data option in the toolbar
navigate to data tools here select data
validation and uh in this instead of any
value select list and here give the
source as this particular
set press okay so that you get the drop
down menu over here you can also type
the individual names again when you type
the individual names you might go wrong
with the case or spelling right so it's
better always to use this kind of list
options which will make things easier
for you now getting into the average
calculation so here the average will be
uh equals to average press tab to select
now the indirect function indirect
of the cell address and close CL the
bracket first you might get an error
because currently it is empty so select
some name and you'll get your average
score now same thing applies to uh you
know total uh you can press the sum
function select the sum function and uh
type in the indirect function and uh the
cell V1 close the brackets and press
enter so that's how you do it so that's
how you can Implement indirect function
in Excel with that we have come to an
end of this
so now we are on the Excel sheet and you
can see that in this particular Excel
sheet we have some student details we
have the serial numbers names role
numbers class blood group and some
subjects like math science computer
statistics social GK and the final marks
obtained percentage and total marks
right so let us imagine that uh a
company has come for an interview so all
these students are going to attend an
interview and uh the the minimum
percentage to attend the interview will
be like
75% so you can see that we have 75 here
and all the students have got above 75
except for the one student which is Mike
right so for Mike to attend the
interview he needs 75 percentage or
above so uh he can make some
modifications in one of these subjects
right so there is always an exam after
the exam called as Improvement exam so
if you can uh like to score some extra
marks in the subjects which you have
scored less so that you can make up to
the percentage what you're expecting you
can do that so here in this particular
sheet uh Mike has six subjects right and
in six subjects you can see he has score
76 91 45 71 94 and 62 so out of these he
have scored Less in one subject compared
to all the subjects one subject is
really low that is computers so what if
he can can give an improvement exam and
increase his percentage to 75 right so
that can be done so we can do some root
Force methods like we can change the
marks like 55 and then check this
particular one so it's getting 74 right
so using the brute force method will be
a little bit lengthy so you can do this
because it is just a small table which
has least number of data and you just
have one single cell to modify so that
can be done in in small tables but what
if you had some table with hundreds of
rows or thousands of rows that'll be
time consuming right so for that we have
some inbuilt functionality in Excel that
is called goal seek in Excel so for now
let's eliminate the marks
here so we have eliminated the marks and
the upgraded percentage is 65 now we
need the target as
75 okay so let's uh write it
as Mike's Target right we need mic so
Mike's new Target
as
[Music]
75 okay now to make sure that we need a
Mark here which can get mic to 75% AG we
will use the data operation so here on
the toolbar which has file home insert
Etc we have one other option called as
data so when you click on data from
toolbar you'll have this ribbon and in
this ribbon we have various options so
when you come into forecast group we
have an option called wtif analysis when
you click on wtif analysis you'll have a
set of options out of which we have goal
seek now for goal seek we we need to
select a table cell that is this
particular table cell that is
M9 so we need the value 75 here right so
what is the cell that you need to change
here for that you need to select this
one and select this particular cell here
right and now you can select okay now
you can see that Excel has automatically
run all the permutations and
combinations and has come up with a
number so that the overall percentage of
mic will be 75% right so the expected
marks that Mike should be getting in his
computer's Improvement exam should be
equal to 56 or greater than 56 to get
the final Target as 75 so that he can
attend the company's interview so this
is how we use goal set or goal seek in
Excel we are on our Excel spreadsheet
and here you can see I'm trying to
create an calendar for the employees in
the company where you might have to you
know write down the day and month and
year or week of your birth date or maybe
your joining date or maybe also your
last working day right this might be
useful for all the employees to you know
uh avoid them from writing it down
manually so how do I create it so it
takes a few simple steps all it takes is
some data validation methods and also
there is an exclusive video specifically
made on data validation in Excel link to
which is in the description box below or
you can search it on our official
YouTube channel now you can see that uh
the word calender is on the first cell
that is A1 but we have four cells below
it that is A3 B3 C3 and D3 so you might
want to add this to all the cells right
like may be in the middle so for that
you can do the option of mergin Center
also there is a tutorial on mergin
Center about all the options available
in this particular
thing so you can go through that also
and uh yeah we have done the first step
now all we need is day month year and
week so in a calendar or in a month
you'll have days from 28 29 30 or 31
days right so let's create a list or the
drop down menu for that so that whenever
you click it right so whenever you click
on that particular cell you will have
the list of all the days available right
so
let's get started with that let's create
a new
sheet so why are we creating a new sheet
you won't want that all the numbers in
your calendar sheet right over here
right so for that so we are creating a
new sheet and all the data will be
available here so here let's write down
the days first and here the second
number also you can use the option of
Flash Fill so that you can you know uh
reduce the effort here so you can see
see the flash full option over here all
you need to do is select the sales and
drag them down until you get your
required dates right so let's keep it to
31 days very good you have the days so
these will be your days and here now the
next option was month right yeah month
and year now using the same flash F
option you will you know add the months
into your sheet
so this will be
Sunday so Excel has this smart flashfill
option where you can just drag the data
and everything will be filled according
to your requirements so Sunday to
Saturday now the next one right that is
your
month so same as the before process
we'll create
January
now you can use the Flash B option and
all the way up to December now the last
one was the
year so
1990 and
1991 so you can select the cells and
Flash Fill Up to
2022
maybe yeah 2020 should be good enough
now this is the flashfill option you
have here and also we have an exclusive
tutorial on flashfill Al together you
can go through it for a detailed
explanation as well now coming back to
the original sheet so this is where you
create your drop-down list right so
select the cell where you want to add
the drop- down list navigate to data and
then here is your data validation menu
so we have a variety of data validation
options options over here there is an
exclusive tutorial on that you can go
through it for now we'll look into the
list option only because we want to
create a drop down list right so here it
will ask for Source click on the source
here the source bar right now navigate
to sheet number two where we have the
days options select the
range so this will be your range and
select okay also you can add some
message here right what you can do is uh
in case if there is an error or
something right you don't want that to
be happening so all you need to do is uh
write down and select from
dropdown select from dropdown
only
so this could be a message select from
drop down only the title is Select
options or just
options in case if there's an error you
can write down your title as invalid
data and you can write down a message as
please
select from drop down only
so um in case of someone tries to write
as 32 or 33 to check the Integrity of
your data validation then they will
encounter an error and an error message
and then they must be understanding what
exactly they try to do and if it's
correct or wrong right so this is to
make sure that whatever the data you
enter is correct and valid so okay and
here you can see select from the drop
down list only options with option list
as title and let's try to enter 32 right
and when you press enter you will see an
error so the error messages invalid data
please try to select from drop down only
so you can go for a retry and select the
drop down
right so let's eliminate them and now
select something from the drop down so
let's take it
as maybe 10 right so this is how you
cleared the day one now let's try to do
with the month same data validation
option settings will be list and Source
will
be this
one
think I made a mistake here so let's
cancel this and go back to sheet two and
brening this as our week yeah now coming
back to the month
again it will be a
list
and the source will be in sheet 2
navigate to the sheet 2 and select your
range and input message the same
options select from dropdown
only and error alert title will be
invalid
data this one will be please
select from drop
down
only it's okay and that's done now let's
continue with here as well let's quickly
do the
same
it will be a list Source will be in
sheet2
this is your list press okay and lastly
the week same process it will be a list
Source will be in your sheet
to input
message
options
Backle invalid
data drop down
only right so your drop down list is
ready now so the month will be anything
So currently we have me and here can be
anything anywhere so let's take it as
1997 and we can be you know the adjacent
week so what was 10th of May
1997 let's check our
calendars was a
Saturday
so it was a Saturday and that's how you
create drop down list in Excel and if
you want you can also add borders to
your calendar
right so that's how it's
done on my screen you can see an Excel
spreadsheet of sales data so here you
have various columns regions category
state subcategory sales quantity and
much more right right so now let us
imagine that we want to add filters on
the region part so we have southwest
east Etc right so we want to you know
let us imagine that you want to extract
the data of only west region and you
wanted a filter so doing it manually
could take a lot of time so using
filters will be helpful now select one
cell on the headers part and select the
filter option in the data toolbar you
can see the data option on the toolbar
right so click on the data option and
navigate to sort and filter uh group and
in that select the option of filter now
you can see the filters are been added
to all the column headers region
category state subcategory sales
quantity right now we wanted the West
category so when you see or when you
click on the drop down icon you can see
all the options are selected right the
central east west south every everything
right but now we just want West one so
click on West and select okay there you
go so you have everything from from the
west region now let's imagine that you
wanted to look into uh office supplies
only or technology only right you can do
the same with the technology and press
okay and now you'll have all the
technology related sales in the west
region right so that's how you use
filters in Excel or that's how you add
filters in Excel having said that if you
are an aspiring data analyst looking for
online TR certification from the expert
universities and in collaboration with
the realtime industry experts then
search no more simply learns
postgraduate program in data analytics
in collaboration with IBM from the
Purdue University should be the right
choice for more details on this course
please click the link in the description
box below now we are on our Excel sheet
and as you can see on my screen there is
some data available on the Excel
spreadsheet and this table is not just
any table this table from Microsoft
Excel is been converted into an actual
table as you know by default Excel
considers all the data which has been
inserted into the spreadsheet as a
database and to implement this license
in Excel we might want to create or
convert the format of database into a
normal table for that you can select all
your data and just press contrl T and
that will allow you an option called
convert the data into table now since
this table is already converted as a
table we can directly start implementing
or inserting slices into the
spreadsheet now for that select all your
data then going to the insert
option and in the insert ribbon you can
see the filters group and in the filters
group select the option called slicer
now you will be provided with multiple
options since we have the columns
employee ID employee name Zone
designation Department salary employees
date of birth and employees date of
joining so we can choose any of the
options available according to our
columns and create the slices now let me
select the first one that is Zone next
designation department and let's also
select employee
name now press okay and there you go we
have our
slicers now let us try to rearrange
these slices all you can do is just
select and drag them up
and done now let us imagine that we want
to see or take a look at the employees
who are working in the East Zone then we
have all the information displayed on
the screen who are working in the East
Zone they are Jack Tony Banner Fred Etc
and their Department designation etc etc
all on one single screen so this really
helps you while you're presenting your
data in a presentation now for a change
let's try to select the department now
if your client wants to select the data
from only analytics Department then you
might want to select on the analytics
key on the department slicer and there
you go you have an employee called lops
who works in the East Zone and his
department is analytics and his
designation is contract based and the
salary he is getting is
65,000 now
similarly uh you can see that we have
only selected analytics and your client
also wants data from it support now you
can see that analytics is gone but what
if you want both analytics and it
support then you have an option called
select multiple then you can select
Analytics and it support and if you want
HR you can also do that and in the zone
if you want West along with East then
you can do the same east and west and
you have all the employee details and in
the designation let's try to select U
Senor traine okay select multiple senior
traine and manager so that's how you do
it so that's how it's done and that's
how you implement slicers in Excel to
simplify the filtering options using S
iers during a
presentation now you can see the PDF
document which I'm looking to convert
from PDF to excel so this particular PDF
document has a table so this is the
statewise GST collections that happened
during March of 20120 now we need to
convert this tabula data from PDF format
to excel format now we are on the
Microsoft Excel now to initiate the
process we might want to choose a blank
workbook for this so now we are at the
blank workbook and the complete sheet is
empty now let's go into the data option
in the
toolbar and in the data option of the
toolbar we
have the ribbon of get and transform
data in this ribbon you can see get data
option select that and you can see
various options here from file from
database from Azure from other sources
Etc now we need the first option that is
from file and in that we have a dropdown
and in that drop down you might want to
select the PDF if you have a Json file
you can also choose from a Json and if
you have the data from XML you can
choose that and even you can extract the
data from text or CSV as well now we
need the PDF option so select the PDF
Now navigate where your file is existing
so my file is on the desktop and now let
me select the PDF document select import
now Excel will automatically analyze the
Tabet data in the PDF format and give
you the results now according to excel
there are multiple Tabo formats table
one table two so basically this table is
one and the same so all the 29 states
are fixed in one table itself but since
the PDF is divided in sheets this
particular document is considering the
first table as a separate table and the
table which is present in the third page
as a separate table so we have table one
table two and there are few more tables
which Excel is assuming that it might be
table but it's not and another table
which is page number 002 it is a table
and another one is right here now there
is an option of selecting all the tables
all together at once or you can select
only one table which you want to select
so if you select multiple items Excel
will automatically give you an option of
choosing your tables you can just take
and select the tables you want or you
can directly select the table you want
on your Excel
sheet so right now let's try to select
multiple tables so I'll be selecting one
2 4 and five and this particular one is
not a table so I'm eliminating that now
you might want to choose the load option
so Excel is now loading the
[Music]
data now all the data has been
successfully
loaded
now yeah it is giving us a notification
that all the data has been successfully
loaded and now just right click on it
and here choose the option load to and
here select table option and if you want
the data to be uh you know loaded to a
new worksheet you can choose that and
select
okay now you can see all the dat data is
been successfully loaded in the form of
tabular format in the new Excel
sheet similarly let's try to load
another
page in the table
format new
worksheet select
okay and the third
sheet
now get ready to impress your boss by
converting all the PDF data into Excel
sheet just in a matter of few seconds
with few steps and there you go all the
four tables have been loaded
successfully in the form of excel in
just a few steps how to add Watermark to
excel now on my sheet you can see some
data so here we wanted to add some
Watermark logo to your uh Excel
spreadsheet so that it looks genuine and
work by you right so that's the overall
idea of adding a watermark now go to the
insert window and in the insert window
go to the text option click on that
select header and footer once you select
header and footer you can see something
on your screen like this so in this box
which is highlighted by a cursor is
where you're going to add the picture on
on my top in the menu bar you can see
header and footer elements in this
select the picture element and it will
navigate to you to a different option
window since we are adding the image
from our local system select from file
or if you are adding from your Bing or
any search window you can also add that
or one drive as well but now let's go
with from file it will directly navigate
you to the pictures folder in your local
system so here is my simply learns logo
click on it and select insert now you
can see the images added in this format
which is ampers and picture and you
might wonder where is the picture it is
actually present to view it click on any
cell in the spreadsheet and there you go
you can see it now you might be
wondering the image is a little towards
top and abnormally placed right so no
worries you can always you know format
your picture just press enter and use
enter to move your picture towards the
center of your data spreadsheet and also
there is a another option of format
picture alog together here you can
adjust the height and width of your
image by you know increasing and
decreasing width or increasing and
decreasing height using the arom marks
also works and apart from this there is
another option of picture formatting
where you can choose your image to be
washing out black and white gray scale
or anything so currently I'm going with
automatic which will automatically
adjust the brightness and you know
everything for your image it looks
perfectly fine so click on okay and
there you go right so now this should be
fine right now everything is done and
everything is automatically saved if you
are having that auto save option on your
spreadsheet and let's go back to the
normal view from the header and footer
view click on The View and go to
normal you might be confused right where
is the logo it vanish did I had to save
it no it's already saved everything is
fine even the image is there but you
cannot see it in normal view to see it
click on file click on print then you
can see the logo it will be present only
on the printed Pages not on the normal
view okay so that's how you work with
watermarks in Excel and that's how you
can add and customize your watermarks
using Excel so conditional formatting is
a method to visualize your worksheet we
already have the charts in Excel to
visualize our Excel sheets in graphical
form but what if you had to see or
visualize the data in your worksheet as
it is yes so that is where the
conditional formatting comes handy now
let's get back to the Microsoft Excel
and try to implement some conditional
formatting now we are on the Excel
worksheet this particular data set is
based on a store now we have various
columns in this particular data set we
have Pro ID order ID customer name Etc
and finally we have quantity discount
and profits now let's go to profits uh
let us imagine that we have provided
this particular ular store with a target
of minimum 15% profits now let us find
out the stores that have hit the 15%
Target and the ones which did not so for
that let us select the entire column now
you can find the conditional formatting
option in the home tool bar and in that
ribbon the ribbon with Styles has the
conditional formatting option click on
that and you have various options over
here highlighting the cells top bottom
rules data bar data scales and icons so
datab bar are actually the bar graphs
which highlight themselves on each and
every cell if you implement them and
these are the color scales if you want
to implement some colors you can go
through that and if you want to
represent your CS with icons you can
also do that for now let's highlight the
celles so select that and inside this
select the greater than option and here
you can provide the percentage that is
15% and the the cells or the stores
which hit the target should be
highlighted with green color and select
okay and there you go you have your
stores that hit the 15% Target and the
ones which did not hit the 15% Target
now if we want to highlight the ones
which did not hit the 15% Target you can
highlight them with the color
red
so conditional formatting highlight the
Cs less than
15% with color red and text dark and
there you go it's done now let us
consider another example so this
particular example is based on train
data set and here we have the passenger
ID survived passenger class name Etc now
we have a train accident incident over
here now one is indicated that they are
alive and zero is indicated that they
are not alive now let us use this column
and conditional formatting highlight the
cells containing the text as one with
color
green
okay
and highlight the
cells that contain text zero as red that
indicates they are not
alive and let us select the
icons now we have the icons over here
the X indicates that they're not alive
and the Green Tech Mark indicates that
they're alive now that is how you use
conditional formatting in Excel so to
understand the page setup in msxl we
will go through a demo inventory in
Excel where we'll be considering some
restaurant data now without any delay
let's get started with the Practical
demo now we are on the Excel sheet and
this is the data I was talking about the
restaurant data where we have the First
Column that is Rank and next we have the
restaurant name followed by that we have
the sales happening through that
restaurant and then we have the segment
category that is what kind of service
does that particular restaurant offers
now this is the list what we made and uh
what if we wanted to represent this data
in the form of a printed paper right so
I guess you can see all the columns and
rows here so you can see that we have
almost like 250 rows so there is no
chance or there is no way to print all
those 250 50 rows in one page of course
it is practically possible but when you
try to read the content it'll be so
tough to read Because all the rows will
be clued together so closely so that you
cannot read it so uh you need to print
them Page by page so and you need to
also take care of the data is aligned
properly according to the page size
everything and even you need to take
care of the margins of your page right
so that's what page seta basically means
so we had a detailed overview of our
data and what actually we're trying to
make now let us see how page setup is
possible in msxl so to go to the page
setup menu or go to the page setup
options we have three methods let's
start with the simplest method so the
simplest method is by just clicking on
file and go to print
option and you'll see all the page setup
options right over here and you can also
Al go to print menu by pressing a
shortcut method that is control P so
you'll directly end up on the page set
of options now let's look at the second
method so the second method is you can
see the toolbar over here right which
has file home insert draw page layout
formulas data review View and help so
the second method we can use page layout
option from the tool bar and you can see
when you click on the page option from
the toolbar you have a new ribbon over
here so this ribbon is all about page
setup options so it will offer you
margins it will offer you orientation
size print area brakes background print
tiles etc etc right so all these options
or menus in this ribbon belong to page
setup now let us look at the third
method so the the third method is
something similar you have view option
on the toolbar so just select View and
you can see we have few page setup
options over here as well the normal
page break page layout custom views and
we have grid lines formula bar heading
zoom in zoom out select to zoom free
certain panes right so all these are
also the page setup options so we have
the three methods to enter the page
setup options now we are familiar with
those now let's get started with the
Practical mode on page setup for that
let me use the simplest method that is
holding the control key and pressing P
which navigates me to the print
option now we have various set of
options here we have no scaling normal
margins letter portrait orientation
collated print active sheets and note
one for Windows you can see this option
is the printers option for for example
if you're connected to a printer which
is the hardware printer then your msxl
will show the printer's name here so
other than printer you can also make
some other arrangements where you can
just directly print your complete data
in the form of PDF and then you can
export your PDF to your recipent that's
also possible okay now let's get started
with the first option that is print
active pages okay to understand this
better we need to create a new sheet
not a problem so you can see that we
just have one sheet over
here so let us kind of select all the
items and create a new sheet and try to
paste it over here or let's try to paste
it over
here okay now let's try to extend
these yeah this should be fine now let's
rename this sheet sheet uh or let's
rename it as
Resturant sheet
two for our reference now let us get
back to the print sheet option so I'll
use the shortest method that is holding
the control key and press P now you can
see that here we have six pages in total
from the active sheets so the current
active sheet is the top 250 sheet so
this particular sheet is the current
active sheet so if you print the entire
data in this particular sheet then we
will end up printing six pages now let
us select the other option where you
have to print the entire
workbook right so now you can see that
there's a change in the number that is
12 pages so what is a workbook so
basically workbook is the collection of
entire sheets in your Excel homepage so
in this particular EX ex homepage you
have the first sheet that is top 250 and
the second sheet that is the restant
sheet two right so the combination of
these two sheets make up a
workbook so when you select the entire
workbook option you'll have 12 pages so
that's how we use this setting where you
select the active sheets the entire
workbook and there is another option
where you can only print a selected item
so if you want to do this then let's get
back here now
what if your customer or what if your
client wanted the top 10 restaurants
only so you can select the top 10
restaurants by doing
this now you have the top 10 restaurants
let's go to
print so you can see Excel has
automatically selected the selection
only print the selected content only so
you can see we have only the top 10
restaurants or top 11 restaurants that
we have selected in our sheet and it is
ready to get printed so this is how we
use the first option now let's get back
let's not select that and let's make the
pages normal now get back to the print
option again now you can see the next
option that is
collated right so in colet you have
different different options that is 1 2
3 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 and the next one which
is uncollated 1 1 1 2 22 333 so why are
these numbers present here and what does
colleted mean anyway so this is your
question right now the answer for this
question will be a little similar to
your examination Hall okay let us
imagine that you are an examination Hall
and you are the invigilator and you have
10 students in your room so you wanted
to provide question papers to all the 10
students okay so you have your question
paper distributed into three sheets that
is you have marked questions and your
questions are fit into three papers
right in this scenario we have 250 rows
and all the data is split into six
sheets that is sheet one or page one
page two page three page four right now
if we wanted to print 10 copies
then the arrangement of papers will be
page 1 page two page three page 4 page 5
page six in continuous order right that
is CED if you wanted 10 copies of
different different ways where you
wanted to print the first sheet first
then you wanted to print the second
sheet second and the third sheet third
that is you'll have 10 copies of first
page 10 copies of second page 10 copies
of third page and so on that that
particular approach is called uncollated
approach and if you're printing the
pages in continuous order for 10 times
then that particular approach is called
as collated approach so this is what we
had to learn about collated and
uncollated now let's get back to the
third option now let's press again print
now we have our data over
here there's something
wrong select all the elements control p
yeah now we have our data back now we
have the third option that is the
portrait
orientation okay so when we click that
we have two options that is portrait and
landscape so you might be having a good
idea like when you try to click a piure
in your phone we have two modes as well
that is portrait mode and the landscape
mode so when you click on the portrait
mode this is how your data will be
looking now to understand the difference
let's click the landscape mode so when
when you click the landscape mode this
is how your data representation will
change you'll have a wider page to print
so this is why we use the page
orientation for now let's get the page
orientation as portrait
orientation and we have now the fourth
option so what is the fourth option we
have various sets of options in here
that is letter and A4 size there are
also some more page options over here
where you can select the page types you
want to print
so basically you'll be having few more
options that is A4 A5 A3 Etc but here we
just have two that is A4 and letter so
basically you'll get those options and
followed by that next we have margins so
here you can see we don't have any
margins for our data okay so now we can
add some margins by setting up this one
as an option like last custom set
setting or you can also choose normal
wide narrow right so your page will be
changed according to your margin
size right so this is how you can change
the margins now let's keep it as default
let's set the normal
one now we have the next option that is
scaling option
so here you can see we are trying to fit
the page so when you're trying to print
these sheets using no scaling then the
actual size of the page will be printed
now you can also modify that you can fit
and print these sizes so you can
remember the first option that I said of
printing all the 250 rows in one single
sheet this is how you can fit it so fit
the sheet on one page where you can see
all the 250 rows are fit into one page
but the data is not readable so but we
don't want this type of an approach
right so let's keep it as the default
one which is no scaling so these are the
variety of options in print now if you
wanted to print the all the six pages
into the PDF format and mail it to your
client you can also do that I think I
have explained it in the first place so
you can see we can do it by just
selecting this option where you can
print all the six pages and into PDF
format and then you can mail them to
your
client and you can also select the
number of copies you want you can
increase the copies to two three and any
number of uh copies you want for now
I'll keep it as one
[Music]
copy now let's print
this
now let us select
the
location rename it and
publish now let's get back to documents
and see if the page is printed or
not here we go here we have the
resturant data in the form of
PDF
so we have our entire six pages of data
in the PDF
format now we are back on the homepage
now we had some limited functions in the
print function over here we had tried to
export the data so you can also export
the data or try to print it from the
print option over here you can just
select that as well make a new
file PDF
yes the pages are printed
now there you go we have the restaurant
2 PDF
[Music]
data so that's how you can print all
your data you can either
choose the export option or you can
either choose print option now when you
see into the print option we have
limited number of page setup options
over here now let's check out what we
missed so we are in the page layout here
so we had gone through the margins we
had set all the margins and then we have
also gone through the portrait and
landscape now you can see this size when
we were in the print menu option we had
only A4 and letter but here you can see
there are a wide variety of options that
is other than letter we have tabloid
legal statement executive A3 right we
have A5 and many more other options and
if you want some more people options you
can go to more and you can always select
a few more options that's how you do it
and yeah we didn't had the break option
so remember when we had been through the
print option we did not have the break
option there let's select this to noral
A4 so you cannot see the break option
over here right so here we have the
break option so what does break option
does right you can actually break the
page uh remember we spoke about the top
10 things or the top 10 rows you can
always do that so you can just keep the
top 10 restaurants in your first page
and then break the remaining and to set
page brakes you can select the cell now
I need the top 10 so I'll select this
particular cell which is in the 11th
position and now I'll try to implement
the page break insert a page break and
now you can see on my sheet there is a
thin line which is separating the two
pages that's how you can see the
indication of a page break implemented
onto your page now how do you see it you
can see it by selecting contrl P where
you can see the first top 10 restaurants
being printed on your sheet so there you
go we have the first top 10 restaurants
printed on our sheets so that's how you
use the page
break now let's try to eliminate all the
page breaks so you can select braks and
reset all page brakes so the page break
has been
eliminated now you can always choose a
background for your data as well you
just uh if you want you can add a
picture to your back background I think
that's not available for
now okay you can work offline as well
let us select this
one so you can see that we have added a
background to our
data we can select all the text files
and then we can change the color so that
the text becomes a little visible yeah
that's how you do it now if you don't
want the image to be added on your file
you can also remove that delete page
background and there you go all the
images are gone now the next important
part that is the print
titles now why do we need print titles
for that let's try to print this so now
you can see the first page in the first
page we have the title rank restaurant
sales segment category but if you go to
the second page you don't have that
title right you don't have the title
rank name of the restaurant sales and
their service category so if we want
that then we need to add titles now for
that let's select the print titles
option now let's select the rowes to
repeat on top now for that we need the
first row select the first row and this
particular row will be repeating into
all the pages now let's try to print it
so yeah now you can see the title are
being added to all the sheets you can
see the page two page three page four
page five and page six so you can see
the titles added to all the sheets so
that's how use the print titles option
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet and
here I'm trying to insert some images
onto my spreadsheet so here we have
company logos and Company brand names so
since we already have the brand names
what we need to add here is the brand
logos okay so how do I add such kind of
of an image into an Excel spreadsheet
that you might be thinking that Excel
spreadsheets are just for data not
multimedia image or files right so no
it's not it's completely wrong you can
also add your images onto your Excel
spreadsheets it's completely simple so
click anywhere on the Excel spreadsheet
navigate to the insert button select the
illustrations option from the addin
group click on that and you know in the
drop down you can see the pictures icon
or the pictures uh button click on
that
and select from this device or if you
have an online stock image you can take
that or you can also check out from
online pictures for now I'll select the
device this
device and here I have some images the
images what we need are simply learn and
simply code logos press okay or insert
so here you have
them now you can also adjust the size of
the image using the small buttons
here press it over
here and
done so you might be wondering is it all
done is there anything more to do uh or
just adding an image is done no most of
the times when you create or you work
with Excel spreadsheet you will not just
you know add some data and add a
relevant image to it most of the time
you add some graphs or you most of the
time you'll add some charts uh to
showcase the data dashboard right so it
will be something like this so this is
how you add the image or graph onto your
uh uh dashboard and sometimes you might
not have enough place to uh display your
entire dashboard during those situations
what you do is you try to hide the row
or column so now let's try to hide this
particular row let us imagine that you
wanted to show only uh two uh charts and
there is no space for your third chart
in such scenarios you might want to hide
or remove that third chart okay so let's
try to hide it and see if gets if it
gets hidden or not when you try to hide
it you can see the column A has no data
and the row number four is been hidden
so we have three and five but what about
the image it is still present right so
if you want to make sure that the row
also hides the image then you might have
to do a little formatting with it so
select the image go to picture
format or you can also right click and
directly navigate to picture format this
opens up a set of options and here you
might want to go to the U third uh one
which is picture format third and select
the properties and here select the
option move and size with cells so when
you select this when you try to hide
this it will also I mean the graph of
the image will also hide along with the
R so that's how you do it l is something
which is clickable and when you click on
it it will redirect you to a different
web page to a different worksheet or a
different location in your local system
so there are a variety of options and we
will explore all of them using Excel now
creating a hyperlink is really simple we
have multiple ways now let's write some
text on the Excel
worksheet I'll write simply
long now creating a hyperlink is really
simple you have multiple ways the first
simplest shortcut is clicking on the
cell where you want to place the
hyperlink and holding control key and
pressing K now this will enable the
hyperlink menu box or the dialog box
this is the first way and let me close
it now again we have have selected the
cell there is another option where you
have to click on the insert menu on the
toolbar and navigate to Links group
click on the link option and you will
again have the dialog box of the
hyperlink and Excel and the Third Way is
right click on the cell and you can see
the link option in the last and this
will enable the hyperlink option in
Excel now let's create a hyperlink the
simplest way again control k
now we have a variety of options that is
existing file or web page place in this
document create a new document and an
email address so we will address all of
these one at each time so first one
existing file or a web page now you can
select an existing PDF file or any file
in your local system and hyperlink or
create a hyperlink to the text or you
can select a website link and place it
over here and create it as as a
hyperlink Let's uh explore both the
options first let's try to explore the
web page option so since I have written
as simply learn let's use the website
link of Simply learn and create a
hyperlink let me open
Google new tab and let me type simply
learn.com let me copy the hyperlink and
now let's get back to the Excel workbook
now here let's place the hyperlink
now you can press okay and there you go
the hyperlink has been successfully
created now this link is clickable when
you click on it it will redirect you to
a new simply learns home web page right
so this is how you create a hyperlink to
a website now we shall explore another
option that is using an existing file
right let's create a new text box here
let's name it as
existing file in okay existing file
should be good again the same you can
either click uh you know right click and
select hyperlink or control ke now let's
select existing file or web page option
now here you can see navigate key press
on that and let's navigate our files
let's select all files you here remember
to select all files okay by default it
shows as office files now let's explore
our file option
so let's select uh fundamentals of
computer programming option which is a
PDF file press okay and there you go we
have created a hyperlink so when I click
on this you can directly navigate to an
existing PDF file in your local system
and it will be open as a web page click
on it and you can see the PDF file now
close now another thing when you
navigate onto this you'll see the lenier
HTTP uh address and same happens here
right so if you're are a little
uncomfortable watching this lengthier
link you can also edit it you can choose
the option of edit
hyperlink
and see the screen dip option click on
it and here you can change the text
display
option
and write it as click here to know
more press
okay again press okay and now if you
navigate onto it instead of seeing a
lenier hyperlink what you can see is
click here to know more okay I think I
made a spelling mistake so I think I
forgot an
e somewhere over here yes click here to
know more
and press okay right so here you can see
click here to know more let's try this
again over
here so
edit edit hyperlink screen tap option
and instead of the lenier text box or
hyperlink you can write as click to open
notes or
PDF click okay okay and click another
okay and you are done so instead of
seeing that lengthier hyperlink you can
see click here to open PDF right so so
far we have explored two options that is
existing file and existing web
page right now let's try to explore
another option again uh hyperlink right
click hyperlink and here you have seen
places in document all right so which is
like uh okay let me show this to you
instead of telling you so here what it
is doing is you have the cell A5 and you
want it to refer to A1 or any other cell
in the same worksheet so you can do that
right so now for your reference let me
cancel it and let me create a new sheet
and here navigate me to here right let
me write as navigate me to here
okay so now what we will do is so here
we will create that navigate link from
using the hyperlink option place this in
this document you can see the sheet to
option and the cell reference is A1
where we have written navigate me to
here so when I click this A5 cell okay
let me also rename
it write it as navigate cell navigating
cell right
now create
that control
K let me select sheet two and the select
address is A1 press okay now what did uh
what What's the change right when you
click on this you will be redirected to
sheet to cell A1 navigate me to here
right so this can be like a shortcut
when you have multiple sheets like 100
sheets then you can uh you know have a
different column over here and and uh
add the navigation address to all those
cell links you can just click on that
cell and go into the different sheet and
to the specific cell which you have
given the address in our case I have
given sheet to address cell A1 right so
this is another trick now let's get back
to the hyperlink thing again uh control
K and another option is create new
document so you might have been through
you know option of uh having
let's say some cheat sheets or uh clip
on clip boards right so uh let us
imagine that you're working through uh a
huge worksheet and uh you wanted to you
know uh have a a track of everything and
keep notes updating right so it might be
a little complicated to understand so
let me show it practically so let me
write it down as clipboard or sticky
note
right okay I think this has as a hyper
letters okay this can be used no
worries back
to uh hyperlink option
again create new document now here you
can create a variety of uh documents
right so it can be a text document it
can be an Excel document it can be a PDF
document right for now we'll create a
text document okay uh we'll name it as
uh
tracker. txt so this should create as a
text
document and the location can be
anything so you can you know uh take it
as a desktop documents download so let
me take documents here and select okay
so I'll be having the tracker. txt
located in the documents
folder and uh you can also choose to
edit the document later or edit the
document now let us select edit the
document now press okay and there you go
so you have your text tracker here so
let us imagine that we have worked on
the Excel sheet and we wanted to write
on us a sticky note uh so that we can
remember what we have done on the Excel
sheet so update
one and update two now you can close it
so it'll ask for a save option save it
and done and let us imagine that you did
something else and you also updated
something else on the sticky note I mean
Excel sheet and you wanted to update
that on your sticky note so click on it
and you'll see a minor noce over here
from Microsoft Excel based on potential
security concerns you can select yes yes
and you'll be having access to your text
document again and write down your
update again here update three what you
have written right the latest update
what you
have and you can save it and close
so that's how you keep track of your
sticky note and you'll have all your
updates right now getting back to the
hyperlinks
again uh the last one is email address
so you can also try to add uh okay let
us imagine that you're working with a
colleague and every time you make an
update in your Excel sheet or anything
and you wanted to send him out an email
right so it would be a little time
consuming that you open your email Emil
and uh compose something and send it
over here but what if you had one single
click and access to the email compose
option right that can be done so let us
write down
email B me with the spelling so again
the control K and hyperlink select email
option and you can write down your
email which can be anything so you can
write down your friend's email address
so I'm just writing down some random
email here friend
gmail.com
and can write the subject about
update and press okay this will navigate
you to the Gmail option or the mailing
address
options click on it and you'll have a
variety of mailing options Outlook
Office 365 Yahoo iCloud Google Etc so
you can select any one of those since we
have written as gmail.com we'll navigate
to Gmail and all you have to do is login
you know all the formalities and you're
good to go with
emailing so let's skip this for now so
you're you know how to do the rest parts
so so far we have uh you know covered
all the hyperlink options in Excel that
is existing file or a web page place
this in the current executive worksheet
or document creating a new document for
your update thing and uh also including
the email right so so far we have
covered everything around hyperlink in
Excel and if you have anything to know
more about or if you feel that we have
missed out anything important regarding
hyperlink in Excel how to calculate time
difference between two different timings
using Excel now let's get on to the
Practical mode now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet as you can see on my Excel
spreadsheet let me expand
it we have two different timings that is
n and out so here we are considering a
scenario where we are calculating the
total number of hours worked by an
employee in an organization so the in
time will be the time where the employee
logged in and the out time will be the
time when the employee logged out so
here we have made some minor cell
formatting so when you right click on
any of the cell you can get back to the
formatting sales option and in that
option we have selected the AM PM so
there is also another option of choosing
the 24-hour timing that is
1320 uh 13:30 so this represents the
24-hour
format but since we are you know working
on office timings let's keep it as a
p.m okay so there you go so we have our
uh timings of in and out now to
calculate the time difference between
the in time and out time so this
particular calculation is completely
simple all you have to do is press
equals to select out time minus select
in time so there you go press enter and
you have the total number of hours the
employee has been working in your
organization so here also we have made
some minor cell formatting so usually it
comes out as Am Pm right but instead of
that we have made a minor cell
formatting we have navigated into time
and we have selected the 24-hour
formatting so that that we have just RS
in our output so that's how we have
calculated the time difference between
two in times and out times of an
employee using Excel now with that we
have come to an end of this tutorial on
how to calculate time difference using
that is how to freeze rows in Excel now
we might want to start our practical
mode So currently we are on Excel and
this is a spreadsheet
data so here you can see columns and
rows so especially the fourth row and
the column C right so uh currently we
have data on our uh spreadsheet and it
is exceeding the number of rows
currently visible on our screen right so
when you scroll down you can see that
the header or the headers of all the
columns are getting vanished or scrolled
up along with the data right and you
might want to keep that so that you'll
have reference to every sing single
aspect of or every single cell data
you're referring to right so for that
reason you might want to freeze this and
also you might have a doubt what if uh
even even I had this data in the column
section right and what if I had to
freeze that and you know when when you
scroll this and keep that data uh set on
the column as it is right so we can also
do that let's look at both of them so
there is a simple process to do that all
you have to do is Select this cell or
for which you want to uh you know set
the or freeze the column adjacent to it
or the row adjacent to it right so
currently I want to let me expand it so
currently I want to freeze this
particular row right and this particular
column so the cell I would be selecting
is the first cell here that is
D5 right so when I select this
particular cell I can be able to freeze
this particular row and this particular
column so now you need to to navigate to
the toolbar and then select the view
menu and inside view option you can see
there is an option of freeze pains right
so click on the drop down so you can see
three different options as we discussed
earlier we can either choose to freeze
an entire row that is the second option
or you can freeze the entire column that
is the third option or you can freeze
both that is the first option right
freezing rows and columns so let's
select this one and see if our rows and
columns are frozen or not right so now
let's scroll down and you can see our
row is successfully Frozen there right
and similarly scroll towards right and
you can see our column has been
successfully Frozen right so this is how
you freeze rows and columns or you can
freeze panes in Excel so with that we
have come to an end of this tutorial on
how to freeze rows or how to freeze
columns or how to freeze both the Pines
in Excel spreadsheet we are on our Excel
spreadsheet now creating a pivot table
is just away from a few clicks trust me
it just a couple of clicks and you'll
have your pivot table ready to operate
now click any cell or select any cell on
your spreadsheet which has the data and
navigate to insert menu on the toolbar
and select pivot table and that's how
simple it is now automatically Excel
will choose your data you can see the
lines over here dotted lines that means
the Excel has already selected the range
of data that you want to put into your
pivot table and you can either select
the existing worksheet or a new
worksheet I'll select a new worksheet
over here and just press on okay and
there you go you have your pivot table
ready now here you can see your pivot
table is a little empty all you need to
do is drag and drop the data elements
that you want on your pivot table so
here you can see on our spreadsheet we
have some business data related to our
store which has furniture and states and
subcategories of the furniture and all
the you know in in category you have
furniture office technology Etc right so
those have some subcategories as well
and different states and the regions as
well and the quantity total sales happen
right so using this business data we can
find out some key insights of this
particular data using our pivot table
right so here we'll add the data now let
me drag the region into rows click and
drag and let me drag uh categories into
columns which are the different
categories which are involved in the
sales data and values what are the sales
happened right and there you go you have
Furnitures off a supplies technology as
the three different categories and those
are the sales happened in central e
South and West regions and this is the
grand total and instead of regions you
know you have all the regions over here
right so Central East Southwest or
instead of uh all the regions or instead
of all the categories you can you know
place a specific category in your pivot
table for example let me push the
category into the filters and here you
can see the total sales happened in
those particular regions now what if
someone asks you to find the sales of
Only Furniture right so your manager
comes to you and he'll ask you getting
the sales of only Furnitures you can
select that and there you go you have
the furniture sales in all the regions
right or you can also do the vice versa
he can also drag uh regions into the
filters and if you wanted to find out
the region wise sales of furniture you
can also do that
right so here we have furniture and here
you have all the regions and let us try
to find the sales of furniture in the
central region and there you go right so
this is how um the pivot table works and
you can also remove the regions for
example if you wanted to remove a
certain element from filters or anywhere
if it is columns rows anything you can
just drag and drop it right so that's
how it works and also you can increase
the level of detail or improve the
granularity right so here we have U
categories on our uh you know columns so
you can also include subcategory into
the columns right
and and you have the region wise
sales so in the region filter select
all press okay and in the category
select
all press okay and you have the
furniture here office supplies here and
Technology here and also if you want to
include the quantity how much or how
many number of um you know things got
sold in those particular categories and
subcategories you can also do that so
here in the furniture section books
these are the sales and these are the
number of quantity or elements sold in
in those particular you know sectors so
you can you can also improve the level
of granularity you can also improve the
level of detail using pivot tables in
Excel having said that if you are an
aspiring data analyst looking for online
TR certification from the expert
universities and in collaboration with
the realtime industry experts then
search no more simply learns
postgraduate program in data analytics
in collaboration with IBM from the
Purdue University should be the right
choice for more details on this course
please click the link in the description
box below now here we have four
different sheets of the sales so the
first sheet is the West Zone next is
South Zone East Zone Zone and central
zone so all this data belongs to one
single sheet that is Superstore data set
so I have categorized or I have taken a
part of the data which belongs to
central region South Region west region
and east region now we are going to use
all these four sheets and create one
single sheet which is the pivot table of
all the four sheets now without further
Ado let's start the process now for that
we might want to use the shortcut key
that is alt D now press P now this
starts the pivot chart
wizard now here we have to choose the
option multiple consolidation
ranges then click on
next and here you can see the pivot
table is clicked by default now we'll go
to next now here click I will create
page fields or the pivot chart wizard
will automatically create if you want
that to create for you now click on next
now here let's select the
range now I'll be selecting the
range add
it now next we'll Select
East
it followed by that we have
South and finally we have
bestest now we will name these according
to the
regions so the first one will be
West next one will be
South next one will be
East and the last one will be
Central
click on next and here select new
worksheet and finish and there you go
you have the pivot table here now you
might want to change the submission
value so click anywhere on the pivot
table and change it from count to
sum so that you have the sumission of
the total number of sales subcategory
sales and grand total of sales Etc now
here you can see all option now let's
select Central and you'll get the
details of the central region the grand
total and the sales happening quantity
of sales Etc now here can you can see
the furnature office supplies technology
and the grand total all in one single
sheet now let's get back to the original
sheet so as you can see this is the
original sheet and in the original sheet
you can see various more categories
which is the which is the shipment mode
customer customer segment country City
State uh and you also have uh product
name subcategory Etc so if you had added
all these into this sheet you can also
create a separate option of adding minu
details to your pivot table so that is
how the pivot table is created using
multiple sheets so how to create a PIV
chart you ask it is really simple all
you need to do is just follow few steps
and you have your PIV chart ready which
is completely interactive now all you
have to do is select any cell in the
data set you have and rush into the
insert toolbar then in the group of
charts you have an option called pivot
chart select on it now you'll be asked
to select the data range and you can see
Excel has automatically select all the
range that you want to include in your
PIV chart then you have another option
which is asking you to either create the
PIV chart in the current worksheet or a
new worksheet for now let's select a new
worksheet and there you go voila the
pivot chart is completely ready you
might ask me this is completely empty
yes the default pivot chart what you get
from Excel will be completely empty but
you can add the Legends and all the data
that you want to add onto your PIV chart
just by dragging and dropping the data
from the right hand side of your Excel
sheet that is from the P chart Fields so
you can see we have various options
region category state subcategory sales
quantity Etc now I'll add
region I'll add region to
access and comparatively we will see the
sales that are happening in those
particular regions by dragging sales
into values now you have all the data in
the form of pivot chart which is
completely interactive which represents
the sales happening in those regions now
you can also select a particular region
right by default all the regions are
selected but if you want to select only
Central then you can do that by
deselecting everything and select only
Central and select okay and there you go
you have all the data related to the
sales happening in the central region
now if you want to you know kind of see
all the uh categories of sales happening
in all the regions you can drag the
category into values again and uh in the
region part okay I think we have to add
category into Legends yes now select uh
regions that that is all regions and
select okay and you can see the category
wise sales in all regions at one single
go and I hope you did not observe it
clearly uh the XL also gives you the
completely prepared pivot table as well
right which is also interactive you can
also get to choose the data from here as
well and select okay and you'll see that
being reflected on the pivot chart so
here you can see both pivot table and
pivot charts are completely interactive
now we are on the Microsoft Excel and we
have taken some sample data to make
things look simple so here we
considering a set of students and their
attendance percentage so we will be
using this particular particular data
and design a progress
tracker now let us try to increase the
size of the
cells now select all the cells in the
attendance
column now we have selected all the
cells in the attendance column and in
the toolbar select the Home tab and
inside the Home tab you have styles
group inside the Styles group select
conditional formatting and inside the
conditional formatting option
select new
rule so in the new rule we want to
select the first option that is format
all cells based on their
values now here you can see format style
since we trying to create a databas we
need to select the option of databas
here and under the data bar options we
have some more options on the drop down
menu so here in the type select
number and the minimum number is zero it
is automatically stored here and the
maximum value is again a number and let
us provide it as one now here you can
select the color for your pass now since
we have already chosen green for all the
column headers let's choose
blue
and select okay now here you can see
that the values are being indicated
using bar graphs right and you can also
see the percentage values but we can
make it look a little more better by
shifting them to the left side and text
could be given as white so that it's
more uh vibrant to look at and now we
can also apply some conditional format
onto these attendance columns so let us
try to highlight the students having
attendance less than
65% so highlight cell heru less
than
65%
attendance with red color select okay
and there you go you you have the
progress tracker right on your screen
and using the same principles you can
track the attendance for all the
students and also you can apply some
conditional formatting onto all your
cells and highlight the ones which are
not on the track now this is how you can
Implement progress trackers using Excel
right on my screen you can see a
circular progress tracker so it is
tracking the percentage of the first
student that is Stacy now let's try to
change the marks of Stacy from
engineering subject from 55 to
75 and U engineering subject 4 from 68
to 84 then you can see the percentage is
getting changed and also the same is
getting implemented on the progress
tracker interesting right would you like
to create a similar circular progress
tracker yes that can be done that's
exactly what we discussing today so
let's get started with our onepoint
agenda that is circular progress tracker
in in Excel now let's get back to the
Practical mode so let us enter into a
duplicate sheet which has all the marks
of the students so now we are on the
duplicate sheet where we have all the
students names and the marks list and
also the percentage now let us create a
new column which states the actual
percentage minus the overall percentage
so the overall percentage is 100 and the
actual percentage is uh 75 76 and so on
let's try to calculate this or let's try
to convert it into the percentage
format
now let's try to change some
values yeah
good now let's try to change this yeah
we were supposed to add the percentage
symbol which we forgot now it's
implemented there now let's drag it
again so there you go we have the
remaining percentage as well so we have
the actual percentage and the remaining
percentage so we need both of them to
apply the donut chart so we have
selected both the percentages and now
we'll enter into insert menu then you
can see um pie chart icon over here
click that and you have a donut chart
over here select that and you have the
donut chart so now let's remove the
symbols which we don't need so we have
removed the uh details of one and two
there and uh let's change this to
Circular
progress tracker so we have remove the
Legends and we have renamed the chart
name as circular progress tracker and
now let's try to insert the percentage
icon or the text chart so you have the
text chart or text box option over here
select that drag and drop it
here yeah we have the text box here
select that go to the formula bar select
equals to and now select the address
cell there you go you have it now we
have the percentage in the text box now
you can make your edits I'll bring it to
Center alignment to Center text color to
Blue as we have it on the Outer Circle
and you can change the font you can make
it bold increase the font
size there you go so we have the
progress tracker
okay let's try to group the text box
with the chart so that we can move them
all
together so now you can make some
changes and see if that's working or not
so let's make the change to the
engineering subject one from 32 to 68
and press enter there you go the changes
have been applied the percentage got
changed to 78 from 72 and the same has
been implemented here and even the
progress chart is also working on the
same way so that's how you create the
circular progress charts in Excel now at
times you might be working on a really
important spreadsheet on your Excel or
you might have the sales data of your
company or some confidential data of
your organization and you might have
shared the file with your junior or you
might face some paret issue and you
forgot to save or you missed to save
your data and what to do if you cannot
save your data and how can you recover
it right so this might be a really big
hassle today we exactly going to discuss
the same and see how to do it in
multiple ways so Excel comes up with an
option to automatically save the data
also it will try to warn you that your
data is not being saved would you like
me to save it or not right so we'll do
the first one so here you have the
autosave option you can either say okay
to it it or you can ignore it in case if
you ignore it if you choose to ignore it
or if you choose to manually save it and
then if you want to close the file
remember we haven't saved the file if
you wish to close it Excel will
automatically come up with a dialogue
box asking you want to save your changes
to your data.
xlsx that means it is asking you if I
have to save it or not let's try to
ignore this and forcefully let's try to
close it you can go to task manager
option here we are trying to simulate
the option of par issues so we are
forcefully closing Excel without saving
any
data so we have closed it now here you
can see we do not have Excel running in
the background now when you directly
open or try to start Excel when you get
the power backup again and if you want
to open that same data file it will ask
you the document recovery option it says
you have closed the file without saving
the changes and you can choose to you
know come back from the same place where
we left last time okay now that was the
paret issue and now let's see uh another
way okay let's imagine that somebody uh
eliminated few important data files from
your organization's confidential data
employee ID employee name Etc and again
uh let's simulate the force uh close of
the
Excel now we are closing it again
without saving no data was been
saved now it will also ask the same uh
data it has another version here the
original one which wasn't saved so here
you can recover the same file again
however it was initially so you can save
it and it will get back to the original
place so this was one way also we have
another few multiple ways just we have
to navigate to file and here you can can
open and in the open menu you have a
button called recover unsaved workbooks
not just the current workbook it will
also have all the remaining files which
are related to excel that are not saved
so here you have a few workbooks which
was not saved this is one option and we
also have another option we can just
navigate to info and there you have
another option called manage workbook
and in the manage workbook you have
another option called recover unsaved
workbooks which will also redirect you
to the same file that is Microsoft
Office unsaved files and you'll have all
the unsaved workbooks which are related
to excel so this is how you can recover
the unsaved data in Excel using multiple
ways first thing Excel will
automatically ask you if you have to
save the file or not and in case if you
forget to save it you can directly
recover it by default by Excel it will
automatically show that some folder was
not saved on the left side of your Excel
spreadsheet by default and in case if
you missed out on that one you can
manually go to file and you can either
choose open option or info option to
recover the unsaved folders from your
default file location from your PC that
is Microsoft Office unsaved files
Etc which will have all the list of all
unsaved workbooks related to
excel so first we will understand what
exactly is standard deviation so
standard deviation is a calculated
square of variance now what is variance
okay nothing to worry let us also
understand what is
variance now the next part variance so
what is variance variance is a measure
of variability it is calculated by
taking the average of squared deviations
from the mean now what are deviations so
slowly you can understand that we're
getting into the topic of statistics and
graphs so uh before getting deep into it
let's understand what deviation so the
deviation is a measure that is used to
find the difference between the observed
value and the expected value of a
variable in simple terms deviation is
the distance from the center point so
for example when you are going through a
graph so you will be expecting some
value right and if you get some
difference that is above or below the
expected point that is called the
deviation what is the difference between
the expected point and the obtained
point so that is the deviation now next
is the observed value so the observed
value is the value that you get in real
time unlike the predicted value so now
you might be thinking to calculate
standard deviation we might need a few
more parameters and you're exactly right
so to calculate standard deviation in
Excel you need variance and then you
need deviation and then you need mean
right so all these parameters are
supposed to be calculated first and then
you will be having the final formula to
calculate standard Devi now that we
understood the theoretical and formula
based explanation about standard
deviation it's time we calculate the
standard deviation using one of the most
popular business intelligence tool that
is Microsoft Excel so let's get back to
the Practical
mode so now we are on the Practical mode
and we have some sample data on my
screen right now let me expand it a
little
bit yeah there you go so as discussed
prefer to calculate standard deviation
we might require the mean variance
deviation and deviation squar and then
we can calculate the standard deviation
so let's go step by step so the first
one is calculating sum right so to
calculate average we might need sum of
all the scores so we have the index
values that is 1 to 10 and scores of
each index value that is 1 to 10 right
now let's calculate the sum of all
values use here press tab to select the
function select and drag these cells
press enter and then you have the scores
now you want number of indexes so
clearly you can see we have 10 but still
let's count them C N tab space to select
and select the number of cells press
enter and you have count now what's the
mean so mean is simply the average of
all the numbers right so you can either
divide the sum by count or you can
simply use the average function so let's
try to use the average function so that
we also have an idea of how the average
function Works press tab to select it
and select all the cells and press enter
now you have the average or mean value
now we have the mean value and now after
finding the mean value we are supposed
to find out the deviation so remember
the deviation that is the difference
between the obtained value and the
predicted value right so the obtained
value is this one which is here in C2
and the predicted value is this one that
is 82.6 that's our mean right according
to formula we supposed to eliminate the
value of obtained minus the mean right
so select uh the cell equals to
C2 minus the obtained value that is mean
now press F4 to freeze the value and now
press enter so that you can freeze the
value and drag the formula
across all the cells now you have the
deviation
right now the next step is to find the
sum of all the deviation numbers so
either you can apply the sum formula to
all these numbers or you can just drag
the cell over here and the formula will
be automatically copied now similarly
the count function to count all the
values that us drag it and you'll have
it over here right now the next step is
to find out the square deviations or the
square of the Devi iations which is
really simple all you have to do is
equals to select the cell and uh see
that small hat kind of logo on the
number six use that now into two press
enter you have the square similarly drag
the same formula across all the cells
and you'll have your square numbers
similarly drag this summation function
over here so you'll have the sum of this
and the count number as
well now comes the final
formula now we have the mean value that
is over here let's color
it and we have the variation
Square now that is which is this one
let's color it in a different shape and
we have deviation as well let's color it
in a different
shape now we need to find the variance
and after we find the variance the last
step is to count the standard Devion or
calculate the standard deviation so what
is the formula to calculate the variance
so for variance you need the sum of
deviation
Square divided by total number of
values minus
one press enter and that's your variance
now the standard deviation so the
standard deviation is really simple you
need to
calculate the variance to the power
of
05 and that's your standard
deviation so that's how you calculate
standard deviation in Excel I hope all
the formulas and the explanation was
clear now you can see that I have sales
data on my worksheet so uh let us
imagine that your manager asked you to
find the average of sales happening in
your company right so let's navigate to
the bottom most sell and you know write
it down as average
here okay average
sales so here this is a cell where you
want to keep your average right so here
we'll be writing a small formula that is
average and tab to select it now you
must select the array of data
right so this is my array since average
is an array function and now press enter
so there you go you have the average
sales data that happened in your company
so what is Su in Excel now you might
want to calculate uh the total sum of
sales right so let us assume that this
is your entire storees sales data and
you wanted to calculate the entire sum
of sales so there is a sum function in
cell where you just have to you know
select all the cells and apply some
function onto it and you'll get the sum
of all the cells right so with something
like this you'll select all the cells
and then you'll apply a sums function
and you'll get the sum here and average
everything right so this is fine but
what if you just wanted to find the
sales that are happening in only western
region as you can see our column f is
based on region so we have four regions
South West East and Central
so your manager asks you to find the
sales happening in suppose say west
region so how do you calculate it what
you manually go into each cell and check
if it's West and calc that will be time
consuming right so what if you had a
method which could do it for you just in
a matter of few steps or few clicks
right so that's exactly sums so it will
basically add a condition calculate the
sum of sales where the region is equals
to West simple to like or similar to Cal
query right so that is exactly what
we're going to do in Excel today that is
using summs now let me add here Sales of
West Region now in the next cell let's
add uh sumus function remember there are
multiple sum functions in Excel so when
you type in suum you can see so many
options based on sum right you just have
some followed by that you have some if
if it is just some if not some ifs today
we are concentrating on some ifs so not
just some if we'll go to some ifs so
we'll be having an option of placing
multiple if conditions there so let's
also try that more on that later now
let's press tab to select our sum FS
function now okay we forgot another
important step so before we apply sufs
we need to convert our table into a
table format yes it looks table but
right now it's not in table format it is
in the format of database we know that
Microsoft Excel considers its data as a
database by default so to convert the
database into table just click anywhere
on the data and press control T so that
you'll have a new dialogue box and it
will ask if your table has headers just
make sure that you have Ted in it our
table does have headers so select okay
now our database has been converted into
a perfect table and it's ready for
applying sus function so now you can see
our data base has been successfully
converted into our table now let's begin
with our sufs now again remember we are
using some ifs here not Su if or sum so
select sum ifs and press Tab and we have
our sus function now the first step
which column are we looking at what are
we finding out right which is a sum
range what sum do you want for now we
need sum of sales so select the sales
column and we have a simple key function
here let let's hold control again press
shift and hold shift together so we're
holding control and shift key together
and now we're pressing lower Arrow key
once yes the entire sales column has
been selected comma Now where do you
want to look so we want to look I mean
which part of the table you want to
fetch right so this is the region part
we want to fetch right now so again hold
control and shift together lower Arrow
key the entire column is selected now
the next last part so we want to look
into the both of the columns that is
sales column and region column now which
type of data you want so for now we want
Western type of data that is the sales
data which is happening only in West
right so we'll select this cell with the
data as West or you can also manually
enter it for now let's select the data
so I'm selecting the cell F7 which has
uh data as West right now let's close
the parenthesis and press enter
so there you go you have the sales
happening in the western region now you
can also try to format it in the form of
currency so let's use uh dollars since
it is based on American states so let's
use dollars so there you go now we are
having the sales data of West now let's
try to copy the same to all the for
sales and uh now here let's type in
East and this can be South right and
this can be your
central there you
go right now you can also copy the same
formula and make minor edits to it so
here instead of f8 you can select uh
East so where is East here and press
enter so you have the sales related to
East now let's try to edit F9 where with
South select South Region enter so you
have South sales and what remaining is
Central so let's edit Central as well
and press enter so there you go right
now you have all the separate sales data
from west east south and Central now
again uh you might want a bit more
granularity in data right or in your
reports right like you wanted to find
the sales data happening in West and you
wanted to find out the category based on
only Furnitures so your manager will ask
you okay a fantastic job so now just
give me another minute detail on the
data I want to calculate the sales
happening on West based on category
Furniture right so he wants furniture or
he wants office supplies only right you
can also do that it's not an issue at
all now let's try to copy the cell and
paste it here and sales invest let's add
another input here on for
Furniture right now you wanted to
calculate the sales happening in west
region only on furniture so you can also
do that now we can use the same formula
as well just copy paste the formula here
right and you can add few things here
when you try to add a comma it will
automatically generate the next criteria
so it is expecting that you are looking
for adding another criteria right now
which column you want you want category
so let's select category you want to
select all the cells same track control
shift lower key and again press comma
and you wanted to select only uh
Furniture so select on furniture cell
there you go now press enter so there
you go we successfully have the sales
data from west region based on category
Only Furniture so that's how you do sus
and Xcel you can also add a few more
details to it like in Furniture you can
also look only for tables so here you
can see in west region we have furniture
sales data and we have sales data of
West Region based on furniture which
includes only tables you can also do
that using sumus function in the same
way all you have to do is select the
subcategory column and select the cell
which has the data as tables so this is
how you use sus in Excel and you can see
on my screen we have the sales data of
one single employee in the month of
January okay so this is the sales data
of John in January sales now let us
imagine that we have the same person's
or same John's data of sales of all the
three months okay so here we have the
sales data of John for January February
and March and you wanted to Club all
these three months and write it down as
quarter one right so let us try doing
it
now you can see that uh only January is
replaced as quarter 1 and February and
March are still uh remaining the same so
let us try to delete them so we have
deleted them and I think now it looks
like uh this is a sales data of one
single quter that is qu 1 but again qua
1 is under column B and anyone who looks
at it feels like this data is of January
February and March and all the quarter 1
details are only present in V column but
C and D are completely you know
different from this one right so you
don't want that kind of an impression on
your uh you know the one who presenting
to you so in those situations you want
to merge all these three columns and
make sure that the quarter one is
present somewhere in between the cells
so that all the data looks relevant and
uh it it defines that these data
elements belong to quoto one right so
there is an option in Excel to do that
so select all the cells that you want to
merge and going to home button and in
home button get into the alignment group
and select merch and Center so you can
do it directly also you have a couple of
more options that is merge and center
merge across merge cells and unmerge so
we'll go through it one by one so first
we'll go through merge and center so
there you go the cell is called mer and
it has been aligned into center now
again if your manager or anyone Superior
to you wants this to be you know
independent like they want it to be in
terms of January February and March so
that they can have access to it in
month-wise so you want to unmerge it
back right how to do that now so the
same menu and select unmerge and there
you go you have your data back in the
original form again all you have to do
is you know rename a few CES
there you go and you have it back right
so in a few situations okay you can also
add the bords so that it looks more
relevant now um you know let's try to
March this again and merch in Center
yeah now again uh let us imagine that
you are going through an appraisal cycle
and you also wanted to add some comments
about the sales happening in your
company uh regarding uh all the
employees right so also we have that
here now let me expand a little
bit Yeah there so again let's Marg and
center now uh you want it to you know uh
you wanted to take a review of your
level one level two and level three
managers so you have all the three um
rows here but you can see the cells are
not merged and uh you wanted to merge
every single row so merging and
centering everything rowwise would be a
little time consuming I mean three
columns is okay but what if you had like
uh you had to take a review from a
couple of more managers like 5 to 10
right uh or imagine you wanted to write
some random comments apart from review
you wanted to write some random comments
based on month-wise uh sales or
something like that so it would be
timeconsuming right so apart from that
you have another option where you you
know select all the sales and come over
here and select the option of merge
across and all the CES will be merged
all together at once and you will be
having those individual rows where you
can write down your reviews like review
one and so on
review two right so this is how the
option of merch across works and we
already have been through the merge and
center and merge is completely similar
to merge and center so this is how
mergin Center merge sales and uh merge
across and unmerge sales in Excel works
so you can see that we have got started
with Microsoft Excel and on the left
hand side we have a simple table with
all the teams in an IT industry starting
from it admin testing development to
client consultant support we have got
everything in this particular
table now our main idea is to find out
the index of these particular elements
for example if you wanted to find the
index of the element marketing then how
could you do it so here let's try to use
the match function in Excel for that we
want look up value and position so on
the right hand side you can see that
I've created two separate columns as
lookup value and positions so in the
lookup value column we will be inserting
the value of which you want to find the
index now for example let us consider
that we we want to find the index value
of Team
marketing so I'll be writing Marketing
in this particular lookup
value now how to find the index value of
the element marketing for that we will
be using the match function in
Excel now after writing the match
function you can see that it is asking
for three different parameters
so the first one is the lookup value
second is the lookup array and lastly we
have match type so lookup value is the
value of which you are trying to find
the index that is marketing this
particular cell so we have selected the
lookup value which is the first one next
we have to select the lookup array that
is from which set of elements you want
to find the index so the set of elements
are this it admin testing the column
which we have created Creed the a column
now we have selected the lookup array
and lastly the match type is it you're
looking for less than or is it you're
looking for exact match or is it greater
than match so for now I want exact match
so I will be selecting the exact match
that is
zero now there you go you have the exact
index of the element that is five now we
have selected all the 10 teams starting
from it1 admin 2 testing three
development for marketing five so that's
how you find the index of a selected
element in
Excel now we just have like 10 elements
so we have got the uh writing of the
elements or you know uh choosing the
elements in a easy way but what if if
you had like 100 elements right could be
a little different okay so let me put it
simple now you wanted to find the index
value of Finance so right now we have
marketing and you wanted to type in
finance and you missed out a letter
A okay now you're not finding the right
index to avoid such problems you can
always take the help of data validation
in Excel that is using the list in data
validation in Excel you can see a small
drop- down icon here right you can
choose that and here you can see all the
names that we have created in the left
column right so here I can scroll down
and choose the finance and there you go
I have the index value okay again we
need to copy paste the same match
function in Excel over
here equals to
match look up
value look up X
arry and exact
match so there you go that's how you
make use of data validation in Excel and
using the list you can comprehend all
the list elements in this particular
column into the list of data validation
and you can choose the team whichever
you want to find the index for so this
is how you can make use of match
function in Excel or index match
function in
Excel now we are on our spreadsheet and
you can see I have some sample data on
my spreadsheet and it does have some
blank rows now how do I eliminate these
blank rows so one step is you can you
know select the entire row and try to
right click and delete
it again this sort of method might take
hours to get rid of all the blank rows
and most of the time you might end up
even selecting the rows with data in it
right so if I want to select multiple
rows then I'll be selecting some rows
with data as well which might be a
little Troublesome in the future now
let's try to use the easier way now for
that go to the find and select option
select the go to special option and in
that select the blanks option and press
okay now hold control key and press
minus key and you will have an option of
deleting the cells now select the entire
row now we are selecting the entire rows
for blank data and press okay and the
cells will be shifted now this was
simple but let me show you another
example so even here we have some blank
rows but in between those blank rows for
example take cell 17 or cell d17 or row
17 we have some data testing and here in
the employee ID we have some data in
a26 and again in b39 we have some data
that is his first
name right in such scenarios how do I
eliminate data so we have a simple Logic
for it so all we need to do is add
another row which is to count the number
of cells in the row now that can be
count now here equals to the function is
Count
a PR Tab and and the cells will be from
A2 to
G2 press enter now you have seven so now
we are basically calculating the number
of cells so if you apply the same to the
entire um data set let's drag
it and there you go so there are certain
places where you find zero which are
basically the mty columns right now
let's do some formatting if you
need let's try to add
filters crl a control D and now table
will have filters and
headers now here you can see the drop
down icon click on that now instead of
select all what you can do is Select
zero now you will be highlighted with
all the rows which do not have any data
select all those and press on delete or
what you can do is the same way control
minus there you go
now clear the
filter now all you have is the data
without any kind of blank rows so all
the rows that had some amount of data
retrained and all the data or all the
cells or all the rules which do not have
any data which are completely blank they
have been eliminated what is Excel
vlookup vlookup stands for vertical
lookup vlookup lets you search for
specific information in your spreadsheet
it allows you to search for a particular
value in a column and returns another
value from a different column but of the
same Row V lookup takes advantage of
vertically aligned tables to quickly
find data associated with the value the
user
enters so what exactly is vlookup
function basically V lookup function is
a lookup method involving to fetch the
data from a tabular data set Now vooka
function is a pre-made function in Excel
which allows searches across columns so
basically we have three type of lookup
functions and V lookup is one of those
we have V lookup H lookup and X lookup V
lookup is vertical lookup H lookup is
horizontal lookup and X is a combination
of both V and H lookup so the Syntax for
V lookup is as follows so we will have a
lookup value that is the cell address or
the value which you are looking for and
the table array which is the range of
elements that you want to look out for
and the the column is the resultant
column from which you want the result
and the match is it supposed to be an
exact match or the nearest match so I
believe the theoretical explanation of
the syntax is incomplete without having
a practical demonstration so let's get
back to Excel and try to execute some
view lookup functions so that you have a
a lookup function and especially a v
lookup function Works in Excel right we
are on the Excel spreadsheet right now
so let's start with a simple one right
so here I will have car and price so
here I will give up a drop down menu
using data validation so that you can
simply choose the data right so we will
go to data data
validation list and the source will be
these are the ones for the source and
press okay you don't have to enter any
error messages Etc to know error
messages and more details on data
validation in Excel please go through
the data validation in Excel tutorial by
simpling down and now in the price
section we will have the V lookup
function right now the first one lookup
value which is this particular cell
right so V look function we look for the
value here so let's say I give
Lamborghini and then it will fetch the
cost of Lamborghini from the table so
where is it looking for the value First
Look up value is Lamborghini which is
right in front of car in the cell E5 so
that is the first parameter we need to
provide or attribute we need to send out
then the table array which table array
should it look for this is the table
array it looks for and I'm eliminating
the header over here we need to
eliminate the header and the column
index number right now we are giving the
car name and now we want the price so in
the table car is column one price is
Colum column 2 right even if this
particular car price is around anywhere
in the table car is still considered as
column one price is still considered as
column two so we need the value from
column two right so we will provide
column number two and the last one exact
match we want the exact match not
appropriate match so select that press
on Tab to select now close the value
right close the bracket now let's get
back to card and now select any one of
of the Cs let's select BMW right now
when you select BMW what lookup is doing
is it is first checking the value here
look up value spmw so since we got the
value spmw it will go back to this
particular table and fetch for the name
BMW right and now it has the BMW data
and now the third parameters that is
column two right so it will check column
two and see the exact match what is the
value of the car 75 or 7 50 uh million
right $7.5 million so that will give you
the data over here that's it so that's
how V lookup works now this is still a
fundamental understanding of V lookup
let's elaborate a little more to
understand it in a much right now I I
have here the flight data right and here
you can see when I select the
source and uh
destination and uh flight
which I want to fly in then it it's
giving me the price of the flight and
the route in which it is going how did I
do it so let's do it practically right
so we will get back
here and uh here we'll do some
changes okay it's okay
fine now here we have
everything
the source and destination airline price
on
Route let's also
provide
route Source will be again data
validation go to data data validation
will be a
list this is the list press okay and
destination is again data validation
select
list and now the list of
destinations and
Airline is again a data validation
operation where you will give the set of
or the list of air L which you are
offering and okay now comes the price
equals to we look
up passing these three
values and table array which is again
the
same the entire table except the
headers
next will be the column number so 1 2 3
4 and five price is in the fifth column
so I will pass column number five and I
want exact match not appropriate match
press tab to select close the bracket
and enter right and same applies to
Route so equals to or you can just copy
the formula and paste it here and make a
minor change that is instead of column
number five you want column number four
which has the route data right so column
number four has the route data enter and
there you go now out of the drop down
when you select source as any U location
here let's select Mumbai and the
destination as Bangalore and Airline as
let's fly in air India here and you have
the price details and the rout so these
particular ones you can you know hide
because the data is coming over here so
you can copy paste it to this
place and let's hide these
things and you can also hide this one as
well
there you go now the data is visually a
little more appealing and you can kind
of have a complete you know dashboard
where you have uh the data of V lookup
results right so whenever you select any
source and give any
destination from the dropdown and choose
any of the flights you want to fly with
and you will have the data over here
right the size of the flight and the
root of the flight and that's how you
use we lookup in Excel so let's get
started with horizontal lookup or H
lookup in Excel so here we might want to
switch to the Practical mode that is
starting our Microsoft Excel now we are
on the sheet of Microsoft Excel and here
you can see some data on my
sheet that is employee name employee ID
and salary so here we are going to
perform our horizontal lookup but before
that let me show you that this this
particular drop- down menu so this
particular drop down menu has all the
names of the employees in this
particular table and we have created
this using data validation in Excel if
you want to create the drop- down menus
just like this then feel free to check
out our data validation in Excel
tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement H lookup in Excel so here we
have employee name but we want to find
out the employee ID so for that let's
create the H lookup now for that equals
to H
lookup now the first one is a lookup
value so this one is the cell which is
the employee name now after that the
table array we have to select all the
table arrays
here
now the row index number so the employee
ID is in row index number two according
to the table so for that provide two and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you must might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false and close the bracket press enter
and there you go and if you select Jack
then you'll find the employee ID of Jack
and if you select Jerry you'll find the
employee ID of cherry reflecting here
now similarly let's find out the salary
of all the employees using H lookup so
equals H
lookup and lookup value that happens to
be the name name of the employee now the
table
array and next we have uh row index
number that is salary happens to be the
third R in the table so three
and exact match close the bracket and
enter so now if you change the values in
this particular drop down menu you'll
find the employee ID and their
particular salary so Jack happens to be
carrying the employee ID as 10001 and
his salary is 10,000 so similarly let's
try try to find out Peter's employee ID
and salary so there you go 105 and
50,000 that's salary so that's how you
use H lookup in
Excel so this is our data set for the
xlup on Excel you can download this data
set from the description box below so
here let's start with X lookup so here I
will like equals to
X
lookup braet so first we have have to
write this this is the form for the X
lookup X lookup value X lookup lookup
array return array and these three are
the optionals okay if not found match
model and the search mode these three
are the optional so the lookup value for
me is the this stock number okay because
only only the stock number are the
common on the both you know sheets you
can say so B2 comma so now we have to
see the lookup array so so look up array
will be over this I will press the shift
down arrow okay then
enter
okay so here the next thing is return
array so what we want to return return
in this particular column okay that will
be the price I want to print the
price
yes ENT so before that what I will do I
will add you can add the dollar sign
using F4 I'm here adding
manually okay then dollar J dollar 12
why we are adding the dollar sign for
the
range
okay then press enter yeah so when I
will drag from here to here all the
price value will
become okay
why NA because this stock number is not
present in the particular this
sheet okay so this is how you can get
the price
but if you want if you want particular
like the size brand and price all three
what you can do you can simply drag here
okay and you can add the dollar
here and or using you can add the dollar
using F4
um adding the manually
pres okay so as you can see we have this
size we have the brand name and we have
the price what I will do I will drag
down okay so this is how you can you
know fast the particular value using
xlup from the different different
sheets this is how you can select the
particular
range what is if you don't
want all the three columns but you want
the size and the price and you don't
want the
brand for that what you will do you will
here
write
choose then
bracket here you can will start with the
curly
brackets here you will write the how
many columns do you need 1 2 3 4 5 6
okay so here I will write the I need the
two
columns okay then what will be your
first column uh I want My First Column
should be the
price so here I will
select I will select the
price as my first
column
okay okay my
bad I
want my first
column
here I will add the dollar sign you can
use the
F4 and I want my second column should be
the
size okay here I will add the dollar
sign why we are adding dollar sign for
the particular range for the full range
of the size
okay so here I will
enter so I will drag
down okay this
is so as you can see here in the First
Column we have the price and the second
column we have the particular
size okay so this is how you can select
the particular cell for the X
lookup okay not Direct and dropping what
you want to this and this size okay how
this is you can select so now as you can
see we are getting this na value here
okay for that what you can do double
click here
so
here I will give here
comma so here as you can see if not
found okay for that what I can give the
double reses and hit the ENT
enter and I will drag
down so as you can see the blank space
because we haven't wrote here something
okay so here I will write the
no
match
enter okay I will write here no
match
enter then I will drag it down then as
you can see here we have the custom
value now no match so this is how you
can fill the plank space or the not
matching values from your custom
values so this is how you can use the X
lookup but here we are using in a
particular single sheet you can add the
multiple sheet and you can same way you
can use the xlup as we did in the this
sheet and with that we have reached to
