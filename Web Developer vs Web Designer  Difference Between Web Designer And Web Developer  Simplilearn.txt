let's get started with the session by
taking a quick look at the agendas first
we start by giving a small introduction
to the role of web development and web
designing when it comes to website
management we then take a deep dive into
the varied role and responsibility of
web developers and web designers finally
we take a look at the popularity and
Trends regarding these position on the
Open Market along with the salaries one
can expect as a beginner in these
domains let's learn about web
development from a beginner's
perspective web development is a process
of creating Dynamic and interactive
websites letter accessed via the
Internet it involves a wide range of
skills such as programming design and
content creation all of which work
together to create a website that meets
the needs of its user it is a
multi-stage process is starting from the
planning design and development all the
way to its testing and deployment but
that's completely different from web
designing though web designing refers to
creating and designing websites that are
visually appealing user-friendly and
effective in achieving the indeed goal
it involves various aspects such as
layout design color scheme typography
graphics and user interface design a
good web designer consider the target
audience their preference and the
purpose of the websites to create a
design that is both aesthetically
pleasing and functional the design
should also be optimized for various
devices such as screen size and search
engine to improve visibility and
accessibility now that we have a good
understanding on what web development is
and how it differs from web designing
now let's take a look at who exactly are
web Developers
so web developers are professional who
specialize in creating and maintaining
websites they are responsible for coding
designing testing and updating websites
to ensure they function correctly and
meets the user's need now developers
work with the various programming
languages such as HTML CSS JavaScript
and PHP to build websites they may also
create Dynamic and interactive websites
with databases and may work on a
website's front-end
back in and full stick
now what do these terms mean front end
back in and full stack so the front-end
developers focuses on the design and
user interface of a website in contrast
back-end developer works on the website
server side and deal with the data and
server-side scripting
full set developer have expertise in
both front-end and back-end development
web developers may work independently or
as a part of a team and specialize in a
particular area of web development such
as e-commerce or mobile website
development now let's understand who
exactly are web designers web designers
are professionals who are responsible
for Designing and creating the visual
aspects of websites they work with
various elements such as layout color
scheme typography and image to create
visually appealing and functional web
designers must have a strong
understanding of design principles user
experience and web development
technology the role of web designers is
crucial in today's digital age as
websites are often the first point of
contact between a businesses and its
customer there are several different
types of web designers each with their
own specialized skill and focus area and
the first one is user experience user
interface and visual design so the first
one is
user experience user experience focus on
designing the overall user experience of
a website they research and analyze
users Behavior to create a website that
is easy to navigate and meets the needs
of its user and the second one is user
interface they focus on designer or
designing the visual elements that user
interact with on a website such as
button menus and other interfaces
element they are responsible for
creating interfaces that are visually
appealing and easy to use after that we
have visual designer which is also a
type of web designer who specialize in
creating the visual elements of a
website they are responsible for
Designing the overall look and feel the
website including layout color scheme
and typography to use their artistic
skills to create a visually appealing
and cohesive design so I inspired of a
lot of overlapping their job roles the
projects taken up by the web designers
and web developers are quite different
so let's discuss about developer versus
web designer
web developer and web designer web
developer focus on the technical aspects
of building our website where web
designer focus on the visual and user
experience aspects of a website web
developers use programming languages
such as HTML CSS JavaScript and PHP to
create and manage websites functionality
where web designer use design tools like
Adobe Photoshop a sketch to create more
cups and prototypes web developers build
and maintain the websites back in
database and server-side scripting where
web designers determine the site's
layout color scheme typography and
overall look and feel of the website web
developer have often background in
computer science software engineering or
a related field where web designers
often have a background in graphic
design art or a related Field Web
developer may work with the web
designers to bring their design to life
and ensure its function properly where
web developer may work with clients to
understand their design needs and
preference and where developers aim to
create websites that is fast efficient
and secure where the web designers aim
to create a visually appealing and
engaging user interface overall web
developer and web designers bring
different skill sets but both are
essential and creating successful
website their popularity and Trends but
