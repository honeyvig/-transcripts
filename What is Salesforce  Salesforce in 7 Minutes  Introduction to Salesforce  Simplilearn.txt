meet Sam
had a meat distribution business where
he supplied fresh meat to stores
Countrywide via his website
things were going as per schedule when
one of his clients complained about a
faulty delivery unable to cope with the
workload of multiple clients and
maintain a streamlined workflow for an
end-to-end process Sam lost this
particular customer owing to bad
resource management
had there been a way to store and manage
customer data automatically the chances
of human error would be negligible
this is where one of Sam's developers
came up with the idea of implementing
Salesforce within the organization

to know first what Salesforce is

management platform also known as CRM
used to manage customer data from the
initial sales pitch to product delivery
before CRM platforms were the norm

took care of data opening room for human
error and unfortunate mistakes like the
one Sam faced most CRM platforms can be
set up over the Internet allowing easy
access to data from any location

platform available on the market today
