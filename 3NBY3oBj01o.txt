1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,040
solo there and welcome to another

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,959
tutorial my name is Senator vaccine this

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,910
time we're gonna be going over parsed

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,820
push notifications in iOS 9 using Swift

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,389
too now I haven't really found many

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,420
resources on this online and I've mostly

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,690
only found a resources for partial push

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,310
notifications for Swift 1 and iOS 7 and

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,609
8 which is not very convenient

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,199
considering the fact that all these

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,710
videos are also really really long and

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,960
they're very hard to understand in fact

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,730
this took me quite a while to make and

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,890
so since this took me quite a while to

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,440
make I'm creating a video on it now I

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,460
wasn't orig

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,960
I didn't come up with the idea for this

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,989
app it was actually sent to me by one of

19
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,480
my subscribers so his name is Ali echoey

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,469
and I want to show a picture of him now

21
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:55,500
this is ali Ocoee he's asked me to make

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,050
a video of how you can actually use

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,750
parse to display push notifications on

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,809
iOS and other platforms I'm only

25
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,820
covering iOS in this video but I may

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,860
cover other operating systems as well in

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,500
the future anyway let's get to the

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,479
actual video so we can explain the

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,790
question so now that you've seen Ali's

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,490
question let's actually get to the video

31
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,470
now essentially what I'm going to do in

32
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,540
this app we're going to have two

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,590
separate I devices these AI devices will

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,080
be able to send push notifications to

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,140
each other but wait a minute they don't

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,670
send them to each other they're going to

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,759
send them to all iOS devices connected

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,630
to this app however in the next part I'm

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,310
going to be showing you how you can send

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,490
to specific people so now let me just

41
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,020
really quickly explain how the push

42
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,790
notifications will work then we'll get

43
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,170
to the coding part okay so let me just

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,810
open up here so let's say we have a few

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,649
clients like iPhone number one

46
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:10,470
okay so this is iPhone number one then

47
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,459
we also have number two who has a bit

48
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:21,090
bigger iPhone I guess and this is number

49
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:29,700
two okay now let's say over here we have

50
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,069
the parse database which I guess I'll

51
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,980
just draw like this and this is the

52
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:46,560
parse database now my instance of this

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,940
let's just say it's this this is my

54
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:58,470
instance of parse okay

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,470
now this has a little section for push

56
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,500
notifications

57
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,290
so essentially what we're doing is these

58
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,349
two AI devices in their app delegate

59
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,810
we're setting them to keep on looking

60
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,500
for push notifications over here but

61
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,819
wait just a minute this can't be too

62
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:29,359
simple

63
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,700
there's also Apple coming in the way

64
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,500
here what we're just going to do apples

65
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,909
just going to act as like a little

66
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,680
bridge in between us well it's going to

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,739
happen is let's say I create a new push

68
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,409
notification over here with text like

69
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:57,280
let's say you push notification hello

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:07,400
use my app okay so now it's going to

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
happen this push notification will make

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,799
its way over to Apple Apple will make

73
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,630
its way over to these two devices and

74
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,169
that on here will either see a little

75
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:29,060
notification here or if you're on the

76
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,780
lockscreen

77
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,780
it'll open up say the time and stuff and

78
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,190
then show the notification on the

79
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,300
lockscreen so that is really simple

80
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,860
actually even though it seems very

81
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,860
complicated and so what we're going to

82
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,479
be doing first in this video we're going

83
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,419
to be handling the Apple part which is

84
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,699
the most complicated part out of all of

85
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,090
this

86
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,330
then we'll handle the actual coding of

87
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,039
the app this is the second part this is

88
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,560
the first part and then we'll actually

89
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,610
handle the parse database which will be

90
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,570
our third part

91
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,460
so let's get to the Mack part now and so

92
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,240
we can code this up so let's get to it

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,860
so welcome back to the Mac part and now

94
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,950
I'm going to be showing you the actual

95
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,400
implementation of this in Swift so to

96
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,990
get started we're going to do a bit of

97
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,450
preparation so first of all what we're

98
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,730
going to do is I'm just going to make my

99
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,650
face smaller can't have a youtube video

100
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,320
without one of those drills then I'm

101
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,730
going to come over here into Xcode and

102
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,230
I've I have a little template actually

103
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,880
for this app which you're going to have

104
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,940
to just open up in your own version of

105
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,770
Xcode and a link to it will be in the

106
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,290
description along with source code and

107
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,090
so what you're going to do inside of

108
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,790
this little template is you're going to

109
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,520
see first of all this is very very

110
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,660
crucial you have to change bundle ID

111
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,500
enter from comm dot fill got me up to

112
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,440
comm dot so whatever your usual bundle

113
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,730
identifier would be for this sort of

114
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,110
thing for me it would be TBS s dot parse

115
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,240
tester something like that make sure you

116
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,010
choose your correct team and then yeah

117
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,340
you have to go into capabilities make

118
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,190
sure push notifications is on and if you

119
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,020
see this little error here click on the

120
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,830
fix issue button and then in a second it

121
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,710
should give you a check mark perfect

122
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,390
you have successfully set up the

123
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,720
template next what you're going to do is

124
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,250
you're going to go into your Apple

125
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,200
developers member Center and they're

126
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,300
going to sign in to your developer page

127
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,000
and go into your certificates

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,470
identifiers and profiles page open up

129
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,510
identifiers and then just our actually

130
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,050
I'm going to search for parse and as you

131
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,750
can see I see parse tester I'm going to

132
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,050
click on it and click on the edit button

133
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,580
we're going to scroll down until we see

134
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,260
push notifications

135
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,300
and where it says development SSL

136
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,860
certificate click on create certificate

137
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,060
now all you need to do is open up

138
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,980
keychain access then we're going to

139
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,780
click on this keychain access button

140
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,740
over here certificate assistant and then

141
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,660
request a certificate from a certificate

142
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,410
authority then it already feels

143
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,060
everything in form but I believe you're

144
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,380
going to have to fill in stuff for

145
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,570
yourself so your user email just can be

146
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,240
anything really your name then the CA

147
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,700
email address make sure that is blank

148
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,700
and then click on the you're saved to

149
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,340
disk option and do not check this box

150
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,500
continue and then it'll ask you where to

151
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,960
store it so I'm just going to call it

152
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:22,040
I'd say just a second push certificate

153
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,330
request okay

154
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,950
then I'm going to just save this to my

155
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,330
desktop because we're going to delete

156
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,810
this anyway and click on the Save button

157
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,980
you don't need to show in finder so you

158
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,630
can just click on the done button come

159
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,830
over here and click on the continue

160
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,030
button then click on choose file and

161
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,260
choose the file that you've just created

162
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,150
ok perfect click on the generate button

163
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,150
and then you don't need to download this

164
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,620
certificate just yet or actually

165
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,950
nevermind yes you do ok once you've

166
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,110
downloaded the certificate just click on

167
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,140
the done button and now you're done on

168
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,510
your Apple Developer page now click on

169
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,340
the certificate you just downloaded and

170
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,830
it should open it up into peach ain't

171
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,020
access make sure you click on the button

172
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,690
my certificates if you do not do this it

173
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,700
usually will not work unless you select

174
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,460
the correct entry so click on my

175
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,030
certificates then search for the one

176
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,410
where it says your app ID which is this

177
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,500
one parse tester for iOS push services

178
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,810
and make sure it hasn't expired or

179
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,970
anything I just created mine so it of

180
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,520
course won't expire just yet but just in

181
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,020
case you're using an older one make sure

182
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,700
it isn't expired or else it's no use

183
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,440
okay then right-click on it and click

184
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,950
export then make sure you're using the

185
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,470
person personal information exchange

186
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,040
file format and if you aren't if you

187
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,570
don't have this option if it's grayed

188
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,120
out like these two then you're probably

189
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,070
using it from all items you're using a

190
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,260
different version of the certificate so

191
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,180
just make sure you use the one in my

192
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,329
certificates so then I'm going to just

193
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:07,399
name this something like parse push

194
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,050
tester

195
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,899
yeah that's it click on the Save button

196
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,579
now do not give this a password so just

197
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,649
click OK then type in your computer's

198
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,029
admin password and click on always allow

199
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,880
or just allow okay now you're done

200
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,459
keychain access now you have to do stuff

201
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,329
in parse go over to parse and click on

202
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,470
go to your apps after signing in create

203
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,140
a new app and I'm just going to call

204
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,250
this parse tester click on the create

205
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,459
button and then click on push and then

206
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:52,290
go to settings then click on push again

207
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,620
but this time from over here then what

208
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,209
you want to do now listen to this very

209
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,579
carefully you're going to have to enable

210
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,950
client push this will allow your I

211
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:07,350
devices to push to parse then over here

212
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,770
where it says Apple Post certificates

213
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,420
wherever it says certificate file dot

214
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,760
p12 click on select your certificate and

215
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,170
open up your certificate file ok perfect

216
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,480
now it has uploaded this certificate on

217
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,140
to parts now that you're done this step

218
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,089
you just want to go into Doc's and click

219
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,769
on launch the QuickStart then yeah

220
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:39,540
there's a little thing I found in the

221
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,790
parse website it resets the app over

222
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,910
here so make sure you click on the app

223
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:49,440
scroll down until you find the app that

224
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,730
you were just working on yet the poster

225
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,620
example

226
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,899
okay then click on push or actually just

227
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,040
give me a second

228
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,050
you won't need to do this I'm just

229
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:10,529
checking yeah for myself so I know yeah

230
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:16,680
so if I just go over to my apps yeah I

231
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,180
selected the wrong one I'm supposed to

232
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,589
click on parse tester okay so if I click

233
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:24,389
on parse tester which is my real app

234
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:26,759
then currently working on and then I go

235
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,220
over to iOS because I'm using iOS you

236
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,509
can really just skip through these just

237
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:33,630
randomly select something and then all I

238
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,459
really need are these application keys

239
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:41,130
so double-click your application ID go

240
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,290
over to your app delegate and paste it

241
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,829
in for a by D select your client key and

242
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:51,180
paste that in for your client ID perfect

243
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,209
now what we're going to do is actually

244
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,529
you know what

245
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,940
currently our push message is this push

246
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,399
notification was sent that's AB or I

247
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,589
will spice it up a bit because you know

248
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:06,480
what we're learning is programming so

249
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,149
let's just do this hello iOS programming

250
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,970
ok so now I'm going to run this app on

251
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,930
both on both of my iPhone so first of

252
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:25,709
all this one then this one so put it on

253
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:34,500
to both okay now right as they start up

254
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,980
I'm just going to show you over here as

255
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,540
you can see now they are both asking me

256
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,300
if they'd like to send me notifications

257
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,699
and so I'm just going to click OK so

258
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,180
that they can send me notifications and

259
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,639
as you can see they work perfectly now

260
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,199
how do I send push notifications to

261
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,449
these well it's quite simple really

262
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:04,670
let's just take our Google Chrome window

263
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,180
make it really small actually a little

264
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,450
small that's in small bring it over to

265
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,310
our view with the iPhones a bit smaller

266
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,920
so it fits in between them then what I'm

267
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:29,990
going to do is if I come over to so not

268
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,730
right now we're in the parse page now

269
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,070
I'm going to click on push see this

270
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,839
little here push then we're going to

271
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,760
scroll over here and click on send a

272
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,220
push now actually I'm just going to make

273
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,529
this big again so you can see what we're

274
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,760
doing and since there are no oh yeah so

275
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,649
forgot the main rule that I've been

276
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:57,950
teaching you this app gets reset select

277
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,040
parse tester again and now what we can

278
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,690
do click on send a push I'm just going

279
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,630
to choose every one so that it sends to

280
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,199
all my devices I'm going to go down down

281
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,779
down and over here where it says what

282
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:20,120
message let's just say this is from

283
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:27,079
parse hello iOS programming so that we

284
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,329
can distinguish between the message sent

285
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,000
by our iOS device and the one sent from

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,220
the parse dashboard okay let's continue

287
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,760
so let's send this now immediately if I

288
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,680
come over here both my iPhone just

289
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,250
vibrated on my table and it shows us big

290
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,320
notification over here parse push this

291
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,279
is from parse hollow iOS programming ok

292
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,890
sure that works but there's nothing

293
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,360
really too big in that I could show a

294
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,769
message from a database whenever I

295
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:59,570
wanted to I just need to use the code

296
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,120
that I use in Swift databases well let's

297
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,390
see what happens if I click ok and let's

298
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,649
see what happens when I exit the app

299
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,350
once I actually exit the app and then I

300
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,670
send a push notification guess what I

301
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,420
think you've already guessed

302
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,370
but if I go down here choose something

303
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,310
like hello

304
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,139
iOS programming from the NC I you can

305
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,829
guess what NC means and so if I send

306
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:35,970
this now that standard stood for

307
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,800
Notification Center because as you can

308
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,899
see it has actually put these on to

309
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,389
Notification Center and it has showed me

310
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,070
the actual notification using push so

311
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,899
now if I go into the Notification Center

312
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,300
it shows me the notification over here

313
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,940
and here so if I click on it it actually

314
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:03,360
brings me into the app and that works ok

315
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,929
so now what happens if I click on the

316
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:11,990
send text button on one of my iPhones

317
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,640
well then it does exactly what you would

318
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,010
expect it actually sends the text that

319
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,929
we put in to our code now let's see what

320
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:23,069
happens when I do that on my other

321
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,360
iPhone as you can see it pushes on to

322
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,570
both now let's close the app on one and

323
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:38,490
send it as you can see it pushes now

324
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,500
let's close the app on this one and open

325
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,580
it up on this and as you can G see just

326
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,110
to prove to you one last time

327
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,100
it pushes okay so that was actually

328
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,980
quite simple for the demo of this app

329
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,799
now let's get into the actual code and

330
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,130
how that works okay so now let's get

331
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,799
over to the actual code part of this so

332
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:05,059
I'm just going to move myself over here

333
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:10,080
over these and stop the apps okay

334
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,870
so now let's start from the app delegate

335
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,330
which is the simplest part again I just

336
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,970
took these parsed our project and I made

337
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,390
it much better so that you can use this

338
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,280
with ease because the power starter

339
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,330
project still wasn't good enough it had

340
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,850
lots of extra code I just clean that all

341
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,400
out for you added some more stuff in

342
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,530
okay so interact delegates did finish

343
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,080
launching with options function we are

344
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,700
just setting the application ID and the

345
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,470
client key to well the application

346
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,430
client ID you get from parse we are

347
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,790
setting the UI user notification type to

348
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:54,940
alert badge and sound that means that in

349
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,800
the notification settings if you are to

350
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,940
your Settings app and click on

351
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,400
notifications these are the three things

352
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,190
that we are going to use for the you

353
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,450
know notification types then settings is

354
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,700
just going to be really simply what

355
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,500
types can we use and what categories

356
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,510
categories can be nil meaning default

357
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,880
but the types will be the types that we

358
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,900
just created then what we do is

359
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,030
application which is a Cy application

360
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,020
that we're getting in this function

361
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,820
we're just going to register user

362
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,010
notification settings and then those

363
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,360
settings that we gave it so it were

364
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,820
registering those notification settings

365
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,370
so we can actually give notifications

366
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,260
and then it shows up that little pop up

367
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,560
this so-and-so app would like to show

368
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,060
you notifications and so these are

369
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,370
clicks okay or no and then we have

370
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,920
permission to show notifications then

371
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,420
next we're doing application dot

372
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,850
register for remote notifications this

373
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,170
means that we can receive notifications

374
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,270
from a remote source like the parse

375
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,500
database then we're just returning true

376
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,180
then this function is not required at

377
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,650
the moment so I can just remove it

378
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,150
however day to register for remote

379
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,550
notifications with device token again

380
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,810
that's just a default function that

381
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,520
parse requires I'm not going to go into

382
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,570
it and so is dead fail to register for

383
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,120
remote notifications with error again

384
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,430
that comes inside of the templates and I

385
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,750
wouldn't really recommend touching them

386
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,890
you don't need to then in application

387
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,440
did receive remote notification again

388
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,870
this is just par stuff where we're

389
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,750
handling the push and if the application

390
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,830
is inactive we are calling the track app

391
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,570
open through the remote notification

392
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,220
payload which is just something to do

393
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,750
with personal attacks you don't need to

394
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,590
get into that

395
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,150
anyway now let's get back to our

396
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,460
viewcontroller in our viewcontroller

397
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,460
right as we open up the view like just

398
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,800
as we're loading our view we are

399
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,810
immediately connecting to a channel

400
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,370
which I like to call

401
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,010
well test channel let's just say test

402
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,850
name but basically what this is is you

403
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,960
know there are multiple different

404
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,260
channels of post notifications that you

405
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,750
can have on parts like for example let's

406
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,250
say we have different Facebook users

407
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,150
different Facebook users would have

408
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,010
their own channels the channels would be

409
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,070
named their own name and let's say

410
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,290
someone else post something to their

411
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,630
timeline that will be sent to that

412
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,610
person's channel and then it'll show a

413
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,700
push notification on their channel only

414
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,680
or on their devices only or else just

415
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,960
imagine this you would be getting

416
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,940
notifications on Facebook for pretty

417
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,270
much everybody else that's using

418
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,220
Facebook which wouldn't make sense so

419
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,700
that's why we use channels so basically

420
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,150
these three lines of code are just

421
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,510
connecting us to test Channel and also

422
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,670
one last thing I'd recommend just in

423
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,460
case their Wi-Fi is a bit slow freeze

424
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,770
the app until it saves the channel or

425
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,790
else there will be glitches then once

426
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,040
the view does appear however we are

427
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,740
checking is the height of our frame

428
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:21,320
greater than or equal to 736 if no

429
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,800
perform a segue to 6 that's the actual

430
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,140
identifier so what this will do is if

431
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,660
we're running an iPhone 6s plus or an

432
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,030
iPhone 6 plus or something of that size

433
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,680
then great good job stay or else what's

434
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,030
going to happen is we're going to make a

435
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,220
segue towards a different view that'll

436
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,510
work on 6 and 6s and also we're checking

437
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,070
if the views tag is 0 this is so that

438
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,710
once we open the second view for the

439
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,980
iPhone 6 that's going to call this

440
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,720
function as well and then we

441
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,970
want to go into an endless loop a loop

442
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,910
of just calling just going to its own

443
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,280
view over and over again so we don't do

444
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,450
that next what we have is the IP action

445
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,450
function for sending messages here we

446
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,460
are forcibly trying because I know this

447
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,350
won't give an exception in my case you

448
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,810
can put in the full do catch statement

449
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,620
but I don't need to at this point and so

450
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,270
what we're trying to do or at least

451
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,760
forcing Swift to do is we're going to

452
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,700
take a PF push I don't know what the

453
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,240
stands for a parse push basically dot

454
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,860
send person push message to channel then

455
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,870
the channel name and then the message

456
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,200
that we want to send so the channel in

457
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,300
this case is test channel and the

458
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,870
message as well as you know hello

459
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,620
iOS programming and that is all the code

460
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,060
I'm just going to show you the UI really

461
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,710
quickly really simple nothing you

462
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,520
haven't seen before this is the this is

463
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,270
the six view this is the two six segue

464
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,070
this is the view and then these are the

465
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,770
two buttons these are the same class so

466
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,240
these are the exact same view just

467
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,800
different sizes so this is also a few

468
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,670
controller this is also view controller

469
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,310
and that was it for this video if you

470
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,040
have any questions concerns or comments

471
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,140
really leave them in the comments you

472
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,910
can also email me at Taji mani at

473
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,850
gmail.com if you'd like to with any more

474
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,830
questions concerns you can also email me

475
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,800
a video question if you'd like to that

476
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,920
has that where you talk just a second

477
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:48,180
yeah oh yes quickly before I go I would

478
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,480
say in part 2 I'm going to tell you how

479
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,730
you can target specific devices anyway

480
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,350
continuing you can also send me a video

481
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,830
question of you saying a question and I

482
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,820
might just feature it in one of my next

483
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,860
videos you can also subscribe to my

484
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,510
channel if you'd like to contact me on

489
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,590
video good
