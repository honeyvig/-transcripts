hi there I'm Jeff Fritz a senior program
manager on the new getet team in this
video I'm going to talk about net
package Management in
2015 today we're going to talk about why
we need package management what's in it
for me and how does it simplify working
with my code in Visual Studio we've seen
many advances in how developers work
with their libraries their colleagues
and the technical community to simplify
the interactions with these tools and
organizations we've updated the new get
package manager to handle these new
requirements I'll show you how to add a
package update the package and then
remove that package from a sample
project let's get started with the
why why is package management important
well package management with net allows
us to deliver a bundle of files that
contain libraries for various versions
of The NET Framework and configuration
information as well as any static
resources that are needed to support
that bundle the new get package manager
simplifies placement of those resources
on disk adding appropriate references to
your project and updating the package
where
appropriate additionally packages can
take dependencies on other packages for
example I could install a package that
allows me to send messages to an Azure
queue using the Azure storage package
and that package has the dependency on
the Microsoft o dat package nuget will
automatically gather those dependencies
and add them them to my project for
me packages can support multiple
Frameworks including the Net Framework
mono and the new net core framework this
is important for package authors because
they want to be able to provide
functionality targeted to different
devices or different operating systems
appropriately in our Azure storage
example that package will use the
network differently if it is
communicating from a Net Framework
application an asp.net core application
or a Windows phone application let's
take a look at Visual Studio 2015 and
see how we can start working with
packages in an asp.net 5
application here I am inside of an brand
new asp.net 5
application and for this demo I want to
add that Azure storage package to my
project I can enter the new get package
dialogue by right-clicking on my project
and choosing manage new get package
packages from here I have several
options to work with this dialogue I can
see my list of available packages on the
left initially and then the
appropriately selected packages details
on the
right across the top I can change the
filter of the packages that I'm looking
at I can also choose to look at
pre-release versions of packages but in
this case I want to search for that
Azure storage package
there it
is I can select the action that I want
to take place and then I have a version
here that I can choose from any of the
versions of the package that are
available in the new get
repository I'm feeling a little
conservative here so I'm going to choose
version
4.0.0 let's show the preview window so
that I can understand what changes nuget
is going to make to my project
I'll click
install I'm presented with those changes
that Nugget's going to make I'll
accept and now I'm presented with the
licenses that I need to
accept
yes and now you can see on the bottom in
the output window we've successfully
installed the package
great but maybe a couple months go by
and I'd like to upgrade that package and
in the latest stable version in this
case in my combo box I can see that the
latest stable version is
4.3.0 I don't want to see the preview
window this time I'm already familiar
with the changes it's going to make and
I can click
upgrade I'll accept the
license and my package is
updated we can see those results in the
output window down here
well now if a few months go by and the
requirements to my project
change I can come through and uninstall
that package by just clicking the
uninstall
button and very quickly the package has
been removed from my
project finally I have some resources
online for you if you'd like to learn
more about nuget and package management
with Visual Studio the nouet gallery is
available online at
www.net.org we'll share news about
upcoming features information about
packages we find interesting and updates
for our existing tools on our blog you
can find that at blog. nuget.org are you
interested in checking out the nuget
source code or maybe you have some
feedback you want to share with the team
you can visit our source code repository
online at github.com slne slome we'll be
happy to answer your questions on GitHub
issues thanks for watching
