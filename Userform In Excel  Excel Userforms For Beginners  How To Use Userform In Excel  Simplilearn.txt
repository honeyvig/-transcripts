hey everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel in this session we will
learn about user form in Excel but
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
Technologies if you're a tech gig in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
Trends then consider getting subscribed

to hit that Bell icon to never miss
another update from Simply learn now
without further Ado let's get started
with our onepoint agenda that is user
form in
Excel so what exactly is a user form so
user form is a graphical user interface
that helps you have an live interaction
with your worksheet which enables you to
enter or eliminate data from your Excel
worksheet through the graphical user
interface now let's get into the
Practical mode and start the Excel work
book now we have launched our Microsoft
Excel so let us create a blank workbook
for now now we have the blank workbook
or worksheet now before we get started
with the user forms in Excel the
fundamental step is to enable the
developer menu on the toolbar here you
can find the developer menu so basically
it will not be enabled as default to
enable that you need to get into file
menu and inside the file menu you can
see the the last menu that is the
options menu select that and you will
have a dialog box on your screen and
inside that you need to go into the
customize ribbon option and inside the
customize ribbon option you have the
main tabs scroll through the main tabs
and here you can find an option called
developer by default it will not be
enabled it will look something like this
but to enable that you need to select
the check option in this and click click
on that and select okay now the
developer option will be enabled on your
tool menu so now you have your developer
option on your toolbar so to get started
with user forms in Excel click on the
developer option and here you can see
Visual Basic so click on that Visual
Basic and now you have your new window
opened right on your
screen so this is the visual basics for
applications
so here is where you create your user
forms Now to create a user form just
select on insert menu and you have the
option called user
form now a new user form will be created
for
you and that is user form
one so this is the user form which you
can design and enable to to interact
with your worksheet and help you insert
data or eliminate data for now let's try
to create a simple user form for
employees now here you can see the
controls option where you can find the
various options to provide an object
into your user form so it might be a
label it might be a text box it might be
a multi-page it might be a command
button it might be a frame or a toggle
switch many more for now let's make it
simple let's create a label
so this is our first label we have just
dragged and dropped it and let us name
it
as okay so let us select it and rename
it as employee
ID now let's insert another
label drag and drop as simple as it
looks
select
that and rename it as
employee
name now another one you can also copy
that and paste
it and this should be our employee phone
number now we have a three labels on the
screen let's try to insert the text
box now this is our first text
box for employee
ID now let's copy and paste it so
another text box for employee name copy
and paste again and the last text box
for employee phone now let us try to
insert the
button so the First Command button let
us rename it as
insert now let us relocate it to a
little bit left now let us try to insert
another
button and here it is the second button
would
be refresh
sheet uh the refresh button will play
the role of uh clearing the text boxes
in case if there is some data already
entered if you want to clear that you
can just press on refresh and it will be
cleared now we have our user form so let
us try to rename our user form so here
you can see that we have the properties
Tab and inside the properties tab you
can always rename it and to rename it
let us go into caption
and rename it as
employee
data and that's done so our basic user
form is ready now let's get back to
Excel sheet so remember that we have
created three labels employee ID
employee name and employee form we need
to create the exact same columns here so
employ
ID let us expand the column a little bit
now em l o y e
e name let us also increase the width
and finally we have employee
phone there you
go yeah we have our three
columns let us select all the three
columns and uh
a line to
middle you can also format your
cells let us select the green color and
text as
white and let us
bold
yeah pretty
good there you go so we have created our
sheet and it's ready now now the last
part part remaining is we need to code
this particular user form so coding in
the sense we have two buttons over here
right so those buttons should be
performing some kind of operation so for
insert button the operation should be
inserting the data which we have entered
into these text boxes so to program it
just double click on the insert button
and here eliminate everything and paste
this code so basically what we did is we
had this particular code segment so this
is the starting part of the code segment
and this is the ending part of the code
segment so we are writing our code in
between these two lines so what did we
write here so end of the row is sheets
of sheet name so this is the sheet name
right here we have our sheet name as
sheet one so that is the sheet name
where we want to perform the operations
and range from a to rows count and XL up
row that is we counting the number of
rows here that particular statement will
count the rows till the end of the sheet
automatically and after that it will
shift to textbox value that is once the
row number is counted that is from 1 to
n it will start entering data from the
first available row that is a column a
column then once the a column is
finished it will enter into B column and
subsequently into C and once the text
boxes are entered the data that is let's
come back to here so once we have
entered all the text that is the
employee ID name and phone after
selecting the insert button
automatically these three text boxes
should go blank again you cannot have
the same data again in your text
box so that is why we have included text
Tex box value one null textbox value two
null textbox value three null so that
was for command operation
insert now we should program the command
operation for refresh double click on
that and you have the code option over
here so this particular code will be
automatically loaded from The Click
button one now for click button two you
need to add some more data that is
refreshing so whenever you press the
refresh button the text should go blank
for that we'll use the same code from
the previous click button or the command
button paste it over here and they
should perform the clearing operation
and it's done now close this so select
the employee data user form and here you
can see the Run option so select that
run option and the sheet has the user
form here now let us enter the employee
ID as 1 2 3 4 5 and employee name as
JN okay caps Lo is on J H and John
employee phone as some
1800
231 and select the insert option and the
data got inserted now let us try to
insert another data 1 2 3 4
6 employee name Wick
and employee phone number 1
18345 Yeah by now you might have guessed
I'm a fan of John Wick yes and yeah
there you go we have entered the second
data over here now let me show you
another trick where you can place all
this user form as a macro and replace
this by just one single button so
whenever you press that button this data
form or user form will pop up and you
can directly start entering data
so for that let's get back to the Visual
Basic and stop this particular execution
and you got your user form back now you
need to insert a model get into insert
option and select the module or model
yeah it is module not model so inside
this module you need to write the
command for
macro so here it
is so what we basically doing is a m p l
y e e data. show or we can use an
underscore and get back to user form and
rename this
as
dat cool so what we are doing is
entering the subject as enter employ
details this will be the macro name and
when this macro is called the employe
data user form should be shown and once
it is shown the code should be ended
that is end subject now we have designed
our
module now let's get back to the
sheet and here go to the developer
option go to the insert menu and select
button and draw the button
somewhere and now you can select the
enter employee details macro and press
okay and now you have a button here
now you can edit
this edit it as press to
enter enter employee
details and there you go done so now
whenever you press this particular
button the user form will activate
Okay and you need to play
this okay the error was related to the
employe data sheet name we had to rename
the employee data from user form to
employee data initially it was just user
form we have renamed that to employee
data and now the code is fine so let's
get back to the sheet now if you press
this button the user form will
automatically start now let us try to
enter the data again 1 2 3 4 5 7 this
time and
uh some
name let's enter as
Jennifer and her phone number would be 1
18345 098 some random number and select
insert and the data has been inserted
here so this is how you work on
userforms in Excel now with that we have
come to an end of this session on
userforms in Excel if you have any
