did you know that nowadays we can create
programs which perform tasks similar to
what humans can do a field of artificial
intelligence called deep learning allows
us to use algorithms called neural
networks which are structured after the
human brain these algorithms allow us to
create programs which do things that
humans can
like seeing in the form of computer
vision hearing and speaking with natural
language processing driving cars in the
form of self-driving cars and a lot of
other things with hundreds of thousands
of jobs available for deep learning
experts worldwide this is a field which
is here to change our world so what
better than starting a career in deep
