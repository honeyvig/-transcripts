without further delay over to our
training experts hello everyone so
without further delay let's get started
with lean Six Sigma roadmap for 2020 Pro
we will start up by understanding what
is Sigma and why do we need it lean Six
Sigma is a methodology and a set of
tools used by organizations to improve
processes increase efficiency reduced
effects and enhance overall quality it
combines two powerful approaches lean
and Six Sigma H with its own focus and
principles let's break it down in a
simple and detailed manner first one
lean lean focuses on eliminating waste
and optimizing the processes it
originated from manufacturing but since
it has been applied to various
Industries we have the following stages
or core principles of Link Six Sigma
first identifying value determine what
customers truly value in a product or
service eliminate anything that doesn't
add a value next one mapping the value
string visualize the entire process from
start to finish to identify areas of
waste such as waiting over production or
unnecessary steps third one is flow
create a smooth and efficient flow of
work by minimizing interruptions and
bottlenecks fourth one is full establish
systems where work is only done in
response to customer demand reducing
excess inventory and work in progress
the fifth one continuous Improvement
encourage a culture of continuous
Improvement by involving employees and
identifying and eliminating waste Six
Sigma is a data driven approach to
process Improvement that focuses on
reducing various and now that we have
understood what is lean now let's
proceed with understanding what is Six
Sigma 6 Sigma is a data driven approach
to process Improvement that is focused
on reducing variation and effects it is
a structured methodology that uses
statistical tools to achieve a
consistent quality the core components
of Six Sigma are as follows first Define
clearly Define the problem project scope
and objectives understand what's
critical to customers next measure
collect data and analyze it to
understand the current progress
performance and identify potential
sources of variation next ahead is
analyze use statistical analysis to
identify root causes of problems and
prioritize them full Improvement
followed by that we have improved
develop and Implement solutions to
address the identified issues make data
driven changes to improve the process
and lastly we have control Implement
controls to sustain the improvements
Monitor and measure ongoing performance
lean 6 Sigma when lean and Six Sigma are
combined organizations Leverage The
chance of both methodologies lean helps
streamline processes by eliminating
waste while Six Sigma ensures consistent
quality by reducing defects and
variation the result is improved
efficiency reduce costs enhance customer
satisfaction and better overall
performance everything falls down to a
simple fact that the lead 6 Sigma is a
comprehensive approach to process
influence that seeks to streamline
process by eliminating waste that is
finally reduced effects and variation by
data driven analysis that has sex Sigma
improve efficiency quality and customer
satisfaction and create a culture of
continuous Improvement within an
organization attachment of healthcare to
service Industries and in empowers
organizations to deliver better products
and services while optimizing their
operations having the basics of lean Six
Sigma discussed we shall now proceed
into the different Wells or
certifications available in six City
fundamentally lean Six Sigma has six
spells as follows firstly a master black
belt next black belt green belt yellow
belt white belt and wrong belt let's
discuss each one of these in detail the
various lean Six Sigma belt levels and
their rules within an organization
Improvement projects firstly we have the
master black belt the role and the
particle of lean C Sigma expertise
Master black belts serve as the
program's Elite leaders and mentors
responsibilities they specialize in
training and coaching black bells and
greenwells equipping them with Advanced
skills and knowledge mastering the data
analysis and statistical tools they
focus on developing key metrics and
shaping the Strategic direction of the
Six Sigma program now the impact acting
as the organization's Six Sigma
Technologies and internal consultant
they are pivotal in driving
transformative change and achieving
Superior operational excels now
proceeding ahead we will discuss the
black belt the rule black belts are
engine of lean six signal projects
leading the way in problem solving and
process optimization responsibilities
that take charge of complex problem
solving projects driving data driven
solutions to improved processes
blackmails are not only project leaders
but also trainers and coaches guiding
project teams towards success impact
their expertise ensures that projects
are executed effectively leading to
significant enhancements in efficiency
quality and customer satisfaction now we
have the green belt green pills are
valuable Assets in lean Six Sigma
initiatives Bridging the Gap between
their locals and black girls
responsibilities the play dual role by
assisting the data collection and
Analysis for Blackwell's projects while
also needing Greenville projects or
things Greenwell's Drive process
improvements and collaborate closely
with black belts impact their work
contributes to streamline processes and
serves as a stepping stone for more
Junior practitioners to progress over
the lean Six Sigma hierarchy now we have
the yellow belt yellow belt serve as
essential members of lean Six Sigma
project teams contributing their skills
and insights responsibilities they
actively participate in Project teams
helping with process improvements and
reviewing data that supports project
objectives next impact yellow globals
bring a strong understanding of lean Six
Sigma Concepts to the project level
providing valuable input and
contributing to the success of
initiatives followed by yellow belt we
have the white belt roll white bands
represent the foundational level of
awareness within a lean Sigma
responsibilities while they may not be a
part of Six Sigma project teams white
pills can engage in local problem
solving efforts that support broader
projects they have a fundamental
understanding of lean Six Sigma Concepts
and principles impact white Bells help
create a culture of awareness within the
organization where employees at all
levels grasp the basics of Six Sigma and
its potential benefits lastly the ground
Builder role bronwells occupy a huge
unique position that varies by
organization as it's not a widely
recognized level in traditional means
Sigma responsibilities some
organizations classify bronwells as
individuals who have attained the
Greenville certificate and passed the
Blackwell certification exam but may not
have completed the second Six Sigma
project impact while not universally
acknowledged prawn Wells and certain
context May Bridge the transition from
Greenbelt to Black Belt showcasing their
commitment to mastering Six Sigma
principles and methodologies these
enhanced descriptions highlight the
significance of each lane Six Sigma
bread level and their respective
contributions to achieving process
excellence and organizational success so
far we have understood the important
belts of lean Six Sigma moving further
we will discuss the process of becoming
a certified lean Six Sigma professional
in 2024 but before that let's hear from
