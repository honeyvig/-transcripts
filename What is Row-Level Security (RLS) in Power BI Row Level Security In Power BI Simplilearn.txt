without further delay let's get started
with what is role level security in
power Pi now imagine that you're working
in an organization and you have
different subordinates let's say you are
the creator of this entire data
dashboard or if you are the manager and
you have some subordinates so they might
be of a different designation which is
lyer to yours and they might have
subordinates in the leaf node level or
the lowest level right so they might not
have complete access to your data set
let's say you are dealing with six or
seven dashboards so you'll have access
to everything and your subordinates
might have to deal with only two of
those dashboards let's say the sales
which are happening in west region and
east region so their subordinates might
have only access to few stores let's say
if the person working with the vest Zone
has two subordinates then he might have
access to two or three different stores
which are available in the west zone
right you're getting my point correct so
you might have access to all the five
zones your subordinates might have to
deal with individual zones and their
subordinates might have to deal with
individual stores that is the level of
hierarchy divides the accessibility to
the data you have so you given this uh
accessibility because you don't want to
mess up the whole dat set your
subordinates might not have an idea how
a dashboard of the DAT set is working or
they might you know some reasons due to
some reasons there is this Ro level
security implemented on powerbi now
let's have a check on this roev security
or RLS and power Pi in a practical
demonstration now we will be dealing
with the same Super Store D so we will
be trying to create individual Ro level
Securities for different zones of sales
that we have in our data set and we can
have a view how it really works now
let's quickly switch back to powerbi so
that you have a better understanding on
what exactly I mean about Ro level
security yeah we are on our sales
dashboard on the D set that we'll be
dealing with the sales D set now this
particular dashboard has all the five
region so here you can see Central north
south east west so this is the overall
sales dashboard this deals with uh sales
order month on month and uh sales based
on Country sales based on category sales
based on subcategory and here we also
have the kpis the total quantity of
products sold the total sales total
discount being offered and the total
profit that we have earned right now
this is an overall dashboard this is the
dashboard that you have access to as a
manager let's say now you want to
distribute or divide or you know
segregate the accessibility based on
zone so that your support needs work on
those only zones or you know focus on
the zones which are provided to them so
that it don't have to deal with the
entire dashboard that you're dealing
with now that can be done by using the
rule of security go to modeling option
here and here you have manage rules so
click on manage rules and you have
access to provide the RO level security
now you can create a new role here let's
create a new role now name the role as
Adam for
north and let's create another one
Jennifer for South John for
West Ramsey for East Kumar for
cental right now we have created Five
grows now let's provide the atom with
the not data so here you can just double
click on data add a filter and go to
region and in region you can provide the
value as
not there you go so your tax expression
is perfect no errors you can just click
on Save and a new region for North has
been created just go back to manage
roles and and try to apply this to
everyone add a new filter go to region
and uh we giving Jennifer the South
Region and for John we giving west
region and for Kumar we are giving the
central
[Music]
region and Ramsey the last one will be
dealing with east region you can save
there you go now you have applied the
role level Securities to individual
employees working on individual zones
now just to quickly check if they are
working or not you can quickly save the
current dashboard and it is done here
you have a view option you can just
click on view and here you have all the
views that you created right now you can
just click on add them for North Region
and your dashboard will change and it
will give you the sales happening for
North region similarly if you go on
checking for different roles you have
different regions so that's how you can
create the RO level security and when it
comes to the end user if you want to
give this particular Ro level security
or access to that particular Zone to
your end user you can just publish your
dashboard and all your rle securities to
your Microsoft powerbi service and you
can provide the access so that's how
basically the RO level security Works in
powerbi and with that we have reached
the end of this session on what exactly
is role level security or RLS and
powerbi and should you have any queries
