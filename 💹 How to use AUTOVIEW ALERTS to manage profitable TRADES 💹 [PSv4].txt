hey traders in today's video i'm going
to be showing you how to use the
autoview chrome browser plugin to
automatically manage your
trading positions and set your stop loss
to break even when a certain price
is hit
so obviously the most valuable thing
about autoview
and the most useful application of it is
to automate your trading scripts
so automating the trade execution and
management of your strategy scripts
and indicator scripts is the main
advantage of this plugin but one
other advantage of autoview is that you
can use it
to automatically manage your manual
trading positions
so for example let's say we enter long
here
on aussie dollar and we have our stop
loss below this
swing low in here and we are expecting
price to
move up but let's say that after we
enter this position
we want to go out for lunch with our
girlfriend or boyfriend
or partner husband wife whatever and
we don't want to have to sit and babysit
this trade but
we also want to move our stop-loss to
break even
when price action hits a certain price
level
well of course you could just set an
alert here you can just set a regular
alert
to pop up on your phone push
notification and you can manage the
position manually but let's say this is
a really
important occasion and you don't want to
be checking your phone while you're out
or even let's say you're at a business
meeting or something well you can use
auto view to automatically move your
stop loss
to break even when your price target is
hit
so let's say at one to one when price
actually gets back up to these highs
we want to move our stop loss from down
here to the price where our trade was
entered well i'll show you how to do
that now
first thing i'm going to do is create a
new order i'm going to go along
at market there we go so we have filled
at
7 6 0 1 2. i'm going to put my stop loss
at 7
5 9 7 1 7 5 9 7
1. there we go and i want my stop loss
to be moved to break even if
price session comes back up to these
highs well the way i can do that with
auto view
is if i set an alert at 76057
so if i just put a horizontal line there
i can right click that line and create
an alert on this line if we come down to
the
message section what we need to do here
in order to initiate a breakeven stop
alert is first we need to clear our stop
loss
and then replace it with a new stop loss
so the oanda api does not allow you
to update your stop loss as far as i can
tell at least not through auto view
i haven't found a way to be able to just
update my stop loss with a command
what you need to do instead is delete
your limit order
your stop loss order and replace it with
a new stop loss order
so the way we do that is we need to
reference our exchange again so rwanda
practice we need to reference our symbol
so i'm on
australian us dollar and i need to use
the c
which stands for cancel or close
and i need to set c equals to order
so this will cancel any limit orders i
have now keep in mind this will also
cancel your
take profit so if i put a let me copy
this order really quickly
and let's put a take profit on this
trade up at these highs here
let's call it seven six one two seven
six one two
modify this position so now we have a
take profit up at 7612.
let's create a new alert really quickly
i'll set the condition to less than just
for demonstration purposes
let's paste that command in here if i
create this alert
when this alert gets triggered it will
delete
our stop loss and our take profit so
watch this let's click create
and wait for that alert to trigger there
we go
now our stop loss and our take profit
are gone we can now use another alert
to update our stop loss and take profit
so the way we do this the way we update
our orders is i need to change
c to position so this will now
update our position if we give new
parameters
for our stop loss and take profit so we
need to first set the book
so we are long on this position so if i
set b
equals long i can now set
a new fixed stop loss so in the case of
a breakeven trade we would set
our fsl to 76012
but for now i'm just going to replace
the stop loss that we just removed so
let's type in
0.75971
and i will also replace our fixed take
profit
up here at let's change it to 76092
0.76092 now if i create this
alert these command parameters will
replace our fixed stop loss and our
fixed
take profit but this is how you would
move your stop loss to break even or
even create a manual trailing stop
let's wait for this alert to be
triggered there we go our stop-loss is
back where we wanted it
i'm not sure what happened to our take
profit
not sure why the take profit was not
replaced let me
just quickly check the order view logs
i'm not sure why my take profit is not
being placed
let me play around with this for a
minute that seemed to work
so i guess we need to use two commands
here
one for our stop loss one for our take
profit so let me change
fsl to 0.5971
let me save that delete our orders again
wait for that alert to be triggered and
see if this works there we go
so we need to separate our fsl and ftp
commands if i copy this command over
here
and paste it in now this is where i
should mention that we can
execute multiple orders in the single
alert message
so we can have multiple commands here
and what these three commands will do
is the first command will delete our
stop loss and our take profit
the second command will set our stop
loss to whichever price we want to
so in this example we're going to set
this to break even when this blue line
is hit
and then we need to replace our take
profit as well
so three different commands here to
manage our position
automatically let's copy this command
and delete this alert and add
that command to this blue line here
we need to change our stop loss to our
entry price
so fsl will now become 76012
and if i create this alert if price
action
gets up to this blue line and triggers
this alert
auto view will delete our stop loss and
our take profit
it will move our stop loss to break even
to the price that we entered at
and it will replace our take profit back
at 761
and this will all be done automatically
without us having to lift
the finger so long as you have order of
you running in your browser
this position will be automatically
managed so this is a great way to use
auto view in your manual trading process
now there have been many occasions in my
career as a trader over the past four
years or so
where i've wanted to move my stop-loss
to break even if a certain price is hit
but i end up going to bed and overnight
at like three in the morning
price action comes up hits where i
wanted to move my stop-loss to break
even
but i was asleep and i couldn't manage
the position and then price action has
come
back down to stop me out for a loss on a
trade that i should have been
stopped out for break even on but i
wasn't able to manage my position
now i can use autoview to automatically
manage
my trades while i'm not at the computer
so not only can i fully automate my
trading scripts
i can also fully automate my trade
management even on the strategies that i
do not
fully automate which is phenomenal and a
really powerful
aspect of autoview that even manual
click traders can take advantage of
so now i'm going to leave my screen
capture recording
for the next i don't know hour or so and
hopefully
with any luck price action will come up
and hit this blue line
and my trade will manage autoview will
auto manage this trade will
automatically move my stop loss
to break even and uh with any luck we
can
see this in practice so let's wait and
see what happens and i will be back
in one second
and no luck on that trade we just got
stopped out by the spread
and yet again we have stopped out i'm
gonna keep trying until
we get a trade that plays out
and demonstrates this break even
technique
set our take profit to 7608
save the alert i'll put on my profit
tool
again so we can watch this play out in
real time
and we'll see what happens
here we go and success
so our stop-loss has now been moved to
break even
after price has finally come up to test
this blue line and you have no idea how
boring it was sitting here waiting for
that to happen
and while recording this i actually just
made a cheeky two percent
gain on my main account taking a
discretionary trade
uh because i noticed that the one minute
chart was holding this
this area down here and so i jumped over
to my main account
um on my second monitor while i was
recording and threw on a trade
one percent risk stop loss below the uh
swing low of this bat pattern and hit
targets
within an hour or so nice little
profitable
video to record can't complain about
that and our take profit has been put
up here at 7608 so if i scroll up and
open up the command
that did all this first we cleared our
limit orders
on this instrument then we replaced
our fixed stop loss price to our
breakeven price
and then we added back our take profit
limit order all done automatically using
the autoview
plugin which is really cool stuff now i
can delete this
line and that's it for the break even
demonstration
so if you were to do this on a real
account all you would need to do is get
rid of practice
make sure that you've connected your
real account id
to autoview and make sure you have set
all of your
exchange parameters to awanda and apart
from that
none of these parameters need to be
changed except if you're obviously using
this on a different market you would
need to change your symbol
to the relevant market but that's it for
today's short lesson hope you found that
interesting
good luck with your trading and i'll see
in the next video
