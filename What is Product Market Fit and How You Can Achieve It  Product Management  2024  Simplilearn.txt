started so guys let's start by
understanding what is product Market fit
guys product Market fit refers to the
moment when company's product resonates
deeply with its Target customers it's
when customers not only buy the product
but also use it regularly and recommend
it to others helping the product gain
attraction and sustain growth over the
time this concept is critical for any
business that wants to achieve long-term
profitability and also Suess
entrepreneurs and venture capitalist
like Mark Anderson who is widely
credited with popularizing the idea
describes product Market fit as finding
a good market and creating a product
that meets the needs of that market it's
not just about launching a product it's
about ensuring that the product
satisfies a significant demand within
the choosen Market without this
alignment between the product and market
growth will be significant and demand
will be chosen within the market so guys
with without this alignment between
product and market growth will be stuned
and profitability will be difficult to
achieve Dan osen a renowned product
management expert developed a framework
known as the product Market fed pyramid
which helps basically companies navigate
the process of achieving this alignment
now let us try to move ahead and
understand why product Market fit is
important so guys Alex Schulz Facebook's
vice president of growth has emphasized
that one of the common issues he
observes in the company that he advises
is misconception around product Market
fit many companies believe that they
have achieved it when they actually
haven't why does it matter so much why
do venture capitalist frequently require
evidence of product Market fit before
investing in a company and why do Mark
Anderson's divide the startup journey
into two distinct phases before product
Market fit and after product Market fit
the answer is pretty simple guys until
you confirm that your product has a
large enough market of customers willing
to pay for it your company shouldn't
focus on scaling other strategic
objectives like upselling and before
product Market fit these efforts are
premature and potentially
counterproductive for example guys
spending money on advertising or
expanding sales team doesn't make sense
if you haven't first proven that there's
sufficient market for your product
achieving product Market fit means that
your product has demonstrated enough
value that is sign significant number of
people want it it's at this point that
the business can begin focusing on
growth strategies but before reaching
this stage the primary goal is to
validate that the product solves a real
problem for the market in short guys
product Market fit is the foundation for
long-term growth without it even the
best of your sales and marketing efforts
are likely to fall short so guys as you
can see all over here so there are
certain reasons like product Market fit
is important like have mentioned
sustainable growth resource efficiency
investors confidence customer loyalty
and competitive Advantage so these are
some of the main reasons why product
Market fit is important but now the
question arises who is responsible for
the product Market fit while product
Market fit is often associated with the
roles of product managers and marketers
the reality is that it's a company's
wide responsibility every team from
sales to customer support and finance
plays a role in helping company raise
this Milestone the product team may be
at the Forefront of creating a product
but customer feedback from sales and
support teams can provide invaluable
insights the finance department also
plays a key role by tracking key metrics
that indicate invaluable insights and
also whether the company is making
progress towards product Market fit or
not in essence of achieving product
Market fit it requires collaboration
across all the Departments it's not just
about developing the right product it's
also about making sure that the entire
organization is aligned and focused on
meeting the needs of customer now let us
talk about a very important question
that how to measure the product Market
fit so guys there's no definitive metric
to tell a company that it has achieved
product Market fit however several
indicators can signal that you are on
the right path Andrew Chen a venture
capitalist offers some useful guidelines
for assessing the product Market fit the
first one is customer feedback like our
customers showing a willingness to
switch to your product when your
potential customers try your product do
they express a preference for it or
other competitors Market differentiation
like have customers who previously
rejected other Solutions now turn to
your product are you offering something
distinct that captures their interest
like the competitive grouping the
customers in intuitively understand
which other products yours competes with
if they place your products in the same
category as leading Alternatives it
indicates you are playing right in the
market so guys as you can see all over
here now let us try to understand some
of the other measures the next reason is
product understanding like do customers
clearly grasp what sets your products
apart if they can easily identify your
product's unique selling points then you
are on the right track
next we have the retention rates like
how do your metrics such as customer
retention rates compare to those of your
competitors strong retention is a good
sign that you are providing value to
your customers these signals incompass
both qualitative and quantitative
measures reflecting that product Market
fit is just not about numbers but it's
also about customer perception and
behavior so guys now let us discuss
about some of the qualitative measures
for example we have first one that is
Word of Mouth according to Mark and
reent one of the best indicators of
product Market fit is when customer
start promoting your product on their
own they essentially become your sales
representative by recommending your
product to others next is Media
attention like we get increased call
from media outlets and analysts suggest
that your product is gaining visibility
and credibility in the industry frequent
media coverage can indicate growing
Market interest in your offering by
tracking both qualitative and
quantitative metrics company can better
understand where the products stand and
on the path toward product Market fit
now the biggest question arises how to
achieve product Market fit so guys
there's no Universal formula for
achieving the product Market fit the Dan
Allen's book The Lean product Playbook
provides a six framework that helps team
towards this goal so guys the first is
determine your Target customer first
identify who your product is for this
involves understanding the demographic
psychographic and behavioral
characteristic of your ideal customer
without a clear target audience it's
difficult to design a product that meets
the real needs next is identify the
underserved needs it means that you have
to assess the unmet or poorly met needs
of your target audience by identifying
the gaps in the existing products you
can tailor your solutions to address
those areas this step is very crucial
for differentiating your product from
the competitor next is Define your value
proposition based on the needs you have
identified craft a value proposition
that clearly communicates why your
product is the best solution for your
target audience you have to also tell
what unique benefits does it offers and
how does it solve the customer problem
more effectively than the Alternatives
specify your minimum viable product so
guys specifying your MVP feature set is
very very important and MVP is the
simplest version of your product that
still delivers value to your Target
customers the goal is to focus only on
the core features that addresses the
most pressing customer needs rather than
trying to build a fully featured product
Right Way by launching an MVP you can
get a feedback and iterate quickly
develop your MVP then once all the MVP
features set is defined the next step is
to build and launch it the initial
version of your product should be
focused on deliv in the core value
proposition while allowing you to GA
data and insights from real customer
next is test your MVP with the customers
finally once the MVP is live collect
feedback from your Target customers use
this feedback to refine and improve the
product testing helps validate whether
your product meets the needs of the
customers and market and also provides
the valuable insights for future
iteration achieving product Market fit
is an ongoing process it requires
continuous refinement of your product
based on customer feedback and market
conditions however by following this
structured approach your team can stay
focused on the key elements that drive
the product Market fit so guys we have
come to the end of this video and before
that I want to say something that
product Market fit is a vital milestone
for any company it is the point at which
your product gains enough attraction in
the market to support sustainable growth
without it even the most ambitious
business strategies are unlikely to
succeed the journey to the product
Market fit is often challenging and it
requires both a deep understanding of
the customer needs and willingness to
iterate on your product but guys once
achieved product Market fit can unlock
the potential for rapid growth and
long-term success so guys that was all
