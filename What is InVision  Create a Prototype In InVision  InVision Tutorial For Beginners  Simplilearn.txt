every time we upload a new video without
any further delay let's get started with
the session on so you have delivered
your final design to your internal or
external client only to find out the
work you created first way of the mark
and the hours you have spent on the
original design have been wasted sound
familiar this scenario and others are
exactly why wireframes are an essential
step in turning any digital products
into a reality think of a wireframe like
a building blueprint but for your
digital product the goal of a wireframe
is to create the basic skeleton for each
screen in your design that you can
review the overall layout of the design
with your clients before things like
imaginary color and branding get brought
into a mix a wireframe will save you and
your clients a huge headache and a lot
of time now you may be asking yourself
okay but what program do I need to
create a wireframe so in this video
tutorial we'll be using Envision one of
the standard software used in industry
let's get started
informationapp.com
after signing it it may take you to the
project dashboard near the top right of
the page click the plus button or the
red circle but before that you have to
sign it up or sign in
create a whiteboard with a free hand on
its way
you can just log in you have to cross it
out
okay
so from here you can get any like you
can create a blank freehand you just
select it
and you will get the page let me select
it once more
rank freehand
uh let's remove any of the before let's
delete it from here
that's great
let's take a minute to look at the
interface the whole rank space is called
your canvas when you away you can draw
endlessly in the top left hand corner
there is an invasion logo to go back to
your dashboard beside the logo is the
title documents uh wait a minute yeah hi
this is a highlight document that that
name to be typed in for the new file
let's take it
demo
invasion in in the middle these are the
different tools in the top right hand
corner these are the menu options after
that X is an additional menu for
exporting an version history creators
and enter presenters mode to share your
net on the bottom side on the left side
or at the bottom in the middle of the
toolbar to start your drawing in the
bottom right hand corner you get a pen
Edge or to hold space zoom in and zoom
out now let's talk about the first tool
that is pointer tool that pointer tools
allows you to select move and resize
suppose it helps you to move the
elements or the pictures on your canvas
and you can make a copy of this let's
make it like this you can click it whole
and drag and create a box around and
chosen things like a selection uh in
Adobe Photoshop or illustrators
alternatively you can hold down shift
key and click each object
so for this keyword shortcut is V and
one draw on a canvas with your pencil
tool when you select the pencil tool you
can change the color let's take and
color over here we have selected the
pink color
and you can change the color even from
here again
let's take this color
and you even adjust the line thickness
or set the default and caps to the top
so
with the chosen color you will see three
different opacity options
along with the opportunity to add fills
but remember to keep the wireframe as
simple as possible by using black and
white and gray color only it is over
here to create neat Circle or squares
hold down the option key while drawing
while drawing uh that will help you to
creating a straight line
suppose I'm making it will be
automatically will become straight at
zero degree
or at 0 degree
45 degree
or 90 degree to create any straight line
at any angles let's take another color
like this like this like if we will make
a line without pressing the shift key it
will be like this there will be no
straight line but it feels stress
while using shift key it will be
straight and automatically
okay hold shift key whenever you click
to draw but release shift before
finishing your line let's take a look
how is it work
like this
can see we can make it up at
okay when we release a shift key it will
become a straight it will become a
straight line keyword shortcut is P or
two okay so now to erase or clear the
canvas shape uh with the Eraser tool
click once on the pencil
oh yeah the pencil tool you can see on
the right side there is the Eraser tool
then you can use it to erase whatever
you have
done before let's you have to just touch
it over it or Pat it over there
eraser on the top of the line that you
want to remove and just and it just get
erased and the keyword shortcut is e so
the next is uh when the text tool is
selected click once on the canvas
the text tool adds to type something go
ahead and enter text on your canvas
to create a line break press enter
switch to the pointer key tool to resize
you can see the resize you can use it
with your use of pointer key you can
change the color formatting and
alignment
let's change it to the red color
italic or let it be
you can highlight the text and you can
format the line of the text or it you
you can do it italicize and set the text
alignment to the left
or right or Center as we have already
takes a line in the center you can also
lock the text on the canvas to keep it
in place
or convert any text box into a sticky
notes let's see
keyboard shortcut is T or three
Tape 2 you can create rectangle Circle
or straight line rhombus oval or any
Arrow shape
click the shape tool and then select the
appropriate shape whatever you want to
keep here let's copy and I'll paste it
over here
and you can hold shift while trying to
create a perfect square let's
do that
let me select the circle
just hold the shift key first
and you can create a perfect square
while drawing a line will lock your line
how does it work let's see
it can lock it at zero degree
45 degree
and
90 degree
keyword shortcut is s and 4. what I
suggest just avoid using graphics and
images in IO wireframes use Simple
rectangles and square shapes from here
let's see
if you place an X through the middle of
the box
this is a signal where you can place an
image and for the videos you can put the
triangle like
um
like this
as a play button let's make it
color
got a note you want to clarify a point
sticky notes allow you to add notes
anywhere on the canvas
it is in the fifth option with a sticky
note selected you can change its colors
actually
adjust its width
and you can even add a text over here
let's suppose
you can keep anywhere with the cursor
and the keyboard shortcut is n or six
see something you like go ahead and add
an emoji let's let's
you can keep this Emoji over here
or one more you can add over here okay
start creating uh one basic wireframe
let's take it over here from here
let's select on this one
we will use some basic tools uh with the
shape first we will have this
pick another one
and the editing toolbar appears when you
have one or more objects selected
like this and let's edit it with the
text let's write something
let it be a normal
we will use our cursor to
align the name
okay similarly we will have password
okay
it
posture
let's make it a little bit small in size
okay
and another text over here let's make it
submit button
so now after creating shapes and line
you can edit them using the menus
actually so
let's
change the color for this as
pink this also we can change the color
with pink
and we can change the color for the text
let it be black
and we can change the
width of the line
let it be normal
this one
okay it is already normal okay we will
change the color for this also
and for this also
it did be little bold
with the red color
you can see the alignment of this is
always
connect to this okay
uh when you have text
you can select you can change the color
formatting and Alignment that we have
done already
so you can unlock the text on the canvas
to keep it in the place like let's
suppose we can make it move around like
this but if we lock
this one
you can't move it because it is locked
so just open it with the tab let's see
or you can even convert any text block
into a sticky note suppose this
and
you can
get a sticky note of this
outside right
so don't let it do this okay
and now you can click on the hand tool
at the bottom to pan around the canvas
like
or press and hold the space bar to
access the hand tool so you can move
your
and you are enabling to move around an
image by
pushing on it like this
and the magnifying tool is to zoom in
and zoom out on the canvas
just like Adobe products
you can command control plus minus to
zoom in or zoom out
so that wrap ups our Envision tutorial
where we created a simple wireframe with
multiple frame styles today's session
was for beginners has a basic approach
the possibilities are endless and we
