1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,159
since its release in November of last

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,560
year chat GPT has had so much hype

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,480
around it and also similar Technologies

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
like Bing chat and Google's Bard and

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,679
gpt4 and really generative AI in general

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,540
uh now as you may know I like to say

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,460
that artificial intelligence is easily

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,800
the most misunderstood technology on the

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,720
planet and to be completely honest the

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,460
past couple of months have only further

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,279
driven in that belief for me there have

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,560
been people making very confident claims

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,199
and statements about uh say a GPT and

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,540
what it's capable of that I frankly

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,700
don't really think hold for example I've

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,520
seen some very confidently claim that we

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,500
will be replacing all Junior developers

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,540
and even artists and journalists and

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,739
that this is the worst thing to happen

20
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,100
to education uh I don't really believe

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,899
that but this does bring up an

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,460
interesting question in my opinion and

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,860
that is that you see I love to do a lot

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,539
of different things I love to write code

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,280
and build applications as you can

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,539
probably tell from my YouTube channel

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,879
but I also absolutely love to share what

28
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,559
I learn learn about the world of tech

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,359
with others through a variety of

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,680
different media like for example

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,140
teaching AI courses and my YouTube

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,780
channel as well as through non-technical

33
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,640
media for example doing interviews to

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
help people understand the impact of

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,060
technology on their lives from a

36
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,180
non-technical perspective and so here's

37
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,840
uh here's the question today can chat

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,140
gbt replace me or maybe even at least

39
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,140
part of what I do and if so how does

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,479
that generalize to everyone and things

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,700
that we all do or maybe if not today

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,939
will it in the future well before we get

43
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,979
to that a little bit of background now

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,420
you may know that I've always been a big

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,460
proponent of the idea that the AI

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,259
artificial intelligence technology we

47
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,720
build today isn't really artificial

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,360
intelligence right it's not actually

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,399
intelligent rather what we're proving is

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,220
that there are skills that we have that

51
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,200
we previously thought required human

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,119
cognition and intelligence and instead

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,520
if we boil it down to enough of a subset

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,140
of that skill still we can actually

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,600
replicate it with math and we can do it

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,820
with the power of technology so take for

57
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,280
example deep blue playing chess or

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,679
Watson playing Jeopardy or alphago

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,300
playing go right so some of the classic

60
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,420
examples of AI technology and how it's

61
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,700
grown over the years especially with

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,440
almost with actually all of these

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,239
examples all we've really done is we

64
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,800
said all right here's a human skill

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,780
we've had say for example playing chess

66
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,239
or playing Jeopardy and if you boil it

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,680
down to enough of a subset and if you

68
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,260
specify the problem really well and you

69
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,819
really sit down and think about how to

70
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,280
build a pipeline an approach to solve

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,080
this problem mathematically we can

72
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
actually do it in in Computing right we

73
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,099
can do it with the power of Technology

74
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,560
we don't need human cognition for it

75
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,239
however this also comes with a pretty

76
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,580
fundamental limitation and that is that

77
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,560
these systems are not at all flexible or

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,780
adaptable really all they're doing is

79
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,700
what they were programmed to do pretty

80
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,379
much like every other technology system

81
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,300
except they have more capabilities right

82
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
they can for example analyze

83
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,420
unstructured data like Watson playing

84
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,700
Jeopardy but it's still playing Jeopardy

85
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,800
you can't tell Watson to do something

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,860
else in language for example but you can

87
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,959
continue to make these capabilities even

88
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,700
more complex sort of growing out from

89
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,040
there back in 2020 I even built and

90
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,540
trained a series of deep Learning

91
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,640
Systems myself that I call Auto Lyricist

92
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,280
and the goal of the system is to augment

93
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,959
songwriters by providing what I call

94
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,319
automated inspiration at scale the idea

95
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,120
is to eliminate writer's block and

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,500
actually got the chance to work with a

97
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,540
couple different talented

98
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,280
singer-songwriters uh to prove out the

99
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,600
system and show that it actually works

100
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,729
[Music]

101
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,299
the line that you just heard and many

102
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,580
others in this song by Claudia hoiser

103
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,680
titled A Summertime song were actually

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,319
inspired by the auto Lyricist system

105
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,959
however even Auto Lyricist working in

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,180
language with such complex unstructured

107
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,220
data and nuance and art and creativity

108
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,620
isn't really flexible you can't really

109
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,659
get this pipeline of deep Learning

110
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,700
Systems to do something other than

111
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,680
generating music lyrics at least not

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
effectively on the contrary it seems

113
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,939
that modern AI technology is actually

114
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,000
flexible so take for example chat GPT I

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,979
can actually tell it to write a song

116
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:18,840
containing the line that you just heard

117
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,000
and it seemed to just do it without

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,280
requiring that whole complex pipeline

119
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,040
that I put together three years ago I

120
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,560
could even ask it to draft a response to

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,259
an email that I received or I could ask

122
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,360
it to write code for me for example and

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,820
this flexibility is precisely what makes

124
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,880
these systems so impressive to us and

125
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,500
also the fact that their input and

126
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,560
output modality is just language right

127
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,360
language in and of itself is super

128
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
special to us because fundamentally it

129
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,220
is the serialization format for our

130
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,100
thoughts it is very deeply linked to the

131
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,500
way that we think and when you can

132
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,139
communicate with an AI system quote

133
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,840
unquote that happens to use language as

134
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,820
this input output modality and it seems

135
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,440
like you can understand this complex

136
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,240
language and it seems like it's able to

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,520
communicate fluently using that language

138
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,460
it's very easy to trip up our brain's

139
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,800
internal circuitry and assign way more

140
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,900
credit and intelligence to the backing

141
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,780
system then there really actually is but

142
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,220
let's finally go ahead and answer the

143
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,340
question can chat GPT replace me or

144
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,820
replace you for that matter or anyone

145
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,199
there are four tests that I want to run

146
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,759
today first we're going to see if chat

147
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,860
gbt can answer interview questions for

148
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,900
me we'll see if they can draft responses

149
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,120
to my emails we're going to see if they

150
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,400
can answer my assessments that I've

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,259
written for my own students and my AI

152
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,580
courses like the one that I taught at

153
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,020
University of Winnipeg last year and

154
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,240
this will see if you know GPT can even

155
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,000
teach students which I mean is dependent

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,080
on it being able to answer the

157
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,460
assessments I put together in the first

158
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,740
place and then finally we're going to

159
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,479
see if chatgpt can replace me as a

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,639
developer and write my code for me so

161
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,620
let's go ahead and try them out alright

162
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,539
let's begin our assessment of chat GPT

163
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,400
to see if it can replace me we're going

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,720
to start off with a task that isn't

165
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,120
really replacing me as much as it is uh

166
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,160
automating a little bit of the job that

167
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,380
isn't as fun for me let's see if it can

168
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,479
write my emails now this is sort of like

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
a typical example of the kind of thing

170
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,160
you would do with gbt taking a look at a

171
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,500
hypothetical email that I that I wrote

172
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,380
out this is from John and he's saying

173
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,880
he's the founder of a startup focused on

174
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,259
blockchain and he wants to chat about

175
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,960
his web 3.0 platform now let's just say

176
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,300
once again fully hypothetical scenario I

177
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,280
have a conflict of interest and so I

178
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,160
can't work with them uh due to due to

179
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
this conflict of interest but I'd be

180
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,419
happy to chat I can simply tell chat gbt

181
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,100
tell John that I can't work with him due

182
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,660
to a conflict of interest but I'd be

183
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,880
happy to chat and with this very naive

184
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,639
prompting I get back actually not that

185
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,819
bad of an email draft it says hi John

186
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,960
thanks for reaching out introducing

187
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,300
yourself I appreciate your interest and

188
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,280
basically boils down to you know giving

189
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,620
across the message that I wanted to

190
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,900
but here's the problem you can tell that

191
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,600
I didn't write this right if this is

192
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,940
continuing a thread with someone I've

193
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,940
been speaking to myself for a long time

194
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,680
or if this is you know sending out new

195
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,060
emails and eventually I take over you're

196
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,139
gonna be able to tell that there's a

197
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,120
shift in voice and I don't want that now

198
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
I gotta go in and do a lot of you know

199
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
editing in post to make it sound like

200
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,639
I'm the one who sent the email

201
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,220
so how can we somehow improve this well

202
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,560
we can improve it with context so what I

203
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,419
did is I built a script that basically

204
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,720
scraped every email I have written and I

205
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,699
took out pairs of emails where it was an

206
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,380
email that I got and then and then my

207
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,360
response immediately after and wherever

208
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,520
I noticed that pattern across my emails

209
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,259
and of course it was like an actual

210
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,440
important tagged email I stored those in

211
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,000
the database and used the openai

212
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,060
embeddings endpoint to index all of

213
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,220
these emails and so now when I see an

214
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,220
email like hypothetical John's over here

215
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,599
I embed that through the same embeddings

216
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,340
endpoint look up similar emails I've

217
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,319
gotten in the past take the top five

218
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,560
most similar emails take my responses of

219
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,319
them and then feed those into chat gpt's

220
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,300
context telling it to respond with the

221
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,759
message that I specify here but then in

222
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,680
the voice and writing style of these

223
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,620
previous five emails and so now if I

224
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,840
were to run this through with the same

225
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,479
message and same email but including

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,060
this sort of contextual prompting I I

227
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,520
get an email that is a lot closer to how

228
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,000
I would actually word a response to the

229
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,039
email that I got if this is what I

230
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,360
wanted to say

231
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,240
and so you can improve the results that

232
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,219
you get from these models significantly

233
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,380
and make them much more valuable to the

234
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,719
end user by using all sorts of neat

235
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,520
tricks and these are ones that you build

236
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,680
into your application not just ones that

237
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,360
you prompt the language model with right

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,399
so for example I actually had to go out

239
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,860
and index all of my emails scrape them

240
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,660
run them through the embedding store the

241
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,220
vectors in the database and then

242
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,140
implement the lookup to make it so I can

243
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,600
construct The Prompt for GPT to begin

244
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
with so one thing to keep in mind is

245
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,360
that when you're building valuable

246
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,399
applications it's all about that

247
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
interplay of using the software that you

248
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,080
build in the logic that you build

249
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,279
alongside the language model in

250
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,320
individual components where it can

251
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,779
actually be valuable now let's move on

252
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,220
to what I think is a more interesting

253
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,800
assessment let's see if we can automate

254
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,440
the uh the process of responding to

255
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
people's questions that want

256
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,100
non-technical answers now I receive

257
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,260
these a lot in like talks that I do in

258
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,600
interviews when people ask me questions

259
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,160
and this will be a non-technical

260
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,260
audience so say will ask me something

261
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,940
like what are your thoughts on

262
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,279
generative AI technology like gbt3 do

263
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,660
you think that large language models are

264
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,040
going to be a bad thing for Education

265
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,420
since students are just going to copy

266
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,519
the output of these AI systems and not

267
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,560
learn anything for themselves and do you

268
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,240
think it's going to replace entry-level

269
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,320
Developers

270
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,420
this is a real question that I got uh

271
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,519
just a couple of days ago let's see what

272
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,380
gbt4 the sort of state-of-the-art

273
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,660
language model from openai has to say

274
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,120
about this as you can see

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,240
it gives us a not bad answer like it

276
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,560
gives us something that is technically

277
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,580
correct

278
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,200
um there are pros and cons regarding its

279
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,120
impact on education you know it can be a

280
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,700
valuable tool for students but we need

281
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,880
to emphasize using these tools

282
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,860
responsibly as a supplement rather than

283
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,260
a replacement and as per entry-level

284
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,360
developers AI systems can automate

285
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,920
certain tasks but they're not capable of

286
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,420
replacing the human creativity problem

287
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,519
solving adaptability that's important

288
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,839
for

289
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,160
um development

290
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
and then it might change the nature of

291
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,920
some entry level jobs

292
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,140
again technically not wrong and it's

293
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,640
aligns to what I was going to answer

294
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,680
regardless but let's ask more detail

295
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,420
because this was kind of high level

296
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,279
so I ask what is the interaction between

297
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,200
students and AI really look like like

298
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,700
why wouldn't they just use it to cheat

299
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,880
right and

300
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,640
gpt4 comes back with a list of positive

301
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,339
interactions between students and Ai and

302
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,839
some of the ways that we can encourage

303
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,060
students not to cheat and most of it

304
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,040
boils down to providing clear guidelines

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
encouraging collaboration you know

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,940
emphasizing the importance of academic

307
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,820
integrity and then also you know finally

308
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,380
designing assessments that require

309
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,120
students to apply their Knowledge and

310
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,140
Skills

311
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,820
and so

312
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,920
a lot of this was honestly quite high

313
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,600
level boiling down to hey you just got

314
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,339
to make sure that you really am you know

315
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,560
encourage people not to cheat there

316
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,140
wasn't a lot of real substance as to

317
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,300
something I guess actionable um in these

318
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,500
answers

319
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,600
uh now for a little bit of context

320
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,820
my actual answer to this was something

321
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,279
along the lines of you know with these

322
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,959
language models sure say software

323
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,279
engineering students they will

324
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,500
inevitably try to use it to cheat no

325
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,880
matter how much you encourage them not

326
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,300
to but the point is that's these models

327
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,279
fundamentally due to certain limitations

328
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,620
and precisely the same ones that made it

329
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,540
so they couldn't answer this question in

330
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,640
more detail we'll never get everything

331
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,620
completely right there will be mistakes

332
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,480
that are made especially in fields like

333
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,640
software and when these mistakes are

334
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,320
made you are forced to then go in

335
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
understand the content the code and then

336
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
fix those bugs that is a lot harder than

337
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,620
people will necessarily give credit for

338
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,240
and then from an entry-level perspective

339
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,800
entry-level jobs are going to continue

340
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,899
to exist we're not replacing developers

341
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,120
right what's going to happen though is

342
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,160
the expectations of entry-level

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,899
developers will significantly change

344
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,060
they will be much higher than they are

345
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,920
today and the reason is simply because

346
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,860
they will have better tools right If you

347
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,360
hired two mathematicians one with them

348
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,760
without a calculator I imagine that you

349
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,019
would expect the one with the calculator

350
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,000
to get more work done because they just

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,579
fundamentally have a better tool and so

352
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,019
it's not that entry level developers are

353
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,000
going to be expected to have senior

354
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
levels of experience coming out of

355
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,500
school that's unreasonable instead

356
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,180
what's going to be expected is that they

357
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,220
will be able to provide more than an

358
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,740
entry-level developer today because they

359
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,079
will have the tools alongside their

360
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,880
human creativity and problem solving and

361
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,100
that little bit of experience to sort of

362
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,899
work effectively with that tool and get

363
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,519
more done than they would be able to

364
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,560
today but what about replacing me in

365
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,320
technical domains let's see if chatgpt

366
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,139
could replace me as a teacher now of

367
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,279
course in order to replace me as a

368
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,600
teacher I would expect that it would

369
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,160
actually be able to pass the existing

370
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
assessments I've already made for some

371
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,639
of my students for example as I

372
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,019
mentioned I taught a course at the

373
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,240
University of Winnipeg last year this AI

374
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,639
course was centered around my students

375
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,200
actually being able to build an actual

376
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,820
application using a machine learning

377
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,880
Tech and I had a quiz where I asked why

378
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,860
is explainability a problem with modern

379
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,260
deep learning techniques select all that

380
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,779
apply and in this question there were

381
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,079
four possible answers it's because we

382
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,399
don't understand the math behind

383
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,279
training the models at all the data we

384
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,500
train these models on only Maps input to

385
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,240
output and doesn't include the reasoning

386
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
for why the human made the original

387
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,220
decision uh also that there's no

388
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,079
standard way to explain a model's output

389
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,760
because it depends on the domain and the

390
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,800
representation of the data and deep

391
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,120
learning models are just trained

392
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,560
end-to-end with a large number of

393
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
parameters as a black box

394
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,040
and so these are our four possible

395
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,620
answers why is explainability a problem

396
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,440
with modern deep learning techniques

397
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,420
now right now if you'd like go ahead and

398
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,120
pause think about the answers and leave

399
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,500
them down in the comment section below

400
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,360
the reason I chose this specific

401
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,240
question from the quiz to give to gbt4

402
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,279
is because this was the one that

403
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,899
actually stumped the most of my students

404
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,120
and looking back in retrospect it was

405
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,860
kind of mean toward it this way because

406
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,440
it's a little bit misleading but really

407
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,139
if you think about the answers and if

408
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,120
you think about what they entail and

409
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,100
what would be necessary for them to be

410
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,680
true or false you realize which ones

411
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,019
should be true and false so let's run it

412
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,660
through gpt4 and let's see what it gives

413
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,860
us

414
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,300
once again this is sort of like the

415
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,440
state of the art model that we have

416
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,320
access to so asking it to both explain

417
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,199
each option a little bit as well as say

418
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,600
whether they're true or false we see it

419
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,519
start with number one then it gets to

420
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,279
number two and three and four

421
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,620
um and it basically boils down to saying

422
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,060
that number one is false because it's um

423
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,800
because we do understand sort of the

424
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
Core Concepts behind training deep

425
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,480
learning systems but then two three and

426
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,600
four are true number two because given

427
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,920
reasoning we could train these deep

428
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,220
Learning Systems to use that reasoning

429
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,560
number three because of course

430
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,899
explainability depends on your data and

431
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,160
domain

432
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,399
uh and then number four uh because that

433
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,959
is how these deep learning systems are

434
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,279
trained they are trained as an

435
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,339
end-to-end Black Box uh and so we may

436
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:33,899
not be able to understand you know the

437
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,920
internal uh reasoning behind decisions

438
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
now how did gpt4 score

439
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,740
well what if I told you it got three of

440
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,500
the four correct number two should

441
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,860
actually be false now thinking about

442
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,720
this for just a moment

443
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,060
if you really sort of understand the way

444
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,100
deep learning algorithms are trained and

445
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,680
if we think about reasoning and if for

446
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,320
example data sets contained reasoning as

447
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,720
to why certain outputs are correct or

448
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,760
incorrect compared to others

449
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,339
even if a deep Learning System were

450
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,459
trained the way it is today to produce

451
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,560
that reasoning as output even if it were

452
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,139
part of the data that doesn't change the

453
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,839
fact that that reasoning is now just

454
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,779
another output of this system

455
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,019
and so now your reasoning is another

456
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,779
output that must further be explained

457
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,120
right you sort of develop the problem

458
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
back into needing to now explain the

459
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,860
reason you came to that explanation

460
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,259
because it's just another output of your

461
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,240
deep Learning System that is trained end

462
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,160
to end as a black box

463
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,860
and you know a system that we don't have

464
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,720
a standard way of explaining output for

465
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,120
and so that answer should have been

466
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,519
false but it's true and gpt4 fell for

467
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,600
the same uh sort of uh trap I guess that

468
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,120
that every human does

469
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,060
um or a lot of humans do which is it

470
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,000
sounds very correct right it sounds like

471
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,699
if there were explanations and reasoning

472
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,140
and training data that would be able to

473
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,660
train systems to sort of respect that

474
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,020
reasoning and to be able to adhere or or

475
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,480
produce that kind of reasoning but

476
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,280
fundamentally keeping the training

477
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,620
algorithms the way they are today we

478
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,240
can't do that because then reasoning

479
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,000
just ends up being another output and so

480
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,100
I think this is really fascinating to

481
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,780
take a look behind the curtain to see

482
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,059
what some of the very fundamental

483
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,000
limitations Behind These large language

484
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,100
models are and speaking of fundamental

485
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,240
limitations

486
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,539
what about code can chat GPT replace me

487
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,720
as a developer well let's find out and

488
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,820
we're going to find out with the example

489
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,120
of the email bot that I showed you just

490
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,160
a little while ago now how is that

491
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,500
relevant you may ask well

492
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,840
as I mentioned I had to build a script

493
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,140
that could extract email pairs from all

494
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,000
of the emails I've ever sent email reply

495
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,700
Pairs and I would then feed them through

496
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,799
the openai embedding endpoint I would

497
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,480
receive embeddings store them in a

498
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,919
quote-unquote database which is really

499
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,740
just a numpy file on disk and then

500
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,840
attempt to retrieve new vector

501
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,940
embeddings and match them against old

502
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,679
emails in the future

503
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,740
now on one hand people have argued that

504
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,900
yes large language models will replace

505
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,000
developers in some fashion at least

506
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,039
entry level ones and the reason is

507
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,500
because of the following if I were to

508
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,799
for example throw the code sort of task

509
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,340
that I need into gpt4 it seems like it's

510
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,740
able to code it pretty well so for

511
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,320
example I can tell it that I would like

512
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,400
to

513
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,179
Implement a script that can take the um

514
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,520
that can take you know list of emails

515
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,500
that are that are laid out in folders in

516
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,140
a certain way and run them through the

517
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,240
open AI embedding endpoint and save them

518
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,460
to disk and what's really impressive is

519
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,900
that it's doing this based off of an

520
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,760
example of using the openai embedding

521
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,980
endpoint because it's data cutoff is

522
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,780
before that endpoint was even released

523
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,000
and so it is really impressive to be

524
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,280
fair and this sort of conclusion has led

525
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,660
a lot of people to think hey we're

526
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,520
replacing entry level developers but

527
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,760
here's the catch let's take another step

528
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,799
back let's go back to the author script

529
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,240
that I was talking about that actually

530
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,679
extracts

531
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,140
the email reply pairs in the first place

532
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,539
the problem is that we're trying to

533
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,000
extract these pairs from an Mbox file

534
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,340
I've actually exported my entire Gmail

535
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,799
to two Mbox files in total it's

536
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,440
something like 20 Gigabytes large that's

537
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,140
a big inbox file if you don't know what

538
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,640
these files are laid out like don't

539
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,740
worry I didn't until yesterday either

540
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,919
but these Mbox files are basically a

541
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
bunch of text representing all the

542
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,299
information in every single email that

543
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,480
is in your well email account

544
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,980
and

545
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,720
this information includes all the way

546
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,100
from like the subject and the body to

547
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,380
the individual tags of the email when it

548
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,960
when the email was sent you know who is

549
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,240
from the message ID all these things

550
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,820
and the thing is parsing that entire

551
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,760
file to begin with ahead of time to then

552
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,860
go and extract like a thousand emails

553
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,400
from it is insanely wasteful but by

554
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,919
default that is the solution that chat

555
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,679
GPT will want to provide you what I

556
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,299
wanted was a solution in the go

557
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,640
programming language that would lazily

558
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,580
load one by one individual emails from

559
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,980
the Mbox file put them through a channel

560
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,860
and allow multiple go routines to parse

561
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,260
these emails allowing me to make use of

562
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,880
all the resources on my computer at

563
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,160
least a lot more of them in order to

564
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,840
parse these emails and figure out which

565
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,640
ones have replies and which ones don't

566
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,620
it's a pretty complex problem because

567
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,600
you have to keep track of State you have

568
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,059
to keep track of the fact that for

569
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,679
example when you see an email you're

570
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,299
going to see the reply before you

571
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:52,740
actually see the email because they're

572
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,080
sorted chronologically so you've got to

573
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,600
store the in reply to tag of a certain

574
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
email and then match that against the

575
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,380
message ID of a future email and if you

576
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,820
don't end up seeing one then you don't

577
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,860
actually have an original email and you

578
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,440
shouldn't save the reply there is

579
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,660
complex state that needs to be managed

580
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,179
and honestly it's a pretty challenging

581
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,640
task it requires a certain level of

582
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
creativity to come up with a brand new

583
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,700
way of this of this sort of parsing that

584
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,400
gpt4 may or may not have seen on the

585
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,440
internet before sure maybe it's seen

586
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,039
individually lazy loading

587
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,320
emails from an Mbox maybe individually

588
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,179
it's seen things like understanding the

589
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,760
in reply to header but putting that all

590
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,520
together it's either I Lay It All Out

591
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,860
step by step in which case I've still

592
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,720
done the creativity and I've still done

593
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,299
the problem solving

594
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,900
or alternatively I could write the code

595
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,840
myself because chat GPT really just

596
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,960
doesn't have the capability to come up

597
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,419
with these sorts of Novel solutions to

598
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,340
novel problems

599
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,100
on its own it's just not fundamentally

600
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,900
creative enough it's still boiling down

601
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,059
to a statistical language model a

602
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,520
statistical language model that can

603
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,380
interpolate between its own internal

604
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,080
data points in a very very sophisticated

605
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,360
Manner and then a lot of times ways that

606
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,659
look really impressive but it can't

607
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,460
extrapolate outside of its own data set

608
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,020
outside of its own data distribution

609
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,620
that is the limitation with these models

610
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,760
and that's why it's not going to replace

611
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,500
developers anytime soon now I personally

612
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,000
think that these experiments have been

613
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,679
incredibly insightful to learn more

614
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,480
about how these models work and what

615
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,500
they're actually useful for and

616
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,720
hopefully you can see why I say that

617
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,919
these models aren't going to be

618
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,620
replacing me or you or really the

619
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,100
majority of people anytime soon however

620
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,659
this does bring me to another question

621
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,700
which is why did it take so long for me

622
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,100
to even cover generative Ai and chat GPT

623
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,900
and these sorts of Technologies on this

624
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,760
channel in the first place and really

625
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,679
it's because and I know this is going to

626
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,720
sound weird but I have been struggling

627
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,659
to find a need a use case to cover

628
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,520
now you're probably thinking there's so

629
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
much you can do with this there's

630
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,280
infinite possibilities why have I been

631
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,260
struggling to find a use case well it's

632
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,760
because I traditionally like to cover

633
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,580
one of two kinds of topics either like

634
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,620
to cover very core technical Concepts

635
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,720
that in and of themselves don't seem

636
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,820
that useful but could be used and sort

637
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,159
of abstracted or learned from to then

638
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,440
apply into a real application or I like

639
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,600
to cover actual applications that I

640
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,340
might not scale up myself or put in

641
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,500
production but that have the capability

642
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,620
to move into production so for example

643
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,980
a hard ID is a system that I built that

644
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,659
can recognize you based off of the way

645
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,220
your heart beats and it uses deep

646
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,020
learning and this is an actual

647
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,000
application that you know could scale up

648
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,799
and be put into production in the future

649
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,419
or you know I released a YouTube

650
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,820
tutorial on using Nvidia Cuda kernels to

651
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,440
brute force hashes similar to proof of

652
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,659
work in blockchains and in and of them

653
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,460
in and of itself the code base isn't

654
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,260
that useful but you can learn things

655
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,419
like how to launch Cuda kernels and the

656
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,940
basics of blockchain Technology

657
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,340
and so when you take a look at those two

658
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,200
sorts of things I like to cover

659
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,600
Easter realized that chat GPT and the

660
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,980
majority of things you can do with it

661
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,620
exist in this very weird Middle Ground

662
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,659
it's almost an uncanny valley of sorts

663
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,880
because on one hand there's the obvious

664
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,980
use case which is just chat with it

665
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,220
right talk to chat gbt and then sort of

666
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,380
guide it through conversation providing

667
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,940
more and more instructions as necessary

668
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,860
to achieve a certain task that's the

669
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,059
obvious one

670
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,340
now what I think delivers a real value

671
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,440
that people would really want to have is

672
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,760
just having these you know machine

673
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,320
Learning Systems integrated into an

674
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,760
application so you don't need to think

675
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,320
about it you don't need to converse with

676
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,600
this AI system it just does things for

677
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,799
you right

678
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,299
but these systems aren't really capable

679
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,220
of that yet they're not truly

680
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,260
intelligent they can't genuinely pick

681
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,120
off of little bits of context and just

682
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,740
you know do the things we want them to

683
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,980
so I can't really build real world

684
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,260
applications with it as a matter of fact

685
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,900
it's very hard to do so it's very hard

686
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,340
to think of those use cases which is why

687
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,140
you see all these cool demos but barely

688
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,539
any actual applications that people are

689
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,880
using at a very large scale to do things

690
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,340
in completely automated ways but on the

691
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,200
other hand it's also not really hard to

692
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,240
call into as a developer right pretty

693
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,159
much any developer with simple rest API

694
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,140
knowledge can call into the open AI API

695
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,700
so I'm also not really covering a core

696
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,039
technical concept so that puts me in

697
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,960
this very weird Middle Ground where it's

698
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,940
hard for me to cover anything technical

699
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,620
because it's just calling an API and

700
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,419
openai has decided not to release any

701
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,279
details about their models but on the

702
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,080
other hand it's also very difficult for

703
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,880
me to build anything because sure I

704
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,559
could show you some demos where it works

705
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,720
but if you actually tried to use these

706
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,100
applications in the real world they

707
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,260
break down so quickly that sometimes it

708
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,120
ends up being more effective just not to

709
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,220
use them or to instead take parts of

710
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,539
what you were going to do and just

711
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:51,240
converse with chat gbt directly

712
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,980
and so that is the problem that I've

713
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,960
faced so far and this brings me right

714
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,120
back to the fundamental limitations of

715
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,260
these models they are large language

716
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,600
models they're not intelligent right it

717
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,760
takes a fundamental rethinking of the

718
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,740
way we do machine learning and AI to

719
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,320
make them useful in large scale

720
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,480
applications and while there are uses

721
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,700
for today's version of this you know

722
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,679
large language modeling tech there are

723
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,440
use cases but they boil back down to

724
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,360
helping us with individual pieces of

725
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,760
larger bits of work rather than taking

726
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,700
over parts of the work entirely that's

727
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,779
that's that's that's really what it

728
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:28,200
boils down to so I know this is a topic

729
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,820
that many people have many different

730
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,740
opinions on so feel free to leave your

731
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,000
opinions down in the comments section
