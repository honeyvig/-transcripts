we live in an information age which
means data and information are the heart
of everything we do the id sector in
which we work requires a lot of data and
information which is widespread and can
be stored anywhere as a result the
question arises as how do we store this
data so that we can retrieve it quickly
for the further use so hello everyone
welcome to the simply learn youtube
channel in this session we are going to
discuss an introduction to data
structures but before we begin let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple technologies so if you are a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn so without any further
ado let's get started with the agenda
for today's session
first we look at the definition of data
structures after that we will understand
why we need data structures later we
will discuss the different types of data
structures finally we will look at the
importance of data structures hope i
made myself clear with the agenda now
let's get started with our first concept
that is what are data structures
data is an information that has been
translated into a form that is efficient
to movement or processing in computing
as it relates to trades computers and
transmission media data is an
information that has been converted into
binary digital form
the term raw data refers to the data in
its most basic digital format after
defining data let's look at what data
structure entails a data structure is a
data organization management and storage
format in computer science that allows
for efficient access and modification or
a data structure is an algebraic
structure about data that contains a
collection of data values their
relationships and their functions or
operations that can be applied to the
data
we will now understand why exactly we
need data structures now that we have
already defined what is a data structure
so let us have a look at some of the
data structure characteristics the first
one is each data structure allows data
to be stored differently following that
the data structure allows for more
efficient data search and retrieval then
specific data structures are chosen to
solve specific problems last but not the
least it enables the management of large
amounts of data such as large databases
and indexing services such as hash
tables
let us now look at some real-world
examples of data structures
first and the foremost we have the
dictionary assume that we're looking for
the word simply learn in the dictionary
and we know it begins with the letter s
so we can search for this word beginning
with the letter s and then this is an
example of array data structure
as a result this dictionary can also
function like an array data structure
following by that we have a music player
example
if you have a playlist with three songs
the second song will play after the
first and the third will play after the
second so these will be played without
any interruption because all these three
songs are linked with each other using
linked list type of data structure so
followed by linked list the next example
we have is the data structures
the stack of books analogy is a perfect
example of the real-time working of the
stack data structure subsequent to that
assume there is a line of people at a
ticket window and the person who comes
first gets the ticket
this particular movie window queue is an
example for the real real-time
implementation of queue data structure
last but not the least google maps
google map is the graph data structure
in which all the cities and states are
connected if we want to go from one
place to another there may be many ways
to do so so we can use some algorithms
to find the shortest path
as a result the google map is a perfect
example for the graph data structure
working analogy
following that we will look at some
different types of data structures in
this tutorial
so the first type is the linear data
structure
the elements in the linear data
structure are arranged subsequently one
after the other they are simple to
implement because the elements are
arranged in specific order
followed by the first type the second
type is the non-linear data structure
which we will be discussing a bit later
so in linear data structures we have
four different types the first one is
the array data structure memory elements
are arranged in a continuous order in
arrays
and arrays elements are of same type the
software program also determines the
type of elements that can be stored in
arrays so followed by arrays we have
linked list link lists are completely
similar to data structures data elements
in linked list data structure are linked
together by a series of nodes
furthermore each node contains the data
items as well as the address to the next
node
the third data structure is the stack
data structure elements in a stack data
structure are stored using lifo
principle in other words the last
element stored in the stack is remote
first in stack operations can only be
performed in one end namely the top
and the last data structure is the queue
data structure
unlike stack queue data structure
operates in the fifo principle which
states that the first element stored in
the queue is remote first in a queue
insertion and deletion are carried out
from opposite ends now we will discuss
the second type of data structures which
are the non-linear data structures
the non-linear data structure is the
second type of data structure non-linear
data structures do not have elements in
any order as opposed to the linear data
structures instead they are arranged in
hierarchical order with one element
connected to one or more others
so the first one in the non-linear data
structures is the tree data structure a
tree data structure is built using nodes
and edges each element in the tree data
structure is called as node or vertex
each vertex or node is connected to the
other nodes or other vertices using
edges
and the second one in the list is the
graph data structure a graph data
structure is completely like a tree data
structure it also has the vertices and
edges each vertex in a graph data
structure is connected using edges the
only difference between a tree and graph
is that in tree you can have n number of
vertices but in graph you will have only
two vertices
after discussing the graph data
structure we will move ahead into the
last segment of this tutorial that is
importance of data structures so the
first one data structures are widely
used in almost every aspect of computer
science both for simple and complex
computations
next data structures are used in all
areas of computer science including
artificial intelligence graphics big
data operating systems and much more
after that the data structures are an
essential component of many computer
algorithms because they allow
programmers to manage data efficiently
lastly a proper data structure of
selection can improve the efficiency of
a computer program or algorithm so with
this we have come to an end of this
session on introduction to data
structures if you have any queries
regarding any of the topics covered in
this particular tutorial then please
