hey everyone welcome to simply learns
youtube channel in this session we will
be discussing about x lookup x lookup is
a new addition to lookup functions and
it is smarter than both vlookup and
hlookup together
now before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
technologies so if you're a tech geek in
a continuous hunt for latest
technological trends then consider
getting subscribed to our youtube
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn now without further ado
let's get started with our one point
agenda that is x lookup in excel now for
that let's get started with the excel
now we are on the practical mode that is
microsoft excel now here you can see the
first chart so this particular data is
converted into a table format to avoid
confusion while you're fixing the data
so here you can see the name of the
employee employee id department salary
and date of joining and here you can see
the salary column and the bonus
percentage of each and every employee
based on their salaries
now coming to the new data table and
here on the table 2 which is an updated
table here you can find we are going to
find out the department of the employee
and the current department of employee
and the bonus percentage based on his or
her salary so why are we finding current
department again
so here you can see that we have an
intern emily who has joined in the year
2020 but recently she got promoted as a
developer so her department has been
changed from department intern to
department developer in 2021 so that's
what we're gonna find out here in the
current department using x lookup now
let's start to implement x lookup so for
that
equals to x lookup
and for lookup you can see if you need
to find out the lookup value lookup
array written array and all the other
two are
not important right now but you can use
them to get some exact matches in the
future we'll also use that in the future
for now let's try to use the first three
parameters that is lookup value lookup
array and written array so the lookup
value is the name of the employee mary
and lookup array is right here which is
this one
now we are going to select the lookup
array then comma and
we're going to look up the department so
this is the department
lookup array
and that's all we need
close the bracket and press enter okay i
think we missed out the lookup value
so the employee or the lookup value
which we required was missed so i've
added it here so that is the lookup
value the first one which is mary and
there you go
press enter and you have the department
here now let's add it to all the rows
and here you have all the rows and all
the data related to all the employees
now we will find out the current
department as you can see here you have
emily as intern which is the older data
but what if you needed the latest data
that is the developer in the year 2021
right for that you might want to to work
the x lookup formula a little bit so
let's try that
x lookup
lookup value which is the same
and comma
now where you have to look for the array
that is lookup array this one
and the return array which happens to be
this one
and next
you can find the exact match for this
one so that's all right exact match and
here comes the important part where you
have to search last to first by default
x lookup searches for first to last that
is like this in the starting place to
the last place so that's the reason why
we had emily as intern so now if we give
last to first then it retrieves the
latest data where emily will be shown as
developer now select that and now you
can close the brackets and press enter
so let's add that to all the rows there
you go now you can see emily clark peter
and james all they have got their
updated job profiles as you can see in
the original data emily is a developer
now so is clark who was originally a
tester and he got promoted to
development team in 2021 similarly peter
became a senior finance executive in
2021 and james the manager of sales now
let's try to find out the bonus for all
these employees based on their salary so
this one is quite simple
so x lookup
now the lookup value is their existing
salary
comma
and the bonus part so the lookup array
is the salary range
then here is another important point
so here you might want to find the exact
match but finding an exact match will
not help you here you might want to
declare another type of value where you
can get exact match or next smaller item
so you'll understand it why i'm
selecting that so now let's close the
bracket and enter
so
so now we have the bonus values now
let's add the bonus value to all the
factors all the rows i mean so you can
see we have different variety of
salaries that is 38 000
2239 etc but here in the ranges we have
provided 10 20 30 40 and 50. so what if
the value is between 30 and 20 that's
when you want the
less number right that's when you want
the number which is equal to 30 or less
than 30 which happens to be 15 percent
so that's how it has worked here that is
0.15 bonus to the actual salary so
that's how you use x lookup in excel if
you have any queries regarding any of
the topics covered in this session or if
you need the data set that we have used
in this particular session then please
