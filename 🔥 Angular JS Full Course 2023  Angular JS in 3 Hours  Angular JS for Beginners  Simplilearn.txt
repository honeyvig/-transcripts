foreign
and welcome to Simply learns YouTube
channel
today we will be taking you through the
angular full course
angular is a popular front-end web
application framework developed by
Google it allows developer to build
Dynamic responsive and efficient web
applications easily the framework
utilizes typescript a superset of
JavaScript and offers a range of
features and tool to make the
development process smoother and more
efficient
this full course on angular is designed
to provide a comprehensive understanding
of the framework and its features
starting from the basic to Progressive
to Advanced topics the course covers
various topics including components
modules Services routing and forms of
angular and by the end of this course
you will learn how to create a project
using angular from scratch
throughout the course you will learn how
to build real world applications using
angular gaining hands-on experience with
the framework and its Associated tools
by the end of this course you will have
the skills and knowledge required to
build complex scalable and responsive
web applications using angular before we
begin let me tell you that we have
regular updates on multiple
technological videos so if you are a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for the
latest technological Trends then

YouTube channel and press the Bell icon
to never miss any update from Simply
learn towards the end of this full
course you will also cover interview
questions on angular to make you
interview ready and you can land a great
job
but before that if you want to become a
software developer consider the course
on full stack web developer mean stack
by simply learn and master those
necessary skills you can also consider
the postgraduate program by Caltech in
full stack web development check out the
link and you will also call us on the
numbers that are given below and learn
more about the program so without
further delay let's get started let's go
through the agenda for this full course
so first we will see what is angularjs
moving ahead we'll see angular
components angular dependency injection
angular forms angular services and then
we'll see what is angular bootstrap how
to use it after that we'll see angular
routing then we'll create a project
using angular which is angular to do app
after that we'll see the main
differences between angular versus
react.js and then in last we'll see
angular interview questions and answers
so let's get started in this session
we're going to cover the topic of what
is angular
sure all of you use mobile and web
applications pay it from social media to
healthcare e-commerce and net banking
these apps are used by billions of
people across the globe now the main
reason we use these apps is that they
offer seamless user experience and
interface but how would it developed
provide such reliability one of the
Frameworks that is widely used to build
such robust apps is angular so let's
dive into the session now so here is a
list of topics that we're going to be
covering first up we'll see why angular
was introduced then what is angular
features of angular
angular architecture advantages and
limitations of angular
the learning curve of angular and
finally we look at some of the companies
that deploy angular so without further
delay let's begin
why angular now JavaScript is the most
commonly used client-side scripting
language it is written into HTML
documents enabling interactions with web
pages in many unique ways
so as a relatively easy to learn
language with almost pervasive support
it is exceptionally well suited to
develop modern applications but the
question arises
is Javascript ideal for developing
single page applications that require
modularity testability and other
features perhaps not however we have a
variety of Frameworks and libraries
designed to help us with such thing with
respect to front-end development angular
and JavaScript together bring in
structure and consistency to your web
applications and also provide
scalability and maintainability
and angular is specifically developed
for single page applications so now the
question arises what exactly is angular
angle angular is
an oak JavaScript framework written
completely in typescript
now it was primarily aimed to develop
single page applications and is
maintained by Google
angular as a framework provides a few
advantages while also providing a
standard structure for Developers
designed for web desktop and mobile
platforms
have a doubt here as to what exactly
single page applications are that help
you with that now these single page
applications are basically applications
that get loaded just once so the main pH
gets loaded onto your browser so any
further interactions does not lead to
loading of subsequent Pages anything
that has to be done further is just an
addition to the already loaded page
these single page applications are
primarily developed using angular moving
ahead let's look at the features of
angular
we have four features that we're going
to be discussing we have the document
object model typescript data binding and
testing now let's look at them one by
one now the document object model treats
an XML or an HTML document as a tree
structure now here every node in the
tree structure defines an object
representing a part of your document
angular uses the regular Dom now let's
suppose you have 10 updates
to MLP
every time you make a change the
corresponding Dom or the tree structure
needs to be updated
angular updates the entire tree
structure of HTML tags moving on to our
next feature
we have typescript
now typescript defines a set of types to
JavaScript which helps you write
JavaScript that is easier to understand
now all the typescript code compiles
down to basic JavaScript that can run
smoothly on any platform now typescript
is not mandatory for developing an
angular application but it is highly
recommended the main reason is highly
recommended is that it offers better
syntactic structure while making the
code base easier to understand and
maintain now typescript can be installed
as an npm package now to do that you
just have to run the command npm install
hyphen G type script on your command
prompt next up is data binding now data
binding is a process that allows you to
manage
web page elements using the web browser
now it mainly employs Dynamic HTML and
does not require complex scripting or
programming
it is used in web pages that include
interactive components like calculators
tutorials Games Etc now incremental
display of a web page makes data binding
extremely convenient when Pages contain
a large amount of data when it comes to
angular it uses two-way data binding so
any changes made in the UI element is
reflected in the corresponding model
state
and conversely any changes made in the
model state are reflected onto the UI
State this allows the framework to
connect to Tom to the model data via the
controller the last feature we're
discussing is testing
angular uses Jasmine to run its various
tests the Jasmine framework allows
various functionalities to write
different kinds of test cases karma is a
task runner for the tests that use a
configuration file to set the startup
reporters and testing framework so with
that we've covered the features of
angular
so let's go ahead and understand
the architecture of angular
angular is a full-fledged MVC framework
it provides a strong opinion on how the
application should be structured and
offers bi-directional data flow and
updates the real Dom MEC short for model
view controller is an architectural
pattern that separates the application
layer into model view and controller the
model here relates to all the data
related logic view on the other hand is
used for UI logic of the application
and controller is the brain of the setup
now it is an interface between the model
and view
moving on let's look at the advantages
of angular
first up we have custom components
angular allows you to build your own
components that can pack functionality
along with rendering logic into reusable
pieces
data binding as discussed angular allows
you to effortlessly move your data from
your JavaScript code to the view and
react to user events without having to
write any code yourself
dependency injection angular allows you
to write modular services and have them
injected wherever they are needed this
greatly improves the testability and
reusability of the same don't worry if
you can't wrap your head around these
topics we're going to discuss them
further in the coming videos
next Advantage is testing angular has
been built from the ground up with
testability in mind you can literally
test every part of your application
comprehensive angular is a full-fledged
framework and provides out of the box
solutions for Server communication
routing and more
lastly we have excellent browser
compatibility angular is cross-platform
and browser compatible an angular
application can typically run on all
browsers beat Chrome Firefox Safari and
platforms like Windows Mac OS and Linux
now many versions of angular have been
released ever since its Inception all of
these versions have added to the
efficient working of the framework now
here are the different versions released
first up goes angular 1. it was built on
JavaScript and completely based on
controllers next release was angular 2.
now this Incorporated the component
based approach wherein the entire UI was
divided into several components and
lastly integrated to give the final
logic next was angular 4 it included
draft adaptation of angular CLI or
command line interface 1.0 was
introduced however not deployed in this
release the angular CLI was optimized
and commands like NG update and NG add
were added
the angular 7 release prompts were
introduced which provided tips in CLI
about the functions being used
in angular 8 IB renderer and bazel were
introduced
and finally the most recent release was
angular 9. now this came with the better
framework and angular material now this
completely switched to the IV renderer
as a default compiler now that we've
learned about the pros of using angular
let's look at some of the limitations of
angular
last up is a steep learning curve now
since angular is a complete full-fledged
framework it becomes difficult for
Learners to begin with you need to be
acquainted with simple topics and then
move on to more advanced topics to
become proficient in this language
stuff is limited SEO auctions now
angular offers limited SEO options and
poor accessibility to search engine
Crawlers
it were both and complex now a common
issue faced by the angular Community is
the verbosity of the framework it also
poses to be complex compared to other
front-end tools
the lastly migration now one of the
drawbacks of angular is poor migration
now it becomes difficult to Port Legacy
code to angular style architecture
also with each new release it is painful
to upgrade and a lot of them are not
Backward Compatible
next up let's look at the angular
learning curve
now if you wish to learn angular you
need to be acquainted with basic topics
in angular some of them are directors
modules decorators components Services
dependency injection pipes and templates
now once you've mastered your Basics you
will want to go and understand more
advanced topics such as change detection
zones aot compilation and rx.js however
the learning curve of angular is
clear-cut in the beginning it could be a
little intimidating but once you start
using the tool becomes way more easier
to comprehend and understand what is
going on
and lastly let's look at some of the
companies that use angular today
many top tier companies like Nike Forbes
Google HBO Sony upwork among others
readily deploy angular so moving on
let's look at the prerequisites for
angular
first up we have node.js angular uses
node.js as its base for a large part of
its built environment
so as a result to get started with
angular you will need to have node.js
installed on your environment so head to
their official website and download the
latest release for your corresponding
operating system
next up is the angular CLI now this
command line interface is a tool that
makes it easier to bootstrap and develop
your angular applications now to install
the latest version run the command npm
install hyphen G at angular front slash
CLI you got to run this command on your
command prompt and finally to confirm
installation check for its version
now the next thing that you will need is
an IDE or a text editor to type your
code now there are several Ides that you
can choose from but in this series we've
used vs code throughout so it is
available on all platforms so go ahead
and download it if you haven't already
now moving on to the final part is the
demo now that you have a basic
understanding of angular and its
prerequisites I think you're ready to
create your first angular application so
let's head to our vs code and begin here
I've created a folder called angular on
my desktop and opened it on my visual
studio code so to create your app you
need to open the terminal just go here
and
select new terminal
and now type in the command Ng
new
and provide the name for your app so I'm
just gonna say hello world
so now this is going to create
to see yes
so basically what happens is that when
you run the command it will
automatically generate a skeleton
application under the folder that is
Hello World in our case and it includes
a bunch of files and installs all the
necessary dependencies for the angular
application
so this could take a while
so once you've created your application
to run it first change the directory so
let's say CD
hello world
and now use the command NG so
now once it's compiled you need to go to
your browser and type in localhost 4200
[Music]
and once you do that
you can see your UI
you can see that the application has
been loaded onto your browser and it
says hello world app is running
so this is how you create your
application
so let's go back to our vs code now as
you can see here
there are many files and folders that
are created right so let's look at a few
of them of course we can't explain
everything but I'll brush through a few
of them
so the first mean component is basically
the root component now the root
component here is the index.html so here
if you open the file and see
it's a very small crisp code right but
the most important thing in the file is
this app Root element
so what this does is it's basically the
marker for loading your application code
so this is extremely important so the
next important file is the main.ts now
this is the part of the bootstrapping
piece all right so the index.html file
is responsible for deciding which files
are to be loaded correct the main.ts
file on the other hand identifies which
angular module is to be loaded when the
application starts so this is just a
brief explanation as to what they are
doing
next we have the app folder now here we
have the app dot module.ts file now this
application module file can be thought
of as a core configuration of your
application
so here's where the source code starts
from and moving on we have the
app.component.ts these are all
typescript files hence the extension TS
now this file basically is the root
component of your application and then
we have the HTML file for the same which
defines the appearance of what you can
see on your browser so let me just
change the message that is being
displayed
so I'll say hey
welcome to this
angular
tutorial so let's save this and when we
go back to our browser
we can see the message hey welcome to
this angular tutorial being displayed
so like this we can make a simple change
and then it gets rendered onto your
browser so this was just a brief
explanation of what happens in the
background of your application
first we'll get acquainted to what
exactly angular components are then I'll
help you create an angular component by
showing a quick demo and lastly we'll
learn about component decorator metadata
but before we begin make sure to
subscribe to our Channel if you love
watching new and interesting technology
videos also hit the Bell icon to never
miss an update so what exactly are
angular components
now I'm sure everybody uses web
applications and one of the most widely
used applications is Gmail correct now
to help you understand what components
are consider them as Lego blocks now
they basically are combined together to
form the final application so in this
case here we have the logo component
then you have a sign in component an
image component and then a create
account component now all of these
components generally don't affect the
working of each other but however when
embedded they Define the UI of your
application
so I hope you understood what components
are so to go ahead let's discuss some of
its common features now firstly they are
the building blocks of an application
generally you have a root component
which is basically the app component and
then it branches out into other
components creating a hierarchy
and these components are a subset of
directives now don't worry about what
deductives are because we'll cover them
later on in the series but to give you
an idea there are three types of
directives you have the structural
directives the attribute directives and
the component directives
only one component can be instantiated
per element in a template now components
are typically custom HTML elements and
each of these elements can instantiate
only one component
now don't worry you'll understand this
better when I show you the demo
nextly a typescript class is used to
create a component now this class is
then decorated with the at component
decorator Now The Decorator accepts a
metadata object that gives information
about the component now a component must
belong to the NG module in order for it
to be usable by another component or
application
and finally components control their
runtime Behavior by implementing life
cycle hooks so this was just a brief
introduction to what annular components
are
now you will only be able to understand
the working of components when I show it
to you practically so let's head over to
our Visual Studio code now here back in
my vs code I've created a folder called
angular demo within which I've created
an angular application called demo
components once executed the browser
looks something like this so if you
haven't watched a previous video on
getting started with angular that is
angular hello world I highly suggest you
go through that video first it helps you
create your first angular application so
um now let's go ahead and create our
first component now the command used to
create our component is NG GC and your
component name once executed it creates
four different files now let's just see
how this works on RVs code now what you
can do is head to your terminal and type
in the command Ng
g c
and provide a name for your component
for example I'm gonna just call my
component text component all right
so what it does is that it creates four
different files you can see you have
four different files that have been
created and finally it updates the file
that is app.module.ts indicating that
this new component has been created so
here in your Source folder within which
is an app folder and again here you can
see that your four different files have
been created first is the HTML file
wherein you can Define all the code that
you want for your component next you
have the CSS file for your styling then
you have the dot TS file which includes
the component decorator and finally you
have spec.ts which is basically a unit
test file all right and then in your
app.module.ts you can observe that the
company that you've created that is text
component has been imported that is what
the message conveys here all right now
let's go back to our
app.component.html now this basically
has all the corefair applications so so
let me just get rid of it
and I'm just gonna display a basic
heading saying
hello
welcome all right so let me save it and
if you go ahead and look at your browser
hello welcome message is displayed now
let's go back to our
component.html file and here let me
provide a message
[Music]
let me say h
3
and let me display a message saying
welcome to this tutorial
on angular components all right now in
your text component dot TS file which is
your typescript file the selector
mentioned here is app hyphen text
component now go ahead and copy this
and in your final
component.html go ahead and create your
custom HTML tag with the selector that
you just copied now this indicates that
the component that you just created that
is the text component is being
Incorporated in the final render
so what happens is that whatever is
defined in the component.html file is
also being rendered in your final output
so when I save this let's go ahead and
check our browser you can see that the
message welcome to this tutorial on
angular components is displayed so this
was a simple creation of a component now
for this let's give it some styling so
here go to your dot CSS file and provide
some styling see for example here I just
say
text line
and let me say Center and also in my
app.component.cs I'm going to give the
same thing I'll see each one
text align is Center
all right so let me save this
and there we go
now we can also create multiple
components and Define the tags in the
app component now the components are
executed sequentially so now let's
create another component just to give
you a brief insight into it let's say NG
GC image component
now here I'm going to be adding the
simply learn logo so I'll show you how
that works
now you can see that a new component has
been created with four files again so in
my assets folder here I've added the
logo so what I can do is back in my HTML
file I can go ahead and create an image
tag so first let me just display another
message here
just to avoid any confusion and let me
say this is the image component
and then let me say
image
Source equals so the source is basically
assets
[Music]
slash logo
dot PNG
and class
equals
Center
[Music]
all right so you can also head to your
CSS file and provide any sort of styling
that you need so let me just say
text
align
to be Center
and then let's create
a styling for the image
and here I mentioned the code for the
image so let's save this I'm from the
dot CS file let's copy the selector
and create a custom HTML tag in our
final component.html file
so there we go let's save this and check
the output
and there we go
first the hello welcome message is
displayed next you have the message
displayed from the first component and
then you have the second component so
this is how you can create your own
components and don't forget to
incorporate these selectors into your
final HTML file so moving on to our next
topic component decorator metadata now
as mentioned earlier the at component
decorator accepts a metadata object that
provides information about the component
correct here is a list of properties of
the metadata object first up is the
selector now basically the selector is a
CSS selector that identifies this
particular component in a template now
this corresponds to the HTML tag that is
included in the parent component you can
create your own HTML tag however the
same has to be included in the parent
component so to help you understand that
better let's head back to our vs code
and say for example in our text
component
here
the selector says text component correct
for the time being let's change it to
say n component
all right now when you save it and look
at the browser the message is not
displayed so what we can do is you can
copy this
selector and then include this
here
and now you can see that the same
component has been rendered onto your
output
all right so the selector plays a
crucial role in that
next up we have the template now a
template is an inline defined template
for the view now the template can be
used to provide some particular markup
the markup could typically include some
headings or paragraphs that are
displayed on the UI
next up we have template URL now it is
the URL for the external file containing
the template for The View so here you
can see
this is basically the external file that
contains the template for the view next
up you have Styles now these are also
inline defined styles that can be
applied to the components view so any
code that you provide in the dot CSS
file can also be included here next you
have the style URLs now this is a list
of URLs to your style sheets that are
applied on your components View
next up you have providers now this is
again an array where certain Services
can be registered for your component
lastly we have animations as the name
suggests these are animations that can
be listed for your components
first to understand what exactly
dependency injection is
then we'll understand the demerit or the
drawback of not using dependency
injection
then we'll understand dependency
injection as a design pattern and
finally I'll help you understand the
entire concept with the help of a demo
so let's begin
what exactly is dependency injection so
let's consider this I'm sure you are
aware that angular uses the concept of
components the entire UI of the
application is divided into several
components now what have all of these
components perform similar tasks be it
accessing the database rendering images
Etc now instead of writing the same
piece of code for every component you
could write the code once and then
perhaps inject the same code into every
component
now this is supported by dependency
injection
now to give you a better example
consider two classes A and B now let's
assume that a uses the objects of Class
B and normally in object oriented
programming an instance of Class B is
created so that a can access its objects
with using dependency injection we move
the creation and binding of dependent
objects outside of the class that depend
on them so dependency injection or di
keeps the core more flexible testable
and mutable also classes can inherit
external logic without having to create
on its own and lastly GI benefits
directives pipes and components
next up let's have a look at the
drawback of not using dependency
injection
now let's consider Class Postal details
that is dependent on the number and the
address class
in the postal details class the
Constructor creates copies of the number
and address
so when you instantiate a new postal
details class the Constructor
instantiates a unique number and address
now although this looks simple there's a
problem with this code let's assume that
the number and address class
Constructors now accept parameters when
we change the numbers class the postal
details class gets broken now to
overcome this what we need to do is we
need to pass parameter to the number
Constructor so this applies to address
as well the first drawback of using this
traditional method is that the code is
not very flexible anytime the
dependencies change the postal details
class needs to be changed as well
and the second drawback is that the code
is not suitable for testing
once you instantiate the new postal
details class you get the same number
and address even if you change the
number and address classes every time
what if these classes are in turn
dependent on other classes
then it's going to be a chain reaction
so to overcome this we make use of
dependency injection
now let's look at di as a pattern
dependency injection as you all know is
a coding pattern where a class receives
its dependencies from an external Source
rather than creating them on its own so
here in the above example we have moved
the definition of dependencies from
inside the Constructor to the
constructor's parameters so the postal
details class doesn't create the
dependencies anymore
it just consumes them so the postal
dependencies class doesn't create the
dependencies anymore
so with that we overcome the drawbacks
of not using Di
so now that you know what exactly
dependency injection is and how vital it
is let's look at a simple demonstration
to understand the concept better now
services classes modules components all
of these are benefactors of dependency
injection so in the demo I'm going to be
showing how dependency injection can be
used with the help of services and
injecting these Services into classes so
the main thought behind this is normally
components are used to ensure just a
good user experience these components do
not generally execute tasks so to
execute these tasks we make use of
services so a component can delegate
tasks like fetching data from the server
any network related issues ETC to a
particular service and these Services
can be made available to components with
the same thought what I'm going to be
doing is I'll be creating a service that
performs a task of displaying an
employee list later we're going to
inject the service into the class using
dependency injection
so let's head to our Visual Studio code
for the demonstration
all right so as discussed I'll have to
first create a component that displays a
button for the employee and then I have
to create a service class and inject it
into my component now this service holds
the employee details such as name
employee ID email ID
Etc so first let's go ahead and create a
component
so here let me just type
n g g c and the name of the component
I'm providing is amp info

all right so as you can as you can hear
in my
apparent with four different files all
right so the next thing we have to do is
we have to create a service so to create
that we make use of the command n g g s
you can either give s or service and the
service name I'm providing is records so
let me just say records here
all right here you can see two files are
created there is a spect.ts file and the
dot TS file all right so now the service
contains all the employee data that
needs to be displayed right so let's go
ahead and write the data so first we're
going to make use of three arrays I'm
going to be displaying employee records
for three employees so I'll have to
create three arrays and provide certain
information so let's go ahead and do
that
all right so the array I'm creating is
called info one for the first employee
and I'm going to be passing
information like name employee ID and
the email ID so the arrays of type
string
and within which let me just mention the
details I'm giving random information
I'm just saying Adam Taylor
and some random
employee ID
and let's say 80 at abc.net
all right so I'm going to be creating
three records so I'll just copy the same
thing and paste with the rest too
let's just change here
provide a different name here
and same for the last one
and let me change the name of the array
as well
all right so with the agenda to retrieve
this data in our component we make use
of the method for the same right so this
method Returns the employee data
so let's go ahead and create this method
I'm going to call it get info
and then just say string
and then this will just return
this dot info one
all right I'm gonna be calling it get
info one for better understanding
same for the rest too as well
I'm just gonna return different arrays
here
order and lastly info three all right
now in order to retrieve this
information in our component we need
three more arrays right three more
arrays I will receive this data let's go
back to our component dot TS file here
and then type in the following code
so I've created three arrays again or
info received one two and three
now what we need to do is we have to
accept the information that is being
sent from the service correct now as I
mentioned services are implemented with
the help of dependency injection so what
we need to do is we'll have to first
import the service into the component.ts
file the key reason behind doing this is
that when angular creates this component
and instance of the service class is
also made to perform the necessary tasks
correct so let's go ahead and just
import it here
so I'll say import
[Music]
s
services
I'm sorry service
from
and let's say records.service
all right and what we have to do next is
that we must also declare this instance
that is being created in the provider's
array of the component
all right so
let's just say providers
and then say records
service
all right now we've created the instance
of this class right however to access
this instance an object is also created
so this object will in turn access the
methods and variables of the service
class so for that we have to create
another object so let's do that here in
our Constructor method let's say
Constructor
private
and the object I'm creating is called
our service you can give a name of your
choice and then I'm gonna just say
records service
all right now this object will help me
retrieve data from the service so let's
go ahead and use this in order to get
the employee details our ads have
created three different methods here get
info from service class 2 1 and 3 and
these methods will retrieve the data and
add it to our array here that is info
received all right and lastly
we'll have to create an unordered list
in our HTML file here we haven't added
anything so let me get rid of this
so now I have to create three different
buttons for three different employees
and when the user clicks on the button
the data is retrieved from the service
and then displayed on the UI right
so as you can see I've created buttons
for three different employees
and then I've made use of a bootstrap
class called list group info and then
I've
interpolated info which displays the
contents
of the info variable all right now in
order to call the methods in the dot TS
file we have to bind them with the
button so since it is bound with the
click event every time you click on the
button the information is displayed
so now the last thing we have to do is
we'll have to create a custom HTML tag
for the component and then add it to the
main component
so let's just do that
let me copy this here
and then in my app component.html let me
get rid of this
and then let me just create this
I've just created the custom HTML tag
for my component
and now just to beautify the code I'll
write a heading
and let's say employee
details
and then I'll also add the simply learn
logo
say image source
[Music]
I've I've added the image here so let me
just say logo
dot PNG
I've also added some styling to it all
right so now let me just save this and
have a look at the browser
so here we go we have the logo here and
then employee details heading and then
we have three different buttons created
that is employee one two and three and
when I click on it
the information of the employee is
displayed the name the ID and their
email address
so yeah so this is how you can make use
of dependency injection and inject a
service class into a component
dependency injection plays a crucial
role in angular
we'll understand what angular forms are
then we look at the different types of
form building supported by angular next
up we'll get acquainted with features
like form control and group control
and we learn all of this with the help
of a simple demo
so without further Ado let's begin
so what exactly are angular forms
now I'm sure every application that you
use comes with certain amount of form
filling correct be it your login
credentials or your sign up forms or any
sort of registration forms Etc so forms
are an integral part of a web
application you need forms to update
your profile or to enter sensitive
information or also to perform any sort
of data related tasks so now let's look
at the different types of form building
supported by angular
first up angular supports two types of
form building
first you have the template driven
approach and second you have the
reactive approach
now let's look at them one by one so
talking about template driven approach
in this method the conventional form tag
is used to create forms so angular
automatically interprets and creates a
form object with the help of the
directors
Now controls can be added to the form
using the NG model tag now multiple
controls can be grouped using the NG
control group module so it basically
uses several module classes to provide
controls now if you don't get this don't
worry you'll understand better when I am
showing you the demo
next up is Json values so form value can
be generated using the form.value object
form data is exported as Json values
when the submit method is called
lastly basic HTML validations can be
used to validate the form fields in the
case of custom validations directives
can be used so arguably this method is
the simplest way to create an angular
form
so moving on to the active approach now
this approach is the programming
Paradigm revolving around data flows and
propagation of change
now with reactive forms the component
directly manages the data flows between
the form controls and the data models
now reactive forms are code driven
unlike template driven approach
reactive forms eliminate the
anti-packtern of updating the data model
via two-way data binding so it does not
use two-way data binding
and typically a reactive form control
creation is synchronous and can be unit
tested with synchronous programming
techniques
so now let's go ahead and look at form
control and form group
so consider a typical form consisting of
fields like name age and location
now a form control is basically a class
that enables validation of these fields
for each input field an instance of this
class is created now these instances
help check the values of the field and
see if they're either touched untouched
dirty pristine valid invalid and so on
so this allows you to check every field
for the value it makes it easier to
understand which Fields value is invalid
or which field has not been entered
Etc
now moving on to form group
so a form group class represents a group
of controls a form can have multiple
group controls the form group returns
true if all the controls are valid and
provides validation errors if there are
any so I hope this was clear
so moving ahead let's look at the demo
to explain all of these features I'm
sure it will become extremely clear once
you look at the demo so for that let's
head to our vs code
so back in my vs code
I've created a component called form
component
and I've also included the simply learn
logo just to purify the appearance so
once you execute the code
this is what you're going to see on your
browser so you just have the logo at the
moment
the first thing we need to do is we'll
have to import the forms module all
right so oh uh but before we begin let
me tell you what the use case is so
we're going to be creating a user
registration form which is going to
include four fields that is the first
name and last name email ID and the
password all right so now let me show
you how to import the forms module so in
your main
app.module.ts file you will have to
import forms module from angular forms
all right and then in your Imports
you'll have to just call it here
all right so this is just a simple step
and now once you're done with that let's
go ahead and start our form creation
so here in my component.html let's
enclose the entire form within a div tag
so here let me say div
class
as a container
within which let me just have one
heading
which says user registration
all right and now let's go ahead and
create our form
so first let me just say form
now I'm going to create a div class for
every field so say div
class
equals form group
I'll explain it to you a little later
[Music]
now first let's create a label
so label tag
for
basically it's the first name
so let me just say first name
and the tag will basically have
first name again
all right and let me just break the line
next we have the field so let's say
input
type is text
name is
first name
and we have a class which is
the form control class
all right
so this we have to do for all the other
fields so let me just copy this
and
paste it like four times
I'll also add the tag 3 for spacing
let's do that here
and finally we'll have the button
so let's just add that here
with a type submit
and let's just say submit on the button
so now let's go ahead and change these
values here
so here let me just change it to last
name
here as well
and here as well
and in this case it is going to be email
so let me just change it here
[Music]
and finally we have passwords so
let's add that here
all right so let's save this and just
have a look at our browser
so there we go we have our uh user
registration form ready but I would like
to uh align it to the center so let me
just do that
so here in my CSS file
I'm just going to uh align all the div
tags in the center and the label tag to
the left so let me save this and look at
the browser now
and there we go we have our registration
form what's a logo so this is how you
create a simple form
now we'll have to add a directive called
NG model now this directive when added
into the input tag will provide form
controls to every input field
all right so here let's just go ahead
and say NG model
that is it
so let me just copy this and paste it
for every other field
all right let me save this and back in
my browser
let me inspect
and here you can see different types of
classes like NG untouched NG pristine NG
valid are added right so this indicates
that angular has recognized the form Tab
and it has added these classes to the
form as well as all the fields
so this is achieved when you add the NG
model directive in your input tag now
back in my vs code now every form has an
output property attached to it called NG
submit all right so this property can be
bound within a method that method called
the submit method
so once submitted this method is called
right so once we click on the submit
button this method has to be called so
to include that
we'll have to just say
form
NG submit
equals
submit
[Music]
all right so now we have to define the
submit method
in our component.ts file so here let me
just go to our component.ts file and let
me
just get rid of unnecessary code here
and let's define a function
or submit
and then here let me just
console log
form submitted
all right so let me just get rid of this
as well it's unnecessary here
let's save this so what it means is that
every time you click on the submit
button
this method is called all right so let's
just have a look at the browser so first
let's go to our console
and when I click on submit it says form
submitted
all right so the next crucial step is to
generate JavaScript representation now
we'll have to make use of another
directive called NG form that is
assigned to a template variable
okay so this JavaScript representation
helps with validating all the fields so
I'll help you understand that better
so back in our HTML file
let's just create a variable first
let's call it login
all right and say Ng
form
okay now the mg form object includes the
JavaScript representation so now while
you're calling the submit method you're
going to pass login as a parameter
so let's just say login here
and in my ts file again let's just say
login
and along with it
I won't login to be displayed so
I say login again
so now let's save this and if you have a
look at the browser let's click on
submit
and now here you can see the JavaScript
representation So within form
I can
check for email
or say first name and here for this
field first name you can see different
properties attached you can see invalid
is it invalid or is it untouched
which is true or are there any errors so
this basically gives you all information
about the particular field
so we can make use of this feature to
validate the information so we're going
to learn about that in our next segment
moving on to form validation one way to
ensure that incorrect fields are not
submitted is by disabling the submit
button
correct now apart from this you can also
specify certain properties in your input
tag for the corresponding input field
now
um let's say that the fields that
now let's say that the fields can't be
empty and the form only accepts names
with the minimum length of 2 and the
maximum length of 7. all right so here
in my input tag I just mentioned a
required meaning this field cannot be
empty
and Min length
to 2
and
max length
to say 7.
all right
so to check this
let's go to our browser
and here
let me submit the form without filling
the first name
and evidently there has to be an error
so when I submit it
and I look here what's in forms and here
controls
and my first name you can see that an
error is shown here it says required
equals true that means that there is one
error now you can make use of these form
control objects you can leverage form
control objects to ensure field
validation and display a message
whenever an error occurs
right so to do that you need to access
these objects like errors or invalid or
touched all of these properties or
objects need to be
accessed for that we'll have to create a
template variable
and then this variable is assigned to
this object so back in our vs code
let's create
a variable let me call it
name
and let's say NG model
all right here the variable name
receives the control object
so here back in my browser when I submit
again without the first name
you can see that the invalid property is
set to True correct so this helps us use
this property to alert the user with the
help of a simple if logic so back in my
vs code let me create
another div tag
within which I mentioned NG if
in which I'm going to use a simple if
logic so let's say n g s
name which is our template variable name
dot touched
and name dot invalid
is true
right then I'm going to alert
so I'm gonna
make use of an alert
here let's say
alert
Danger
all right
so in my CSS file I'll have to mention
the simple styling for alert
so here let me just say
so we're gonna have the background color
red
for danger right and here I'm gonna
display the message
invalid in bold
so now let's go back to our browser and
check it
so let me proceed without entering the
last name it says invalid here so this
was a simple demonstration to show you
form validation
of course you can modify the code
depending on your requirement say
suppose the length of the first name is
too short then you can alert the user
with a different message or uh suppose
they have missed out on filling a form
field then you can again alert the user
so you can basically make use of the
nested if condition right now just to
and help you understand that better let
me just show it to you
now back in my HTML file
instead of invalid let me have another
tag a paragraph tag
within which I make use of NG if again
now ngf
name dot errors
[Music]
dot required
is true
then I display the message first
name required
all right
and if
the length of the first name is
not 2.
now if the length of the first name is
less than 2 then I'm going to display
another message so let me just say
name dot errors
dot Min length
if this is true then I'm going to say
sorry
short
first name
all right so let's save this and have a
look at the browser
when I proceed without providing the
name it says first name required but
when I type in one character it says
sorry short first name but if I type in
another character it accepts so I hope
this made you understand how form
validation works
so this was just a simple demonstration
again now I highly recommend you explore
these properties and play around with
these objects uh trust me it's really
fun so I hope this tutorial helped you
out I'm sure you all know that an
angular app is divided into several
components for example you have the logo
component you have the sign in component
and image component and say a create
account component
now these components are Standalone and
each of them represents a part of the
user interface
now imagine if all of these components
performed common tasks for example
access in the database or rendering
images on The View
tasks like those now instead of having
to write the code for every component
you can just make use of angular
services
now the service can be written once and
then injected into all of these
components
now a service could be a function it
could be a variable or a feature that an
application needs
so the main use of a service is to write
code once and avoid rewriting of it now
the same code can be injected into
several components that make use of this
particular service
but what are angular services
so normally components are used to
ensure a good user experience now that
is the extent of it components make sure
that whatever is being rendered onto the
screen is right and pristine
but in order to execute tasks we make
use of services and this approach is
ideal
so a component can basically delegate
tasks like fetching data from the server
validating user input or logging
directly to the console to a particular
service
and these tasks can be made available to
any component in the app
so now let's talk about a few features
of angular services
now typically an angular service is
simply a typescript class with an at
injectable decorator
this decorator tells angular that the
class is a service and can be injected
into components that need that service
now they can be used to share the same
piece of code they can also inject other
services as dependencies
now these Services hold valuable
business logic and can also be used to
interact with the back end now for
example if you want to make Ajax calls
you can have methods to those calls in a
service and then use it as a dependency
in files
and as mentioned earlier it can be used
to share data among several components
in angular services are Singleton
meaning that only a single instance of a
service gets created and the same
instance is used by each and every
building block in the application and
finally a service can be registered as a
part of a module or it can be registered
as a part of the component now to
register it as a part of the component
you'll have to specify it in the
provider's array of the module I'm sure
you'll understand the concept of
services better if we look at a simple
demo so in the next section we're going
to look at a demo but before that let me
tell you the use case
so basically in the demo what we'll do
is we'll create an employee details list
say for example you will have employee
information like name employee ID and
their email ID we'll create a database
of say three employees
and on the browser when you click on the
employee button it displays the
information about that particular
employee
and at the end we can also add
information to the employees details so
without delay let's head to our vs code
and start learning angular Services
Hands-On so here first I've created a
folder called demo underscore angular
which in which I've created a file
called hello world so this was
previously used for a tutorial so the
name is just hello world so don't get
confused
however when you look at the browser
I've written an initial code here which
is angular services and I have the
simply learn logo so back in my browser
this is what the UI looks like
so uh to uh
so to understand the concept of angular
Services first let's go ahead and create
a component
so here I am going to say NG g c
e info
I'm creating a component for employee
information
so as you can see
inside my app file we have the e-info
component which has these four files so
if you're wondering what exactly
components are and how this is working
then I highly suggest you watch our
components video first
so now let's go ahead and create a
service
so I'm just typing in the command NG G
service
here G stands for Generate and we're
generating a service and the name of the
service that I'm providing is data
so now it creates a service
which is going to be a DOT TS file
so you can observe that dot service is
appended this indicates that it is a
service all right
as mentioned earlier we have to display
the employee details correct so for that
in my component.ts file I'm going to
create an array the displace the
employee information in our case I'm
creating uh three different employee
records so for that I'll have three
different arrays so let me just call the
arrays info
received
one indicating this is the information
of first employee and this is going to
be of type string
and I'll just initialize it to null
for now
all right and I'm going to create
two other
arrays
and let me just
change
the name of that is all right
so now uh to retrieve the information
I'll have to create a method again I'm
creating three methods for uh the three
different employee records
so I'm gonna call the array get info
[Music]
from service one indicating it's again
for employee one
and
I'm just going to leave it as it is for
now I'll tell you how the information is
being received
and I'm gonna do the same for the other
two uh employee records so let me just
copy paste and here I'm just going to
change
the name of the methods
all right so uh this is the initial code
for retrieving information however we'll
have to create the employee record in
our service
so back here in my
data.ts file
what I'm going to do is
I'll create three different uh Records
for the employees so let me say info one
which is going to be of type string
[Music]
all right
and let me just give a random names say
for example I say John
Matthew
[Music]
all right
and employee ID say
if 354
and let me just give a random
email ID and say JM at abc.net
all right so I'm gonna do the same for
the other two uh Records
so let me just create another one and
call it info 2
and the name I'm providing is say Rob
listen
with a different employee ID says 673
and I'm just gonna make it RW at abc.net
and another record for employee number
three
and I'm just gonna say Rose Adams
with
some employee ID
and an email ID all right
so now
we've created the employee records so
what I have to do is I have to create a
method that returns these employee
records correct so for that I'm just
gonna create another method called get
info one
which is of type string
and it just returns
this dot info one
all right similarly for the rest of the
two records I'm just gonna retrieve them
let's say in four two and get info two
and again
I'm just gonna make it get in for three
[Music]
and this is gonna return
info 3.
all right so I'm sure you've got an idea
as to what I'm doing here so basically
this information is going to be
retrieved in our employee component
correct so for that I'll have to make
use of dependency injection
so here I'll have to import the service
that I've created so let's go ahead and
say import
[Music]
the service with data service
all right
from
[Music]
slash data.service all right
now the main reason we're doing this is
to tell angular that when the component
is created
the service instance is also created and
this instance is being used to perform
particular tasks and for that we'll also
have to include this in our provider's
array so here let me just say providers
[Music]
and let's say data service
now to access this instance of service
that is created we make use of a
property
so this property basically allows us to
access all the methods that are defined
in the service class
all right so here in my Constructor
method I'm just gonna say
private
and you can give any name for your
property and here I'm just giving the
name d service
all right and which is of type
data service
[Music]
all right
so now with the help of this property I
can retrieve information from the
service class so here I'm just going to
say
this Dot
info received
equals this dot d service
dot get info one
[Music]
all right so what it basically does is
that it calls the get info one method in
our service which Returns the
information of the first employee
and this information is being stored in
the array that is info received one
so similarly for the next two methods
I'm just gonna use the same piece of
code
let me just change it here
[Music]
same for the third one
[Music]
all right
so now that we have the logic behind
what is being displayed
let's go ahead and create the UI for it
here in my HTML file
I'm going to create
an unordered list
[Music]
and now I'm gonna make use of the NG
for director
to uh basically Loop over the record and
display everything so for that I have to
make use of a particular variable so
I'll just say
let info
of info receipt
so
um you can check here in our TS file the
array is info received correct so I'm
going to make it with the same array
here
and since it's displaying the first
employee record I'm just going to
say
info received one
all right and let me just create a Class
A bootstrap class of list
group
item of list group info
and we're just gonna have to interpolate
info
all right that is basically going to
display what the information holds what
the info variable holds
all right and here as well let me create
a bootstrap class
called list
group
all right I hope this was clear to you
so basically here the information is
being retrieved with the help of this
method right let us get info from
service one so in order to call this
method we'll have to bind it with a
button all right so that's what we're
going to do let's just
copy this and here I'm going to create a
button
[Music]
all right
and the type
is button
[Music]
with name
button again
all right so I'm going to bind it with
the click event so what happens is that
when I click on it this particular
method gets called
all right I'm just facing the method
here
and finally let's just
provide the name employee one
for the button all right
so uh similarly we'll have to do the
same for the other two records as well
let me just make this look better all
right so uh what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna paste the same
twice
and here I'm gonna just change the names
I'll say 2 here and this is again for
employee two
and I'm going to change this as well
it's going to be employed I'm sorry it's
going to be in four received two this is
going to be in for receipt three
and finally employee three
all right and lastly we'll have to
include
the selector that is app hyphen e info
in our main component or HTML so here
let me just
create a custom tag all right and save
this so now let's go back to our browser
and see what it looks like
so here you can see that uh three
different buttons have been created for
employee one two and three and when you
click on it it retrieves the information
that is the name the employee ID and
their email IDs so we've successfully
created an angular service and injected
it into our component to retrieve
information all right so now the last
part of the use case that we discussed
was uh to add another detail that is the
employee detail in the record all right
so for that we'll have to take uh input
from the user and in our case we're
taking the location now we are also
adding the same location for all three
employees
so this is what services do you know
they can be used to update modify alter
anything that happens in the back end so
you can tweak the code a little bit and
you can change the entire uh view of
your application you can add information
you can delete you can retrieve you can
alter
Etc all right so for that what we're
going to do is back in the HTML file
we'll create a form that basically takes
the input
so I'm just going to say um
[Music]
form
all right within which I'm going to be
defining a div glass
[Music]
within which I'm going to be defining a
div tag
inside of which I'll have the input tag
of type
text
and the name I'm going to be providing
it will be location
all right
and we'll have a value and I'll just
[Music]
leave it blank and finally I'll have NG
model so if you're confused as to what
I'm doing here then I suggest you watch
the angular forms uh video it basically
teaches you uh how to work around with
angular forms
all right and now after this we're gonna
have a button
so let me say button
[Music]
okay
all right
[Music]
and I'm going to just say add info
okay
all right so now when I'm creating the
form I'll also have to create a template
variable to access all the values within
my form so if I have to access the
location then I need a variable to
access it so here let me just go ahead
and create a template variable let me
call it frm
and I'm gonna make use of the NG form
directive
so this tells angular
that this variable can be used to access
all the values within the form
and since I'm using form here I'll have
to import it in my module file
so here
I just go ahead
and see
import forms module from angular forms
and here in my imports
I'll just say forms module
okay so I've imported the forms module
so now uh back in my HTML file
what I'm going to do is that I'll have
to make use of this template variable
to update my information correct so I'll
have to create another method that will
update information into the records
so here in my component.ts file I'll
have to create another method and I'm
going to call this method update info
method
all right and uh this basically takes in
the template variable that is form
and let me just specify any
okay and what this is going to do is
that it updates
the record correct so I'm gonna say this
Dot
the service
Dot
add info now you must be wondering what
ad info is
I'll just let you know in a minute and
and the value that I'm going to be
passing will be the value that you've
provided as an input which is nothing
but form dot value dot location
all right so now what happens is that
I'll have to again specify what ad info
is and this method is going to be
defined in the service file correct
so here I'm going to create another
um
method that's add info
and I'm going to pass info as a
parameter
and what this method does is that it
just pushes the information or the data
into the arrays
so since I'm going to be pushing the
same information into all of these
arrays that is info 1 info 2 and info
three I'm just gonna say this dot info1
dot push
of info
all right and the same for
[Music]
the other two areas as well
let me just
change these all right
so what exactly I'm doing is that I have
I have a method called add info which
gets information from the component
all right and it basically pushes this
information into the array and also I'll
have to return it so I'll say return
this dot info
one
all right and I'll save it
and here we have another method called
update info which basically calls the ad
info method in our service
and passes the value to it
and then my HTML file also note that the
button type here is submit and not
button so what happens is that now the
value that we've received as an input
has to be passed on to the method that
is update info so here I'll say NG
submit
foreign
[Music]
update info
and I'm gonna pass
frm as the argument and now let's save
this
and execute
so all right here you can see that we
have an input field and a button saying
add info
so now I can just go ahead and say type
USA
and when I say add info and when I check
on my employee one details USA has been
added to the list
and same goes with employee 2 and
employee 3.
so I hope this simple demo on angular
Services helped you understand the
concept better I highly recommend you uh
play around and explore other
possibilities
let's understand what exactly is
bootstrap
bootstrap is a powerful toolkit
basically a collection of HTML CSS and
JavaScript tools for creating and
building responsive web applications and
Pages it is a free and open source
project based on GitHub and originally
created by Twitter
now to put it more easily bootstrap is a
giant collection of Handy reusable bits
of code written in HTML CSS and
JavaScript it's also a front-end
development framework that enables
developers and beginners to design quick
and responsive websites
now there are several advantages to
using bootstrap
to name a few bootstrap comes with a
responsive grid you don't have to spend
time working on your layouts
bootstrap comes with its own code for
automatically resizing images based on
the current screen size
it also comes with different components
that you can use for your web page these
components could be navigation bars drop
downs progress bars thumbnails
Etc
it also offers excellent documentation
and is customizable
so bootstrap comes in extremely handy to
create responsive user interface
so now before using bootstrap it needs
to be embedded into your application so
let's see how to embed bootstrap into
angular
now there are two ways to do it first up
is by using the bootstrap CDN or the
content delivery Network
now this enables users to load CSS
JavaScript and images remotely from its
servers
the other method is to use bootstrap npm
bootstrap jQuery and other packages and
Frameworks can be installed via the
command prompt
in the tutorial that I am going to be
showing you I have embedded bootstrap
using npm alright so I'm sure you only
understand the concept better when you
look at a demo
so let's go ahead and create an
application with the help of angular
bootstrap so in this tutorial what I'm
going to be showing is the creation of a
blog post so let me show you what we're
going to be doing
so here I've created a simple blog
for simply learn and I've added the
simply learn logo I've also written a
few lines about simply learn and what
they offer I've also mentioned their
tagline and when you scroll down you can
see that I've mentioned the different
courses they're offering
and when you click on the more info
button
it navigates to the official page that
gives you the overview for that
particular course
so this is for lean sex Sigma the same
for full stack web development
as well
and uh the same for the last one that is
cyber security
and finally I've added a simple video
here to just make it more uh beautiful
so I've added a simple video
and lastly I've also linked our YouTube
channel so when you click on the YouTube
icon it will navigate to the YouTube
channel
to our YouTube channel here
all right so this is what we're going to
be creating uh using angular bootstrap
so I'm hoping you're all ready for it so
without further delay let's jump in so
first let's find the template that we
want to use for our blog
so for that I'm going to just go ahead
and say
bootstrap
blog template
and I'm just going to click on the first
link that I get
and here
you can choose the template that you
like so I'm just going to look for more
templates here
and the one that we are going to choose
is
oh yeah this one so which is small
businesses so you can go ahead and click
on that you can then click on live
preview
and once you do that
you can just
say view frame source
so here you can see that the HTML code
is available
it has the head section and then the
body section
so the head section consists of a lot of
meta tags and then you have the title
and then you also have the CSS file
references
and then if you look at the body tag you
have different code for different parts
of the UI there's code for navigation
bar and then you have page content code
heading row
call to action and all of that and
lastly you have the footer
so what we're going to be doing is that
we'll take all of the code and then
we'll have to create components for each
of it and then we'll include all the
components in our main
HTML file
so that is the best practice that
angular uses so we're going to make use
of components
and you can also see that when you
scroll down you can see that it has
certain dependencies so here it has the
bootstrap dependency and then you have
jQuery so we'll have to download them
so we'll have to install them and as
mentioned earlier we're going to be
installing them with the help of npm so
for that we'll have to head back to our
vs code here
back in my vs code I've created a
folder called angular demo and then I've
also created a file called demo
components
and here
I'm just going to say CD
demo components
within which I'll say npm install
jQuery
[Music]
so this could take a while
and once you've installed jQuery go
ahead and type npm install bootstrap
all right so we've successfully
installed jQuery and bootstrap so now we
need to add the references to these
JavaScript files to do that go to your
angular.json file
and here we'll have to add them in our
build section so here you can see we
have styles and scripts so now scripts
array we Define the relative path to
these JavaScript files so these files
are generally uh stored in your node
modules so go ahead and
here you can look for bootstrap
here you go and then in your dist file
and then click on Js and then you can
see you have bootstrap.min.js
oh well I'm sorry we need
bootstrap.bundle.min.js so here
you can just right click and say copy
relative path
and back in my Json file in my scripts
I'm gonna just paste it here
and make sure to uh
make it a path by providing by providing
forward slash
[Music]
all right and then the next thing we
need is the
jquery.min.js files so for that
again in our node modules you'll have to
look for jQuery so here there's jQuery
and then click on test
and then we have jquery.min.js
so again let me just
copy the path
and paste it here
[Music]
follow the same procedure for this as
well
[Music]
all right so we've embedded both our
files in our
angular.json file
so now in our code here in the beginning
they've also included the CSS file so
we'll have to embed that as well so
here back in bootstrap
let me just add the CSS file as well
that's
bootstrap.nint.css I'm just going to
copy the relative path and just provide
it here
[Music]
let me just change these
to forward slash
[Music]
okay so we have our custom style sheet
so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to copy this
and just paste it in our
[Music]
and then you can just paste it here
all right
so I think we've added all the
dependencies
and the custom style sheet and
everything so now let me just close all
of these files
uh what we can do now is that we can go
ahead and take the code from The Source
here so I'm just going to copy the body
tag
all right so
I'm gonna copy this till the footer
and then I'm just going to paste it in
my
component.html file
[Music]
so as mentioned earlier I will create
components and then place the code for
specific parts of the UI in these
components
so let me just see if I've got
everything here
okay
so I'll be creating four components the
first one will be for the navigation bar
the second will be for the introduction
and then the third one will be uh to
display the courses that we're providing
and then lastly we'll have the footer
component
right so first let's create these
components I've also created a
components folder here in my app folder
so I just have to
tap in the command
nggc first we'll create the component
for the top navigation bar so I'm just
saying NG GC so I'm just gonna say
components
slash nav bar
[Music]
all right so uh the component has been
created so what I'm going to do is I'll
just
copy this
[Music]
here
[Music]
all right and the next component I'm
going to be creating is for the
introduction right so I'll say NG g c
components slash intro
all right so
so I will have to take
this code here I'm also going to be
including the call to action part
so I'll just
copy paste this one in my
intro.html file
so let me do that and then I'm gonna
have the main course content
component so for that I'll say NG GC
components slash courses
[Music]
and we're gonna copy the next part of
the code
[Music]
all right until uh till the footer
[Music]
let me just add it here
and finally we're going to create the
component for the footer so I'll say NG
g c
components slash
photo
and the last part of the code I'm just
going to add it there
[Music]
all right
so now we'll have to create the custom
HTML tags for these components and then
place it in our HTML file right so first
one that we created was the navigation
bar so here
head over to the TS file
just copy the selector
[Music]
and then here
and then in our
app.component let me just
create the tags
similarly for intro
[Music]
just going to copy the selector
[Music]
and then for courses so
we have app a hyphen courses
that as well
[Music]
and then lastly we have the photo
component so let me just copy that
face to tear
all right so we've included all the
components so let's just run this
application and see if everything is
displayed in that so here let me just
say NG serve so when you execute the
command you can see that the template is
being displayed so you have the
navigation bar you have the
intro component and then we have the
courses component and finally we have
the photo component right okay so now
that we have the template ready we can
go ahead and customize it according to
our needs so now I'm going to be making
a few changes to the code we're going to
add the simply learn logo we're going to
change the tagline here we're going to
display something else over here all
right so let's go back to our vs code to
customize and display the final output
so here
the first thing that I'm going to be
doing is
changing the message here I'm gonna
display simply learn for that
in our nav bar component
let's go to the HTML code
and here instead of start bootstrap let
me just type in simply learn
[Music]
all right so when you save it and when
you look at the browser
you can see that
simply learn is displayed
and the next thing that I want to do is
I want to add the image right a simply
learn logo
so what I've done here is I've already
added the logo uh dot PNG file in my
assets folder
so I'll just go ahead and provide the
path to this so that's going to be in
our intro file so here
image source is going to be
[Music]
assets
slash
[Music]
logo dot PNG
so let me save this
so there we go the logo is displayed
so the next thing is we'll have to
change this part of the UI so the
information that I want to display is
this
I'm going to be displaying
world's number one online boot camp and
other information so what I'm going to
do is back in my vs code I'm just gonna
delete
this
and instead of that I'm just gonna
copy this that's world's number one
online bootcamp
[Music]
and then within the paragraph tag I'll
display something else so let me get rid
of this
[Music]
let me just copy the information that I
want to display
paste it here
[Music]
and let me just give a line break
[Music]
let me save this and see if it's
displayed
so yeah we can see that the information
is being displayed
next up here instead of displaying call
to action message I'm going to display
uh explore programs message so let's go
back to our vs code
let me just say explore
programs here
and then lastly
instead of this message here
I want to display the message or get
certified get ahead without programs so
back in our vs code
I'm just gonna get rid of this
[Music]
and paste this instead
[Music]
so when you have a look at the browser
Let me refresh this
you can see it displays the message gets
certified get ahead and all of that
uh well now what I'm going to do is I'm
really not happy with the font size and
everything so I'm just go ahead and add
certain styling you can customize this
and provide your own font size and all
of that so here I'm just gonna mention
Style
and then say font size
and I'm gonna make it XX large
all right so let's see
[Music]
yeah all right so it's the font size has
increased so I think I'm happy with this
all right so the next thing we have to
do is add information here for our
courses
so back in RVs code
we'll have to go to the courses
component so here I'm gonna just uh type
in the code for the different courses so
I already have it here so the first
thing is this message that I want to
display let me just copy that
and for our first tag I'm just gonna say
post graduate program ending Six Sigma
and the next information I'm going to be
providing is the duration
so here let me just get rid of this
paste that here
let me just break the line
to beautify the code and then
and here for our reference link I
already have the link here
so I'm just gonna paste that so once you
click on the more info button it will
automatically navigate to this page
all right
so let me see this
next up I'm gonna do the same for the
other two courses as well
so it says postgraduate program in full
stack development
and then we're going to mention the
duration and the cohort so
let me paste that
I'll also provide a blind break
and then link I have it here so
I'm just gonna paste that
[Music]
and finally for the third card I have
the third link here
[Music]
let me get rid of this extra code and
paste this instead
[Music]
and then let's also provide the link for
the same
all right so uh let me save this
and have a look at the browser
so you can see that uh the information
has been added you can see it displays
postgraduate program in lean sex Sigma
full stack development and cyber
security so once I click on more info it
leads you to that page
that shows the overview all right
so now the next thing on the agenda was
to display a short video and then the
link to our YouTube channel so let's go
ahead and add that in our
courses component
uh so what I'm going to do is I'm just
gonna get the code to add a video from
Google and then I'm going to provide the
source which is going to be the video
that I would want to display
so I've received the code I'm just gonna
paste it here
so you can get the code uh on Google so
go ahead and just paste that also for
the source I have a video in my assets
folder which I have provided here
so when I save it and look at the
browser here we go you can see the video
here
all right
and once clicked it starts playing
[Applause]
[Music]
all right and lastly we'll have to
provide the logo for YouTube and then
the link to navigate to the YouTube page
so let's go ahead and do that
[Music]
so here again I've pasted the code
for the YouTube logo so here you can see
that I've added the image that is
YouTube dot PNG in my assets folder and
I've provided the source
and accordingly I've also added
The Styling I've provided a white
background and I've also aligned the
text to the center of the page
all right and I've also displayed the
message saying check out our YouTube
channel for technical videos and
tutorials
and then I provided the link to our
Channel on YouTube
so let me just save this and head back
to the browser
okay
and here you can see that
we have the YouTube logo
and we have the message displayed so
once you click on the logo it navigates
to the simply learn Channel on YouTube
all right so uh if you want you can also
change the message here for the footer
so here in footer.html I can just
remove this and
paste this I say simply on Solutions and
All Rights Reserved and I save it and
look at the browser
it must get updated
so yeah there we go
so with the help of bootstrap we have
successfully created a website which is
basically a Blog
and we also added the reference links
and images and logos to customize it
according to our requirements
so yeah this is it this is how you make
use of bootstrap and embed it into your
angular for more responsive and better
user interface let's have a look at the
basics of routing
now that I'm sure that you've observed
that the URL changes every time you
click on a particular link or on an icon
on the user interface correct now this
basically indicates that you are
navigating throughout the application
now to achieve this navigation we use a
mechanism called routing routing is
essentially used to navigate through a
website or a web application
but how is it achieved in angular
especially in angular routing plays a
major role it is used to create a single
page applications now these applications
are loaded just once and new content is
added dynamically applications like
Google Facebook Twitter and Gmail are a
few examples of single page applications
the best part of using single page
applications is that it provides an
excellent user experience and you don't
even have to wait for new pages to load
which by extension makes single page
applications extremely fast but how is
this new content loaded
enter routing now routing is the
mechanism that as discussed earlier that
is used to navigate through the
application and load new content
routing helps angular configure the
route and the component that needs to be
displayed
now I'm sure you're going to understand
the concept of routing better when you
work on it Hands-On
so in the demo we're going to be
navigating to the login and the home
pages of a web application with the help
of routing
so let's head to our Visual Studio code
so basically the objective of our
application is to navigate to home and
the login pages so when I click on the
login icon here it loads the login page
and here you can see the extension
slash login and similarly with home once
you click on it some new information
gets added and the URL changes
with a slash home appended alright so
this is the main objective of our
application so to create it let's head
back to our vs code all right so here
I've created a folder called demo and
underscore angular and I've created a
file called demo routing
now the first thing you want to do is
open the index.html file and make sure
that the base tag is added now although
this is generally added when your app is
created if it is not then add a base tag
with href attribute which is set to a
forward slash
all right now this is generally done to
tell angular to construct the URL while
navigating with a forward slash all
right and the next thing you want to do
is open your app dot module.ts file and
check if the app routing module has been
imported
if not go ahead and import it and then
also mention it in your Imports array
or with that the initial setup is done
Now to create the nav bar the code that
I'm going to be using is already
explained in the previous video that is
angular bootstrap I highly suggest you
go through that video before watching
this
so uh the code is already available I'm
just going to create a component and
write the code for it
and paste the code in it so let's do
that
let me say NG GC
navbar
[Music]
alright so this component is now created
now here in my HTML file
I'll just get rid of this and paste the
code for the nav bar
so here we go I've pasted the code for
the navigation bar
and back in my
app.component.html file I'll just remove
all The Unwanted code here
and just specify the
custom HTML tag for my nav bar
so let me just create one here
all right let me save this let me just
run the application and see if it's
displaying correctly
all right so when I open the browser uh
the navigation bar has been created
along with these different options
that's home about services and login
all right and we also have the simply
learn icon here all right now the next
step is to generate the components to
display the login page content and the
home page content
now again I have used bootstrap to
define the user interface for these
files you can easily find the code
online just search for a bootstrap login
templates and depending on your
requirements you can choose the
appropriate one
so first let's create the components for
by two files that is for the home
component
and the login component
so let's go ahead and do that
[Music]
nggc
I'm just going to call it login for my
login component
all right and then I'm gonna say nggc
home for the home component
all right
so I'm just going to copy the code for
the login component
so back in my login.html
file
[Music]
I'll just paste the code here
okay
also note that I've added the simply
learn logo in my assets folder
and then just provided the source for it
here in my login component
all right
so next up is the home component
and if you've seen the previous video
that is angular bootstrap you might have
seen that we created three different
components that is intro courses and
footer which included the content for
the intro message for the courses and
the photo message correct so here we're
going to just paste the code for all of
these three
and then just display it when the home
button is clicked
alright so what I'm going to do is I'll
just paste it here
[Music]
so this basically has all the content
one thing I want to tell you is that in
the previous video we made sure that the
code was written in three different
components however for this I've just
added all the code in the same component
now I agree that this is not the best
practice so if you want you can go ahead
and create three different components
and separate the code into these three
components and just add the custom HTML
tags in your home component
I'm just hoping you're following me
right now and also here in my assets
folder I have added a video and the
YouTube logo that needs to be displayed
uh when the home icon is clicked all
right so now that we've created the home
and the login components the next step
is to configure the routes for the
application
right so here you can see that we have a
file called app routing module.ts file
so here we have the routes and the
router module that is imported and we
also have a constant called routes which
is strongly typed two routes from the
router package
all right now this array is used to
define all the possible routes in the
application now each route is basically
an object with a path
so here in my routes array I'm just
going to go ahead and create the paths
that is we have two different routes
right one is for login and one is for
home so I'm just going to create a path
object so let's say path
solution curly braces I say path
[Music]
and then the path that I'm going to give
is login
this is basically what will appear uh on
the URL all right and the component that
needs to be
navigated to is nothing but the login
component
so let me just say login
component as you can see the login
component has been automatically
imported
now same with
the Home Path so let me just say
path
home
and the component that needs to be
rendered is the home component
[Music]
all right
now the next step is to link these
routes to a button
in the navbar that is the home and the
login button right so we're going to
make use of the nav tag and an anchor
tag for this you can see that we have a
nav tag
and an anchor tag
which encloses the login and the home
components
all right now we're going to make use of
two directives from the router package
called router link and router link actor
now these are specified within the
anchor tag the router link basically
holds the path to the page
and the letter that is the router link
active specifies one or more CSS classes
that will be applied when the router
link is active
all right so to do that let me just add
router
link
all right in our case it is home here
and we're gonna have another director
called router link active
[Music]
and we're just gonna say active here
[Music]
all right
same for the login icon here
let me just copy this
[Music]
and instead of home
the path we created for this was login
[Music]
all right
so this is how you can bind the route to
your specific button on your UI
now despite of all this how are we
specifying where these components are to
be displayed
right the answer to this is using the
router Outlet director now again this
directive is available in the router
package so we have to add that in our
app component.html file
so here just go ahead and type
router Outlet
[Music]
all right so with that we've created a
simple navigation bar which has
different options that is home about
services and Link and once the user
clicks on the home icon it displays the
content that is in the home
component.html file
and once the user clicks on the login
component it displays the content in the
login.html file
all right it's as simple as that so now
let's go to the browser and see if it
executes correctly
so all right we have the navigation bar
and once I click on the home icon here
all right yes we see that all the
content has been loaded
you can see we have uh the intro section
we have the courses section and the
footer section as discussed
and the most important part is that here
in our URL you can see that slash home
has been appended this shows that a
route has been created that navigates to
the home component so we've successfully
created a route here
and for login component when I click on
this icon you can see that the path
changes here and the login component
gets displayed
all right so this is how routing is
achieved in angular so let me show you
however application will look like
so
like this our application will look like
here you can add anything like like
share
and comment
you can also remove it or Mark as done
like this you just have to click
and just remove if you want
from here you can just write anything
and just add or like this if it's done
or you want to remove it
so
before we jump to the coding part let me
just tell you about a angular overview
so what is angular angular is an open
source JavaScript framework written in
typescript Google maintains it and its
primarily purpose is to develop single
page applications as a framework
angular has clear advantage while also
providing the standard structure for
developers on a team to work with it
enables users to develop large
application in a maintainable manner
so there are so many advantages
using angular but the two I love the
most is data binding and browser
compatibility
you can also check out our videos on
angular for deep understanding
so what is data binding angular enables
users to effortlessly move data from
JavaScript code to view and react to its
user and events without having to write
any code manually
and the browser compatibility as angular
is a cross-platform and compatible with
multiple browsers and angular
application can typically run on any
browsers for example Chrome Firefox and
others such as Windows Mac OS and Linux
so let's open our
Visual Studio code
let's cut this
the first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna create an angular project
for that let's open our command prompt
in this command prompt we'll write a
command
npm
install
I think globally
at
angular
CLI
press enter
so for this you must have node.js and
npm install in your system
it'll take a couple of seconds to
install the files
let's wait a minute
meanwhile
let me tell you why we use angular
JavaScript is the most commonly used
client-side scripting language it is
written in HTML documents to enable
interaction with web pages in many
unique ways as it is relatively easy to
learn language it is well suited for
Developers for modern applications
let's wait a couple of seconds more
so whatever angular application is
installed
so now we're gonna create a project for
that
we're gonna write NG new and the project
name
here I'm gonna write
angular
ah
press enter
we're gonna ask you a few steps
yes
I'm gonna type CSS
and it will install all the necessary
packages
let's wait a couple of seconds more
let's discuss some other things about
angular
JavaScript idle for developing single
page application that we all know but
that requires modularity testability and
developers probability perhaps not
these days we have a variety of
Frameworks and libraries designed to
provide alternative Solutions
with respect to where front-end
Frameworks
angular addresses many if not all of the
issues developer face when using
JavaScript on its own so angular is the
best app or tool to develop applications
so angular is the one thing I love the
most
so let's wait more seconds
so
all the packages are installed
successfully
so now
let's now open our Visual Studio code
let's cut this
and inside this let's open our folder
you can check the path of the file where
you have installed this so in the my
system it's in the user
here
and angular wrap is here so I'm going to
open it
so
this is what
it will open
those more most of the code we are going
to do is in this source file
so we're going to open this app
so let's delete this we're gonna not
need it and
our application
we don't need routing as well
and
now
let's open style.css
let's
delete this
and let's write some Global styling
here
let's write margin
if it is zero
betting zero
OtterBox
and
fun family
let's save this file
and let's open index.html
so here it's
angular app
now let's just run this and see
how it's looking for that let's type
control and backtech
to open the terminal
or you can also go here
let me just first
zoom out a little
then new terminal
inside this
new terminal
I'm gonna write
ND servers open
let me show you
so we're gonna type yes
enter
let's wait a couple of seconds
so as it's saying
this can't compiled
so let me see the issue here
it's saying
most of the times the
app routing the file that I have deleted
so because this file is has been called
somewhere
because of this this error is coming
so I'm gonna go here
and see where this file is
called
so we're gonna remove this part
this
app routing module part
now let's save it
now
let's see where are the issues here
again
do the compiling
until it's being compiled
we're gonna see if
there are the
HTML file the CSS component is empty
in this HTML only
the issue is coming so it must be in the
last of this yeah
let's remove this save this file
and as you can see it's compiled
successfully
we're gonna go again to a Wrangler
application
as you can see it's showing this
create a new component we're gonna write
this command NG generate component and
the file or the project name
angular material for that we're gonna
write this command
and like this there are so many other
commands also
if you want to learn angular you can
just click on that and it will open the
angular Iota tutorial part
so we don't need that let's delete this
and the application that we have created
let's delete it also
let's minimize this
and let's work on our code
minimize this as well
I don't need components
so let's delete this part
this
here we'll write app
it's
there
I'll use a twin tag
and inside this I'm gonna write
from
employee
let's save it and see in our browser
it's saying hello from simple
isn't it amazing
let's write here
angular
to do
app
let's just save it
let's say angular 221
now
let's make it under editor
let's write this one
between this so we'll make this
under header
it's working fine
now
I'll create a component for that
I'll create
a new terminal in here I'll write
a command Ng
globally
component
components in that I'll write
2 2.
enter
so as you can see here
component inside this app
has been created under to do so here as
you can see
so many to do components and TS file has
been created a typescript file
so everything looks good here we don't
need this file so we're gonna remove it
so
let's minimize this
and inside the components folder
HTML
let's delete it
and create a class
to do
inside this class
I'm gonna create another class
let's name it as to do
let's make this as to lose
and this has two
after that
I'll create a class of
ID
so that we can
fetch the numbers
L for the junk data I'll write zero
not Rand
will write F class
content whatever we're gonna post inside
that
so I'm going to write content
and inside this I'm going to write
my to do
after that I don't need it there now we
can create a button
of glass
delete
and then inside that I'm gonna write
oh
it's fine let's see in the browser
how it's looking
wait a couple of seconds
Illuminator code
so
first we're gonna call it inside this
okay
that's right amp
doodles
so it's not affecting it
let me see
tool okay
let's first see in the modules that
should provide that two two component is
automatically as you can see here
the 22 component is automatically has
been imported in this
see the issue
let's first see the component name
inside this file
okay the component is app.tudo
that's why it's not fetching
let's
lead it now save it
compiled successfully zero my to do and
remove button
let's move forward now
so this is fine but we need to Loop this
how many times
so because of that
we can't write it so many times for that
we're gonna do
create a array inside this to do
component
under this Constructor
now we can use angular
engine for that I'm gonna write title
here I'm gonna write
two two
component
okay let's see
so let's save this file in will go back
to our
to do a company.html and inside this
we're gonna call this class
so the name of the class here is title
that's why
I'm calling this here
let's see
you will see to do
if we'll change this to
to amp now let's save this
it will show us to do app
okay so this is how we can inject our
variables inside the Dom
so now
let's
delete it
tools
it's here
now let's save this
let's compile
inside this file only
title
so we have created an error
so let's create a file because we don't
want to access it from here so we
create a file let's name it as
to do
well let's
models first
let's just create a folder first
inside this models
will create a file
you to
dot clip screen
inside this we'll export class
22
yeah well
if the content
but
string
and
when it'll get completed
we'll get Boolean
so
as you can see here
and then
and
so guys oh
sign
it's looking fine now let's save this
file
let's move forward
let's first import
YouTube
we'll import this module
TS file
so it's in this
tutu
from
tag
modules one two
this is the path of this
so let's
filter
save this
you have to write
doodle array
components are done
so we will
this is a keyword so
this array
exit this
here we'll write content
it's
it's true
complete
completed
okay it's
content
what we are going to show so it's
Commander
okay
first content
and here we'll write
true
so it's
fine
we'll create
two so we copy it from here
here
that looks
let's save this the error is coming
can't fetch it so I guess
isn't behind it is
yeah
let's save this still
compilation error is coming
deleted
let's join similar only
we're gonna have to work on our code
let's minimize this
now
here we'll call it function
attribute for the last trick
two
let
to do
those
and then let
I equals to
index
and next
so this looks
fine save it
so
it can't fit it so you know
as the index here
it's not fetching
so
okay we have declared here
as I as index so we're gonna write I
let's save it by successfully
one okay fine
before we go deeper into the code
I'm gonna copy the CSS file
from here
let's copy this
and we're gonna paste it
the component part
they are just simple CSS commands
we'll get this code in the description
box
let's save this
let's cut this
is not fetched
C
oh
mistake
these CSS should come under
company dot CSS let's save this
save and cut this also on this
now we'll open a graph
so our application is going to look like
this
is
buttons are not functional right now but
we'll make it functional
so let's
let's style it
remove will remain the same because it
is coming under the button part
now we're gonna call methods
and the methods are like just functions
okay
now
index
we need to add
to do
complete
when it will get complete
then Mark as done
otherwise
empty
so
it's done
it's completed
okay
see this
now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna make
method or function
so that whenever we click on this part
will just get cut or Mark as done
so the end
I'm gonna go to this to the component
and under this
I'm going to create a method
toggle
done
and I'm gonna pass the ID
and inside this
so this
I'm going to make it as here
to do this
dot map
don't worry I'm gonna tell you
how this is working and what I'm doing
it's not fitting V and I
just wait
where I'm gonna write
see
if
I is equals to equals to ID
then
V Dot
P did
will get cut
or equals to
not V
don't
completed
or if not
then return
V
so what I'm gonna do here is
okay this is
left
I'm gonna pass the number here
foreign
things look
normal
let's find the issue here what's the
issue
okay
we have declared V and I but we can't
fetch it because it's under this only
so to
access this V and I here also
check this let's
see
it's second and it's coming like this
let's go back to our code
and make it as
only
let's make this also
it's both are coming like this
okay
let's clear the click function
side
over
component
HTML okay
here only
clear click whenever we click on any
item
it'll pass through dog
and here we're gonna pass
inside toggle I
so we call this we'll pass through I
save this
here also in the delete path
we're gonna do it later let's save it
first
see
whenever we click on this
LDL leader
like this
fine
let's just
go back to our code
after this we're going to create a
delete method
let's name it as delete
[Music]
total
this will implement
inside remove
like
so to delete we will not write
again this to do
news
equals to
this
Dot to do
filter method
here we'll call B
B I can
stem will not repeat
old mistake
run right
not equals to
to ID
when I is not equals to ID remove it
this is a function
so
we're going to call it like
we call inside our toggle done so we're
going to save this
going back to a cone
after this right click
when I will click
it will call
eat
dude
and inside this will pass index
save this
coming back to our
company
let's just
create far
add to function
so let's first take place here
in giving her number is
whenever will
put the number only that time it will
work
so we can't add a string here so that's
why we are declaring here
number
let's just leave this delete this from
now
save it and see
okay
the remove function is also
working now
going back to our code
what we'll need is
remove or ADD
so now we'll work on
let's let's create
first thing we're gonna do is
inside this
dot HTML
so we're not writing
two two
will help create a class
dove
class name
and inside this
let's create a form
set this form will create an input from
the user
so what
he or she wants to enter in this
or first thing we'll need is the text
next we need is the name
input
to
to that placeholder
inside that box that will get created
all right
enter
your
after that you get the class
off
of foot
to do
what I have declared here as to do
no your hand
let's
one thing I'm forgetting is the
NT model
will get red because
we are not
so this is coming red because we haven't
created this input to do
the component
so we're gonna create it right now only
first here
first let's just save this
okay
and let's
okay
let's just delete this save this
it's coming red okay
let's
do
is a string of
where we are creating
what
will come under the string is
a Boolean only or not Boolean string
value only
let's open this
here
I'm gonna import
ah
in G
module
[Music]
to Wrangler
core I guess
only the module is already
fetched so we're gonna need
only
import
forms
module
angular
oh
let's see this
hold it inside our
side over
app module
CS
here we're gonna write
this module
with this app.word
even
um this
save as
so
I've called this one
so it's working now
this still is not working let's
do this so everything is working fine
now there is no
nothing
and you can add
it's not adding
now everything is done
we're gonna
create
add to
insert this so we'll call this Dot
two-do's
dot push it
content which will come under this will
be content
whatever comes under this
and two two
and then completed
and false
let's close this
and after this
let's create the empty string here
called
to do let's run this
let's
have we are looking for
hello
from
another click on let's mark As done
you can also remove it
yeah and we can also add it
like
chill
if this is Mark as done then click here
as done
so what's in it for you we'll first get
familiar with both the programming
languages by going through a quick
introduction then we will compare
reactant angular focusing on their
performance
after that we will discuss the learning
curve for learning both of these
Frameworks we'll also get to know about
the adoption of these Frameworks and
their application in the field of web
development after that we'll compare the
community support available for each
framework
then we will dive into the industry
Trends and job prospects
and in the end I'm going to tell you
which technology to choose but I will
give you enough food for thought for you
to choose the technology that suits you
and your project best
so let me first give you an introduction
to react
now react is JavaScript library for UI
development it is managed by Facebook
and has an open source community of
Developers
the framework was introduced in May
2013. it is currently one of the most
popular front-end libraries for web
development
moving on to angular
angular is an open source JavaScript
framework for web development and mobile
development
it is typescript based and is managed by
Google's angular team and the angular
developer community
launched in September 2016 angular also
known as angular 2.0 is a complete
rewrite of angularjs which was
introduced in 2010. it competes directly
with react front-end Library
moving on let's go ahead and compare the
performance
now react performance is greatly
improved with the introduction of the
virtual Dom and is generally better than
that of angular
react uses the concept of virtual Dom
that puts less load on the browser react
was released with the USP of being
faster than other Frameworks available
furthermore since the data binding
process is unidirectional bindings are
not assigned Watchers as in the case of
angular
when it comes to angular it performs
worse especially in complex and dynamic
applications
the performance of angular apps is
negatively affected by bi-directional
data binding angular uses traditional
Dom that updates the whole web page even
if a single element is changed however
the most recent update of angular has
greatly improved its performance and it
does not lose to react anymore
so moving ahead let me give you a brief
insight into the learning curve
react is a library and not a framework
it is quite simple to understand if
you're familiar with JavaScript
however it takes time to learn how to
set up a project properly so you need to
learn the Redux Library which is used in
more than half of react applications for
State Management react depends on other
libraries to add functionality constant
framework updates also require
additional effort from the developer
complex to understand some complicated
features are embedded into the framework
core which means that the developer
cannot avoid learning and using them
angular itself is a huge Library so
initial learning effort is worth it
since you probably won't have to learn
other libraries like react
moving ahead let's look at the community
support
react framework is one of the most
popular JavaScript Frameworks worldwide
it has larger community support and you
may face a lack of documentation at
times the community support makes up for
the lack in documentation
when it comes to angular even though
angular was released before its adoption
is lesser when compared to react
comparatively it has a smaller Community
Support documentation is on point and
definitely better in the case of angular
also the community support has improved
over the few years
moving on let's look at adoption and
application
react was released in May 2013. react is
more popularly adopted by developers due
to its simplicity
it is an actively used by companies like
Facebook Twitter Netflix Airbnb and many
others
now here New York Times is one of the
many popular websites built using react
every News section acts as a separate
component so if any one of the component
updates the entire web page doesn't have
to reload making the web app feel much
faster and smoother
this is just to give you a brief example
when it comes to angular it was released
in October 2010 even though it is
improved now developers used to ignore
angular due to its complexity at the
time of its release angular is used by
Google Apple Nike McDonald's and other
companies
now Gmail is one of the many popular
websites built using angular only the
initial loading takes time but after
that everything is so smooth because it
is pre-loaded onto the web browser
similarity of react and angular in the
last five years
we can clearly make out that react's
popularity is increasing over time while
angular's popularity is more of a
straight line
moving on to job Trends a react
developer's average salary in the United
States is around 91 000 US dollars per
annum in India the average salary of a
reactive lapper is around 7.35 lakhs per
annum
when it comes to angular an average
salary of an angular developer in the US
is around 73 000 US dollars when it
comes to India the average salary is
around 4.88 lakhs per annum
so in conclusion angular is a
full-fledged mobile and web development
framework
react is a library only for UI
development which can be turned into a
full-fledged solution with the help of
additional libraries
react seems simpler at First Sight and
it takes lesser time to start working on
a react project however that Simplicity
as the main advantage of react is
neutralized because you have to learn to
work with additional Frameworks and
tools
angular itself is more complex and takes
quite some time to master yet it is a
powerful tool that offers a holistic web
development experience and once you
learn how to work with it you reap the
fruits
now there is no better framework both
are updated continuously to keep up with
the competitor for instance while react
was believed to win because of its
virtual Dom angular equal Discord by
implementing change detection in the end
angular versus react is all a matter of
personal preference a matter of skills
and habits as a beginner in programming
you would probably benefit more from
starting with react as an experienced
developer you just keep working with
what you know better
okay everyone so we will go ahead with
the next set of interviews which is
related to your angular
so angular is as popular as I can react
okay so there are some questions which
are usually asked like what are the data
binding
okay so the data binding is actually the
process which allows the
application
okay to have some data associated with
your
HTML page
from your typescript classes or the vice
versa
okay so the data binding is the one
through which you bind the data okay so
you can see here it says like angular
uses two-way data binding when the
changes happens in a model it will be
affected in a view and whether changes
happens the review it will affect the
model also so it is used to
typically keep the model and view in
sync with each other to have the data
interchange
what is the typescript typescript is a
typical I would say a language which is
used
by angular okay to develop angular
component Services pipes decorators and
multiple things it is a superset of
JavaScript and it supports JavaScript
libraries and apis it is a pure object
oriented in nature uses object oriented
principles better development time fast
to load and additional features to the
JavaScript for sure
okay what is an aot compilation how it
is different from jit aot stands for
ahead of time compiler which is
converting all angular and HTML and
typescript code into the JavaScript code
during the build phase before the
browser downloads and run the code Okay
so aot
is far more faster and light weighted in
the size just in time compiler is a by
default compiler Okay so
it is a process where the compiling
computer code is the machine code during
the execution of runtime so this ensures
the faster rendering the browser it also
known is called Dynamic compilation
are we clear so when you want to develop
this aot compiler you always use hyphen
hyphen aot
okay so here you always use jit compiler
because that is the by default compiler
you use when you say NG build
next what are the pipes in angular so
pipes means that they are the decorators
they never change their default value
but just for the representation purpose
they change the values okay to look more
better the way they always want
okay so pipes are ready made or else it
can be customized created angular also
comes with lot many predefined pipes
okay like it comes with the pipe symbol
here okay so you can change the pipes
together it can be provided with some
arguments at a runtime with the colon
sign
okay now you pass the input you put the
pipe and get some result
with some decorated outcome now you can
see the pure pipes uses the pure
functions
clear so this pipe doesn't use any
internal State and the output Remains
the Same as long as the parameters pass
to stay the same angular calls the pipe
only when it detects the changes in the
parameters being passed a single
instance of the pure pipe is used
throughout the all components
okay so this is how you see how the
pipes are being used so we have defined
the pipe okay which is the value called
true and fault for the pure and giving
the class by implementing pipe transform
so
you can see here the impure pipes for
the say for every change detection
actually happens in an angular and
impure is called I'll be clear with
regards to the changes in the input
fields
okay they will be calling every time so
multiple pipe instances are created for
the C for these pipes and push pass to
these pipes can be mutable by default
all pipes are pure only if you want to
make it impure you always say like pure
colon true
or
pure colon false
now what are the promising observables
in angular see promises it is a typical
JavaScript object okay it it emits a
single values at a time they execute
immediately after the creation and not
cancelable they are pushed error to the
child promises
okay where the observables are only
executable when subscribed to them they
won't call unless you subscribe to them
using subscribe methods so they help
perform operations like it for each
filter and retrieve and everything when
you unsubscribe this they won't get
called and won't listen anymore
what are the form controls and the form
groups see the form controls and form
groups these are two predefined objects
comes with your
angular
so these all text boxes
from you take the input it may be radio
buttons it may be the drop down it may
be the check boxes are called form
controls
okay so form controls is a class that
enables the validation for every single
input class whichever you are creating
it now so they check the values which
are touched untouched or the dirty
clear now we talk about call form group
they are basically forming a group which
under which you have a call relevant
Fields joined together are called what a
form group
okay so form group class represents a
group of controls like you talk about
address contains city state and pin code
these all three can be together called
as a form group
okay so the form group class basically
return true if all controls are
basically what the valid
okay and they are designed to provide
all the necessary validation errors
what is the eager and what is a lazy
loading okay so eager loading means what
it is a default module loading strategy
followed in an angular
Eagle loadings are used before the
application starts
these are typically useful for the small
scale applications
lazy loading however is designed for
dynamic loads of features only on demand
this makes your application far more
faster so in a bigger application we
really don't make easy eager loading
because it hamper the performance and
you want only when the client asks you
want to use lazy loading
what is the String interpolation in
angular see string interpolation is
written under the double curly braces it
is a typically One Way binding where you
get the data from the typescript classes
and display directly over your browser
it denotes with the curly process and it
always display the data comes from the
component to The View and with that we
