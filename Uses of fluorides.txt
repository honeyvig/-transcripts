hi venus this is dr srikanth from team
mds conquer now i'll be talking about
the advantages of fluoride
reacting with dental structures so most
of the dental structures they contain a
molecule which is called as
hydroxyapatite when this hydroxyapatite
reacts with the fluoride it forms two
molecules one is fluoro hydroxyapatite
and fluorepetite when you compare the
critical ph of these two
i hope you know what is the meaning of
critical ph critical ph
is a ph around which demineralization
and remineralization takes place
whenever the critical ph is below this
5.2 to 5.5
there will be demineralization whenever
it is above it will be remineralized
i hope you know this concept so when you
compare the critical ph of normal teeth
it is 5.2 to
point five whereas fluorapatite or
hydroxyl fluoride is four point two to
four point five which clearly gives the
meaning that
more acid is required for dissolution of
a teeth
when it reacts with the fluoride so it
is more acid resistance
when compared with the normal depth and
it is more in size you can see there is
increasing in size here
when i compare with the normal t there
will be increasing in size and
there will be decreasing in the critical
page so taking these advantages into
consideration okay
fluoro hydroxyapatite or fluoropathetic
requires more acid to dissolution
are increasing in size and all these are
advantages which make
tough for the bacteria to dissolve or
tough for the acid to dissolve
okay i'm done with this particular
concept signing off dr srikanth from
team mds conquer
take care
