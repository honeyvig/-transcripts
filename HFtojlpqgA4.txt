1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,000
so hello and welcome to the tutorial so

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,010
today I'm gonna be and my name is Tammy

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,660
Bakshi and today I'm gonna be talking

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,389
about an app that I created and this app

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,040
was written in Swift which is Apple's

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,379
programming language for Mac OS X and

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,439
iOS 9 or iOS 8 and it also works on iOS

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,920
9 so yeah this app will essentially

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,650
allow you to take a borrower's name and

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,080
I am named and also an image of the

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,119
items that they borrowed from you and

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,130
upload it all to a database on the web

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,410
so that you can access it from any other

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,570
device whenever you want yeah so this

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,940
app is mainly targeted towards people in

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,660
you know grade 11 grade 12 that are

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,039
trying to do computer science maybe

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,469
making a project then and they need to

19
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,719
upload images to a database it would

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,570
work for them it could work for even

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,070
professional app developers that are

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,829
actually trying to create apps that need

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,410
to actually upload images that the user

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,989
gives them onto a database stuff like

25
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,479
that and yeah I'm just going to go to

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,310
our Mac now and you will see the app in

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,229
action so as you can see here I have my

28
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,250
iPhone here and so I already have the

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,860
app up and running and so as you can see

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,500
this is a UI tableview in which all of

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,170
the entries are put in so we have Frank

32
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,670
took my mouse and then a picture the

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,979
mouse Travis took my well it was

34
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,810
supposed to be marker but again

35
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,720
autocorrect made it market so apparently

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,460
he took my market but as a picture of a

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,439
marker there and then Tom took my

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,790
glasses and then picture their glasses

39
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,159
and then Tim took my USB extension and

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,560
then the picture of the USB extension

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,530
and so now that we have all these why

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,579
don't we actually try uploading

43
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,030
something so to say we upload and let's

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,689
just say the person in this name is

45
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,689
Frankie

46
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,620
and then let's just say the item that

47
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,710
they took or my headphones that could

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,210
work so now I'm just gonna choose an

49
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,600
image and as you can see here I'm just

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,760
going to take my headphones take a quick

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,500
picture and then as you can see it asks

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,750
me if I want to take a retake or if I

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,160
want to just use the photo so I can

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
click on use photo and as you can see

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,090
after a little bit of delay which is one

56
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,850
of the known bugs in the app it will

57
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,310
actually start spinning the UI activity

58
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,860
indicator view which will tell the user

59
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,810
that it's uploading and also this back

60
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,600
button here is now disabled so that we

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,360
cannot go back while the uploads because

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,220
then it would be in between and

63
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,570
operation and then the next time you

64
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,530
would open the app it would just crash

65
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,870
so once this is done uploading and again

66
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,670
sometimes it takes longer than other

67
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,610
times but usually it's quite fast 30

68
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,720
seconds to a minute

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,020
at max so usually this can be done in

70
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,239
like 15 to 20 seconds sometimes if your

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,280
Wi-Fi slows 30 seconds and if it's

72
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,170
really slow or if it's a really big

73
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,900
image and it'll take around a minute so

74
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,810
as you can see the uploading bars gone

75
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,090
and the back button is now enabled so if

76
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,019
I click on back you will see that the

77
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,390
back button gets clicked but then we're

78
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,250
still at the view like what happened I

79
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,860
don't know but what actually happened is

80
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,090
it's loading up the images from my

81
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,340
website and it's putting them into the

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,200
table view so it's downloading each

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,690
image again and it's basically putting

84
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,730
each one into the table view one by one

85
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,120
so if I just wait a second this will in

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,570
fact just load up the entire UI

87
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,190
tableview with all the entries and we'll

88
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,440
also have additionally Frankie took my

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,239
headphones and then a picture of the

90
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,950
headphones just so I can make sure that

91
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,110
they're not damaged and just really make

92
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,200
sure that they're mine so yeah that'll

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,870
load up in a few minutes until then what

94
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,030
we can do is I'm just going to minimize

95
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,940
that and let's just go oh as you can see

96
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,580
it has loaded up and as you can see we

97
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,099
have the classic entries that were

98
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,140
already there

99
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,850
right to her mouth Travis took my marker

100
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,370
Tom took my glasses and took my USB

101
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,390
extension however if I scroll down here

102
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,640
in just a second sometimes it freezes up

103
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:33,620
like that a second again this is a

104
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,690
pretty big app so it does take some time

105
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,600
to load up so as you can see I can

106
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,910
scroll down even more and it says that

107
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,590
Frankie has taken my headphones and then

108
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,530
a picture the headphones so now that

109
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,330
you've seen a slight demo of the app

110
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,460
let's actually get let's just skim

111
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,680
through the source code here and as

112
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,110
always the source code will for sure me

113
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,419
in the description 100% on github like

114
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:57,380
always

115
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,570
and so this Apple essentially take the

116
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,640
swift parts and the objective-c part

117
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,810
makes it together and the the iOS end

118
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,570
which is both Swift and objective-c will

119
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,919
contact PHP PHP will upload the image to

120
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,700
web server on my GoDaddy and the name

121
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,030
the item and the name of the actual

122
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,880
image itself will go to the database so

123
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,000
that we can store it and then this is

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,669
the UI for the app you should see you've

125
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,860
already seen this but we have the reload

126
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,890
upload the name of the person the item

127
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,600
they took and an image of the item

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,030
inside of a costume table view cell and

129
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,130
then we have the UI for the uploading

130
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,200
which is the name of the item the name

131
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,880
of the person sorry and then with the

132
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,710
item then you can choose an image you

133
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,810
can go back and it will tell you if it

134
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,180
is currently uploading apart from that

135
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,250
we have view controller dot select which

136
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,640
will do some basic stuff you know it'll

137
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,830
it's basically the heart of the entire

138
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,470
app itself it controls the entire PHP

139
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,620
and the database and the web server it

140
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,990
just does everything that its little

141
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,070
branches can so in just a second here

142
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,080
and as you can see we have an extension

143
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,490
to the string class which will allow us

144
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,070
to get specific ranges of character were

145
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,900
actually just specific characters itself

146
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,890
from strings and also apart from that we

147
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,020
have a class view controller which

148
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,639
conforms to UI view controller

149
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,860
datasource and UI tableview delegate

150
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,509
it'll also conform to UI navigation

151
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,280
controller could I'll get and

152
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,860
uiimagepickercontroller delegate apart

153
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,469
from that this is just all some

154
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,029
variables and IB outlets we are

155
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:43,460
declaring then we have a function called

156
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,620
buted load and this function is called

157
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,919
whenever we whenever we run the app and

158
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,949
this function over here is called

159
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,960
whenever a boolean updates meaning

160
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,419
whenever we're done uploading this

161
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,249
function over here is the reload

162
00:06:58,249 --> 00:06:59,719
function it's called whenever we click

163
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,360
on the reload button this button will

164
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,919
basically hide the keyboard whenever we

165
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,919
touch somewhere on the screen this

166
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,159
function here will get JSON values from

167
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:12,439
my websites or actually from the

168
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,930
database and put it into the table view

169
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,360
and this function will tell us how many

170
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,639
rows in the section there are for the

171
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,680
table view and this function will

172
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,629
actually be able to make a cell for each

173
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,879
cell that's required in that table view

174
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,400
this IB action will allow us to start

175
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,189
taking a picture this function will

176
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,580
allow us to pick an image and then we

177
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,930
can put that from the image picker

178
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,539
controller to the actual web server

179
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,210
itself and the database and this will

180
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,310
allow us to get all the contents inside

181
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,729
of the well basically all the names of

182
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:49,310
the images inside of the ID the inside

183
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,439
of Mike from my database and then this

184
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,629
function will just allow us to parse out

185
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:56,949
all those names from the all data and

186
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,449
