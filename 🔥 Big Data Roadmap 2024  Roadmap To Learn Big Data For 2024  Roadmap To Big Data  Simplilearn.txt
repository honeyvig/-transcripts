in today's fast-paced digital age we are
witnessing an unprecedented explosion of
data this data Deluge encompasses every
aspect of Our Lives from the image we
send and received to the photos we
capture on our smartphones online
transactions and even the sensors
embedded on are smart devices this vast
and ever growing sea of information has
come to be known as Big Data and it is
reshaping the way we understand and
interact with the World Imagine a world
where every click like and share and
swipe generates a digital footprint the
machines constantly gather information
from their surroundings and where the
internet is a vast ocean of data streams
in this era traditional methods of data
collection and Analysis fall short
unable to keep Pace with the shear
volume velocity and variety of data
being generated this is where Big Data
steps in as a transformative Force
promising new insights opportunities and
challenges that have the potential to
revolutionize Industries improved
decision making and unlock the mysteries
of our interconnected World in this
journey into the realm of Big Data we'll
see what big data is and after that
we'll dive into the roadmap of big data
so fast and your seat belts and prepare
to embark on a captivating exploration
of the data-driven frontier that is
reshaping our present and shaping our
future welcome to the world of Big Data
with that in mind now over to our
training experts before moving on to
what big data is develop Advanced Data
skills with the data engineered course
by simply learn data engineering
postgraduate program in partnership with
Purdue University and IBM is the ideal
program for professional exposure
aligned with AWS and Azure certification
this applied learning program will help
you all master crucial data engineering
skills this data engineering course is
ideal for professional covering critical
topics like Hadoop framework data
processing using spark data pipelines
with Kafka big data on AWS and azure
your Cloud infrastructure this program
is delivered via live session industry
projects IBM hackathons and ask me
anything session this course covers big
data and data engineering Concepts like
Hadoop ecosystem Apache python Basics
AWS EMR quick site Sage maker the AWS
Cloud platform and Azure services for
admission to this data engineering
course candidate should have two plus
years of experience a bachelor degree
with an average of 50 or higher marks
and a basic understanding of object
oriented programming so why wait join
now course link is in the description
box below before understanding how to
become big data engineer let's quickly
understand the term big data so what is
Big Data in the early 20s data
generation was limited but the emergence
of social media and Global Corporation
has led to an exponential data explosion
related to reach 175 zettabytes by 2025
Big Data encompasses structured
semi-structure and unstructured data
requiring Advanced Frameworks like
Hadoop and Spark Big Data engineer
navigate this landscape and we will
explore their Road and roadmap ahead so
job roles under big data and the
salaries career opportunities in the
field of Big Data are endless as
organizations rely on the big data for
crucial decision making the average
salary of Big Data engineer in the U.S
is around 90 000 and in India the
average salary is around 7 lakh rupees
in addition to the job role of a big
data engineer there are few more job
profiles in this field they are big data
administrator Big Data architect big
data analyst Big Data developer and Big
Data scientists so moving forward let's
see roadmap of a big data engineer so
the first one is you have to acquiring
skills to excel as in prominent data
engineer a strong foundation in computer
science is imperative start by pursuing
a bachelor degree in computer science or
a related field this will give you a
comprehensive understanding of
programming languages algorithms data
structure and database management system
memorize yourself with languages like
Java python or Scala which are commonly
used in Big Data engineering the second
one is to develop Proficiency in data
processing Frameworks
focus on acquiring expertise in popular
data processing Frameworks like Apache
Hadoop and Apache spark are two widely
used framework that you should
prioritize Hadoop enables distributed
processing of large data set across
clusters of computer while spark
provides the fastest and flexible data
processing engine mastering these
framework will open doors to numerous
opportunities in the Big Data industry
then gain experience with distributed
System since big data is typically
processed on a distributed system it is
crucial to gain hands-experience in this
area
memorize yourself with distribution file
system like sdfs Hadoop distributed file
system and cloud storage services like
Amazon S3 and Google's cloud storage
moving forward Master data extraction
transformation and loading ETL data ETL
is critical process in Big Data
engineering you need to extract data
from various sources transform it into a
usable format and load it into the
appropriate system for analysis gain
Proficiency in ETL tools and
Technologies such as Apache Kafka Apache
nifi or Talent understanding data
integration and data Quality Concepts
will enable you to handle complex data
pipelines effectively moving forward
consider taking a certified course
taking a certified course to become big
data engineer can be significant step
toward enhancing your skills and career
Prospect enroll in certified course like
post-graduate program in data
engineering by simple reason to embark
on a journey towards becoming a big data
engineer these programs offer exclusive
master classes by IBM and ask me
anything session by providing eight
times more live interaction in online
classes led by Industries so why wait
join now seats are feeling fast
the course link is in the description
box below moving forward let's see
