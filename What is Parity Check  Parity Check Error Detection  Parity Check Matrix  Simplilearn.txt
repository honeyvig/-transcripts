hi guys and welcome to yet and
interesting video by simply learn
in this session we will look into the
working of parity check which is a
network method used to check errors in
the data at the receiver site
but before we begin if you love watching

now without further ado let's take a
look at the agenda for today's session
to begin with we will look into what is
parity bit check
moving on with key points regarding the
parity check
and continuing with explained example on
the same
now let's continue with the first
heading that is
what is parity bit check
the parity bit is a data check bit added
to the original data for detecting
errors at the receiver side by checking
the integrity of the received data
the parity bit adds 1 or 0 to the
original data that is to be transmitted
to the receiver side
and if in case there is an error in the
received data the center side will do
the parity check and
give the request for re-transmission of
the data
now let's move on to the key points
regarding peri-debt check
to properly understand the working of
parity bit check
we need to understand some key points
where the first one is
redundant width
they are the extra binary width that are
added explicitly to the original data to
prevent the damage to the transmitted
data
or to detect the damage to the
transmitted data
they are also used to recover the
original data in case of a damage at the
receiver end
the number of redundant bits added
depends upon the type of check method
used
regarding which
in this example there are four data bits
used
whereas three redundant bits
it can also be two redundant bits
or one redundant bit
in case of parity check method only one
redundant bit is added to the original
data
now let's move on to the next key point
that is
parity bits
the parity bit check method is a method
to add binary bits to secure the
original data
that is done by counting the total
number of ones in the original data
which is either even or odd number
the parity bit check method is used to
detect error in the original data at the
receiver side and also in some cases it
is used to
correct the change
there are two types of parity bits
available to choose from the first one
is odd parity bit in this parity bit
check
the number of ones in the original data
including the parity bit should be order
number
for example
in the given example the number of green
tiles has
four ones that is even so the parity bit
should be 1 in this case to make the
total number of ones in the data
5 that is odd
similarly the other parity bit is known
as even parity bit
in this case of parity type the total
number of ones counted is to be even
including the parity bit for example
the number of ones in green tiles is
four that is even so the value of parity
bit should be zero in this case
the point to be noted is
the parity bit value should always be
correct because it acts as the error
detection method at the receiver side
now let's move on to the explained
example to consolidate all the things we
have learnt so far
the question is for the given data bit
that is 1 1 0 1 1 1 apply the even
parity bit check for data transmission
now let's begin
for the first step let's take the
original data
that is 1 1 0 1 1 1
and the parity bit value is to be given
as p
now according to the next step we have
to count the number of ones in the
original data
which will come out to be
5 bits
that means there are five ones in the
original data which represents an odd
number
to balance this according to even parity
bit now we have to add one in place of p
so the new data to be transmitted will
become 1 1 0
1 1 1
and 1
which will be transmitted to the
receiver side
by the sender side
after the data has reached the receiver
side there are a few cases that may
arise in the data
where case one is
the database received to transmission
has no errors that is the data received
is correct after applying the
parity-width check
which in this case is even
so the transmitted data is this
and the received data is this that means
both the transmitted data and received
data are same that means the received
data is correct
then the second case arises is the data
bit received to transmission has errors
that is the data received is damaged
after applying the even parity check
which in this case the transmitted data
is
and the received data has an 0 instead
of 1
which means the number of ones in this
case becomes 5
which does not match with the even
parity check so it has an error
and the last case case 3 in this the
data bit received through transmission
has errors that is the data received is
correct according to the even parity bit
because the transmitted data has
six ones
whereas the received data has four ones
but according to even parity check only
the number of ones should be even
that means the number of ones received
by the receiver side is four so
according to parity bit check it is
valid
but
according to the original data the
received data is wrong
these are the three main cases that may
arise
during the transmission of data through
parity check method
with this we have completed all the
headings regarding parity bit check
