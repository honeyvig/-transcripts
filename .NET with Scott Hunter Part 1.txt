>> On today's Visual Studio Toolbox,
Scott Hunter recaps all of
the amazing things the
.NET team showed it build.
[MUSIC]
Hi, welcome to Visual Studio Toolbox.
I'm your host and joining me today
is Scott Hunter. Hey, Scott.
>> How's it going, man?
>> Right. Thanks for
coming on the show.
>> I'm super excited to be here.
It's right after Build.
>> I know. I know you've
been pretty busy with Build,
they're a lot of things
that were announced.
What I thought we
would do in this show
is review what you
guys said at Build,
what you shipped, what you announced,
and then we'll spend time
talking about what it all means.
We'll give people
pointers to the videos
and the demos you and
Scott Hanselman did,
a great 30-minute video and
a really great hour-long
video that will
show people will have pointers to
everybody should go watch that.
Then what I really want to do is go
a little bit more high level and
figure out what it all means,
what you guys are thinking,
what we as .NET developers can
look forward to coming down the pike.
We'll do that all on our
reasonably short period of time.
>> Cool.
>> So let's start off
with a recap of Build.
>> Yeah, let's show a
couple of the slides
that I had at Build and share.
We always start off
talking about, Robert,
when you probably started using .NET,
you probably remember we used
to only have desktop and web.
>> I do.
>> Then over the years,
we've added Cloud,
mobile gaming, IoT, AI,
.NET's grown a ton.
People always ask me when
they see me, it's like,
well, .NET's been around 18 years.
How is .NET doing?
So we've added 1.5 million
.NET Core developers.
We shipped .NET Core
in March of 2017,
that's when the tool
showed in Visual Studio.
So it's only been about three years,
little more than three years.
Stack Overflow just ranked us in
their 2020 developer survey as
the most loved web framework
and the most loved
other frameworks that was both
ASP.NET Core and .NET Core.
For a project that
open-sourced in 2014,
we are one of the fastest,
highest velocity projects in GitHub.
C# is number 5 language in GitHub.
We're seven times
faster than NodeJS in
this tech environment benchmark, a
public benchmark that we work on.
A lot of the people that are
using our tools are brand new.
We have 40 percent of our NET
new developers are students.
>> Not only is ASP.NET core
seven times faster than NodeJS,
but it appears to be
dramatically faster than
ASP.NET based on the full framework.
>> That is true.
There's a variety of
reasons that come to that.
When we built ASP.NET web
forms on the version of
AS2 net system web that's
in .NET Framework,
we tried to maintain the most
compatibility we could with
classic ASP or ASP
server pages as what they
were called at the time.
So what we did is we took
all the objects from
ASP.NET or ASP server pages and
we cloned them into ASP.NET.
What this means is every request
that comes in to system web,
allocates all of those
objects which should have
been upwards of 20
or 30K per request.
If you look at something
like .NET core,
it allocates on the order
of 1 or 2K per request.
So there's a 28K difference
in the amount of memory used.
What you find as a developer
is the less memory you
allocate, the faster you go.
>> Yeah.
>> Let's talk about adoption.
So once again, I just said earlier,
we're 18 years into this thing.
Last year, we added over a million
brand new .NET developers.
Never used the tool before.
I think that 18 years into
the life of a framework,
that's a great number.
>> Yeah, it's amazing.
>> Six hundred thousands of
those were .NET core developers.
So you see that momentum
happening around our open-source,
cross-platform, lightweight
version of .NET.
Then the crazy thing is,
one of the visions of .NET core
was to run on Linux because we
saw the world of servers
moving to the Linux platform in
containers and stuff like that.
So we saw over a
million developers use
our tool chain to actually output
a Linux publish from that,
which is amazing to think,
we were Windows-only tech in 2014.
In 2019, we have over a
million publishes not
necessarily to the Cloud,
but at least to your local machine,
which you could copy somewhere.
>> Right.
>> Robert, you're so
familiar with this.
As we shipped .NET over the years,
whether it was 1.0 or 1.1,
2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5,
most of our developers took years to
move from one .NET the next .NET.
When I first joined Microsoft,
I struggled with
this, it's like, man,
it takes forever to get the
customer on the new version.
With .NET core 3, 75
percent of all of
our customers have at least
tried the new version within
the first six weeks of shipping it,
which is, that's never
been done before for us.
So it's super exciting.
Now, let's talk about some of
the new stuff that we
announced at Build.
We had two things that
we announced at Build.
We shipped Visual Studio 16.6,
which is the new version, supports
some of these new features.
That's the stuff that you can try
right now and then after that,
we're going to talk about some of
the stuff that goes beyond that.
First off, we shipped the new product
with .NET core 3.0 in September
of last year called Blazor.
Blazor isn't pretty cool tech.
It's like, if you go
to modern websites,
they all have what we call a
SPA, single-page application.
They feel desktopy when you click
around on the whole screen,
isn't redraw, they're very fluid.
Every app that you build
with Blazor works that way,
except normally those
SPA applications,
you write it with a
JavaScript framework like
Angular or React review.
But now, we let you actually
write these apps fully in .NET.
C#, they can run on the client and
C# they can run on the server.
At Build, we introduced
Blazor WebAssembly.
This is a really cool,
upgraded the tech
where we actually can
run C# inside of your browser.
So why might you want to do that?
Well, if your C#'s from
running in the browser,
it can take advantage of the
CPU on the user's computer.
It can run offline,
meaning that you
unplug the network, or
we did a demo at Build where we're
showing an app you might check at
a rental car facility
and maybe sometimes it
can't find the Internet.
Well, because the C# is
running in the browser,
it can keep running and storing
stuff in local storage.
Then when the network comes back,
I can re-synchronize to it.
When you build one of these
Blazor WebAssembly app for
you to checkbox to make
it a progressive web app,
and that's when the browser will say,
"Hey, this app can actually
run as a desktop app.
You want to install it as a desktop?"
You click that box in your
browser and then suddenly,
it'll show up on the Start menu.
It'll run without the
browser Chrome on it.
It's super cool.
It's now available in
the .NET Core 3.1 SDK.
We also announced that Dynacore 3
came out with WinForms
in individ get support.
Even today, we still have
millions of developers building
desktop apps because
these frameworks are
super fast and easy to build.
But we've been trying to catch
up on the tool side of this
and we shift 16.6 at Build,
but with 16.6 also came
to previews of 16.7,
and preview one of
16.7 is available now.
These can run side-by-side,
is close to having all of
the controls in the WinForm
designer available for you to use.
Once we ship 16.7 preview 2,
then we'll work on
third party controls.
But as a WinForm developer,
it's going to be easier to move
from .NET Framework to .NET Core
because you get that same designer
support that you expected.
Finally, the last big
announce at Build is,
we shipped a framework called
ML.NET about a year ago.
It's a done at framework for
building machine learning.
Machine learning is complicated.
Examples of ML.NET you're using
today that you're not aware of
is if you have a device that
supports Windows Hello,
that's where you can look
at the screen or the
camera and it will sign you
in, that's using ML.NET.
If you're using PowerPoint
and it suggests
some styles to you, that's ML.NET.
Our job in Visual Studio is to
make your life as a developer easier.
What we've done here is,
we have a tool inside of Visual
Studio where you can actually
go click the machine learning
kind of thing you want to do,
we'll walk you through
a wizard asking
for images or text or whatever,
and then we'll actually build
a model for you and inject
the source code to consume that model
directly in your application that you
don't have to know a lot
about machine learning.
We think this is a super
exciting direction.
>> That's cool. It seems like it has
the possibility of hiding a lot of
the plumbing that you might
eventually want to learn,
but to just get started,
be nice to not have to
figure that out first.
>> Exactly. Then we
go off the rails here a little
bit and we talked about,
this was a dream of mine.
I joined Microsoft in 2007,
and a bunch of my
colleagues, Phil Haack,
Scott Hanselman, Damon Edwards,
we all talked about this notion
of .NET at that point
in time was fragmented.
There was Silverlight,
there was Windows Phone,
there was compact framework,
there was Mono for Xamarin,
and could we get .NET back
to a simple platform?
We started with .NET Core,
but now that we've
shipped out in Core 3,
we want to drop that Core
Moniker and switch to .NET 5.
The idea here is,
let's take the best parts of .NET
Framework, .NET Core, and Mono,
and when I say the
best parts, I mean,
if you're going to build
a brand new app today,
we don't want to take the oldest tech
from .NET Framework and move it in.
We want to take the modern tech
you would use building a
brand new application.
>> Right.
>> Well, .NET might
have had .NET remoting.
Today, we think GRPC is
a much better solution.
So we don't want to bring it over.
We take the best of
those three frameworks,
we merge them together,
and that becomes .NET 5.
This will shift this November.
It has a single SDK that can
build all of those app types.
It's got a single BCL.
I mentioned before Mono,
and .NET Core, and .NET.
We want to have just one base
class libraries that
stands for the rest
of your strings and date-times
and a lot of the types user.
With .NET Core, we introduced this
new ability to say .NET new run.
We want all that to actually
be for all the app types.
We want to have awesome support
for cross-platform native UI.
If you want to build apps using
Native Controls that run on Windows,
Mac, Linux, iOS, Android,
we'd love to do that.
We want to have awesome
cross-platform web UI,
and I showed some of that today with
the blazer stuff we talked about.
We want to have, everybody's
heard these terms,
and I'm sure you've heard of
it a million times, Roberts,
Containers, Kubernetes,
Microservices, Docker.
We want .NET to be
awesome in that space.
Then of course, we always
want to make it better in
size and speed and diagnostics
and stuff like that.
We really think that the end of
this wave of .NET 5 and .NET 6,
that we're going to have
the best breed solutions
for all those different workloads.
>> But the one .NET
really appeals to me
because you wind right now,
there are three things.
There's .NET Framework,
there's .NET Core,
there's Xamarin running on Mono.
There might be something
that you want to use in
an App and then you discover
that that version of
the framework you're using
doesn't support that, right?
So I wanted to use Async
Main in a Xamarin App,
and it's possible I couldn't find it,
but I think it's because
Mono doesn't support it.
I'm not going to admit
how much time I spent
messing around with it until
it suddenly occurred to me,
"Oh, this just isn't
supported. Time to move on."
>> Yeah. One of our goals is,
and we hope this is
going to happen with
transition is we break
those seams down.
You get exactly the same features
for every one of those app types,
whether it's a desktop App,
a Cloud App, a mobile App,
an IoT App, a gaming App,
the exact same feature set
across every single thing,
the exact same tool chain.
I think it will really
help the platform.
We're going to do something
else cool as part of this
too, they're things exciting.
When I say single SDK,
one of the things that
.NET Framework sometimes
gets because it's big and
it's got a lot of stuff.
We want to make even the SDK modular,
which means when I
install the .NET 6 SDK,
all I'll get by
default is many class,
library and console Apps.
I'm not going to give you
desktop or ASP.NET or mobile
unless you ask for it.
So imagine having a
really, really tiny
lightweight SDK and you
do something like .NET
add mobile or .NET add Web.
I think that's going to be cool too.
We want to open it up to
the third parties as well.
So third party libraries
can actually do .NET add
their library and they can use
the same features that we're using
to compose our own framework.
>> Right.
>> This is a big area of stuff
that we talked about at Build.
Windows has some really cool
new features that's came out,
but any version of Windows just
came out about a week ago as well,
and that is the Windows 10, 2004.
It supports something called WSL.
WSL stands for the Windows
Subsystem for Linux,
and it lets you actually run Linux
native on your Windows machine.
This is cool for a .NET developer
because I can actually do,
build a Microservice, maybe
my target is actually
going to be Linux.
I'm going to run it on a
Linux server in the Cloud.
I can develop locally
in Visual Studio
and control that file
and F5 directly into
Linux just as fast and
naively as I can run it on
Windows on that same machine.
Always trying to make
microservices smaller.
So in this case, I showed a demo
where I took a microservice.
It was 45 minutes in .NET Core 3,
and .NET 5, it was 17 minutes.
>> Cool.
>> Then probably, the coolest
thing on his list of things
here, I'm sure you've
done this, Robert,
you need to have a .NET app and
maybe it's got a front-end app,
maybe it's a web front-end
and it's got a back-end app,
that's an ASP.NET Web API,
maybe it even needs a SQL Server.
Getting Visual Studio tool chain
to launch all those the right way
and swap the ports
between them is all
complicated, so we have
this good thing called tie.
With tie, I can
literally run the app one time
and will run all the apps.
Those apps can be either .NET
apps or they can be containers.
But you don't have to
write docker files.
That's if you just say, "I
want to run this image."
We'll go and do all the
heavy lifting for you,
and that's our investment
in the microservice space.
This is something that
you and I have talked
about before this, Robert,
and this is Cross-platform
Native apps.
>> Yes.
>> This is the exciting thing.
We're introducing .NET Multi-platform
App UI. That's a mouthful.
So we're going to abbreviate
that down to .NET MAUI.
Obviously, .NET MAUI runs
on the .NET platform.
What it gives you is it gives
you Cross-platform Native UI.
So against all those targets,
it'll do Windows, Mac,
iOS, and Android.
Hopefully, we can do Linux as well.
This is one of the coolest aspects.
If you've ever used a Xamarin
project, they're complicated.
They have a project for
each of the platforms.
So you have an Android project,
and an iOS project,
and a Windows project,
and Shared class library.
In this case, it's
one single project,
one single codebase to
build all those targets.
From that single project,
you use "Right click"
and say "Deploy".
From that deploy,
you'll get a list of
all the devices that you
might want to deploy to
and they'll just run.
One of the things that I showed
Robert a couple months ago,
is one of my favorite features,
it's a feature we've added to
Xamarin where I can
basically take a Windows PC,
plug in iPhone into the Windows PC,
and run my app on the iPhone.
>> Yeah.
>> I don't have to have a
Mac or any special things,
I can do it all with a free
developer account from Apple.
So for the first time ever,
you can actually build and
deploy for your own testing,
apps directly from
Windows to your iPhone.
>> Yeah.
>> This tech is actually just
an evolution of Xamarin.Forms.
I like to think that this is
the next gen of Xamarin.Forms.
So you're taking in what was
successful and then made it easier
to use with the single SDK,
the single projects that
run on multiple devices.
Something else I should
call out here is because
we can run on those multiple devices,
I can now build the app locally with
no emulators because I can just
run it on Windows or on my Mac.
I can build it locally
and run it on the Mac,
which means I don't have to wait for
the slower emulator to actually
work to get that app tech to run.
The .NET MAUI is going
to actually DNS,
they're calling the one .NET
is a .NET 5/.NET 6 wave.
We'll have previews of
.NET MAUI out with .NET
6 towards the RC of
.NET 5 later this year.
This is awesome Native UI.
One more thing I want to talk
about in this space, Robert,
is you might have had to
ask me, "What about UWP?"
A lot of customers
have asked us, well,
what are we doing with UWP?
>> Yeah, because the Windows
guys are talking about WinUI 3,
and then I've heard about their
plans for WinUI 4 and beyond.
So WinUI 3, I think, targets .NET 5,
and then they're talking
about WinUI 4 as being
the UI that will be
Native Cross-platform.
>> Exactly. So a lot of
customers have asked us, "Hey,
with .NET Core 3, where was
UWP?" Robert just nailed it.
The Windows team was already working
on something called WinUI 3,
and this is basically
an evolution of UWP.
It gives the developer more choices.
UWP requires our app to run
in a contained environment,
a container, which gave
it security constraints.
If you want to go to the file
system, that's hard to do.
UWP had different features
depending on the version
of Windows 10 you ran on.
WinUI 3 is very similar to .NET core
where they shift the actual
framework with your application,
which means it works on all
the versions of Windows 10.
As Robert said, it supports
both .NET 5 and C++.
The coding is, as you said, Robert,
if they get to the point
when there's a WinUI
4 that actually works
on all those platforms,
maybe even .NET MAUI uses
WinUI 4 as its back-end.
We don't know that yet. We have
to wait and see where things shift.
>> In addition to or instead
of Xamarin.Forms XAML?
>> Let me step back a second.
So what Xamarin.Forms does
today is it actually uses a
variety of different techs.
So if you're on iOS, it's
using the frameworks on iOS.
If you're using Android,
it's using the
frameworks for Android.
If you're using Windows today
with a Xamarin application,
it's using UWP as its implementation.
So for all the platforms that Xamarin
runs on or .NET MAUI in
the future will run on,
we use whatever the best Native tech
is for that platform to
render the controls.
So when you write a button,
it's a Windows button on Windows,
it's an iOS button on iOS,
it's Android button in Android.
So the .NET MAUI apps,
that's the rendering platform.
I think you were asking the question,
what about the XAML
that you actually use?
>> Yeah, that's true, and
there's a distinction.
>> Yeah. Separate those
two things a little bit
>> Okay. So as the set
of native controls,
that's what you were saying
MAUI would use moving forward?
>> Yes.
>> Then, there's the
question of what do you
use to layout the design time?
Is it XAML or does it wind up being
something entirely different?
So it was a great
conversation with Scott.
We then went on to talk
for another 20 minutes, so
we decided to split
the episodes in half.
Please join us for
Part 2 where we talk
about what this all
means for developers.
