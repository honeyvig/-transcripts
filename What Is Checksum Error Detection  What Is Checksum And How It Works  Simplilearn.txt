hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video by simply learn but
before we begin if you love watching

now without further Ado let's take a
look at the agenda for today's session
to begin with we will look into what is
checksum
continuing with why to apply checksum
method in a data Exchange
continuing with working steps involved
in the checksum
and in the end we will look at a solved
example for the same
now let's take a look at the first
setting that is checksum
the checksum is one of the most applied
error detection method in the network
channel
and is a bit based format detection
method
the checksum uses checksum generator on
the sender side to form the checksum
method and the checksum checker on the
receiver side to check whether this an
error in the data or not
let's continue with the next setting
that is why to apply checksum method
using the checksum method at the center
side the checksum value is added to the
original data to being transferred as an
error detection method whereas at the
receiver side it decodes the incoming
data from the sender side according to
the checksum method
to detect any changes in the given data
now let's move on to the working steps
involved in the checksum method
there are various steps involved in the
checksum method let's take a look at the
first step that is the first step begins
at the sender site where we divide the
original data into K Paths of n Bits
continuing with adding all the cave
blocks we have obtained
then the addition result is complemented
using one's complement
the data now obtained is known as the
checksum value
next let's look at the step two
data transmission after we have received
the checksum value from the checksum
method we will add it to the front of
the original data and transfer it to the
network channel to the receiver site
now step three
step three begins at the receiver site
that is
it will divide that is the receiver side
will divide the obtained original data
plus each XM value into clay box
and then add all the K blocks using
addition
after that we will complement the
obtained data
if the complement of 1 comes out to be
0.
that is no errors are received in the
data
and the receiver will accept the data
whereas for case 2 if the result is not
0 the received data is damaged
so the receiver will discard this data
and request for re-transmission of data
from the sender side
now after understanding all the points
regarding working
of the checksum method let's take a look
at a solved example to better understand
all the points
the question is for the given data
perform the checksum method
this is how we divided all the four
parts
each of these represents a key block
that is four blocks and eight bits in
each of the block that is n Bits
now for the first step that is at the
sender side
we will add all the given data
so the value would come out to be one
zero zero zero that would be 1
0 1 0 0 would be one
0 0 1 1 would be one carry 0 so 1 carry
plus one means zero plus one carry again
one carry plus one means zero and one
carry again
one zero one that is one carry 0 plus 1
plus 0 means one so one carry is over
this side
one plus zero is one one plus one is one
carry zero zero plus zero zero zero plus
zero is zero and zero and we have one
carry over here
so the obtained data would be 1 0 with
extra bit as this
now to resolve this issue we will now
add the extra carry to the obtained data
from the addition part that would be
1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0. now
add the sender side we will do one's
complement for the obtained addition
value that would come out to be one one
zero one one zero one zero that is the
checksum value
now this value addition to the original
data will be shared to the receiver side
where at the receiver side we will again
perform the addition method
and the value comes out to be
this along with two digits of extra bit
that is the carry again similarly we
will add this carry to the addition
value and get the new data that is all
ones now again going by the steps we
have to perform one complement for this
value obtained that comes out to be all
zeros that means the checksum value is 0
at the receiver side which indicates
that there are no errors in the received
data by the receiver side
with this we have completed all the
points regarding working of the checksum
method now to better understand all the
steps let's take up a quiz
that is for the given data find the
checksum value
where the given options can be one of
them you can give your answers in the
comment section

topic you can ask them in the comment
