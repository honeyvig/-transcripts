do you know that every day more than
30,000 websites face cyber attacks
showing the critical need for strong
network security in this video we will
explore Fireballs key tool in defending
against these threats you will learn
what firewalls do the different types
available and how they protect networks
from harmful attacks stay with us to
strengthen your understanding of network
security and learn how to protect your
own digital spaces so let's start with
what is a firewall so a firewall is
essentially a system designed to prevent
unauthorized access to or from a private
Network you can think of it as a barrier
that separates your internal network
from the external internet allowing only
traffic that meets a defined set of
security criteria to pass through let's
understand this with the help of an
example imagine your computer network as
your home the firewall acts like the
main door where it checks everyone at
the entrance and only lets in guest who
meet your strict criteria so this is the
example craving a career upgrade

whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back now before commencing with types of
firewalls just a quick info for you if
you are an aspiring cyber security
professional looking for online training
and certification from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts to enhance your
credibility then search no more simply
Lars postgraduate program in cyber
security from MIT University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
a right choice for more details you can

pin comment so after understanding that
a firewall acts as a protective barrier
for your network controlling access
based on network rules it's important to
recognize that not all Fireballs are
created equal there are several types of
firewalls each designed to fit different
security needs and network environments
so let's explore the most common types
to see how they vary and what makes each
of them unique in defending our digital
spaces so let's start with number one
that is Packet filtering firewalls so
these are the simplest types of
firewalls that make decisions based on
the packets or small chunks of data that
attempt to enter the network they check
information such as the intended receipt
and senders IP address packet type port
number and more against a set of rules
next comes the stateful inspection
firewall these are more sophisticated
because they remember the context of
previously allowed traffic which enables
them to make more informed decisions
about which packets to allow or deny
then comes proxy firewalls acting as an
intermediary between your network and
the internet these firewalls evaluate
request from an external network at the
application Level they are known for
providing high levels of privacy and
security then comes the Next Generation
firewalls ngfw these combine the
capabilities of the aforementioned
firewalls with additional features such
as encrypted traffic inspection
intrusion prevention systems and
advanced identity management they
provide comprehensive security Now
understanding this with the help of an
example so consider a scenario where a
packet filtering firewall acts as a
bouncer at a club's entrance checking
IDs while a ngfw is more like a VIP host
offering details scrunity and added
security features so understanding the
diverse types of firewalls from simple
packet filtering to advanc Next
Generation systems shows us their unique
roles in network protection now proper
configuration is crucial to maximize
their potential and now we'll shift the
focus to how we can effectively set up
these firewalls and correct
configuration is an ongoing task vital
for adapting to new threats and ensuring
robust network security next we will
delve into the Essen steps to configure
and maintain your firewall to meet
specific security needs so starting with
configuration and setup the number one
step you have to do is Define security
policies so establish guidelines based
on your Network's needs for example
restrict access to risky Geographic
locations or block social media during
work hours then comes setting firewall
rules Implement technical rules to
enforce policies like blocking
unencrypted incoming connections to
protect sensitive data then comes
segmenting your network Network divide
the network into zones with tailored
security rules to isolate and protect
different types of data and services
then comes managing access controls use
authentication and access control list
ACLS to ensure only authorized users
access specific network resources then
comes testing and monitoring after
configuring test the fire Vol to ensure
it works correctly and continuously
monitor Network traffic for suspicious
activity and then we have updating it
regularly so keep keep the firewall
software and rules updated to guard
against new threats and vulnerabilities
so now understand this with the help of
an example how we can configure it so
configuring a firewall is a ke to
setting up a security system in your
house you want it tight enough to keep
burglers out but not so tight that your
family members can't enter so having
established how to configure and set up
firewalls to suit your specific security
needs We Now understand that these are
critical First Steps in defending our
networks however the real test of a
firewalls Effectiveness comes when it
faces actual Network threats so let's
explore some of the common threats on
networks encounter and discuss how
well-configured Fireballs act as the
first line of defense against these
potential changes so in this Digital
World networks face a variety of threats
that can compromise data Integrity
privacy and functionality so now we'll
have a concise overview of common
Network threats and how Fireballs
provide crucial protection starting with
number one that is viruses and bombs so
these malicious programs can disrupt
operations steal information and spread
across the network firewalls help
prevent their spread by blocking
unauthorized excess and harmful
downloads then comes troan horses so
these appear Banning but perform
malicious activities discreetly
firewalls scan incoming traffic to
detect and block these threats before
the infiltrate the network then comes
the ransomware so this malware locks
away critical data demanding a ransom
for release firewalls reduce the risk by
preventing connections to risky IPS and
websites known for hosting rare and then
we have the fishing attacks Fishers use
deceitful emails or links to extract
sensitive information Fireballs with
integrated email security can filter out
such threats by scanning emails for
malicious links and attachments then
comes dose and Doos attacks denial of
service that is do and distributed
denial of service so these attacks
overwhelm the network making it
available firewalls mitigate these
attacks by limiting the rate of incoming
request and filtering out traffic from
suspicious resources so now understand
this with the help of an example so
let's imagine firewalls protect against
threats like viruses which can come
disguised as inconscious downloads so
they inspect incoming files and block
those that match known viruses similar
to how a security officer might check
bags at the entrance of prohibited items
so while firewalls are crucial for Ving
of common Network threats like viruses
rare and fishing attacks the evolving
landscape of cyber threats require even
more robust defenses so this is where
Advanced Fireball features come into
play next we will delve into these
sophisticated capabilities such as
intrusion detection and prevention
systems which are designed to enhance
the protective measures provided by
traditional firewalls so now we'll see
the advanced firewall features so modern
firewalls come equipped with a suit of
advanced features designed to provide
deeper security and handle sophisticated
threats number one is intrusion
detection systems IDs these systems
monitor Network traffic for suspicious
activity that may indicate a security
breach IDs alerts administrators about
potential threats allowing for Swift
action then comes intrusion prevention
systems IPS building on IDs capabilities
IPS not only detects threats but also
takes immediate action to block them
before they can cause harm this
proactive approach ensures that
potential attacks are stopped in their
tracks then comes DVI that is D packet
inspection unlike basic firewalls that
only check packet headers DPA examines
the data within the packet to uncover
malicious content or code that standard
inspections might miss this allows for a
more thorough analysis and better
security now we have application control
this feature allows firewalls to control
application access based on specific
policies ensuring that only safe and
necessary applications are allowed to
communicate or the network then we have
VPN support Advanced firewalls provide
VPN features to ensure secure and
encrypted connections between remote
users and the network protecting data
transmitted or the public internet now
we understand this with the help of an
example so imagine if a firewall with
IDs and IPS were a bodyguard IDs would
whisper in your ear about a Potential
Threat while IPS would block the threat
from approaching you so think point for
you guys maintaining a firewall is like
maintaining your car it needs regular
checks and tuneups to function optimally
and protect you reliably so that's a
wrap on firewalls and how they protect
networks from various threats remember
the strength of a network security lies
not just in having a firewall but in how
well it is configured and maintained if
