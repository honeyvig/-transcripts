move on on to the first topic which is
what is search engine marketing so a
search engine marketing or sem is a
strategy where businesses use paid ads
on search engine results pages scps to
boost visibility typically seen on
Google or Bing sem involves bidding on
keywords relevant to products or
Services when users search with those
keywords adds from successful biders
appear prominently it's like a shortcut
to be seen when people are looking for
something specific online advertisers
pay when someone clicks on their ad
which is known as pay per click that is
PPC the goal is to attract potential
customers actively seeking related
information sem complements search
engine optimization that is SEO efforts
by providing immediate visibility this
Dynamic marketing approach allows
businesses to tailor campaigns measure
performance and adjust strategies
quickly contributing to a more agile and
responsive online presence all right so
this was about search engine marketing
now let's understand why is it important
so with more people relying on the
internet to discover and buy products
search engine marketing has become a
vital for expanding a company's online
presence the majority of new website
visitors come from search engine queries
SC ensures that companies only pay for
ads when they lead to actual visits
making it a costeffective marketing
strategy moreover each visitors
contribute to improving a website's
ranking in organic search results unlike
social media where users aren't actively
seeking products or Services consumers
using search engines are often ready to
make a purchase the intent driven
approach makes sem powerful tool for
connecting with potential customers who
are actively seeking relevant
information ultimately boosting a
company's chances of making
sales so this was about why sem is
important now let's have have a look at
the difference between sem and
SEO so search engine marketing and
search engine optimizations play pivotal
roles in online marketing as involves
paying search engines like Google or
displaying ads and search results on the
other hand SEO does not require payments
to Google instead businesses aim to
secure a free sport in search results by
offering the most relevant content for
specific keywords sem is like a shortcut
where you pay for immediate visibility
while SEO is a long-term strategy
earning visibility organically ideally
combining both is a smart approach SEO
drives consistent traffic over time
especially at the top of the marketing
funnel while sem with its paid ads is a
cost- effective way to boost conversions
at the bottom of the funnel it's a
dynamic duo for comprehensive online
marketing strategy so this was about the
difference between search engine
marketing and search engine optimization
now let's understand how it works that
is how sem works so search engine
marketing works like a online
advertising when you search on Google
you see some results at the top with a
small ad tag those are sem ads
businesses pay to show their ads there
it's like putting up a billboard where
lots of people can see it here's how it
works first business choose a specific
words that is keywords related to what
they offer when someone searches using
these words if the business is Bid
enough money their ad can show up the
more they bid the higher the chance of
their ad gets seen imagine you have a
local bakery and you want more people to
know about your delicious cupcakes this
is where search engine marketing comes
in let's say someone is in your town is
craving for cupcakes and types yummy
cupcakes near me into Google if you have
set up sem campaign and bid on the right
keywords like yummy cupcakes your
bakery's ad may appear at the top of the
search results with a little ad tag now
picture a person seeing your ad and
thinking oh that's look tasty they click
on your ad visit your Bakery website and
maybe even place an order for cupcakes
so in this example sem helped your
bakery get noticed when someone was
actively searching for what you offer
cupcakes you paid a bit to Google but in
return you gathered a new customer it's
like putting up a sign saying hey we
have the cupcakes you're looking for
when someone is out searching for a
sweet treat now let's understand about
sem tools so search engine marketing
tools first we have is Sam Rush Sam Rush

people are searching for online it tells
you about popular keywords what your
competitors are doing and how your
website is doing compared to others it's
like a map of making your website stand
out in online crowd then there is Google
ads Keyword Planner Google ads Keyword

you pick the best words for your online
ads if you're a baker it suggests words
like delicious cupcakes or fresh
pastries to reach more people it's like
a helper for choosing the right words to
get noticed then there is Google Trends
so Google Trends shows what popular on
the internet right now whether it's a
new dance or the latest gadget it helps
you stay updated on what people are
talking about it's like a trending watch
friend keeping you in the loop all right
now moving on to the next topic
which is how do ad auctions work so
Google Bing and Yahoo use an auction
system for ads during every user search
in the Google ad auction various factors
decide which ad appears on the top of
the search results this includes the
quality score from Google ads Google
paperclick platform it's not just about
the budget relevance matters even if a
campaign has smaller budget it can beat
a bigger one if the content is more
fitting similar to organic rankings
factors like trust signals and web
traffic also influence who wins the ad
space in Google auction these ads go
through an auction process with each
user search in Google ads auction the
ads position isn't solely determined by
the campaign's budget the quality score
earned through Google ads plays a
significant role unlike a state forward
budget race the auction plays relevance
a smaller budget can Triumph if the ad
is more relevant to the user search
additionally organic search factors like
trust signals and web traffic also wait
in ensuring that auction isn't solely
about money but about showing the most
fitting ads to users so this was about
how ad auctions work now let's
understand sem campaign strategy so in
sem campaign strategy first we have is
keyword research so discover what
keywords people use when searching for
your product or service for instance if
you run a cupcake shop identify terms
like tasty cupcakes near me select these
keywords to connect with potential
customer actively looking for what you
offer so next is campaign creation
establish your online advertising
campaign craft straightforward ads with
appealing language for the cupcake shop
an ad could be delicious cupcakes order
Now set a budget for how much you are
willing to pay when someone clicks on
your ad keeping it simple and engaging
to attract
attention the next is measurement and
optimization evaluate the performance of
your ads track clicks and conversions if
results aren't satisfying adjust your
ads or
keywords constantly Define your approach
based on what resonates best with your
audience to improve outcomes over
time so this was about the SC campaign
