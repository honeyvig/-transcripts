welcome project management enthusiasts
to a journey through vital metrics that
power the engine of agile methodology
velocity burndown charts and burnup
charts in the fast-paced realm of
software development these tools are the
compass guiding teams to success imagine
having the ability to measure your
team's consistency and performance with
Precision velocity a numerical
reflection of completed work in each is
the heartbeat of agile projects it's a
difference between Kos and cohesion
providing a tangible metrics for teams
to gge and improve their efficiency
companies like Lucid atan use motion
uses this approach first up we will
understand what is a burndown chart then
we will have a look at the benefits of
burndown charts after that we will cover
what is burnup charts then we will study
about the benefits of burndown charts
and move on to what is velocity and at
the end we're going to conclude our
session with how to calculate the
velocity so guys let's start with what
is a burndown chart a burndown chart is
a graphical representation of work left
to do versus time it is a fundamental
tool in agile and scrum methodologies
which is used to track the progress of a
project by displaying the amount of work
that remains to be completed in a Sprint
simply put down a burndown chart is like
a visual map that shows how much work is
left to do in a project over time
imagine it as a graph where time goes
from left to right and the amount of
work remaining goes up and down in agile
and scrum it's crucial tool to see if
the team is on track the chart has ideal
line showing how much work should
decrease each day as a team Works they
can compare their progress in this line
it's a bit like Fitness tracker for
projects so this was all about the
burndown chart
now we will understand the benefits of
the burndown chart the benefits of
burndown charts are mainfold they
provide transparency and visibility to
the team progress enabling early
identification of potential issues or
bottlenecks additionally they facilitate
effective decision making by
highlighting deviations from the planned
work allowing for timely adjustments to
the project scope or resources next we
have is what is a burnup chart in agile
project management a burnup chart is
like a progress picture it shows how
much work has been done over a time what
cool is that it also displays the total
amount of work we plan to do known as
the scope so it's just not about what L
to do it also lets everyone to see how
projects plan has changed as we have
been working on it's a bit different
from the burndown chart and it only
focuses on what is left with burnup
chart you get the big picture of both
what's done and how how the project has
grown or changed along the way so we
just understood what is a burnup chart
next we will look at the benefits of the
burnup chart burnup chart offers
multifaceted benefits in agile project
management these charts provide a
holistic view of Project's progress by
facilitating both completed work and
total project scope this comprehensive
visibility AIDS in effective scope
management preventing scope gep and
aligning the project expectation burnup
charts also Empower informed decision-
making through real-time Data Insights
enhancing communication and
collaboration within team with
stakeholders and serves as a
motivational tool by highlighting the
milestones and achievements overall
burnup charts play a pivotal role in
promoting transparency aligning goals
and ensuring the success of agile
projects so these were some benefits of
a burnup chart now let's move on and
understand what is velocity just a quick

description box so what is velocity
velocity is a measure of how much work a
team can complete in a given period such
as Sprint or an iteration velocity is
calculated by adding up the estimated
effort or story points of task or user
stories that team has finished and
accepted as done imagine the team as a
group of Runners and the race as a
Sprint or an iteration in a project
velocity tells us how much work the team
can finish in that Sprint or iteration
to calculate velocity we must add up the
estimated effort or story points of all
the task or user stories that a team has
completed and accepted as done it's like
adding up the distances each Runner has
covered the race this gives us a measure
of the team's productivity and capacity
for work by tracking velocity over
multiple Sprint or iteration the team
can understand how much work they can
typically handle this helps them plan
and forecast asked how much work they
can complete in future Sprints if the
team's velocity is consistent it's like
knowing how fast the runners can go in
each race if the velocity changes it's
like the runners either speeding up or
slowing down in the race overall
velocity is a useful tool for teams to
understand and improve their
productivity in project management Now
we move on to the next topic that is how
to calculate the velocity velocity in
context of burnup charts are often used
in agile project management refers to
amount of work completed during a given
period of time to calculate velocity you
typically sum up the estimates of the
task completed in a given iteration or
Sprint this sum represents the total
amount of work completed by the team
during that time frame to calculate the
velocity follow these steps first at the
end of the Sprint sum up the story
points or task estimates for all the
completed work items second this sum
represents the velocity for that Sprint
for example if during two we Sprint the
team completes the estimated 30 story
points then the velocity of that Sprint
is 30 velocity is a useful metric for
predicting how much work a team can
complete in future Sprint it provides a
basis for forecasting project timelines
and helps in managing stakeholders
expectations understanding velocity can
also Aid in identifying Trends in team
productivity and in making informed
decisions about resource allocation and
project Planning by tracking velocity
over multiple Sprint team can gain
insights into their capacity and improve
their ability to deliver value
consistently so this is how the velocity
is calculated and there you have it
folks we have navigated the Dynamics and
the landscape of agile methodologies
uncovering the secrets behind velocity
burndown charts and burnup charts from
understanding the consistent delivery
management of velocity to visualizing
project progress with burndown charts
and gaining holistic insights through
burnup charts these tools are backbone
of successful agile project management
