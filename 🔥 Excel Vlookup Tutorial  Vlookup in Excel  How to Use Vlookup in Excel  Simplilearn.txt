hey everyone welcome to Simply learns
YouTube channel in this session we will
learn about we lookup function in Excel
but before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have daily updates on multiple
Technologies if you are a take gek in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
Trends then consider getting subscribed
to our YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply Lo now without
further Ado let's get started with V
lookup in
Excel so what exactly is vlookup
function basically V lookup function is
a lookup method involving to fetch the
data from a tabular data set Now vup
function is a pre-made function in Excel
which allows searches across columns so
basically we have three type of lookup
functions and B lookup is one of those
we have B lookup H lookup and X lookup V
lookup is vertical lookup H lookup is
horizontal lookup and X is a combination
of both V and H lookup so the Syntax for
V lookup is as follows so we will have a
lookup value that is the cell address or
the value which you are looking for and
the table array which is the range of
elements that you want to look out for
and the column is the resultant column
from which you want the result and the
match is it supposed to be an exact
match or the nearest match so I believe
the theoretical explanation of the
syntax is incomplete without having a
practical demonstration so let's get
back to Excel and try to execute some
view lookup functions so that you have a
a lookup function and especially a v
lookup function Works in Excel right we
are on the Excel spreadsheet right now
so let's start with our simple one right
so here I will have car and price so
here I will give up a drop- down menu
using data validation so that you can
simply choose the data right so we will
go to data data
validation list and the source will be
these are the ones for the source and
press okay you don't have to enter any
error messages Etc to no error messages
and more details on data validation in
Excel please go through the data
validation in Excel tutorial by simpl
down and now in the price section we
will have the V lookup function right
now the first one lookup value which is
this particular cell right so we look a
function will look for the value here so
let's say I give Lamborghini and then it
will fetch the cost of Lamborghini from
the table so where is it looking for the
value first lookup value is Lamborghini
which is right in front of car in the
cell E5 so that is the first parameter
we need to provide or attribute we need
to send out then the table array which
table array should it look for this is
the table array it looks for and I'm
eliminating the header over here we need
to eliminate the header and the column
index number right now we are giving car
name and now we want the price so in the
table car is column 1 price is column
two right even if this particular car
price is around anywhere in the table
car is still considered as column one
price is still considered as column two
so we need the value from column two
right so we will provide column number
two and the last one exact match we want
the exact match not appropriate match so
select that press on Tab to select now
close the value right close the bracket
now let's get back to card and now
select any one of the cars let's select
PMW right now when you selling BMW what
lookup is doing is it is first checking
the value here look up value sbmw so
since we got the value sbmw it will go
back to this particular table and fetch
for the name BMW right and now it has
the BMW data and now the third
parameters that is column two right so
it will check column two and see the
exact mat what is the value of the car
75 or
750 uh million right $7.5 million so
that will give you the data over here
that's it so that's how V lookup works
now this is still a fundamental
understanding of V lookup let's
elaborate a little more to understand it
in a much by right now I I have here the
flight data right and here you can see
when I select the
source and uh
destination and uh
flight which I want to fly in then it
it's giving me the price of the flight
and the route in which it is going how
did I do so let's do it practically
right so we will get back
here and uh here we'll do some
changes okay it's okay
fine now here we have
everything
the source and
destination airline price and route
let's also
provide
route Source will be again data
validation go to data data
validation will be a
list this is the list press okay and and
destination is again data validation
select
list and now the list of
destinations and the
airline is again a data validation
operation where you will give the set of
or the list of airlines which you are
offering and okay now comes the price
equals to we look
up passing these three
values and table array which is again
the
same the entire table except the
headers next will be the column number
so 1 2 3 4 and five price is in the
fifth column so I will pass column
number five and I want exact match not
appropriate match press tap to select
close the bracket and enter right and
same applies to Route so equals to or
you can just copy the formula and paste
it here and make a minor change that is
instead of column number five you want
column number four which has the route
data right so column number four has the
route data enter and there you go now
out of the drop down when you select
source as any U location here let's
select Mumbai and the destination as
Bangalore and Airline as let's fly in
air India and you have the price details
and the R so these particular ones you
can you know hide because the data is
coming over here so you can copy paste
it to this
place and let's hide these
things and you can also hide this one as
well
there you go now the data is visually a
little more appealing and you can kind
of have a complete you know dashboard
where you have uh the data of V lookup
results right so whenever you select any
source and give any
destination from the dropdown and choose
any of the flights you want to fly with
and you will have the data over here
right the price of the flight and the
root of the flight and that's how you
use V lookup in Excel so if you want to
