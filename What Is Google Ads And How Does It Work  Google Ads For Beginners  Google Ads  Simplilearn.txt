Ado let's get started so to kick off our
Google ads campaign we'll start by
creating a new campaign so once you're
logged into your Google ads account
Begin by clicking the blue plus new
campaign button so here you presented
with a list of campaign objectives now
choosing the right objective is crucial
because it guides Google ads on how to
optimize your campaign so let's see one
by one the first objective is sales so
this is perfect for businesses looking
to drive direct conversions whether it's
online purchases phone orders or
inperson sales so for instance if you
run an e-commerce tore this objective
will help you target users who are ready
to buy so Google will prioritize showing
your ads to people most likely to
complete a transaction based on their
behavior intent so this makes it ideal
for businesses focused on generating
immediate Revenue so you can use this
when your primary goal is to turn clicks
into sales making it perfect for
businesses with clear purchase Parts
like online stores or service providers
now next we have the leads objective so
this is designed for businesses that
want to gather contact information from
potential customers such as through form
submissions phone calls or signups so
for example imagine you are a real
estate agent aiming to build a list of
potential home buyers so by selecting
the leads objective Google ads will
optimize your campaign to reach users
likely to fill out your contact form or
call your office now next is website
traffic now this is the objective you'll
want to choose if your main goal is to
drive more visitors to your website so
this is particularly useful for
increasing brand awareness or getting
people to explore your products and
services online like for instance if
you're a blogger or a content creator so
this objective will help you attract
visitors to your site to engage with
your articles videos or any other
content that you put up so now next
comes app promotions so this is when you
have C created an app like for example
uh you know an online gaming app or
anything and you want more installs or
downloads now next you have awareness
and consideration so it is designed for
businesses that want to engage users and
engage them to think about their
products or services so this is
especially effective and introducing
something new to the market and then you
have local shop visits and promotions
and then you can also create a campaign
without a goals guidance okay so here we
are planning to give an example for lead
generation like how to generate lead for
our the online course provider so let's
select leads and continue now as we have
selected our objective it is generating
leads the next step is to choose your
campaign type so there are several
campaign types like Google ads offer
several types but the two most common
are search and display ads so anyways
let's start with the search ads so these
are the text based ads that appear at
the top of the Google search results
when someone searches for keywords
related to your business like for
example let's see let's just see car
details near me so your ad could appear
like this like as you can see the
sponsored ads so your ads could appear
at the top of the search results so this
is highly effective for capturing High
intern users so people who are actively
looking for what you offer now next we
have display ads so these are visually
engaging ads that appear across the
Google Display Network like which
includes websites like the ads basically
the ads you see in others websites apps
or even YouTube so now display ads are
perfect for building awareness and
keeping a brand top of mind so they work
with for retargeting like showing you
ads to people who have previously
visited your website but didn't take any
action now the next one is shopping ads
now shopping ads are a powerful tool for
e-commerce websites so these ads
showcase your products directly in the
search results complete with images
prizes and your stud like for example if
we search leather
jackets just a
second leather jacket yeah so your
shopping ad could appear displaying a
product image price and a link to
purchase directly from your website as
you can see here so this makes it easy
for potential customers to see what
you're offering and click through to buy
so shopping as a ideal if you're looking
to drive sales of physical products
providing a visual direct part to
purchase then we have video ads which is
another impactful way to reach your
audience especially on Plat video ads
you can create engaging content that
appear before during or other videos on
YouTube so it is basically the videos
like the ad videos that you see like
while watching your YouTube video and
then we have performance Max campaign so
this type uses Google's machine learning
to optimize your ads across all Google
properties like including search display
YouTube Gmail Etc so performance Max
campaigns are perfect when you want to
maximize your results without managing
multiple campaign types separately so
Google's algorithms will automatically
find the best combination of AD formats
and placements to meet your objectives
so right now we'll select the search
campaign type and we want like we'll be
giving lead form subm missions and let's
press continue and let's just keep like
lead
search so now that we have selected our
campaign type the next step is to set
your budget and bidding strategy so this
is crual as it determines how much
you're willing to spend and how Google
ads will manage your bids so now for
bidding since our objective in this
demos generate leads we'll choose
conversions so this strategy lets Google
automatically set your bids to get the
most conversions within your budget so
now you can set a Target cost per action
so this budget is the amount of
comfortable spending per action so like
you can just give 0.3 rupees you know
per action and let's press next now next
let's define our targeting options so
this step is about deciding who will see
your ads where they will see them and
when so you can Target users by location
as you can see all countries and
territories India or any other location
you have options so for example if your
store is in Delhi you might want to
Target only people within a 50 m radius
now additionally you can also refine
your audience based on demographic such
as age gender and household income so
this ensures your ads reach the most
relevant relevant customers and you can
also select the languages that your you
know customers speak like you can give
English you can give Hindi so you can
select multiple languages that your
target audiences speak and also you can
you know select the audience segments
like what your audience may be doing so
like for example we are actually you
know giving this example for lead
generation for a free online course
provider so what we do is we can
actually like our audience will be
students right so we can give students
yeah you can give current University
students and this is also for working
professionals so you can be
working education jobs it and Technical
so you can select who your target
audience are so effective targeting is
crucial for maximizing your ad spend so
take the time to consider who your ideal
customers are now let's go to next so
now next is selecting keywords so for
search ads keywords are the backb of
your campaign so these are the words or
phrases users type into Google when
looking for products or services like
yours so choose keywords that are
closely related to your business so for
example we are actually looking for lead
generation for this particular website
which is simply learn skill website that
provides free online courses so first
you have to give the final URL and then
then you have to enter your keywords you
can also you know type in the products
or services like you advertise like the
course name and everything and you can
enter the keywords now you can take the
help of Google's Keyword Planner for
keyword ideas and see how often they
searched so let's just go to Keyword
Planner discover new keywords so now
here you have to enter the products or
Services closely related to your
business so here I'll just type online
sry free online course
digital marketing so you can give so
many keywords okay and let's give get
results so now these are the keywords
that are suggested by the Keyword
Planner so what you can do is you can
just select the keywords like you can
select so many multiple keywords you can
copy it you can paste it here so this is
a demo that's why I've just taken you
know three to four keywords but in fact
you have to use more keywords so now you
have selected your keywords now it's
time to create your ad so your ad copy
includes the headline description and
display URL so this is what users will
see in the search results or across the
display Network so basically in your ad
so making it engaging and relevant so
first you can give the URL of your
website so in the headline you can grab
the attention by highlighting your key
offerings and including one of your main
keywords like for example you can give
Master digital marketing you can give
like you have to fill at least three
head lines so you can give free
digital in course or you can give
best and you can even fill more
headlines now you can use the
description so this is the description
part so you can use the description to
expand on your offer so like you can
highlight unique selling points of yours
like expert instructors for example you
can give expert
instructors
sorry or
flexible
learning or like enroll today to boost
your career Etc so once you have done
this let's go to next now this shows
your budget so as you can see we had
given like
0.244 cost per conversion so your weekly
cost will be 58,000 rupees so here you
can see the budget now the final step is
before we launch is important to review
all the details now Google ads will show
you a summary of your campaign settings
including your budg targeting keywords
and hand copy so you can double check so
next is the review so here you can
double check everything to ensure it
aligns with your objective so this will
take some time so so like once you're
satisfied you can publish your campaign
so your ads will start running shortly
and you can monitor the performance in
real time through dashboard so that's a
wrap on our Google ads campaign demo I
hope this guide has made it easier for
you to navigate the platform and create
effective ads that truly resonate with
your target audience so remember the key
to success with Google ads is continual
