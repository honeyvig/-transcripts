imagine creating an account on a new
website
you provide your email address and set a
password that you are confident
and you would not forget
what about the website owner how
securely are they going to store your
password
for website administrators they have
three alternatives
they can either store the passwords in a
plain text format
they can encrypt the passwords using an
encryption and decryption key
or they can store the passwords in a
hash value
let's have a look at each of these
when a password is stored in clean text
format it is considered to be the most
unsafe option since anyone in the
company can read your passwords a single
hack and a data server breach will
expose all the accounts credentials
without needing any extra effort
to counter this owners can encrypt the
passwords and keep them in the servers
as a second alternative
but that would mean they also have to
store the decryption key somewhere on
their servers
in the event of a data breach or the
server hack both the decryption key and
encrypted passwords will be leaked thus
making it a single point of failure
what if there was an option to store the
passwords after scrambling them
completely but with no way to decrypt
them
this is where hashing comes to play
since only the hashed values are stored
in the server
though encryption is needed with no
plain text passwords to protect your
credentials are safe from the website
administrators
considering all the pros cached
passwords are the industry standard when
it comes to storing credentials nowadays
hey everyone this is bible from simply
learn welcome to this video on what is
hashing
let's see the topics that we need to
cover today
we understand what is hashing and the
base concept behind its
implementation we move on to hash
functions and then take a look at the
guidelines that need to be followed when
setting the algorithm among other things
in the end we take a look into how we
can further strengthen hash values and
make them more resistant to being
cracked
before getting too deep into the topic
let's get a brief overview of how
hashing works
hashing is the process of scrambling a
piece of information or data beyond
recognition
we can achieve this by using hash
functions which are essentially
algorithms that perform mathematical
operations on the main plain text
the value generated after passing the
plaintext information through the hash
function is called the hash value digest
or in general just the hash of the
original data
while this may sound similar to
encryption the major difference is
hashes are meant to be irreversible
no decryption key can convert or digest
back to its original value
however a few hashing algorithms have
been broken due to the increase in
computational complexity of today's new
generation computers and processors
there are new algorithms that stand the
test of time and are still in news among
multiple areas for password storage
identity verification etc
like we discussed earlier websites use
hashing to store the user's passwords so
how do they make use of these hash
passwords
when a user signs up to create a new
account the password is then run through
the hash function and the resulting hash
value is stored on the servers
so the next time a user comes to login
to the account the password he enters is
passed through the same hash function
and compared to the hash stored on the
main server
if the newly calculated hash is the same
as the one stored on the website server
the password must have been correct
because according to hash functions
terminology same inputs will always
provide the same outputs
if the hashes do not match then the
password entered during login is not the
same as the password entered during the
sign up hence the login will be denied
this way no plain text passwords get
stored preventing both the owner from
snooping on user data and protecting
users privacy in the unfortunate event
of a data breach or a hack
apart from password storage hashing can
also be used to perform integrity checks
when a file is uploaded on the internet
the files hash value is generated and it
is uploaded along with the original
information
when a new user downloads the file he
can calculate the digest of the
downloaded file using the same hash
function
when the hash values are compared if
they match then file integrity has been
maintained and there has been no data
corruption
since so much important information is
being passed on to the hash function we
need to understand how they work
a hash function is a set of mathematical
calculations operated on two blocks of
data
the main input is broken down into two
blocks of similar size
the block size is dependent on the
algorithm that is being used
hash functions are designed to be one
way they shouldn't be reversible at
least by design
some algorithms like the previously
mentioned md5 have been compromised but
most secure algorithms are being used
today like the sha family of algorithms
the digest size is also dependent on the
respective algorithm being used
md5 has a digest of 128 bits while she
256 has a digest of 256 bits
this digest must always be the same for
the same input irrespective of how many
times the calculations are carried out
this is a very crucial feature since
comparing the hash value is the only way
to check if the data is untouched as the
functions are not reversible
there are certain requirements of a hash
function that need to be met before they
are accepted while some of them are easy
to guess others are placed in order to
preserve security in the long run
the hash function must be quick enough
to encrypt large amounts of data at a
relatively fast pace
but it also shouldn't be very fast
running the algorithm on all cylinders
makes the functions easy to boot force
and a security liability
there must be a balance to allow the
hash function to handle large amounts of
data and not make it ridiculously easy
to brute force by running through all
the possible combinations
the hash function must be dependent on
each bit of the input
the input can be text audio video or any
other file extension
if a single character is being changed
it doesn't matter how small that
character may be the entire digest must
have a distinctly different hash value
this is essential to create unique
digest for every password that is being
stored but what if two different users
are using the same password
since the hash function is the same for
all users both the digest will be the
same
this is called a hash collision
you may think this must be a rare
occasion where two users have exactly
the same password but that is not the
case
we have techniques like salting that can
be used to reduce these hash collisions
as we will discuss later in this video
you would be shocked to see the most
used passwords of 2020.
all of these passwords are laughably
insecure and since many people use the
same passwords repeatedly on different
websites cash collisions risks are more
common than one would expect
let's say the hash functions find two
users having the same password
how can they store both the hashes
without messing up the original data
this is where salting and peppering come
to play
salting is the process of adding a
random keyword to the end of the input
before it is passed on to the hash
function
this random keyword is unique for each
user on the system and it is called the
salt value or just the sort
so even if two passwords are exactly the
same the salt value will differ and so
will they digest
there is a small problem with this
process though
since the salt is unique for each user
they need to be stored in the database
along with the passwords and sometimes
even in plain text to speed up the
process of continuous verification
if the server is hacked then the hashes
will need to be brute forced which takes
a lot of time but if they receive the
salts as well the entire process becomes
very fast
this is something that peppering aims to
solve
peppering is the process of adding a
random string of data to the input
before passing them to the hash function
but this time the random string is not
unique for each user it is supposed to
be common for all users in the database
and the extra bit added is called the
pepper in this case
the pepper isn't stored on the servers
it is mostly hard coded onto the website
source code since it's going to be the
same for all credentials this way even
if the servers get hacked they will not
have the right paper needed to crack
into all the passwords
many websites use a combination of
salting and preparing to solve the
problem of hash collision and bolster
security since brute force takes such a
long time many hackers avoid taking the
effort the returns are mostly not worth
it and the possible combinations of
using both salting and peppery is
