1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,040
so hello there and welcome to a tutorial

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,170
my name is tender-back xin this time

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,100
we're gonna be going over something

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,509
really interesting I know you're all

5
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,610
gonna love it and this app is really fun

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,990
to test you because this is cold v he's

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,910
in tic-tac-toe and you'll see exactly

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,460
why I chose teasing for the word in just

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,270
a minute

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,730
the reason I chose teasing is because

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,560
well let's take tac toe game it's

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,320
impossible to beat you can only draw

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,039
with it and you can only lose against it

14
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,449
so let's get straight into it I'll

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,340
explain all the rules that falls the

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,070
basic algorithm it has and then we will

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,630
get straight into the code where I will

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,000
explain and I'll also give a little demo

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,070
and then I'll explain the code if you

20
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,300
can find any way to beat this game make

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,950
sure you tell me either in the comments

22
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,200
or mail me mail me my mail is tangent

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,820
Manion gmail.com and that will be in the

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,940
description if you don't understand that

25
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,949
so please tell me I will include a fix

26
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,440
in for that in my algorithm but let's

27
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,109
get started and as you can see here I

28
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,260
devised seven rules in tic-tac-toe these

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,659
are from Wikipedia link to this will be

30
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,220
down in the description below not

31
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,540
exactly sure who wrote this but that

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,549
will also be in the description but

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,520
these seven rules will help the computer

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,080
decide exactly what it needs to do on

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,909
this turn of its tic-tac-toe game so as

36
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,220
you can see the first rule is if you can

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,860
win win don't do anything else

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,689
don't walk your opponent from winning

39
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,119
just wait if you can win because you're

40
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,250
gonna end the game anyway and you would

41
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,790
have won next if your opponents about to

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,540
win block him from winning third if your

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,520
opponent tries to fork you block his

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,430
fork before he can and this doesn't

45
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,040
really apply to my algorithm because

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,320
it's really complicated but the rule for

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,840
humans is that fork the other player if

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,540
you could possibly could and if you

49
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,210
can't do all of these strategies then go

50
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,950
for the center if the center is taken

51
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,780
then go for the corners if the corners

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,110
are taken then go for the sides so I'm

53
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,020
gonna be sharing with you first of all

54
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,400
have an example of all the first the

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,650
first four rules actually the first

56
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,510
rules that the computer would use and

57
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,849
also just as an addition the fourth rule

58
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,799
that the human would use and then these

59
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,439
five six and seven rules I will explain

60
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,790
with an example game that I actually

61
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,530
played with the computer and I'll

62
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,450
explain all of its logic and reasoning

63
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,390
behind what the moves it did so let's

64
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,099
get started here I'm gonna start off

65
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,959
with rule number one which is if you

66
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,480
can't win just win don't bother doing

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,760
anything else so as you can see me here

68
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
we have a board and I'm just going to

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,500
start let's just say X is over here and

70
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,480
X isn't the most smartest of opponent

71
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,829
see it's a really new take back to a

72
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,930
player he hasn't played many games about

73
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,180
oh he's a really seasoned experienced

74
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,730
player so it isn't really a fair match

75
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,900
so let's just say all goes for the

76
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,019
center like most normal and most really

77
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,030
good take back to hers no that's where

78
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,689
you get the best moves so then let's

79
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,069
just say X goes over here for some

80
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:05,760
reason

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,900
now all we'll try it's best to go here

82
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,519
now what's gonna happen is let's just

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,650
say oh again isn't the brightest and he

84
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,870
doesn't realize that oh is threatening a

85
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,109
three X will play over here by mistake

86
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:23,220
Oh we'll play over here and win so this

87
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,230
is one of the examples if you can win

88
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,199
just win don't do anything else just win

89
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,370
that's it

90
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,620
apart from that we have the second rule

91
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,470
which is if your pony can win make sure

92
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,419
you block him let's just give a little

93
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,389
example this let's just say X plays over

94
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:44,760
here let's just say maybe old plays over

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,810
here or actually no I'm going to say X I

96
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,440
mean o plays over here okay now let's

97
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,000
just say X plays over here okay now X

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,370
can win like this so oh it's gonna play

99
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,819
over here now okay one like this so X is

100
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,440
gonna play over here and the rest of

101
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,090
this game would probably end in a draw

102
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,440
unless one of them can think of

103
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,540
something really smart to do or if one

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,859
of them makes a really foolish mistake

105
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,919
after that we have if your opponent

106
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,470
tries to fork you block that opponent

107
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,199
from forking so let's actually see how

108
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,250
this works

109
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,979
so the basic fork strategy that I've

110
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,700
learnt is that you choose a corner look

111
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,480
around it

112
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,150
try to fill these and try to fill the

113
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,220
inside then try to essentially kill it

114
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,560
then you actually do have two openings

115
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,120
here and then your opponent can't block

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,650
and just in case you were wondering

117
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,540
exactly what fork is let me explain that

118
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,670
to you right now a fork is when you have

119
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,620
two openings in six Actos that you could

120
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,800
possibly win and forking is actually one

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,620
of the most challenging tactics first of

122
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,110
all but it's also the best tactic if you

123
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,060
want to win and this to me doesn't work

124
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,710
if you play with one player because they

125
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,480
will eventually find out what you always

126
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,300
do in a game and they're always they're

127
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,480
gonna know how to actually go against

128
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,730
you so that's why this is really good

129
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,950
against new players who really don't

130
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,050
know much tic-tac-toe that they don't

131
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,940
have enough experience they don't know

132
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,620
what sort of trick you're doing on them

133
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,400
but they do make lots of silly mistakes

134
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,020
so let's just start here let's say X

135
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,420
wants to win this fork let's just give a

136
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,540
proper example of forking and that X

137
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,830
wins with this fork so X will start here

138
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,800
and since o is a pretty nice player

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,050
he'll say that ok you didn't go for a

140
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,630
corner or a side or the center so that

141
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,210
means you're bad at this so then all

142
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,430
would just get really overconfident and

143
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,060
he'll just place his over there okay

144
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,090
next X will play over here Oh still

145
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,830
really thinks that he's a master of this

146
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,340
thing and he just plays over here okay

147
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,250
oh it doesn't realize it but if X were

148
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,470
to play here now you would have two ways

149
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,890
for him to win so X will play here and

150
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,900
now X can either place here or here in

151
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,600
his next turn and he would always win so

152
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,430
now there's zero possible ways for o to

153
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,490
win I guess for example o goes here X

154
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,830
place here in wins and let's just

155
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,730
recreate this quickly when this and

156
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,490
let's just say again oh there's this now

157
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,890
for example o will play here X will play

158
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,500
here and win so no matter what this fork

159
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,750
attack will always work against almost

160
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,690
always work against newer players and it

161
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,280
you really works it's a really good

162
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,640
tactic but thing is our computer as I

163
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,540
said is

164
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,460
it's smart enough or at least I didn't

165
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,260
program it because that would be a lot

166
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,660
of code to actually fork however it can

167
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,210
defend against support attacks I'm

168
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,280
wondering how does it defend against a

169
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,870
fork attack well let me just tell you

170
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,530
right now the way it defends is let's

171
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,810
just say it's going to look at all of

172
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,360
these corners and it'll check around

173
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,270
them if any two are filled up then just

174
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,190
fill up those corners immediately

175
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,010
so for example let's just say X is over

176
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,710
here o which it's a computer will

177
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,330
automatically go here because as you can

178
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,960
see taking the court says Center is its

179
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,840
top priority as long as there's no other

180
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,830
strategies possible so it'll take the oh

181
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,590
in the center and then what will happen

182
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,750
X will go over here trying to over smart

183
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,240
pickle or outsmart the computer but then

184
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,070
over around this and create this little

185
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,750
thing this means that these two are

186
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,610
basically wasted now they can't really

187
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,780
fork anymore you could also go like this

188
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,310
but then again it would go this and then

189
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,620
it's basically almost a tie game now and

190
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,640
as you can see o has also created a fork

191
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,880
oh I've gone here in one but it's just a

192
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,640
bit more fun to do this so as you can

193
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,220
see now there's a fork for oh he can

194
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,380
either go like this or like this so

195
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,420
let's just say he decides to go like

196
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,650
this and Oh will win no matter what here

197
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,440
so that really sums that up now in order

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,480
to explain the rest of this I don't want

199
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,610
to give you lots more examples so I'm

200
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,860
gonna do is I'm going to explain an

201
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,630
actual example game that I played with

202
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,950
the computer and I wanted to explain

203
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,140
exactly what the computer thought behind

204
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,280
every single move it did now let's get

205
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,030
started I'm X the computers Oh so as

206
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,190
tic-tac-toe convention says I will be

207
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,770
going first because I'm X so I always I

208
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,110
take the center first usually okay I

209
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,720
took the center now the computer is like

210
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,180
okay this i connect I can't use a

211
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,280
strategy it'll that's just out of the

212
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,590
picture so what should I do now I can't

213
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,150
take the center I should take a corner

214
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,750
so it picks this corner over here so

215
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,070
that's what the reasoning was

216
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,710
behind this corner they've picked after

217
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,770
that I decided to place an X over here

218
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,140
this allowed me to threaten an attack

219
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,160
this way

220
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,830
on a diagonal but then the computer

221
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,250
realized that and put an O there this

222
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,380
means that the computer found out that I

223
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,300
was about to win so it blocked me from

224
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,080
winning then what's gonna happen is I

225
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,600
just place an X here and at this point I

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,780
you I placed an X here in order to block

227
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,300
these two O's from meeting I did not all

228
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,490
realize that I had just created an

229
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,920
opening for me to win so what happened

230
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,440
the computer did realize that so it

231
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,390
tried to its best to block me over there

232
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,970
and so I actually wondered why didn't it

233
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,040
just go for this corner why did it have

234
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,000
to go up here then I found out that okay

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,890
there actually wasn't opening for me to

236
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,260
win and so it chose this so I I don't

237
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,620
win and then what happens is that I

238
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,780
threatened an attack like this over in

239
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,740
this way and then what happens is the o

240
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,150
decides to block here and then over here

241
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,400
so it becomes a tie game no one wins the

242
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,340
computer is amazing at this so now we

243
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,830
will be getting into the Mac part again

244
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,630
if you find any way to beat this please

245
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,310
mail me at tad you manage gmail.com my

246
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,830
mail will be in the description yeah

247
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,120
let's get to the Mac parts and you can

248
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,340
also comment it down those in the video

249
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,860
comments and yeah let's get to the Mac

250
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,450
part so welcome to the back part of the

251
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,430
video and now we will explaining the

252
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,850
code and giving a life's little demo so

253
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,850
now I will be giving you a demo and

254
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,250
let's start so as you can see this is a

255
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,650
blank UI and I'm just gonna start in the

256
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,960
center as most good tic-tac-toe players

257
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,320
do I guess start in the center the app

258
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,260
will automatically put it over here I'm

259
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,330
just gonna click over here now and it

260
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,010
the text that I'm about to win and it

261
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,120
blocks me from winning

262
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,590
because it doesn't want me to win of

263
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,560
course I'm gonna close it here again

264
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,900
blocks me from winning now there's no

265
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,880
way either of us could possibly win I

266
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,160
mean I could do a diagonal but of course

267
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,440
it's too smart and then of course this

268
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,350
will actually try to win but then I just

269
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:04,840
do that

270
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,860
and we're gonna draw so then I can just

271
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,590
continue reset let's just play one more

272
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,860
example game all right here as you can

273
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,050
see it went concentr immediately because

274
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,120
it really asked you and then it tried to

275
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,140
block me here I'm gonna block it here

276
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,930
it's going to try to well it just took

277
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,820
this corner because there was nowhere

278
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,890
else for it to go I mean it could have

279
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,680
gone when they here but it isn't smart

280
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,990
enough to do that yet as you can see

281
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,400
then we can block it yet but I mean this

282
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,740
app will always either end up in a draw

283
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,040
or a win for the computer so this is

284
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
pretty nice and easy but let me just you

285
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,300
know at the whiteboard I gave you that

286
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,490
little example game I'm just going to

287
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,080
recreate that here so you can actually

288
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,570
see the app doing it so let's just start

289
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,520
as you can see the first move that I did

290
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,670
was play in the center the app will

291
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,130
automatically play here next I played

292
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,320
over here threatening an attack over

293
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,080
here so that I could win but then the

294
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,240
computer blocks and also makes a way for

295
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,270
it to win on its next turn however I

296
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,230
block that and I create a little gateway

297
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,720
for me to win and I didn't even realize

298
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,400
this but the computer did so if place

299
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,050
down and oh here and block you from

300
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,080
winning next I place down an X here

301
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,330
threatening over here however in place

302
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,339
down and oh and as you can see this all

303
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,980
could either continue extend or I could

304
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,560
just place it here and we end in a draw

305
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,839
of course because the computer is smart

306
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,910
enough to know exactly what move to do

307
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,830
at what time so that we either end in a

308
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,270
draw or a win so now we can reset and

309
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,520
I'm going to continue with explaining

310
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,589
the code so as you can see we have

311
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:54,250
classroom control and we have 9 IB

312
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,770
outlets for each UI button these are all

313
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,180
UI buttons if you didn't know already

314
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,350
each one of these I guess ok

315
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,390
so apart from that we have our reset

316
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,220
button and output label also which I

317
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,630
will just quickly show to you this is

318
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,010
the output label this is the reset

319
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,990
button the reason we create IB outlets

320
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,310
for this because we need to hide and

321
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,770
show them next we have the game over

322
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,190
which

323
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,620
tells us if our game is over and we also

324
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,200
have our plays array or a dictionary

325
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,420
which is an INT dictionary which will

326
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,900
store all of our grids and their status

327
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,390
and if you just come over here quickly

328
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,130
you'll see that this is the entire

329
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,760
dictionary in its full form so there's 0

330
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,710
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 for each ID for each

331
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,030
little grid or block next we have a

332
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,940
timer this timer will set the correct

333
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,600
colors for each little square every 0.01

334
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,830
seconds that's like 0 1 what's after

335
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:08,170
milli it's forgot after 4 millions so

336
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,020
it's 1 millisecond basically and then

337
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,060
what it's every one millisecond it's

338
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,860
going to look at it and it's going to

339
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,170
say ok I'm sorry every 10 milliseconds

340
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,120
and so what it's gonna do every 10

341
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,250
milliseconds it's going to set each

342
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,760
correct color over here so this one will

343
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,470
be green this one will a black and some

344
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,260
lemon red because all those are so to be

345
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,800
read all greens are to be all acts as a

346
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,560
social green and all underscores this

347
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,830
will be black so then let's get back to

348
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,950
our buted load we are resetting our

349
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,300
entire grid being also set and then we

350
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
are setting the timer to every 10

351
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,600
milliseconds I will change the colors or

352
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,670
it will actually execute the function

353
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,710
change colors with no user info and make

354
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,420
sure our piece then we have our change

355
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,670
colors function as you can see pretty

356
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,339
simple it just sets the color for each

357
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,300
button depending on which button it is

358
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,250
then we have a button clicked function

359
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,550
this is called whenever we click on one

360
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,880
of these grid buttons and depending on

361
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,070
which button it is it'll take out the

362
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,030
button ID and it will essentially just

363
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,589
take that button ID set the it'll check

364
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:30,770
ok

365
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,520
if look if the grid the specific little

366
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,560
node at that ID already has an O do not

367
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,830
give it X if it's blank then give it X

368
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,649
so that's how it works over there that's

369
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,330
what we're doing then we're checking if

370
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,420
it placed the X then you want to reset

371
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,990
the view check for a win on both X and O

372
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,839
then do an AI turn and also reset the

373
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,480
view again the reset view just sets all

374
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,360
these texts for the buttons correctly as

375
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,610
you can see next we have the check for

376
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,160
win function or I have the check for win

377
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,180
function and so what we're checking if X

378
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,120
wins anyhow meaning they win by doing

379
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,440
this this this this this this or this or

380
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,820
this then it will tell us the X 1 and

381
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,370
just stop the game or it'll do the same

382
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,589
thing for o and it will also do the same

383
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:36,050
thing for a drop so it'll check if

384
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,240
there's no blank squares and no 1 1 then

385
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,450
it's a draw obviously after that we have

386
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,540
our reset view the reset mute function

387
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,579
sorry and inside of here we are checking

388
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,670
if the game is not over then we want to

389
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,209
set the correct title depending on what

390
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:56,720
Square is currently on meaning if

391
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,190
buttons 0 has the ID for plays 0 in the

392
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,670
dictionary then if that plays 0 is equal

393
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,970
to 0 then give it the O if it's 1 then

394
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,600
give it X or else just keep it the same

395
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,250
after that we had our reset clicked IB

396
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,530
action what that means is it will just

397
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,329
call the reset function and then the

398
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,429
reset function as you can see we are

399
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,760
just going for I in 0 8 meaning 1 2 9

400
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,250
and I guess you could call it plays I is

401
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,050
equal to negative 1 meaning we are

402
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,840
complete we are creating dictionary from

403
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,890
0 to 8 with each value being minus 1

404
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,420
then we are sending each buttons titles

405
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,660
to just underscores as as simple as it

406
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,520
possibly could be because these are just

407
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,169
little placeholders so that you can

408
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,530
actually see how it works

409
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,299
then we are just setting game over to

410
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,190
false we are hiding the reset button and

411
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,190
we are also hiding the output label then

412
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,559
what an AI does turn this is where

413
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,750
things get interesting and as you can

414
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,900
see from this Wikipedia page this is the

415
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,480
entire steps that Wikipedia gives you

416
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,169
and so I'm skipping two of these in my

417
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,900
program the first one is number 3 and

418
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,440
I'm also skipping number 6 so instead of

419
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,460
checking for basically I just check for

420
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,980
corners I don't check if I want to go to

421
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,750
the opposite corner I just check four

422
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,559
corners themselves that's it so that but

423
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,270
I mean it's still so far it works

424
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,110
perfectly it can only draw or win a game

425
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,240
so I don't really need to implement them

426
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,390
anyway so apart from that this is just

427
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,429
mainly a human strategy if you think

428
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:39,200
about it but for computers this is more

429
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,460
than enough to be drawn okay so the ad

430
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,590
does turn and also just one more little

431
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,350
piece of fact there's a variable called

432
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,480
current move which is the move that the

433
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,230
AI currently has in mind to do so it's

434
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,289
going to start by checking the last rule

435
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,539
it's when to check for an empty side if

436
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,130
there's an empty side the current move

437
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,980
will be one of those empty sides then

438
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,390
it'll check for empty corners if there's

439
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,250
an empty corner it'll be one of those

440
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,080
empty corners it'll continue like that

441
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,090
and keep sitting at the current move to

442
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,679
the best move that it thinks it's

443
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,900
currently possible then when it gets to

444
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,990
the end it will do that move and so if

445
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,150
the winged move is the best move that it

446
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,100
could do then it'll just the win if the

447
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,570
fourth is the best well it can't do a

448
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,490
fourth if blocking an opponent's fourth

449
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,140
is the best things we can do then it

450
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,419
will do that if the center is the best

451
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,640
if the empty corner or on the side of

452
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,580
the best it'll always do that so far

453
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,530
from that that's really all we have to

454
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,390
do there so as you can see first we are

455
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,799
creating the current move burial which

456
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:43,370
is a blank integer and then we are

457
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,470
playing the sides meaning we want to

458
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,870
check if there's an empty side and if

459
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,549
there is and you want to play to that

460
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:53,510
side so we want to check if plays one

461
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,750
meaning the first side is and

462
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,809
set it to 1 etc etc for all sides and

463
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:01,419
set them so that me want to check if

464
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:03,549
this core is available if there are of

465
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,490
course use the corners then we want to

466
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,020
check if the center is available if it

467
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,510
is music because that's usually a good

468
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,900
tactic then we want to block forks if we

469
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,650
detect a user trying to fork us well we

470
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,470
just block it so that they can't then we

471
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,600
want to check if the user can win and I

472
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,770
will tell you more about this code in

473
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,500
just a minute if they can then try your

474
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,289
best to block it and if you can win just

475
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:31,330
immediately win because obviously it's

476
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,039
gonna end the game no one else can win

477
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,730
and you've already won then we want to

478
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,470
actually play the move if there is a

479
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,260
move meaning it'll only play the move if

480
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,720
there is a move meaning if there's no

481
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,640
squares left to be filled it won't do

482
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,539
anything so here we are playing the move

483
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,270
so we're checking if let nothing is able

484
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,740
to current move meaning we have a move

485
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,200
then plays the current move is equal to

486
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,840
zero meaning set it to an O and then we

487
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,370
want to reset the view check for a win

488
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,580
and then you south of you again now as

489
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,580
you can see these two little if

490
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,919
statements are quite different from the

491
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,480
rest because these are using a flat

492
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,169
statements

493
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,630
let me explain them first of all let's

494
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,409
see block the user if they can win

495
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,900
basically this is going to set a

496
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,450
constant called win available to two in

497
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,730
our row which is a function I created

498
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,460
and it'll check if X has two in a row if

499
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,309
it does then you want to set the current

500
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:31,870
move to that when that's available for

501
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,580
them meaning it will try its best to

502
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,380
block it however if you can win meaning

503
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,630
there's two in a row for o then you want

504
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,400
to set the current move to the way that

505
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
you can actually win because that will

506
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,559
end the game and you will also one so

507
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,559
then we can actually play that move as

508
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,090
you can see I've already told you about

509
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,950
that code but let's see the two in a row

510
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,960
function as you can see this function

511
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,240
takes the players of string and the an

512
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,640
array as two as a dictionary of intent

513
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,700
and so this is pretty simple

514
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,020
I mean it's nice it's an integer or

515
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,340
dictionary and as you can see this is

516
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,170
how it's actually gonna look inside of

517
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,390
the program the reason I had this

518
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:22,250
dictionary is because I had a custom

519
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,440
array feature before but then I didn't

520
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,870
really use it so I just still have it

521
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,580
there and this will return an optional

522
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,550
aunt and my default this will return nil

523
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,410
and so what'll happen is if the player

524
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,560
is X then you want to check every single

525
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,630
possible almost every single possible

526
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,750
combination that X could have tuner like

527
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,260
this one this one or this one

528
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,370
and we want to do that for every single

529
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,200
one except for a few which I'll explain

530
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,230
later and then what's gonna happen is

531
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,770
we're also going to check for oh okay so

532
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,480
then that's there so we're checking

533
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,810
every single possible combination for a

534
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,710
two in a row

535
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,110
that could possibly be there and then

536
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,810
after that it just returns the blank one

537
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:13,700
so for example if let's say o has an

538
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,860
opening at 1 4 7 meaning that this and

539
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,020
this are occupied but this one is free

540
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,480
meaning we just draw it out for you

541
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,130
these two are occupied but this one is

542
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,010
free that means it will return 7 because

543
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,190
then we can move to 7 and win so that

544
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,830
just proves that that really understands

545
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,280
how it will have to use its moves and

546
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,020
then apart from that but it's really

547
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,640
simple and now if I were to run this one

548
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,670
once more we can just do one more sample

549
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,160
game let's just play a little bit more

550
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,800
smart this time so I want to play the

551
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,300
center so it doesn't get an opportunity

552
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,650
to attack me from the diagonal then I'm

553
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,580
going to play this corner then I went to

554
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,560
play on over here so it cannot beat me

555
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,000
then of course the plays over there for

556
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,450
some reason

557
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,760
oh yeah so it blocks me then I'm just

558
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,920
going to play over here item Li and play

559
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,420
over here as you can see it's a job

560
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,950
because the computer is so smart even

561
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,960
look human can't beat it and that just

562
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,900
means it's really smart so yeah that was

563
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,350
the app now let's good for the ending of

564
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,789
so the source code will be down in the

565
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:24,799
description below you can feel free to

566
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,710

you yet

568
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,450
