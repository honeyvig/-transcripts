and had your favorite food cooked for
you if so you may have followed the
steps described in the recipe to prepare
your delicious food this is what an
algorithm is a step-by-step procedure
for producing a final result
and algorithm is a method for solving a
problem or carrying out a task
algorithms are useful in problem solving
and is widely used in daily life it is
used in software development to provide
the system with a set of instructions
that allow the computer to perform tasks
and print the desired output Facebook
for example determines which post people
prefer as well as the order in which
they appear on the Facebook feed online
shopping Google search traffic signals
and so on are the other examples hey
everyone you are already watching simply
learn and in today's video we're gonna
be learning all about what is an
algorithm if you love watching videos

but before we begin with the topic
further I have a simple question for you
guys
and the question is which of the
following approaches is used to solve
the nq's problem and the options are
sorting algorithm backtracking algorithm
Brute Force algorithm or greedy
algorithm
if you know the answer please leave them
in the comments box below and the agenda
for today's session is
what is an algorithm
the importance of an algorithm and
moving ahead let us know the
characteristics of an algorithm then let
us understand the basic steps to write
an algorithm later the types of
algorithms and finally algorithm example
so first let us get started with what is
an algorithm
the algorithm is a step-by-step
procedure or set of instructions to be
followed to perform certain tasks for
example
algorithm takes input and performs
certain operations and finally produce a
result
we have importance of an algorithm
first
writing an algorithm helps student
develop structured thinking and
reasoning skills
next an algorithm can help to simplify a
complex Problem by breaking it down into
simple steps then it will increase the
efficiency of a computer program and
AIDS in the efficient use of resources
advancing we have characteristics of an
algorithm
first well-defined input as an input the
algorithms require a well-defined value
it might or may not accept input
then clear and unabody quiz the set of
instructions to be followed must be
clear and places in order to be
understood then comes language
independent a language independent
algorithm is one that can be written in
any programming language and still
produce the same result next feasible
when a problem can be broken down into
simple steps it becomes feasible and
easier to understand the logic next
findness
and orbital must be finite which means
it must have a finite set of countable
instructions to execute later
well-defined output the generated output
must be well defined and clear and it
must produce at least one output
now we know what is an algorithm and its
characteristics now it's time to know
the basic steps to write an algorithm
the first step is take values as an
input then perform operations on the
values and finally display the result
then there are different types of
algorithm so now let's Understand Each
one by one
first we have Brute Force algorithm
to design an algorithm this algorithm
employs the general logic structure it
is also known as an exhaustive search
orbital because it exhausts all possible
solution to a problem and is the
simplest approach to the problem
the next type of algorithm is gradient
radio algorithm is easy to set up and
executes instantly it follows the
problem-solving approaches or finding an
optimal result for the whole problem at
each stage
next we have branch and bond algorithm
the branch and bond algorithm divides
all feasible solution sets into smaller
subsets they are then evaluated further
to determine the solution it is used to
solve problems involving integer
programming
then
randomized algorithm
this algorithm reduces running time and
it takes input and output and for the
defined set of instruction it follows
described steps this algorithm uses a
random number to get the expected result
foreign
to construct solutions by searching
through all possible solutions when a
solution fails we go back to the point
of failure and build on the next
solution repeating the process until we
find the best solution
next
divide and conquer
divide and conquer algorithm enables
programmers to solve problems by
breaking them down into sub problems in
order to find the desired solution for
the valid input
next
sorting algorithm
the Sorting algorithm is used to arrange
the data in ascending or descending
order
finally we have hashing algorithm
the hashing algorithm accepts data and
converts it using a key element
now it's time to look at the algorithm
to find the product of two numbers
Step 1 we have start and in Step 2
declare variables in 1 and 2 and product
so here are the variables that is N1
into one product
so then in step 3 we are reading values
of variables N1 and into that means
taking values for N1 and N2 and in Step
4 multiply in 1 and into and store the
result in the variable product that is
whatever we are multiplying of the
values of N1 and N2 is Multiplied and
stored back in the product then in the
step 5 display product and step 6 stop
so let's see
the example
so as discussed in the algorithm we have
variables declaration and let the values
of N1 be 5 and N2 B10 so using the into
operator the value of N1 and N2 is
multiplied
and the result what we get is stored in
the variable called Product and finally
it will be displayed as an output so
here N1 value is 5 and into is 10 so we
are going to multiply it 5 into 10 is
equal to 50 and that is stored in the
product and displayed as an output so
with this we have come to the end of
this session on what is an algorithm I
hope this session was informative and
interesting until next time thank you
