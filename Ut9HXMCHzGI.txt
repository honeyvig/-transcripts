2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,010
now before I begin I would like to say a

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,109
big thank you to dr. Anna fan for

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,820
actually being a part of this video and

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,650
of course taking me more in depth into

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,750
one of my favorite topics quantum

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,140
computing and now let's get into it so

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,550
hello there and welcome to another

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,250
tutorial my name is Tammy Bakshi and

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,570
this time we're going to be going over

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,870
well an entirely new series that the

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,760
first video in a new series about

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,469
quantum mechanics from physics

14
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,200
especially quantum computing before we

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,780
begin I want introduce even Anna's was

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,180
actually a part of IEM research lab in

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,340
Melbourne so for begin with just meet

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,379
yourself hi I'm Anna one of the

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,719
researchers at IBM Research Affiliate I

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,539
am looking into clone computing that is

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,000
absolutely great and now let's run off

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
but a little bit about what cloud

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,539
computing is and really what quantum in

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,860
the first place

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,290
so before we again which one feels a

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,360
quick introduction to quantum mechanics

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,549
but for example it was a beginner who's

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,170
never heard of quantum physics before

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,900
how would you explain quantum to me so

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,750
quantum mechanics is a theory that

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,810
explains how things interact with each

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,850
other on a very very small scale so it's

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,100
very interesting very interesting thing

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,350
is at a very very small scale things act

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,390
very differently yeah you would expect

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,890
compared to the real world

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,900
for example if you had a bunch of pool

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,880
ball you expect them to hit off each

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,740
other and weave around and you can press

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,990
well with them sort of a set of quantum

41
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,939
pool balls may not act like that

42
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,140
sometimes they'll go through each other

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,670
sometimes they'll hit each other some

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,470
builders ignore each other

45
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,590
it's exactly now that's basically the

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,619
where world of quantum mechanics and so

47
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,270
today we're going to show you a little

48
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,860
bit more into the world of quantum

49
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,600
mechanics and quantum physics with a

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,520
bunch of different experiments including

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,869
proving static

52
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,609
mechanics or more specifically

53
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,429
entanglement actually exists using the

54
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,319
audience to experience we'll talk about

55
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,780
that it just on as well but before that

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,489
let's talk a little bit more about

57
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,190
duality quantum mechanics is absolutely

58
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,410
great for something knows dualities yeah

59
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,930
so the start of corner case really came

60
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,840
about in amount of 1900s where they were

61
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,819
looking at light the line was really

62
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,700
confusing because in some stages what

63
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,670
acted like a particle it's like a bunch

64
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,530
of protons little discreet packets of

65
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,540
life but then in other experiments it

66
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,569
acted as if another wave yeah so one of

67
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:40,920
the experiments that that looked in was

68
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,170
they've done a flip one yeah yeah looks

69
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,489
a little bit more about the double slit

70
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,920
experiment actually oh sure so now

71
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,410
imagine that you've got essentially one

72
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,329
world water right so this is just a

73
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,700
liquid and so if you're a little board

74
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,459
with two slits beside each other in the

75
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,129
water and if you were to throw a pebble

76
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,440
in the water just in from the board the

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,900
very middle and at the very end you have

78
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,849
a little sort of measurement board where

79
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,459
the higher the higher whole wave that

80
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,440
touches the board it'll make a brighter

81
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,739
line and it the way is this sure they're

82
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,380
like a different one also is actually

83
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,790
some animation to that on screen right

84
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,200
now if you're not completely getting my

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,109
my description but essentially for the

86
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,760
pebble and of course that creates a wave

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
the propagation thrown throughout the

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,900
liquid now when I actually was that when

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,569
you travels to to through the truth to

90
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,359
two slits what happens is a currents to

91
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,519
separate links up in those lips and

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,500
those two way to go ahead and travel

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,480
interfere with each other and create the

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,370
sort of interference pattern on the

95
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,950
measuring board or the other side

96
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,959
however if you do something similar with

97
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,120
saying marbles and so you've got no

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,340
liquids this time but you've got this

99
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,680
this board to slip it in our measurement

100
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,940
board which is just a piece of cardboard

101
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,459
and your marbles at that double slit

102
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,160
board randomly that's arcing this double

103
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,319
slit board just bounce it back however

104
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,840
some are actually going to slip and this

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,430
time instead of seeing an interference

106
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,590
pattern you're just seeing two lines on

107
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,310
the back

108
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,410
piece of cardboard and so in this case

109
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,150
you can see that we're not seeing an

110
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,050
interference pattern

111
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,240
however with quantum mechanics it works

112
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,410
a lot lot differently and so let's say

113
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,160
that you're selling electrons one by one

114
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,830
from one side to the other to another

115
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,810
before we're able you know explain where

116
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,550
the electrons hit and of course it's

117
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,700
going through these two slits now you

118
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,550
expect the electrons little particles to

119
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,590
act like the model and you see two

120
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,350
individual lines measurement board

121
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,900
however the really interesting part is

122
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,110
that you do not see those two one you

123
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,900
see an interference pattern using the

124
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,120
particles now the way this works is

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,270
really confusing the particle acts as a

126
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,000
wave and a particle at the same time

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,760
until it was observed by the variable

128
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,680
and it actually depends on where that

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,290
measurement takes a takes place as well

130
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,000
because if you measure it before the

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,450
board

132
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,910
yeah the electron has actually decided

133
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,800
which way it goes and with and did you

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,140
can actually see in heavier if you do

135
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,850
the measurement before the truth laying

136
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,790
around crazy exactly so that means that

137
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,800
if you're several electrons even one by

138
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,390
one so you're not coming like a bunch of

139
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,800
them they're interfering with each other

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,570
you're only from them one by one it

141
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,360
exists as a waste probabilities that

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,190
don't feel it that interferes with

143
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,990
itself and I creates the interference

144
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,210
pattern but it's centered but if you are

145
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,280
looking to the camera or something that

146
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,870
actually ended that interferes and

147
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,510
actually observes before it goes to the

148
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,210
Swift it doesn't go through both slits

149
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,820
at once it decides which will go through

150
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,370
in discrete two lines and there are lots

151
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,380
of other you know experiments talking

152
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,030
about how the house observed with a

153
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,800
quantum eraser experiment so much more

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,330
so we'll talk about that just yet

155
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,830
doesn't get a little bit too complicated

156
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,600
if you're interested in that I might

157
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
only some new video about those sorts of

158
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,990
experiments you can leave that down in

159
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,740
the comments below

160
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,080
but graph of that let's go ahead and

161
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,550
talk about another really interesting

162
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,210
concept known as superposition another

163
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,890
very interesting thing about quantum

164
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,500
mechanics is that when while particles

165
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,710
can also be waves all particles they can

166
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,969
also have some very

167
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,709
interesting properties so one of the

168
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,629
parties of fundamental particles is spin

169
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:24,209
and interesting thing about spin is that

170
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,909
a particle can either have a spin up or

171
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:30,449
spin down and in some situations it can

172
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,389
be inverse spin up or spin down and we

173
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,009
won't actually know which one it in

174
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,199
until we make a measurement and this has

175
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,039
some very interesting thought experiment

176
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,489
about that yeah and so that's a little

177
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:46,439
bit more about those showing your tax

178
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,679
revenue doctor and so essentially

179
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:52,949
showing your experiment ah basically the

180
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,139
starting to see how I think they need

181
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,689
quantum particles actually affect us in

182
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,969
our you know bigger world where regular

183
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,469
business enjoyment emits actually no

184
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,379
become works out so essentially this is

185
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,899
this experiment is a box and we thought

186
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:11,129
a we've got a cat inside of the box and

187
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,399
we've also got a radioactive particle uh

188
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,369
with some sort of you with some randomly

189
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:21,479
ran a vegetarian decay okay so if this

190
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,689
part was case a poison gas release which

191
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,429
killed the cat within a box there's no

192
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,110
way of knowing that this happened from

193
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,889
the outside and so in theory and so this

194
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,479
is where the super pollution comes in

195
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,300
that's a quantum particle and so it can

196
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,689
exist in the state of decayed and not

197
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,879
decayed at the exact same time and then

198
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,019
oh it's observed in existence or 50:56

199
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,179
and then the whole campus also involves

200
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:51,029
it within a 50-50 state of maybe being

201
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,759
alive or maybe being this long the gas

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,379
solar particle exactly and so until we

203
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,319
look inside of the box somehow and

204
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,659
observe what's actually happening within

205
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,629
the box we will never be sure whether

206
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,479
the cat is dead or alive it could be in

207
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,909
slow states at the same time in theory

208
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,399
inject it separate now I won't going to

209
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,139
be actual interpretation of the

210
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,639
many-worlds interpretation the cat

211
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,619
consciousness goes down a different

212
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,119
blood but anyway we don't get to that

213
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:24,389
right now but again if you request that

214
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:25,190
in the comments

215
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,690
we'll create a separate video about that

216
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,970
as well however for now well as you

217
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,010
mentioned spin is another very

218
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,419
interesting aspect and we sorts of

219
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,210
fundamentals or quantum particles but

220
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,010
there's also on your apartment spinning

221
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,960
in superposition there's also a really

222
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,210
other interesting aspect of these sorts

223
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,770
of quantum particles and how the actual

224
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,900
sidelines with quantum computing so

225
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,130
we'll talk a little bit more about in

226
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,500
Tanglers of how quantum particles can be

227
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,770
entangled yes sir there's as well as

228
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,630
particles having being unique you can

229
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,280
put a particular particle in a

230
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,990
superposition ask what you can also do

231
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,360
is set up a quantum mechanical system

232
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,790
whereby two quantum mechanical particles

233
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,950
can be entangled with each other so this

234
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,400
means that when you look at one or you

235
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,650
measure it or you compute with it or you

236
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,090
do some sort of experiment with it

237
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,520
you're going to affect the other one and

238
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,200
this actually doesn't matter how far

239
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,090
away they are apart well how good they

240
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,710
are so once they're entangled they're

241
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,180
always going to be entangled quantum

242
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,370
mechanically which means that if one has

243
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,200
been up yes the other one might always

244
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,240
be spin up or when it's been down the

245
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,220
other one has always been down and you

246
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,070
can do some very interesting confucius

247
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,630
computation with that and it's actually

248
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,870
caused another type of paradox similar

249
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,790
to surgeon is passed around a

250
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,850
communication issue so if you have a you

251
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,700
set up a quantum system of two consoles

252
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,860
here and instead of super super file

253
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,730
part yeah

254
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,170
and then sum of X measurements one you

255
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,180
instantly know what lives in the other

256
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,160
ones yes so this was the question of can

257
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,780
you actually have fun than like

258
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,850
communications yeah between two

259
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,240
different particles yes yes about that

260
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,340
yes I looked that was actually cool but

261
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,910
I'm saying

262
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,040
um popping telemarketer remember the

263
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,860
Southern Nevada by Topher and you can

264
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,930
actually do an experiment to test

265
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,830
whether the particles are entangled or

266
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,000
they actually have a hidden there's

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,370
exchanging hidden information behind the

268
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,140
other they decided beforehand that were

269
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,089
both going to be spin up were both going

270
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,460
to be spin down our weather is going to

271
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,700
be probabilistic and so on called this

272
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,709
spooky action

273
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:40,170
okay yes okay awesome elbow let's go a

274
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,330
little bit deeper into hug connection

275
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,910
use I'm still entanglement superposition

276
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,070
with quantum computing so now look at

277
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,160
how you can actually use IBM q but

278
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,080
before we get into the action lots of

279
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,880
experiment itself let's talk a little

280
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,920
bit more how can actually use the

281
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,050
supercomputers quantum computers

282
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,140
themselves that was all about quantum

283
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,670
computers ourselves first how do they

284
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,130
work what exactly are they okay they're

285
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,279
coding computers are computers that use

286
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,890
qubits to computer other than things so

287
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,540
the interesting thing about qubits is a

288
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,089
little bit a quantum business sorry one

289
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,589
of this is that you can put them in

290
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,570
superposition and then you can entangle

291
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,570
them they work by the laws of quantum

292
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,520
mechanics involving eternity and cilia

293
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,709
which is how all about you know laptops

294
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,290
today work and it's really interesting

295
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,839
because we think we can compute very

296
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,850
very different things on quantum

297
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,529
computers than we can on classical

298
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,050
computers it's all a really new exciting

299
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,680
era of computing yes yes I talk about

300
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,899
how these things actually work like a

301
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,209
little earlier how exactly these

302
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,040
processors work whether they look at how

303
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,110
having communicate with quantum bits

304
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,200
exactly sure so we can make quantum bits

305
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,110
in may different ways yes so one of the

306
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,079
easiest way to do it because atoms or

307
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,360
particles themselves have spin and we

308
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,190
try to interact with those spin yeah

309
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,350
that is one way to do it or if it's very

310
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,990
hard to get down to a clinical level and

311
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,779
and move them around and people actually

312
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,050
do that today using lasers okay okay at

313
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,839
IBM we actually use superconducting

314
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,810
circuits to act as our qubits okay so in

315
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,310
these little circus if the current is

316
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,050
going one direction that means it's in

317
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,180
the ground state or spin up or spin down

318
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,520
example or if the current going the

319
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,959
other direction that means our spit-up

320
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,420
yes and the problem with the

321
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,640
superconducting qubits is that you have

322
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,440
to have them at very very low

323
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,200
temperatures okay so they're actually at

324
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,320
a couple of nearly Kelvin okay sorry not

325
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,430
cool designer Jericho back to

326
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,370
perspective that is a lot lot lot colder

327
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,880
than for example out

328
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,180
okay Alex paces at about 2.7 Kelvin

329
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,029
we're at sort of 25 is nearly Kelvin

330
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,029
okay so you can see actually quite much

331
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:58,300
cooler than outer space and so now

332
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,690
though

333
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,399
Josefa new programs we all know that

334
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,829
sort of as a very bare level for

335
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,389
training where you work programming

336
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,329
computers using assembly assembler so

337
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,759
what exactly are we using for quantum

338
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,440
computers that is actually a new

339
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,350
interesting area of research right so we

340
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,660
program computers using first logic

341
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,000
gates yes and then assemble yeah and

342
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,290
then your higher-level like there's

343
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,060
there are going to be quantum computing

344
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,060
or you program your cutest using quantum

345
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,769
gates yes and on top of that we're

346
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,690
starting to build quantum assembly

347
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,029
languages IBM one is caught into the

348
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:33,220
closet and in the future we want to

349
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,089
figure out how to write those high-level

350
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,920
languages to go on top of that like C or

351
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,680
for Channel passes or on our Java these

352
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,870
days but at the moment we can also use

353
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,690
Python to write open closets to then

354
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,180
access our quantum computer yes is

355
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,519
really interesting but now though since

356
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,490
the head can actually use this quantum

357
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,610
computing will be angry MQ experience so

358
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,439
let's get over that now and as a

359
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,029
computer the point of power this

360
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:03,430
experiment is actually owned by IBM and

361
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,399
there in your town Research Lab yes so

362
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,860
in our youkai Research Lab anyone in a

363
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,079
freezer at almost a colder than outer

364
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:14,949
space we have a five qubit machine as

365
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:17,290
well as a 16 qubit machine which is free

366
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,209
for everybody to use on what is called

367
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,490
the IBM quantum experience and so I'll

368
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,410
be showing you here today yeah some

369
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,180
quantum experience actually I'll do

370
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,459
program in open glasses as well as this

371
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,620
great graphical user interface that

372
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,910
allows you to actually program these

373
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,550
quantum it to quantum computers that are

374
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,380
powering it to actually create different

375
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,180
forms and applications in fact it has

376
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,230
lots of different features like

377
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,180
simulating a quantum run run and

378
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,130
actually running it on a quantum

379
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,439
computer so for to actually go and

380
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,360
wonder a result you might want to

381
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,220
simulate it because the simulation just

382
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,839
gives you cleaner result because about

383
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,149
no error so it's very your finale wait

384
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:53,290
so that's where we've been you've got

385
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,960
one five machine and 116 qubit machines

386
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,790
ever'one something you have to go join

387
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,200
the queue yeah and you don't ever know

388
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,610
how long that he was going with it

389
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,020
exactly exactly

390
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,600
however now they'll get over to screen

391
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,250
recording or showing you how you can

392
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,630
actually use the queue experience okay

393
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,110
so this is the class of experience this

394
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,450
is how you can program two different

395
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,390
qubit floozies q0 and q1 and are two

396
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,160
different cubes and you can see down

397
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,260
here we can actually show you what our

398
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,540
quantum computing chip looks like I've

399
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,400
added currently active which is great

400
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,020
which means you could run on it if you

401
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,810
wanted to and you can see the particular

402
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,960
errors that we're getting on the on the

403
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,970
qubits themselves the error the readout

404
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,920
the qubit error as well as the current

405
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,660
temperature of the fridge so actually at

406
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,120
our 15 really Kelvin our cremeux is

407
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
lured a little high before when I said

408
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,070
25 so this particular experiment that

409
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,810
I've got running here or showing you

410
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,800
here is putting so here is a two qubits

411
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,350
and with time going along the x-axis

412
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,750
then this is called the composer and

413
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,150
what we do is you over time you put

414
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,880
Cupid escapes onto the qubits and then a

415
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,850
measurement at the end ah yes I actually

416
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,380
also just wanted that just to put that

417
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,820
two more push spectra for everyone as

418
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,850
around negative 273 degrees Celsius oh

419
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,150
yeah and we can talk very very cool

420
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,220
yes sorry that I forgot there were

421
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,840
neither would I want to cover your ear

422
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,350
right okay so this is actually one of a

423
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,890
four-part experiment that you do to try

424
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,550
and prove that quantum mechanics is

425
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,110
actually what causes entanglement and

426
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,050
not perhaps a hidden theory or hidden

427
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,060
information behind two entangled

428
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,910
particles because when the coil

429
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,920
mechanics first came out people given

430
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,390
the spooky action in the distance were

431
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,740
all thinking well maybe I'll apply for

432
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,930
the change information beforehand then

433
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,490
they went to two different places and we

434
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,080
just measuring the information that was

435
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,720
already there but they came up with an

436
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,840
experiment to try and test whether there

437
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,280
was actually information shared

438
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,500
beforehand or whether was entangled

439
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,840
particles and the way you do this is you

440
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,150
set up an entangled state and then you

441
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,030
do as a cup four different sets of

442
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,040
measurements on

443
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,949
entangled states this is one other sets

444
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,570
of measurements but of course you don't

445
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,360
want to have to drag and drop and check

446
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,699
and look at all the graphs to compare

447
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,490
for each of the 40 mistake that's why

448
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,959
we've created the we've got of FDA they

449
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,089
call it a piss kit sdk so you can

450
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,490
program the client experience or the

451
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,440
quantum computer using prison

452
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,470
okay so let's look over to that okay so

453
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,240
here um so this act this experiment it's

454
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,150
called the CHCs inequality named after

455
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,130
the four people who came up with it and

456
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,340
so the idea is you set up these space

457
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,830
and you measure them and you if with

458
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,420
quantum mechanics is actually a theory

459
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,330
and the qubits are entangled that we

460
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,240
should see some of this inequality being

461
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,080
above zero

462
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,820
this was actually some very interesting

463
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,280
research a couple papers were actually

464
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,840
written about this earlier

465
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,480
decentering of 2009 it's actually pretty

466
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,100
amazing that these days you can just

467
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,110
take the clothes and run it and get the

468
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,180
same back but it would have taken a team

469
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,240
of people helpful phd's probably to do

470
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,910
and that was only but eggs are using our

471
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:26,190
new so this is actually what a closet

472
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,380
looks like they're very assembler near

473
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,900
back yeah quite loud that you could we

474
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,720
can program the heisman to make the

475
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,730
assembler here that actually lined on to

476
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,680
the clone computer so he loved a lot so

477
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,120
does early are committing what they have

478
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,940
to wait during the video and you can see

479
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,150
here in this graph the red line there is

480
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,330
this theory and the blue dots are what

481
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,060
we get from the experiment and the two

482
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,880
blue lines are with pop and one is two

483
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,980
are okay so you can see that some of the

484
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,780
dots are actually above and below too

485
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,010
which proved that the theory is not a

486
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,160
hidden information yes very much so it's

487
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,520
possibly probably isn't angle

488
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,130
that is absolutely great so is there

489
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,240
anything else you want to share nothing

490
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,309
you experience when I'm in provides also

491
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,890
online through if you don't think that

492
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,289
Tommy is giving you enough information

493
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,970
there's also a lot of tutorials and

494
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,640
information about how to use the common

495
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
experience and some of the quantum

496
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,940
mechanics behind it for both people who

497
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,000
know linear algebra as well as people
