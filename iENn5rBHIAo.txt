hi traders welcome to the most
comprehensive trading view guide on the
Internet
[Music]
my name is matthew from zen and the art
of trading in this video i'm gonna break
down everything you see on your chart
from top left down to bottom right i'm
gonna show you how to navigate the
interface like a professional trader and
we're gonna do a deep dive on every
interface option on the trading view
platform so strap in this is gonna be a
long video I'll provide timestamps in
the description if you want to jump
ahead to a certain section so check that
out if you need to otherwise let's get
started but first of all if you
unfamiliar with training view trading
view is a cloud-based charting platform
and a social trading platform so that
means that it runs in your browser you
don't have to download anything to
access it just go to training view com
you can load any tradable market in the
world from crypto to stocks the Forex
futures commodities you name it
if it can be traded it's on the trading
view platform trading view is also
referred to as a social trading platform
and that's because it has social
elements so if I go to ideas here we'll
get a list of all the different ideas
posted by other traders on the platform
there's also a script section which
lists all the scripts and strategies
created by trading views users and over
here on the right there is public chat
rooms that you can discuss trading with
traders all around the world so it's
kind of like a social media platform a
charting platform a scripting platform
and a back testing platform all wrapped
up into one service so I'm a huge fan of
trading view if you haven't used it I
highly recommend you check it out I know
you're going to love it it really takes
trading and charting into the modern age
of cloud-based apps they also have a
mobile app if you want to download that
and check that out on your phone or your
tablet cloud-based means that it runs in
your browser you don't need to download
anything you don't need to leave the
system running in order for your alerts
to trigger or your scripts and
indicators to run once you set alerts on
the trading view platform they continue
to run 24/7 365 days a year only trading
view servers and you can access a lot of
the trading view functionality for free
you don't even need to pay any money
unless you want extra features so if you
don't have an account there'll be a link
in the video description to sign up and
without any further ado let's get into
the video guide so here we are on a
blank trading view chart layout now if
you've never used trading view before
this can all look a bit overwhelming but
I'll walk you through each of the
interface features in this video and by
the end of this video you'll have a firm
understanding of how trading view works
so here I am on a blank chart layout you
can access your chart layouts up here on
this little drop-down box here if you
click load chart layout here's a bunch
of chart layouts i've created depending
on your trading view plan you will have
a limited amount of chart layouts you
can create but this is where you load
existing chart layouts create new chart
layouts make a duplicate copy of your
current chart layout rename the chart
layout that you're using currently and
you can even turn sharing on or off so
that you can share your chart with
friends or colleagues other traders that
you work with now I would recommend
leaving autosave on this means that any
changes you make to your chart will be
saved every five minutes it's a good
idea to leave that on so that's all of
our chart layout options now for the
rest of this video I'm going to go over
all of the interface features from the
top left down to the bottom right so
there's a lot to cover this is gonna be
a long video but I'll leave timestamps
in the video description so let's get
started the first button we have in our
top left is our settings menu so this is
for general chart settings and here you
can access your chart layouts from this
top drop-down box as well as up here and
you have your orders save options
sharing options and your rename make a
copy you can even export your chart data
here too so if I wanted to export this
data into a CSV file into a spreadsheet
file I could do so here click export and
I'll get a file saved to my computer so
there's all kinds of reasons why you
might want this such as external
back-testing programs and that sort of
thing but we won't go into that in this
video because that's outside of the
scope of what I have to teach you today
but if you need to export your chart
data that's how you do it next up we
have our profile settings so here you
can go to your trading view profile you
can change your profile settings and you
access your account and billing
information all from this settings menu
so next up we have the Help Center so if
you click on this you will get access to
all of the various categories that you
need help with and there's a lot of
information here this is a great
resource for beginners to trading views
platform and they cover everything here
including an FAQ section there's a list
of keyboard shortcuts which we'll go
over later in this video you can also
request features from this menu and if I
scroll up to the top we have this button
up the top right my support tickets you
click on this there'll be a list of
support tickets these are all my support
tickets and the trading view team have
resolved every single one of these and
have done so quickly and they've always
been friendly so if you ever run into
any trouble with the trading view
platform just lodge a ticket and they
will get around to you as quickly as
they can and they are always extremely
helpful that's one of my favorite things
about trading view so we're not going to
go over all of these categories of
issues here but there's a lot of
articles a lot of information here so
this is the first place you should go if
you run into any trouble with the
platform so next up we have the
refer-a-friend
if you click on this you get a link here
that you can share to your audience if
you have a social media presence or just
a friends and other traders that you
want to tell about trading view and if
they sign up and upgrade to a paid plan
then you both get up to 30 dollars worth
of coins added to your accounts and you
can use these coins to purchase
subscriptions or renew existing
subscriptions and you can even use them
to donate money to stream authors which
is pretty cool moving on we have the
what's new section so if we click on
this and if we scroll down here is a
list of the various changes that have
been made to the trading view platform
so all of these links go to the blog the
official trading view blog where they go
into more information about the changes
and they are constantly updating and
upgrading the platform and that's
probably my second favorite thing about
trading view they have fantastic support
and they also have a very active
development team that is constantly
improving the platform and responding to
user suggestions and feedback so moving
on we have home that'll just take you to
the home page we have more which will
list the various trading ideas that are
published by other traders
various market information and indicator
scripts which we'll go over later in the
video next that we have the dark color
theme toggle if you toggle this off then
the charts turn bright white like this
so unless you are mostly using your
charts during the day
I'd recommend leaving this on because
it's much better on your eyes next up we
have the drawings panel toggle you can
turn the drawing panel sidebar on or off
here which is helpful if you don't use
it very often or if you have your
drawing tool favourites setup such as
these star icons next to all of these
drawing tools and we'll go over that
later in the video as well next up we
have the keyboard shortcuts now this is
fantastic this is a this is something
that I'm constantly learning new things
about myself there are so many keybinds
and keyboard shortcuts on the platform
that it's quite overwhelming and
impossible to memorize them all but if
you go through the list of keyboard
binds here you're guaranteed to find a
few that will dramatically improve your
workflow and speed up your efficiency
when it comes to chart analysis and just
navigating the charting platform so I'm
not going to go over all of these here
I'll leave that up to you but there is a
lot of information here a lot of
shortcuts including the pine editor
shortcuts
now the pine editor is a whole new bag
of worms and I'll only be covering the
complete basics of the Pioneer deter
because that is an entire subject of a
turn I've created an entire course on
this called the pine script mastery
course we're going a great information
great detail about how to use the
Pioneer data and how to create your own
scripts and I have several hours of
content on the Pioneer data so we're not
going to be going into that in this
video but I will give you a brief
overview of how it works and what it
looks like and what you can achieve with
it so that's it for the settings menu
it's a lot of information here and you
should be able to access everything you
need to regarding the charting platform
settings and support network and all of
that from this menu up here so let's
move on to the next box on our interface
which is the ticker box so here is where
you write in the market you want to load
on your charts so for example if I
wanted to see what the Australian dollar
was priced against the US dollar I just
write in aud/usd and I'll get a list of
all the
various exchanges that trading views
data allows me to load and if you just
click on any of these it will load the
price data onto your chart so it's very
easy to access markets through the
trading view platform now you can also
load markets simply by typing in to the
trading view platform itself if you
don't select anything just click on your
chart and start typing let's say Tesla
we can load the Tesla chart straight
from that interface and it couldn't be
easier but one to load Apple again AAPL
click on the top option and there we
have it so it's very easy to load market
data in the trading view next up we have
our timeframe settings so if we click on
this little drop down box we get a list
of all the various timeframes that
trading view allows you to load all the
way down to these seconds so you can
load a one-second chart if you're an
extreme scalper or you can go all the
way up to the monthly chart if you
wanted to and see how things look on the
higher time frames you can even load
your own timeframes here by just typing
so if you start typing a number then
this will bring up the change interval
box and you can use letters to specify
what time frame you want to learn so if
I wanted every bar on my chart to be a
six-day time frame I can just write 6 D
if I press ENTER every bar on my chart
is now six days of price action for
wanted to load six months I could type 6
M now every bar on my platform is a
6-month period now this looks a lot like
Bitcoin in our 2018 2017 and you can get
some really interesting perspectives
from the trading view time frame
functionality and again if I wanted to
go to the 1 second chart I can just type
1 s and we're back on the 1 second chart
so you can favorite the time frames that
you trade the most and that will add
them to this little list here so at the
end here we have the last loaded time
frame and here we have my favorite time
frames so 15 minute chart 1 hour for our
daily and weekly so those are your time
frame options and you can load any time
frame you want if I wanted to load a
three hour time frame just type 3 H and
every bar will be a 3 hour time frame so
there's a lot of flexibility with your
trading view time frames moving on we
have the candles so
will allow you to change what kind of
candles your procession is represented
as so if you wanted to load a bar chart
this click bars if you wanted to load
hollow candles click hollow and so on
there's quite a few options here you
could even load hiking Ashi which is
like an average and this is using price
averages this can be really helpful for
following the trend and momentum in
procession and there's some really great
options here you can go to a line chart
and they even have range bar charts see
see what price ranges are being traded
in so here we have a 50 tick range so if
you measure out the size of the candle
you can see it's around 50 texts there
every bar on this chart is exactly 50
ticks or 50 points and as soon as that
50 point range is broken a new bar opens
on the chart so this is a unique way of
analyzing price section and there's some
great range bar trading strategies out
there so those are your bar options and
you have quite a few I'm not going to go
over all of them in this video this
video will never end
but there are a lot of options here so
come here and play around with these
when you get time and it's worth
mentioning that some of these options
will not be available to you if you're
on a free account a lot of these
advanced candlestick options are only
available for premium subscribers so
let's go back to candle charts and move
on to the next interface option which is
compare or add symbol so right now we're
on the Apple chart if I click this
little plus sign we can add a symbol
which will draw over the top of this
chart here so if I wanted to draw the
S&P 500 for example I can click that and
now I'm getting an overlay of the S&P
500 as a line chart so if I click on
this come to style we could change this
to candles as well they can get a bit
confusing having two candlestick price
data draw into your chart so that's why
it comes on by default as a line chart
but you can change this in the style
menu but I'm just showing you that that
is possible
we've good area or baseline so remove
that for now and if we click on this
again and go to compare here's a bunch
of options here so if we wanted to
compare Apple stock price to the Nasdaq
just click on that and now we're
automatically comparing
the difference in price magnitudes
between these two so these are all
advanced options we're not going to go
into how to use these in this video but
that's how you can access other markets
on your trading chart and have multiple
sources of price data on the one chart
so let's remove that and let's move on
to the indicators and strategies dialog
box so this box here will allow you to
select built-in indicators and
strategies so for example we could come
down here and find the relative strength
index the RSI indicator click on that
and now we have an RSI if you want to
load a stochastic come down look for
stochastic click on that now we have an
RSI in stochastic indicator drawing on
the web chart you can also of course
type in here so I could type in
exponential moving average click on that
and now I have a moving average on my
chart and you can even merge these
indicators so if you click on this
little three dotted button here you can
go to move to and you can say existing
pain above and that will merge these two
indicators into each other or I could
even move it on to the actual chart
itself
so that's what this that all these
little ellipses do and this is useful
for something like drawing your ATR
indicator directly onto your chart which
I'll show you how to do really quickly
now if we put on the ATR get rid of the
RSI and I move this up twice now we have
the ATR on our chart in the top left
here as you can see here and if I open
up the style menu and I change this
transparency to 100% we're now not
drawing the line we're still getting
that data value in the corner so that's
a really helpful use case for this
little three dotted button so this is
one of the more powerful functionality
features of trading views platform is
just how easy it is to add indicators
onto your price action chart and of
course there is a wealth of public
scripts that have been written by the
trading community that do all kinds of
things that you won't see in your
typical inbuilt indicators for existing
popular indicators and of course using
the pine editor you can write your own
scripts so here's a list of all the
scripts that I've
working on over the past couple of years
and if I just add on one of these let's
add on my latest version of the ultimate
pullback indicator but click that and
you can see this is drawing price
signals straight onto my chart and so
there are a lot of custom indicators out
there that you can load onto your chart
and they're extremely powerful but we'll
go into more information about custom
indicators later for now this is all you
really need to know about the indicators
and strategies box so those are your
indicator options let's move on to
strategy strips so if I go to built in
any script that has this little red down
arrow and green up arrow represents a
strategy script so if we click on one of
these it will open up the strategy
back-testing system so this is executing
mock trades over historical data to give
you an idea of how certain strategy
rules would have performed on historical
data and now this is a very advanced
feature I'm not going to go into too
much information about this in this
video because again it'll be far too
long but this is a great way to test
various strategies and depending what
time frame you're on it will change your
back testing results and this is another
very powerful feature of trading view
the ability to back test strategies
automatically over historical price data
but we'll cover that in another video
because it's far too complex for this
video so let's close the strategy tester
window by clicking on the tab down here
and let's remove all these indicators so
that we're not overwhelmed by
information here and let's move on to
the next interface feature which is the
fundamental metrics for stocks so here
is a list of various financial data that
you can draw on to your chart to give
you a reading on a stocks fundamentals
so for example we want to see apples and
Newell cash to debt ratio we can just
click on this and now down here it is
drawing onto our chart 0.93 and there
are a lot of stock financials you can
select from and so I'm not going to go
over all of these
in today's video either but that's how
you would access them if you need to
just by clicking on this little little
symbol up here next to the indicators
box so next up we have the indicator
templates button if you click on this
you can save your indicators as a
template so if I add on for example
let's add the RSI on and the ATR
indicator on and let's change the look
back on the outside to seven and we'll
leave the ATR as it is but let's come up
to this button now click on this if you
click Save indicator template you can
name your template so that's called this
RSI plus ATR and if you click remember
symbol this will remember the symbol
when you load the template next it will
load this symbol as well and you can
also remember the time frame you're on
the interval but we'll leave these off
for now if we click Save and we remove
these indicators then next time we want
them back on our chart we can just come
up to this indicate the templates button
click on that click on our RSI plus ATR
template and there we go it's back with
our settings saved seven period RSI and
the ATR so that one's pretty easy to use
but a very convenient feature of trading
view so moving on we have our alerts
dialog so here is where you would create
trading alerts so if you click on this
you will get little options menu that
will pop up that will allow you to
select a trading script this is where
you would select your condition or
script so there are a lot of scripts out
there that generate training alerts to
send to your phone or your email or to
pop up on your charting platform again
I've got a video on alerts which I'll
leave a link in the video description on
how to create alerts and what all these
different settings do but this is where
you come to create your alerts and
adjust the settings so here is a bunch
of inbuilt conditions you can select
from so here we could say is price
crossing up above let's say 360 and this
alert now will trigger when price action
is crossing above the price 360 and then
you have a bunch of options here you can
notify push notification on the trading
view app you can show pop-ups under your
chart it can send yourself emails you
can use web hook URLs which is used for
automated trading sending data to URLs
for third party API and trade automation
now that's an extremely advanced topic
we're not definitely not going to go
over that in this video
but training view does allow that
functionality and then we have other
options we can play a sound if you want
to is a
have been built sounds you can select
from and you can even SMS yourself using
the email to SMS functionality here and
finally we have our message so you can
send yourself messages whenever an alert
is triggered so if you wanted to alert
yourself whenever Apple crosses above
360 you could right here
Apple breakout and then if you wanted to
know what the current price of Apple is
you can use these little placeholders
down here so if I typed in close within
two curly brackets this will be replaced
with the current closing price of
Apple's stock so if you click on this
little question mark here there's a
whole list of various placeholder tags
you can use in your alerts but I'll
leave that for you to look into this is
very powerful and allows you to send
indicator data to third-party api's that
sort of thing which is extremely helpful
for trade automation which is something
that deserves its own video to address
so we're not going to go into more
information about that in this video but
this is how you would set your alerts
when the time comes and once you have a
firm grasp on the trading view platform
you'll be using this functionality a lot
so moving on we have the bar replay
feature now this is another extremely
powerful feature of trading view this
allows you to load historical data and
then play it forward using this little
back testing tool here you can either
click Play and the chart will
automatically load a bar one bar at a
time and you can use this for back
testing strategies manually so if you
have a particular trading setup or
trading strategy you want to test you
can cycle through the bars one at a time
until your rules are met and then you
can simulate
how you would manage that trade through
historical price action so this is an
extremely valuable tool that I have used
a lot in my own trading career
especially in strategy development and
if you're brand new to trading this can
be a great way to practice just reading
price action and this bar replay tool
can also be used to load more data on to
your chart so if I open up a forest
chart here and I drop down to the one
hour chart and then I hold alt and press
G that'll bring up the go-to shortcut
box now if I just put in a really far
back date like the year 2000 here and I
click on
goto button you can see that training
view can only load a certain amount of
bars onto the chart at one time and here
we only go back to 31st of December 2016
but if I want to load more bars on my
chart I can click on this bar replay
tool click on this very first bar and it
will load even more bars on my chart so
now if I do the same thing you can see
here that we are now going back all the
way to 2013 and so that's another really
useful application of this bar replay
tool so that is the bar replay tool
let's move on to undo and redo scroll so
here if we wanted to say move our chart
all the way over here and then we wanted
to quickly go back to where we just were
you can click on this little button here
and it'll take you back there and if you
want to go back to where we were a
moment ago again we just click on this
and it'll take us back to where we just
scrolled back to so this is a great
little tool that can speed up your
analysis process and there's also
shortcut keys there a lot of these
buttons that do have keyboard shortcuts
the keyboard shortcut will appear as a
tooltip when you hover your mouse over
it so that's really convenient so here
you can press ctrl-z
and that will undo the scroll or press
control Y and that will redo the scroll
and so that's a great way to hop between
two points on your chart really quickly
without having to click and drag or all
around your screen and these also
operate as just general undo and redo
buttons so if I were to just draw a line
on my chart here and press ctrl-z
that'll remove the line and if I press
control Y it'll bring it back so that
covers the main toolbar here let's move
on to our chart options so here are our
various chart options so you can split
your chart into two two charts here
depending on your training view plan you
will only have access to a certain
amount of these but on the highest
premium plan here which I'm on you can
select up to eight individual charts
drawn onto your chart window and you can
load as many different markets as you
want to here so I could load
pound/dollar
the S&P 500 gold bitcoin whatever you
want to load here and you can customize
all these charts you can change the
colors
them so I could change these two bar
charts I could change this one to a line
chart and I could change this to we
could even change the remove some of
these settings here change the
background color if we wanted to there's
a lot of customization options with your
various chart types and that's a huge
strength of trading views platform so
each one of these charts is customizable
completely customizable and independent
of each other but if you wanted to you
could come here and click settings and
then go apply to all and that will
change all of your charts to match the
same settings you had on the chart you
selected that from so this is a
fantastic feature for anyone who uses
multiple time frames or want to analyze
multiple markets on the one screen and I
use this every day on my kitchen charts
I have a computer setup in my kitchen
with a screen that has a bunch of
markets that I trade actively loaded
onto the screen and I can just monitor
them all without needing to open up each
chart individually at a glance which is
really really powerful and extremely
helpful feature of the trading view
platform and a huge reason why it's so
popular and before we move on there's a
few other options here you can sync your
symbol to all the charts so if I click
that we are now loading the Apple chart
across all of our charts here you can
sync the interval so if I were to change
this to a daily chart this to a weekly
chart in this to a 50 range chart I come
up here and click interval whichever
chart was selected that will sync the
interval across all of my charts so
let's go back to one hour here and you
can also sync the crosshair so if I turn
that off then the crosshair will only
show up on the chart that I'm hovering
over if I turn that on it'll show up
across all of them you can sync the time
of your chart so that when you click on
a single chart others get scrolled to
the same point on the axis so if I turn
that on and I click here you can see
that whenever I click the mouse all of
my charts are scrolled to that location
which can be really helpful for
analyzing multiple time frames and
lastly you can sync your drawing tools
so if I reset this and reset this
and I draw a line here let's change the
color to red you can see that that's
actually sinking across all of my charts
so again even if I go to a different
time frame that will still be synched
onto my chart so this is great for
multiple time frame analysis in
particular so if we go to two charts
here and I drop out to the daily chart
turn this back to a candlestick chart
reset this reset this change this to
candles and we say change this to a
15-minute chart let me just delete this
line and first of all let me turn off
our interval sync so now if we go to a
daily chart on this top chart and I draw
in a support and resistance line now
when I scroll out my 15-minute chart you
can see that higher time frame support
resistance line drawn right onto my
chart and then you can look for trading
setups around those key levels by
synching your drawing tools across all
of your charts and time frames so that's
it for syncing your symbols and
intervals across their time and drawings
and of course there's many different
ways you can apply this information and
I won't go into all of them in this
video but there's a quick crash course
in how to change your settings for your
chart displays let's go back to one
chart remove our drawing tool if I hold
ctrl you can click and drag to select
any drawing tools if I had multiple
drawing tools here I could click the
cross option up here on the top left
hold ctrl select them all and then press
Delete they're all gone and if I press
control Z they'll come back and another
way to remove the mole is just to
right-click and click remove drawings so
there are multiple ways to achieve the
same thing on your tradingview platform
for most functionality and it's just a
matter of what you prefer in your own
workflow but we'll come back to drawing
tools in a little bit let's move on to
your chart properties so here we are on
the chart settings page there's quite a
lot of information in this settings menu
but we'll go over each thing one at a
time briefly so this first option will
change the color on your charts
according to the previous close so I
believe this will change the color of
the bar based on whether it closed
higher or lower than the previous bars
so you can see here that this bar closed
bearish but if we turn this on it turns
green because it closed higher than the
previous day's closing price so that's
what that setting does then we have our
buddies setting you can change the color
of your candles here if you wanted to
change him to purple and orange whatever
you want here you can change the border
colors as well you can change the wick
colors and you have a lot of chart color
customizations here which is fantastic
if you enjoy that sort of functionality
this is what makes training view so much
fun to use and so modern so if you don't
like using red so you want to use black
and white bars it's really easy to set
that up in this settings menu here then
we have the last valued line so you can
see here that this is set to whatever
the color of the candle is but you can
change this if you want to we could
change it to yellow for example and then
our last price line is a different color
to the candles on our chart except we
have the previous close value line and
I'm not sure why that's grayed out but
normally if you turn that on then you'll
have two lines on your chart one for the
current closing price and one for the
previous closing price then we have a
just data for dividends so this is only
relevant for stocks typically when a
stock issues dividends it affects the
stock price on your chart which can
obviously affect your technical
indicators so if you want to adjust your
data for compensating for dividends so
that removes any price influence that
the dividend payment has on the stock
price you can turn that on here and that
will help with certain technical
indicators that are affected by that
then we have extended hours so if I go
down to a 15-minute chart and we come
back up there's two ways to get to the
settings menu by the way you can right
click and come down to settings or you
can just click on this little button up
here but if I turn this on now we will
get depending on your trading view plan
your subscription plan you will have
access to intraday free-market and
aftermarket trading data so this is
after the market closed apples price
continued to be traded and before the
market opened the next day apples price
continued to be traded and you can see
that information here by turning that on
in the settings menu next up we have
precision so this is for your scale if I
set this to 1/2 then we'll
get half points on our right price axis
and you have a lot of options here
you could extend your decimal places by
a significant amount or just leave it as
a default which will just show you the
tradable price scale on your price axis
next up we have time zone so by default
this is set to the exchange that the
market is trading on but you can change
this to whatever you want so for me I
live in Brisbane so I'd look for UTC +10
Brisbane click that and you can see that
that changes the time on my time axis to
represent my time zone so the US markets
closed for me at around 6 a.m. and so
this final 15-minute bar is a 5:45 a.m.
bar but if I come back up to the
settings and change that back to
exchange you can see that it's showing
3:45 p.m. down there so that's how you
would change your time zone let me reset
these to defaults if you want to reset
any of your chart settings just come and
click on this template option you can
save your chart settings as well if you
want to by clicking there otherwise just
hit apply defaults and that will reset
your chart back to the default settings
so moving on to status line this affects
the text up here on the top left so if I
turn all these off I will have no
information on my chart in the top left
here so that can really clean up your
chart there but if you want to have your
symbol information there you can click
that you can change that to just ticker
so if you leave description it'll give
you the full stock name if you change it
to ticker it will just give you the
ticket code next that we have the show
open market status I believe that's this
little guy here for some reason when I
turn that off it's not doing anything
but maybe I'm wrong about that but
anyway this will show the open market
status then we have open high low close
values but turn that on we'll get our
price data over whichever candle and I'm
hovering my mouse over whichever bar I
hover my mouse over my mouse crosshair
the data up here the open high low and
closed data will be for that candle next
that we have bar change values so this
will give you the point change and
percentage change between each bar so
you can see there's a big gap up here if
I hold my mouse over that candle we had
a eleven point eight three point gap up
and a three point five two
percent gap up so that's useful for
performing analysis so that's what bar
change values does let me have indicated
titles if I add an indicator to my chart
let's just use the RSI I come up here
you can see here we have the RSI
indicator title if I turn that off we
lose the title down there and same with
indicator arguments if I turn that on
it'll show me what settings I've set
this RSI to if I turn that off I do not
get that information there so this is
useful for decluttering your chart if
you don't change your indicator
arguments very often or you don't want
to even see the title there but leave
them on for now and then indicator
values will just show you the value of
the indicator wherever you are hovering
your mouse so similar to this open high
low close data at the top
whichever candle you hover your mouse
over it will show the indicator value
next to the indicator title next that we
have the background of your status line
and I don't see that changing anything
right now but this I assume is the
background color for your status line
then finally we have wrap text so if
your status line data gets too long
it'll wrap on to a new line so that's it
for the status line settings let's move
over to scales now scales allows you to
change the scale information on your
chart so here we can draw the symbol
name straight to the axis then we have
symbol last value label and you can set
this to value according to scale or
price in percentage value so this is
telling you that this can will close
0.49 percent higher than the previous
candles open I believe that looks about
right so we'll change this back to value
according the scale and then you have
symbol previous close value label for
intraday prices only so I'm guessing
this is a previous day's closing price
then we have indicator name labels so
that will draw the indicator name on the
scale down the right there then you can
have the indicator last value as well on
that scale so if I turn that off we're
now getting the indicators last value
drawn straight on to the scale which is
convenient then we have financials name
label and financials last value label
this is only applicable if you have
financials drawing on to your chart
then we have no overlapping labels if
you turn that off then whenever a label
overlaps it will just draw over the top
of another label whereas if you turn
that on
then the labels will be separated from
each other so that you can tell their
values apart then we have the countdown
to bar close so if I go over to a market
that's open it's a weekend right now so
let's go to a Bitcoin market if I open
up the settings and we turn this off
you'll see the little countdown timer
goes away there and next up we have
currency so we can turn the currency on
or off up on the top right there that
will tell you you'll quote currency or
which currency you're trading in so this
is Bitcoin against the US dollar so
that's it for scales let's move on to
appearance now this is a fun one if I
delete RSI you get a lot of settings
here and you can customize everything
the background color of your chart for
example I believe it's like 16 million
different colors you can choose from and
so that's a great feature of Pyne script
allows a lot of visual customization
then we have your vertical gridlines so
if I change these to black you'll see
that these lines are drawing both
vertical grid lines and horizontal grid
grid lines so if you want to turn these
grid lines off you just open up this
color setting and change the opacity to
0% so now we only have horizontal lines
drawing and if I want to turn them off
as well we'll just set the opacity to 0%
for that too and now we have a chart
with no horizontal or vertical lines on
it so let's turn those back on from now
and move on to the next one which is
session breaks so this will tell you the
previous day's close so this market
opened down here at midnight according
to the exchange we're trading on
so if I come up to the settings menu
here and we go to symbol and change time
zone to UTC +10 Brisbane you'll see that
that was 10 a.m. my time so at 10 a.m.
my time a new trading day starts for
Bitcoin so that's what the session
breaks setting does then we have scales
text so you can change the size of the
text on your scale if you want to you
can also change the color of your scale
text you can change the color of the
scale lines and you can also customize
the crosshair
Tellem so if I change that to red we'll
have a Red Cross here and finally we
have the watermark so if I turn that on
and we set the opacity to askew a
hundred percent can see in the
background there there was text telling
us which market we are trading and what
time frame so that's what the watermark
setting does and you can just turn that
on or off by clicking on here next up we
have navigation buttons so if I set this
to visible onmouseover when we come down
at the bottom here we see we have our
scroll buttons down here and navigation
buttons we can zoom out the chart zoom
it in or move left and right and we can
reset our chart by clicking there if you
want to turn that off just set it to
always invisible and now it's gone and
if you want it there all the time said
it's always visible and there we go so
that's what that does and it's the same
for your pain buttons there so I'll set
these back to visible onmouseover so
before we move on I'm just gonna reset
all my settings to the defaults just so
we don't have all these wacky colors
going on and let's move on to the
trading setting panel so in order to
show what these two is probably best
that I create some positions to trade so
let's if you come down here to the
trading panel this is where you can
connect to real life brokers for real
money trading there's a number of
brokers here we click the brokers page
you'll be taken to a page with a full
list of the available brokers that are
integrated with training video for this
example I don't want to lose any money
showing you guys this stuff so I'm just
going to connect to my paper trading
account through trading view this is a
free account that comes with trading
views service so now this is the only
market that's open right now because I'm
recording this on a Saturday so that's
good a trade create new order for
Bitcoin and let's just create 10
contract position and let's buy it since
it seems to be going up here now you can
see if I open up the settings menu again
we go to trading I can show you what all
these settings do now so if I hit show
positions that will remove my position
from the actual chart and in order to
show orders I need to add a take profit
and stop-loss so let's do that now
let's move our stop loss down in case it
gets hit so I can continue this
demonstration and so now if I turn off
show orders our take profit and
stop-loss orders are going to disappear
so that's what this button does then we
have our connecting line this is
just d-line the connection to our right
axis so if I change this to say 20
percent that'll move these to the left
by 20 percent leave that is 5 percent
and this if we turn this on off will
change whether or not these lines extend
to the left so if I turn them off you
can see these lines disappear from our
chart so these are some great options
actually for customizing how you display
your position information on here so
I'll leave them on for now next up we
have show executions so you can see this
little blue arrow underneath this candle
pointing up that's showing that I
executed a long position on this bar
right here
so if I turn that off that goes away and
these executions will stay on your chart
through historical data so that you can
quickly at a glance see where and when
you entered or exited your trades so
that's a great feature there for
reviewing your trading next up we have
players sound on order execution so if I
turn that back on and we remove this
position I've actually got my chart
muted right now but that should have
made a sound so that's one way to manage
your trades and and have an audible
response to your order execution so you
know that it went through or failed to
go through and whatever next up we have
instant orders placement so by default
this is turned off and when you go to
say you want to enter a buy order above
this little swing high in here you could
right click and go trade buy stop if you
click that then you need to fill out
your information here in order for that
order to go through but if we come up to
the settings menu and we turn this
setting on now when I go to trade and
create a buy stop order it will
automatically just enter the order
immediately so that's what that's for
let's go back up to the settings show
rejection notifications only will only
show you notifications when a order is
rejected next up we have the show by
cell panel that's this thing down here
so I move this over if I turn this off
that'll disappear turn it back on comes
back so there's multiple ways to enter
positions and manage your trades here
you can click this order panel button
down here you can use this buy sell
panel down here or you can right click
trade create new order so there's three
different ways to open that order menu
so you don't need this buy sell panel on
Charlie we don't want to but it's also
an easy way to see the spread instantly
and you can change your position size
here and that will affect your quantity
before you enter the trade so it's just
a matter of preference there and before
we move on I should show that you can
undock this window here so you can move
your order execution panel around and if
you want to dock it again just click on
the little cog and click dock to right
and there's a bunch of settings here you
can turn on or off the various display
options here so you can display your
quantity only in percentage risk if you
wanted to and your stop loss and take
profit only in terms of percentages if
you don't want to look at how much money
you're risking and you just want to
focus on taking good trades and managing
your risk responsibly with the
percentage amount that's one way to
achieve that just turn off the dollar
amounts here and you will only ever see
everything in terms of percentages of
your account balance so that's it for
the trading panel and the trading
settings let's move on to events so if I
go over to a stock market here let's go
back to Apple go to daily let's remove
this buy sell panel come down here to
events and now you can see down the
bottom here we have a couple of symbols
we have e and D so e stands for earnings
if I click on this little symbol will
have our earnings data pop up here and D
stands for dividends so this will tell
you when dividends do to be issued so if
I come up and open the settings again
this will only show economic events that
affect the market your trading so if we
go over to a currency for example it's
go to the Australian dollar open up the
settings and uncheck this show only
future events and this will show every
event that ever happened every
fundamental event that ever happened you
can see there's quite a lot on this
chart and that's why this setting is
turned on by default but he resumed
right he and you can see that there's a
few events upcoming next week and we can
see what they are just by clicking on
them so this is a really great trade
management tool to stay on top of the
markets obviously you can use a
third-party external economic calendar
to get this information but it's great
to have this stuff drawn directly on to
your chart so that you always know
what's coming
up and you can even draw an event break
lines so you can see now we've got
visual lines on the chart
representing the time that these events
are going to happen if we drop down to a
four-hour chart
it'll even show the exact time of day
that the event is going to happen so
that's a really useful feature for
staying on top of the markets and never
being surprised by an economic release
and that's it for our chart settings
let's move over to the rest of these
buttons up here first of all we have
this full screen button so if you click
that it will exit full screen or enter
full screen then we have this little
camera button and there's a hotkey there
alt s if you press alt s we'll click on
this then the training View platform
will take a screenshot and now you can
copy this link or you can click save
image you can right click save image or
copy image and you have a copy of your
chart analysis and this will save any
drawing tools you've done on your chart
any technical analysis and it will even
draw in the upcoming events and there's
even a little tweet button here so if
you click on that you can log into your
Twitter account and tweet that
information out to your followers if you
have a social media presence moving on
we have the publish button so this will
allow you to share your idea with the
trading community so if i zoom out a bit
and I draw in some support and
resistance lines here I could say you
know these are my key levels I'm looking
at this week if I hit publish I can give
the idea a title and a description I can
link to related ideas that are relevant
to this analysis then I can tell traders
whether I'm looking to go long we're
looking to go short
I can select a category for my analysis
I can tag the analysis I can share the
analysis to Twitter or stock twits
there's a bunch of options here could
publish a public idea so that anyone can
see this or I can publish a private idea
so I need to send them the link in order
to see this analysis that I've just done
and if we publish a public idea then
this will go up live on the trading view
public ideas library where a lot of
traders share their analysis so that's
what the published idea button does you
can even record a video idea which is
pretty cool so here you want to you can
record a video up to 20 minutes in
length and use your microphone to
explain what you're looking at before
you publish your
video to the training view platform it's
a really cool feature if you don't have
your own third-party recording software
or you want to publish your video idea
to the training view platform publicly
so that's what these two buttons do and
that's the top bar completed so if this
video is extremely long there's a lot to
cover with trading view but we're about
halfway through now we've covered all of
the major important settings let's move
on to this right bar we'll go all the
way down at the bottom and then we'll
move over to the drawings bar and then
finally we'll go over these tabs at the
bottom so first of all up here we have
our market watch list details and news
so if you click on this little button
it'll bring out our watch list so this
is my personal portfolio that I trade
the forex markets with and I have a few
portfolios here that I can choose from
and you can rename them create a new
list duplicate your lists import lists
even so if you have a list on another
platform you can import it you can
export your list you can select your
list by color so if I go green let's see
that I've got this cad swiss highlighted
as green if i click on that then that
will just show me any markets that I've
tagged with a green flag so it's pretty
cool feature there so moving on we have
our lurtz settings menu so here who's a
bunch of alerts that I've created and
you can just right click on any of these
alerts and you can edit them change them
delete all inactive alerts if you want
to and here's our lurtz log which will
give you a log of every alert that's
been triggered and if you click on the
alert it will bring you to the page and
the time frame at the market and the
time frame that the alert was set on
which is a really handy feature next up
we have the data window so this just
shows you the data of the market that
you have loaded onto your chart so if I
add a let's say an EMA onto my chart and
you just do a double EMA you can see
that the indicator setting now shows up
down the bottom here and you can hide or
show that indicator from this data
window so if I wanted to also add an RSI
on here we'll now get that information
drawn into the data window as well so
this is a great little spot to get all
of your data in one window all right now
moving on to the hot lists so this is
list
generated by the market scanner the
tradingview market scanner and so you
can see here we've got US exchanges and
we have volume gayness we have percent
changes to the positive side so these
are the markets that have had really
strong days yeah so this is a great spot
to analyze your charts at a glance
really quickly and see how the markets
are being performing so this is a great
way to isolate your portfolio or your
watchlist especially if you're an
intraday trader here's a negative
gayness as well so any market that had a
bad day will be listed on this list here
and these guys did not have a good day
yesterday anyway that's hot this that
just shows you the biggest movers on the
market currently and you can say this is
a watchlist actually and there's a whole
bunch of options here a whole bunch from
different exchanges so if you want to
see what the london stock exchange hot
lists are you just click on this little
drop down box and here's a list of all
the different parameters you can scan
for so you can look for the biggest gap
gainers for example and that will
identify any markets that had a big gap
in price so that's a really cool feature
there so next up we have the calendar so
if we click on that that'll bring up the
economic calendar and we have a list of
all the upcoming economic data that are
likely to move the global markets and up
here on the top right we have the filter
so you can turn on or off certain
countries and there are a lot of options
here we're not going to go over all of
these but this is where you would change
your economic calendar filters if you
need to and then this button here will
just highlight the closest event that is
pending next up we have the ideas panel
my ideas so this will list any ideas
that you've published this is just an
easy way to access your own ideas then
we have public chats so this is like a
chatroom for various markets so here I'm
in a group called Australian traders now
I've never really used this
functionality but there's a whole bunch
of different chat rooms you can join and
you can chat with other traders
that's why trading view is referred to
as a social trading platform but of
course it's optional you don't need to
come in here be done wanting but if you
do come in here there's plenty of
interesting conversations to
to participate in if you don't mind
being very distracted while you trade so
next up we have private chats that will
just list any private private messages
you have from other traders on the
platform I'm not gonna open that up now
because I don't want to give away the
usernames of everyone that follows me
but that's where you would access your
private messages if you need to then we
have the idea stream so this will just
show you ideas recent ideas from people
that you follow in your trading profile
next up we have notifications so this is
just a quick and easy way to see all of
the notifications that are relevant to
you and right now I don't have any
because I've cleared out all my
notifications to make this video but if
I did have any notifications here that's
where I could see them all at a glance
next up we have the author panel we
already went over that that is where you
get your order execution information and
before we move on I did forget to
mention that you can use this little box
here to adjust your risk based on your
stop-loss price so if I wanted to have a
stop loss here at 70 cents I could just
write in 70 cents I could click sell up
here if I wanted to risk 1% of my
account I just leave that in there for
one of the risk to change that to 2 and
trading view automatically calculates my
position size for me so that's a really
great feature of the order panel but
anyway let's move on to the depth of
market so this will show you the depth
of market for the market your trading if
I go back to Bitcoin which is actively
being traded it's not actually showing
the do M here I'm not sure why there's
no information here maybe it's not
applicable to crypto or maybe you need
to pay extra money to access this
information in this data but if you do
have access to this depth of market
information this is where you access it
from the next up we have the object tree
so if I draw a bunch of different things
on here and make my chart look like a
Bob Ross painting and then we come and
click on this this will list all of the
different drawing tools and different
analysis data that I have on my chart
this is an object tree so we can delete
each thing individually if I wanna get
rid of the pitch fan just remove it off
there and I can remove the various
drawing tools from this window here and
then last but not least we have the very
important question
mark help menu so this is you can access
this as well from going up here to help
center but this is where you get a lot
of information on how to navigate the
channeling platform and you can open
support ticket if you need to by
clicking up there and that's it for the
right bar interface let's move over to
the drawing tools and then this video
guide is nearly finished so now we have
our drawing tools and various technical
analysis tools here so if you click on
this first little box here you'll get a
list of options here so if I click dot
that will change my cursor to a dot
instead of cross now you can also change
it to an arrow if you want to so this is
all just a matter of preference and you
can change to an eraser so if I draw a
drawing tool on there and I select
eraser I can now delete that tool just
by clicking on it next up we have our
actual line tools and there are a lot of
line tools so I'm not gonna go over all
of them you can highlight your favorite
tools here by clicking on this add to
favorites and once you do highlight any
drawing tools and make them a favorite
you can come down to this little star
icon down here click on that and that
will open the drawing tool hotbar so
here's a list of all the most commonly
used drawing tools that I most commonly
use in my own trading and these are all
tools that I've highlighted as a
favorite so you can turn that on or off
by clicking on this little icon down
here so there are a bunch of options
when it comes to drawing tools for
example you've got a straight horizontal
line that will extend all the way across
your chart here you've got this
horizontal ray which will only draw from
where you click it and if you double
click on the drawing tool you get a
whole bunch of options here so you have
visibility options you can change what
time frames the tool shows up on and
this works on all drawing tools so the
drawing tool functionality on training
view is quite advanced and one of its
strongest features in terms of a
technical analysis platform then you can
change the coordinates so I could change
the bar that this begins on if I want to
you can even add text so here I could
change this to say resistance I change
it to red put it in bold change the size
and change the text alignment to the top
of the bar and now we have text drawing
on the line and this is a really cool
functionality of the platform because it
even works on trend lines so if I were
to draw a trend line here and I change
the text to say steep trendline and we
put the text alignment to bottom you can
see it's now drawing text on the bottom
of the drawing tool so that's a really
cool feature that they recently added to
the platform that really allows you to
take your technical analysis to the next
level in terms of attention to detail so
let's delete these and move on so
there's a whole bunch of drawing tools
here for various lines vertical line the
vertical line is helpful for seeing the
date you can see the date down here so
when I place the line there if I change
the color to white so we can see it we
can actually see the date down on the
bottom there and you can also press alt
V to draw that as well or hold H to draw
a horizontal line there's a whole bunch
of keybinds which will go over at the
very end of this video but those are
your various drawing tools in terms of
lines you can even draw parallel
channels if you want there's a lot of
options here which are really cool then
we have our kind of complex drawing
tools so you've got your fibrin
treatment here if you want to draw out
Fibonacci's you have your fib extensions
so if you want to draw out any
Fibonacci extensions here you can use
that tool there we have really a lot of
options I'm not gonna go over all of
these there's some pretty crazy ones as
well like tip circles I'm not actually
sure what that's useful to be honest
with you but it looks pretty damn cool
I'll give it that
but there's just a lot of options
overwhelming amount of options and it's
all matter of preference if you don't
know what some of these do you don't
have to use them but if you do want to
use them here they are next up we have
our geometric shapes so if you want to
draw like a support and resistance box
you can draw that in here if you want to
draw complex geometrics like a curve for
example you can do that here if you want
to draw just random sort of brush
drawings on here you can do that as well
using the brush tool so there's a lot of
options here you have text options a
whole bunch of text options price labels
so
here that will actually draw the price
that you've anchored this to so if I
moved this around you can see that it's
actually showing what the price is where
this little dot is on the price label so
there are a lot of options here we have
arrow up arrow down so a lot of drawing
tool functionality here to choose from
we have text obviously which is a great
tool for technical analysis so I could
say this is a resistance zone and drag
that up there there we go
really easy let's remove all that and
let's move on next up we have our
advanced patterns so this is a great
tool if you're an advanced pattern
trader and you have a whole bunch of
options here so if I want to draw an X
ABCD pattern like a bat pattern or
something like that you can do your ex a
a to B B to C C D completion and draw
that right on to your chart so let's see
if we have any valid advanced patterns
here that we can draw out let's go down
to one our chart have a look around so
here's a valid bat pan setting up so we
have our X to a A to B B to C and a CD
completion down at the 886 retracement
so here's a bullish bat pattern setting
up and that's how you would draw it out
on your chart using the advanced pattern
functionality so I'm not going to go
over all of these you also have Elliot
waves and if you draw them out like that
you can get your points drawn Elliot
wave points drawn directly on your chart
so a lot of really cool drawing tool
functionality here next up we have a
bunch of other options here we have our
date range so you can see how many bars
are between date range and days and how
much time has passed between the two
points and then next that we have our
long position tool and our short
position tool so these are really cool
tools that allow you to draw your profit
and stop-loss price directly on to the
chart and trading view will give you the
information you need in order to enter
your positions or just monitor the trade
so for example if we wanted to enter
this advanced pattern down here down at
this 886 retracement
if I draw this out and I put our D
completion down here first of all
there's a whole bunch of drawing options
if you double-click on any drawing tool
you'll get a whole bunch of options you
can choose from and some of these tools
such as a Fibonacci tool have a lot of
unique options here so I go extend lines
right now we have our Fibonacci lines
drawing all the way across the chart I
could draw a long position tool right on
this d completion I could have my stop
loss just below the X leg my target
let's say at a 382 retracement from the
high of the pattern that would put me
right here so that's a two-to-one trade
you can delete these and now there's our
position tool ready to enter a trade if
price gets down there so one of the
coolest features of these drawing tools
is that if I right click this click on
create limit order that will create a
limit order with this data filled out
for me so my limit price is at eight
nine seven nine point eight seven which
is at the little horizontal line down
here this gray line the entry point of
this long position tool my stop loss is
down here at eight eight six two point
six five that's all filled out for me
all I need to do here is just change my
risk per trade and now if I hit by I
have my limit orders set according to
this long position tool so that's a
really great feature that makes trading
through trading view real pleasure let
me delete all this delete all the
drawing tools and that's it really then
we have a whole bunch of symbols here
I'm gonna go over all of these because
they're not really relevant but if you
want to draw some wacky symbols on your
chart you can using this symbol drawing
tool this icon drawing tool lists and
there's a lot here to choose from moving
on we have our ruler tool so this will
allow you to measure between two points
on your chart so it'll tell you how many
bars between the horizontal axis and how
much price difference between the
vertical axis so for example from the
low here all the way to the high
we have twenty-one bars twenty-one hours
six hundred ninety nine points of price
reference and a seven-point eight six
percent gain from the load of the high
so that's a really cool tool for
analysis then we have a little zoom in
button so you can if I reset the chart
and I use this you can use this to zoom
in on a section of your chart so that's
a really cool feature there and you
click the Zoom Out button to reset your
chart back to normal zoom next up we
have the magnet mode which will snap
drawings placed near price bars to the
closest price value so your open high
low and close so if I turn that on and
then I go to draw a trendline you can
see that this is snapping to the nearest
price that I hope for my mouse near so
if I wanted to snap it all the way up
here too let's go to this high and so if
I wanted to draw a support resistance
you can turn on that snap functionality
and just hover your mouse right near the
high or the low and there you have it
and then after that we have this stay in
drawing mode so this is really handy if
you're drawing out like a trend analysis
or something so advising might ride out
a bit here and I turn on the drawing
tool and I locked my drawing mode I can
draw as many lines as I want to without
losing the drawing tool functionality if
I turn that off
then every time I draw a line the line
tool will deselect so that's a really
cool way to stay in drawing mode when
you're performing complex analysis and
next up we have lock all drawing tools
so if I draw on a bunch of tools here
and I lock this now if I try to move
them I can't
and that just moves the chart around so
that's great if I turn that off when I
click and drag on this tool I can move
it around and if you don't want that to
happen just click lock all drawing tools
and that will lock them in place you can
also lock drawing tools individually by
right-clicking on the tool and clicking
lock and so now if I draw another line I
can move this line around but I can't
move this line around because it's
locked until I right-click on it and go
unlock I cannot move it and then finally
we also have our hired drawing tools so
if I have a bunch of drawing tools on
here and I click that that will hide
them from my chart temporarily if I want
to turn them back on I just click on
that button they come back
and if I want to delete them all then I
have this little bin button down here
and that will just remove all of the
drawing tools off my chart and that is
it for the drawing tools section so
moving on we're nearly done let's look
at these tabs down the bottom here so
the first one is our stock screener if I
click on that and I'll bring up the stop
screener interface I'm not gonna go over
all of this information because this
deserves its own lesson entirely and I
personally specialize in forex trading
so I don't use this very much myself to
be honest but if you want to analyze the
stock market overall to filter out
certain stocks based on certain data you
can do so here on the stock screener so
you have a whole bunch of options here
and a heap of presets if you click on
filters here is a whole list of filters
you can choose from and this is quite a
powerful tool there's a lot of options
here significant amount of options and
so the world is your oyster when it
comes to analyzing the entire stock
market if you want to analyze other
markets just click on this little flag
icon up here and select which stock
market or country you'd like to analyze
so that's the stock screener and I won't
go into more detail here because we'll
be here all day if I do but moving on to
text notes this is a place to add notes
about your own trading so here you can
change the title of the note and the
text of the note and this is just a
place to keep notes on your trading or
your technical analysis you could have a
trading journal here or something if you
wanted to and it's just a very very
basic note functionality next up we have
the pine editor now this is where you
would write your own scripts or edit
existing scripts to run on the training
view platform and I'm definitely not
going to go into a lot of information
about this section because I have an
entire course on Pine scripting that
goes for nearly a full day worth of
recorded material and even then I've
only barely scratched the surface of
what's possible with the pine script
language but if you do want to edit any
scripts this is where you would do it
and if you want to learn about pine
scripts head over to pine script mastery
comm I have a free basics course there
which will teach you the absolute core
basics of pine script and what all this
code means so if that's something that
interests you make sure you head over
there and check that out
because I do
do you not have time to go over pine
script in this lesson moving on we have
the strategy tester now this is used for
testing strategies over historical data
so if I just quickly add on a strategy
strip that I've been working on myself
such as this one here you'll see that it
will load a bunch of data onto my chart
and it's entering and exiting mock
trades on historical data and then
recording the information into the
strategy tester so this is a great way
to see if certain rules based strategies
are profitable by automatically
back-testing them and again I'm not
going to go over this information
because I have a whole course on this
over at pine script mastery comm that
goes into significant amount of detail
and there's just so much to cover with
this I can't cover this information in
this video because otherwise it's gonna
be far too long but if you do need to
access the strategy tester this is where
you would do it and then next up you
have the trading panel so if I click on
this this will list all of your trading
data if you signed into a paper trading
account it will show you your paper
trading account if you signed into a
real account such as Amanda or trade
station or fxcm then you will get your
real trading data in here and you can
manage your trades directly through the
trading view platform so again if I go
to trade create a new order and we just
buy Bitcoin right now at market you can
see I have a new order down here if I
click on this little edit icon I can
adjust my stop-loss and my target I want
to I can do all of that from the trade
panel and so that's it for these tabs
down the bottom let's cover trading
views hotkeys and then I'll end this
video so if you come down here and click
on this little question mark icon this
help center and then you scroll to the
very bottom of this menu we have our
keyboard shortcuts so if you click on
this this will bring up the list of
shortcuts for various parts of the
platform so if you want to look at your
chart shortcuts just click on this
little drop down box here and there's a
whole bunch of keybinds to memorize here
now you can't customize these key binds
but you can see a list of them here and
there's a whole bunch of options here
moving on we have drawing tools so for
example to use a measure tool really
quickly you can just hold
then click on the chart and that will
bring up the measure tool and there's a
few drawing tool options here like I
showed you earlier
Alvie will draw a vertical line alt C
will do a cross line and alt H will do a
horizontal line and alt T will draw a
trendline then we have the watch list
and screener keybinds as a few here to
learn if you use those a lot and then
next up we have the pine editor so
there's a whole bunch of key mines for
the pine editor that can really speed up
your workflow and make your coding a lot
more efficient finally we have the
trading hotkeys so shift B will create a
market order to buy shift S or create a
market order to sell and to use the
depth of market interface to place your
limit orders you can just click on the
cell itself or press control and then
click in order to place a stop order at
a certain price so that's it for the
trading platform itself let's go and
have a quick look at the trading view
homepage so here on the front page we
have a market summary and a few ideas
that people have published sharing their
analysis this is a great place to come
particularly if you're new trader if
you're an experienced trader you'll
probably rarely visit this page because
you'll have everything important to your
trading process bookmark and most
experienced traders would never look at
any of the ideas on here maybe you would
come and check out the scripts if you
click on this scripts navigation bar you
can get a whole list of different script
categories and if you scroll through
them you can find some pretty cool stuff
on here so these are all scripts written
by traders that use the trading view
platform and all these scripts are
written in Pine script and you can find
all sorts of customized indicators here
and some strategy scripts as well if
you're feeling adventurous and you want
to try out some other people's work and
then we also have this ideas page so if
you click on this this will bring you to
the list of ideas published by other
traders on the platform if you're a
beginner trader I would recommend being
cautious with this stuff because no one
knows where the markets headed and all
this is just opinions and someone's
drawn a cute little boat here so I'm
sure this is very very valuable
technical analysis but just take it with
a grain of salt and here
CAD yen to fall Aussie dollar to rise
we'll see about that but anyway next up
we have markets so if you come to the
markers tab this is pretty cool you can
find the crypto screener so you click on
that this works like the stock screener
that I showed you earlier in the video
and so if we come up to filters there's
a whole bunch of different parameters
that you can search through the entire
crypto markets for but I'll leave this
for you to experiment with next up we
also have a Forex Forex screener here it
is and this behaves the same way as a
stock screener and the crypto scanner
next up we have streams this is a new
feature that was just added to the
platform where you can watch people
perform their analysis live on the
platform it's kind of like twitch for
traders next we have brokers so there's
a list of integrator brokers that have
partnered with tradingview to provide
their service through the trading view
platform so if you want to trade
directly through trading view your list
will be different to mine depending on
what country you're from then there's a
bunch of other things you're not going
to go over everything here probably one
of the most useful things on this list
is the Help Center and the blog in news
so you'll get a lot of information from
the blog page here anything important or
significant that has changed with the
platform will be explained here on the
blog and that concludes my comprehensive
guide to the trading view platform if
you want more information about trading
or Pyne script or you want to check out
some of my indicators head over to zen
in the art of trading comm and here
you'll find a list of all of my publicly
released indicators including the source
code to them if that strikes your
interest so thanks for watching everyone
good luck with your trading and I'll see
you in the next video take care
