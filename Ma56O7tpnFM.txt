1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,150
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,429
tutorial my name is Tammy Bakshi and

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,190
today I'm joined by Rob hi the CTO MVP

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,469
of IBM Watson and my mentor thank you

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,179
very much for being a part today Rob

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,190
it's great to have you here Emma haha

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,500
thank you so today we're gonna be

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,840
talking about the Watson studio and

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,400
we're specifically how it relates to the

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,220
call for code now you can build

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,109
analytics a I powered solutions that

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,960
enable you to impact field of disaster

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,550
preparedness so you can help out those

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,079
who are being affected by natural

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,920
disasters using the power of the Watson

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,649
studio so the Watson studio Rob would

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,420
you just give us a quick brief on Lily

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,370
what that is and what it allows us to do

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,469
yeah it's my sister's really cool set

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,300
it's targeted at people who want build

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,719
analytic or AI based solutions it

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,850
includes a number of sub tools including

23
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,579
Jupiter notebooks including our the deep

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,989
learning visual construction tooling

25
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,290
access to our knowledge catalog yes the

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,960
ability to both gain access to it

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,479
publish as well as to curate some of the

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,659
data - exactly so it's really a suite of

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,010
tools that's really called it's really

30
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,740
targeted ad what we might normally refer

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,780
to as data scientist but really it's a

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,670
much broader class of people it doesn't

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,220
require that you have a GC analytics or

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,350
algorithms to be able to do anything

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,479
useful with and it really allows you to

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,670
get in and begin to detail out and

37
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,100
decompose your problem even stupider

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,110
notebooks to kind of organize your

39
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,880
thinking around the things you're trying

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,150
to analyze to import data normalize that

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,030
data and curate a yes and then layout

42
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,740
the algorithmic approach that you want

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,350
to take for assessing what they did is

44
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,390
trying to tell you yes including them

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,340
driving all the way down into using

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,570
various languages 14 buildings

47
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,149
algorithms with that is great now one

48
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,710
thing that you said they're really sort

49
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,750
of fascinates me and that is that you

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,770
don't need to be a machine learning

51
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,899
expert to use walk in the studio you

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,670
don't need to you know have a PhD in

53
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,810
data science or machine learning

54
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,299
whatever else it may be in order to use

55
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,770
this tool in order to build your own

56
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,410
applications and so let's just say you

57
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,700
know I wanted to build an application

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,970
that use the Watson

59
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,250
I could use tools as you mentioned of

60
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,380
data refinery that's built in to help me

61
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,060
pre-process figure out what my day is

62
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,860
like visualize I got a better idea of

63
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,900
what it is I can use the open source of

64
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,580
Jupiter notebooks and so I'm not even

65
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,070
just limited to using say the wonderful

66
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,200
Watson services I could use other

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,790
open-source technologies maybe I want to

68
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,200
build my own custom bottle eaves and

69
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,540
garage yeah I can do whatever I want to

70
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,190
inside the Jupiter notebooks and in fact

71
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,560
if you're using a supported library like

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,180
Ross you can actually build the neural

73
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,800
networks in a graphical user interface

74
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,440
with the journal Network model er uh but

75
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,240
let's just say that I were taking a look

76
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,040
at a more specific use case also one

77
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,780
more thing though would be like for

78
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,610
example the community tab there are also

79
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,440
tons of different projects and and

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,480
neural network designs and data sets I'm

81
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,040
even publish on to the community of

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,170
Watson studio in fact you can as well

83
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,090
and you can collaborate with people

84
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,160
inside of that experience but getting

85
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,530
back to the point let's just say that I

86
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,180
wanted to build an application that

87
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,790
predicts how intense a wildfire is gonna

88
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,190
be based off of where it's located of

89
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,930
course a few more environmental factors

90
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,370
in fact this is actually an open source

91
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,010
data set from NASA it was actually code

92
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,390
pattern on this and there'll be a link

93
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,120
to it down in the description below uh

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,070
but let's just say that I was working

95
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,959
towards this use case I want to use the

96
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,820
Watson tsuneo to build a custom machine

97
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,740
learning model soon just for my needs

98
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,510
could you kind of walk us through how

99
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,940
you would do that what kinds of tools

100
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,860
you use and what you use them for yeah

101
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,020
well let's start with the data and as

102
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,190
you pointed out some of that data is

103
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,780
available now but you know you still

104
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,430
need to make sure that it's shaved and

105
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,840
these guys the right characteristics in

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,400
it that you're looking for there may be

107
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,840
some assets that idea that you care

108
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,860
about some that you don't care about

109
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,239
there may be other data that you want to

110
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,630
bring in and so first step is to walk

111
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,700
through and what I think of as being a

112
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,830
curation process a lot of that is about

113
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,720
to simply make sure the days in a shape

114
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,400
that you want to be in so let me step

115
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,540
one now once you've got the data

116
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,580
ingested step two is to begin to

117
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,709
understand what your objective is what

118
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,660
is it they try to get from this data in

119
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,610
a case of disaster preparedness maybe

120
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,660
what you're trying to do is identify

121
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,500
where the fire is likely to be addressed

122
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,880
given the data that you've got available

123
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,520
to you or it could be you know where you

124
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,260
want equipment you know how are you

125
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,110
going to manage and prepare for this

126
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,680
disaster as it unfolds if you got

127
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,500
any advance warning they been coming up

128
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,639
to the potential maybe I said it was a

129
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,720
hurricane or a storm that you know

130
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,090
that's coming in or or unfortunately in

131
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,009
some cases that may be so that's already

132
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,289
happened but maybe the case you know

133
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,389
managers and people who are involved

134
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,210
with managing disaster situation II you

135
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,229
know need to be able to think about

136
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,060
where the gunner places equipment and

137
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,250
yes and where is going to be best used

138
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,350
what the needs are and so forth so but

139
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,370
that's part of what you're trying to do

140
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,810
then of course having that objective in

141
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,300
mind you can begin to work backwards and

142
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,430
decompose how would you go about

143
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,320
predicting for the things we need to

144
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,810
predict you know we talked about one you

145
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,250
know where what you want be able to do

146
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,550
is identify what people need you know

147
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,289
that they're already in the midst of the

148
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,210
disaster they've already been affected

149
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,699
by whatever the consequence is where it

150
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,380
may be that they're stuck in their home

151
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,840
and they're out of food or water

152
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,280
yes um you know how would you use

153
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,199
something official recognition to go and

154
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,440
identify somebody who's you know calling

155
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,630
or asking for that before they even got

156
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,599
a sign yeah so you know working

157
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:33,240
backwards to what you're trying to do

158
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,000
solve for and then using duper notebook

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,120
to begin to organize that yeah as you

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,349
can do that organization you can

161
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,139
identify the need for specific analytics

162
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,849
and so you don't have to go in and drill

163
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,110
into that you gonna have to go build

164
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,669
algorithms gonna have to do the machine

165
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:48,539
learning you're gonna have to go

166
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,789
construct the the approach that you want

167
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,370
to take for identifying the thing that

168
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,630
you're looking for the things are every

169
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,449
day and again and joking nope you switch

170
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,669
out of that into some of the machine

171
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,400
learning technologies you may come into

172
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,720
it knowing that you've got it so

173
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,889
vibrates that you've already been

174
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,289
playing with may be familiar with went

175
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,120
with source projects around tensorflow

176
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,599
or around cafe or as it carries for

177
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:15,449
others PI torches getting crystalline

178
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,220
polymers yes so you know you can import

179
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,169
those libraries and corals and make use

180
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,789
of them within within the Jupiter

181
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,800
notebook if you're building a complex

182
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,470
model like a deep learning model you may

183
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,909
want going he's one of our official

184
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:33,030
tools or tool for people in construction

185
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,820
and you know that's really nice because

186
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,260
you can use it parameterize the

187
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:37,920
different layers

188
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,590
as deep learning model you can read

189
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,080
sequence that the pooling the various

190
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,370
techniques of my applying of

191
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,230
construction of your model yes and of

192
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,610
course you know you're going to then use

193
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,190
that in the context of that data to see

194
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,830
what kinds of results really eventually

195
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,420
you may decide that we've got as a real

196
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,180
well form said of analytic and you want

197
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,230
to take the algorithms that you've

198
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,600
constructed and now export them for

199
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,190
production is huge case and that's where

200
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,760
this into running code and into services

201
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,070
when they publish somewhere on the cloud

202
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,470
perhaps and make use of that with these

203
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,690
application that is great thank you very

204
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,270
much Rob for giving me that overview as

205
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,860
to how you go about using the Watson

206
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,140
studio sounds you can tell the Watson

207
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,330
studio is really tool for you to go in

208
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,610
and build her own an outtake or machine

209
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,920
learning applications without you having

210
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,140
to be an expert in this field and at the

211
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,730
same time you can make use of

212
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,890
practically any library you want to you

213
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,420
can use all the open source tools that

214
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,920
you know and love and if you're an

215
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,780
expert you can go really deep inside of

216
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,610
your data you can reshape it you can

217
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,990
take a look at what's important you can

218
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,850
find patterns even yourself that you

219
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,890
wouldn't have noticed without the Watson

220
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,180
studio and all the tools that it

221
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,950
provides but thank you very much all for

222
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,140
giving us that detailed over you now

223
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,090
though in part two you're gonna be

224
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,010
seeing a live demo how you can actually

225
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,470
use of the Watson studio in order to

226
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,540
take a custom data set and actually

227
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,310
understand it inside and out using a

228
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,020
bunch of the different tools at the

229
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,030
Watson studio provides so again thank

230
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,260
you very much Rob for joining in today

231
