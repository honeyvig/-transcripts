description to FasTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back what is Microsoft Excel so
Microsoft Excel is a software product
designed and developed by Microsoft is
storing data in an organized way that is
rows and columns and Microsoft Excel is
also capable to manipulate data through
some mathematical operations
followed by that Microsoft Excel is also
used to extract the insights from the
data and represent it in the form of
visually appealing graphs and charts now
we have a basic understanding or an
overview of what a Microsoft Excel
software product is now moving ahead we
will understand the fundamentals of
Microsoft Excel so following are some
fundamentals that you need to know
before getting started with Microsoft
Excel so basically when you install the
Microsoft office in your computer you
will have various Microsoft products out
of which Microsoft Excel is one of the
product so we will be dealing exactly
with that particular product that is
Microsoft Excel so when you get started
with Microsoft Excel this is what you
will see in the first page so this
particular page is called as Microsoft
Excel homepage where you will be having
various varieties of sheets Microsoft
Excel will give you some suggestions
based on the type of sheet you want to
work with we will see this in a better
way through the Practical session so
once you get started with the sheet you
will have some more options so this
particular option is called as the
toolbar menu you will have the file home
insert draw page layout formulas data
review View and help so these are the
tools that you will be using to work on
your data using Microsoft Excel
furthermore we have a toolbar ribbon so
when you select some of the other option
from the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help but butons you will have a ribbon
so for example you can see that I have
selected the Home Tool here so when I
press on the Home Tool this is the
ribbon which Microsoft Excel gives me so
this ribbon has some options in it which
can perform various operations now in a
further more detailed way we will have
toolbar groups so when you see in the
previous slide we have a complete
toolbar ribbon so this particular ribbon
is segmented into groups so you can see
the first group as paste Cut Copy format
painter etc etc and the second group is
the font the size of the font and to
increase the size of the font to
decrease the size of the font bold
italic underline etc etc and here you
can see the text alignment so each and
every group has separate functions so
each set is called as a
group and I think you can see a small
Arrow option over here so this Arrow
option is used into the toolbar groups
when the group is not able to fit all
the operations or all the
functionalities in one single provided
section so when you click on this
particular Arrow Mark you will have
another dialog box so this is called
toolbar more options so you can see that
when I clicked on this icon you can see
a new dialogue box which opens me a new
set of operations which are not able to
be fit in this particular group so we
will also see more about this in a
better way in the Practical session now
moving forward we have cell and address
so when you open a Microsoft Excel sheet
you can find boxes so each and every box
is named as a cell and each cell has its
own address for example the highlighted
cell over here has an address B3 so B is
the column name and three is the rule
name and apart from that you can have
the sheet tracker in the bottom left
corner of the Excel sheet where you can
navigate through different sheets and in
the bottom right corner you have an
option of increasing or decreasing the
sheet size so these are the basic
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel that you
need to keep in mind before getting
started so we will have more on this in
the Practical session if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more so
now we enter the demo inventory in
Microsoft Excel so we will be using
Microsoft Excel to create a sheet of the
employees in a company so basically an
employee in a company has employee ID
name and designation salary etc etc so
we will be trying to create the same
table using Microsoft Excel but before
that let us understand the fundamentals
of Microsoft Excel through the Practical
demo first so I have started my
Microsoft Excel and this is how the
homepage of Microsoft Excel looks like
so you have a blank workbook over here
if you want to create a new workbook you
can select new Option so Excel will
provide you with various variety of
sheets you can see money in Excel just
meeting agenda streaming showers small
business cash flow and many more if
you're not able to find what you're
looking for then you always have an
option of selecting the particular type
of sheet what you're looking for so you
have various options if it's business if
it's personal if it's planners and
trackers list budgets charts etc etc so
let's imagine that you wanted something
from business so just by clicking at
business option the Excel will load a
variety of sheets related to business
options so this might take a while so
you can see that the Exel is loading few
types of
sheets so you can see that Excel has
provided us with some online varieties
of sheets for example any calenda
business expenses Channel marketing
budget budget summary report blue
product list etc etc you can see
construction proposal enro your name at
Excel has carded so Excel will provide
you with some variety of options based
on your requirement now for this session
let's get started with a blank workbook
which looks something like this since
this tutorial is based on the
fundamental we go with the blank
workbook now over here you can see the
toolbar that we discussed earlier that
has the file home insert draw base
layout formulas data review View and
help so this is the toolbar and under
the toolbar I have selected home and you
can see this is the particular ribbon
what we discussed about this particular
ribbon belongs to homepage and when you
select file option you'll get back to
home and if you select insert option
you'll have another different ribbon
with different groups Etc Etc so every
particular tool has different ribbons in
them and remember the extra options that
we discussed when you press over this
Arrow key this is it so when you press
the arrow key you'll have few more
settings which cannot be fit in this
particular section of groups so you can
have some variety of options over here
of changing the font changing some
effects to the text font size and font
style etc etc apart from this we have
also discussed about the cells in every
sheet so this particular cell has an
address so you can see the address over
here which is B3 so B happens to be the
column name and three happens to be the
row name now we also had a discussion
about the sheet tracker right now we
just have one sheet if you want multiple
sheets you can just feel free to select
on the plus option which will always
create you some extra sheets and you can
navigate through sheets just by pressing
on the sheet
name and when you get back to the bottom
right corner you have an option of
increasing and decreasing the cell size
or the sheet size now let's keep it
default with 100% now these are the few
fundamentals that you need to keep in
mind before getting started with
Microsoft Excel now that we know the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel let's
get started with a practical session
which is about the employees details in
a company now let's select this
particular cell and let's type in
employe details
yeah we have the cell now an employee
details table will have the information
related to employees so the information
will be about name it will be about
employee
number it will be the
designation and maybe salary
and maybe blood group as
well and uh let's take another one which
is phone
number
yeah so so far so good and uh you can
see that we have some problem with this
particular column the designation the
name uh the the name of the designation
is practically good but it is not
visible so when you
uh when you're not on that particular
cell you can see that the name is
incomplete over here so you can always
fix that you can just you know manually
change the size of the row or cell or
you can also feel free to you know
double click on that cell which will
automatically you know set the size of
that particular cell and same goes to
the blood group just let's try to double
click on that and same goes to phone
number
great so you can see that the employees
details are just confined to the first
two cells it's supposed to be somewhere
in the middle right so no problem we can
do that as well we can select all the
cells and we have an option of merging
them you can just select this one which
will help you with merging and centering
that particular data to the center part
so that's how we do it now let's get
started by adding the names of the
employees uh let's add the names
Joe John
uh Mary
Mark
Susan and
then
Jennifer let's type in
Mike let's type in
them Jeff
Jeffrey yeah we have a couple of
employees now let's type in the employee
number pleas
yeah we have the employee numbers now
let's type in the designation okay let's
choose uh Joe to be the CEO of the
company and John as the software
developer and maras tester
Mark in
finance Susan also in
finance and Jennifer in
testing and mik in uh marketing
same goes for
Tim and again Jeffrey into software
development and
uh Morgan into testing again
now let's click on C so that it gets you
know resized according to the length of
the text now it's done so let's get into
salary uh
$10,000 and
$15,000
$119,000 let's increase the salary of a
CEO so let's keep it $1
lakh and finance again
20,000 so yeah the salaries are
allocated again the blood
group e
yeah we have the blood groups now let's
type in the mobile numbers
[Music]
yeah now we have typed in some random
mobile numbers as well so uh yeah this
is how you can add in some data into
your table and now let us imagine that
you forgot to add or
remove a column so let's imagine that we
wanted to add a serial number as well
but somehow we forgot to add it now you
can always add a new row or column for
example here we wanted to add a new
column so we just have to right click on
a select the insert option now we have a
new row now now let's type in serial
number and let's type
one now can you see the small box option
over here if you just drag it you can
you know copy paste all those over here
and now let's right
click and fill series now we have the
employee number starting from 1 to 10
that's how you do it and app apart from
this you you can also uh you know change
the font of the entire row you can
change the font to say uh aroni and you
can always also change the font and same
goes to the employe table you can select
it bold it and you can also increase the
size and again select a color for the
text maybe a different color green would
be
better and uh you can also select the
entire cells and align them to the
center looks more good and you can
select or double click the row names so
you'll have the proper spacing between
all the rows and columns so we have
double click on the column right yeah so
basically that's how you make things
happen now let's save this so I'd like
to go to the save option and uh MP
data let me save this in my local
location and just save it's done so
that's how you work on your Excel file
with some basic data and to learn more
don't forget to get subscribed to Simply
learns YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to stay updated so
you are the first person to get an
update on any technology not just Excel
now let's get back to the Practical mode
and now we are on our Excel spreadsheet
so here we have some text boxes on the
column A and on column B we have lower
and upper okay so um we have a mix of uh
uppercase and lower case in our text so
first we'll try to convert them to lower
case and then we'll try to convert the
entire text into upper case so for that
that you need to press on equal symbol
and select the lower formula T and you
selected the function and now click on
the cell A3 that's your cell address and
press on okay now all the letters are
converted to low case so we had J in the
uppercase which is converted to lower
case now all you can do is drag the
formula to all the cells and it will be
apply to all the cells right now let's
similarly try to convert into uppercase
and and tab space and there you go you
have selected the formula now the cell
address press
enter and drag the same address I mean
drag the same formula to all the cell
addresses and there you go all the cells
are converted to uppercase now that's
how you convert the cells or data in
Excel to uppercase or lower case in
Excel now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet now here we have some sales
data based on a store now what we going
to do is we're going to add some
multiple rows or a single Row in this
particular data so here you can see the
region wise category Wise statewise
subcategory Wise and there sales and
quantities right now let us imagine that
you must have to add a sale data here
right so let us imagine that on the row
7th you were supposed to add some detail
for example some technology related sale
happened on that day and you missed out
to add it right so how do you create a
new rule now so for example if multiple
sales happened on the same day like 3 to
four and you missed out them so how do I
add three to four rows in between the
existing data right so don't worry about
it it's completely simple all you have
to do is select the row and right click
and press on the option insert now this
will insert one single row if you wanted
to add one single U row or you know
toule and if you wanted to add multiple
rows for example you wanted to add three
rows Al together then it's also simple
all you have to do is select three
rows and right click and press on insert
and then you have three rows so there
you go so that's how you add multiple
rows in a Excel spreadsheet or that's
how you add one single Row in an Excel
spreadsheet now we have started our
Excel worksheet and here you can see we
have employ details on our worksheet now
all of a sudden uh you wanted to add
employee second name as well or a last
name right so you are a beginner and you
don't know how to add a column or you
know you might be a little ambiguous
right so instead of using this simple
step you might end up creating a whole
new sheet or maybe other approaches as
well which are time consuming so let me
give you this simple step all you have
to do is select the column so here you
wanted to add a last name right so B is
your column with the first name and here
you wanted to add a second name or the
last name which is in between the
columns B and C so remember that Excel
adds a column always towards the left
side of a column so here if I if you
wanted to add a column next to V then
you want to select the column C and
right click and select the insert option
so that it can be added in between B and
C which is adjacent to B so let's look
at it right so you have added the next
uh column or a new column right next to
the column V and it's in between the
designation and employee name now you
can add your you know second name so
that's how you create a new column in
Excel now in case if you wanted to you
know create multiple columns Al together
so uh here we have or here we needed a
second name also here you have a
designation and you wanted to add
another column which you know assigns
manages to the employee
right so let's delete it uh Delete the
second column and let me explain you how
what I want to do so here you wanted to
add the second name of the employee and
also the manager of these employees
right so here you wanted to add two
columns all together right uh and now
you might be wondering could I add two
columns together or will it work only
for the one column thing right no it
works for two columns and also more than
two columns altogether so you wanted to
add two columns here right right so
select the two columns you can you can
select or you can click on the column C
and hold that left key and drag it along
the right side okay so here I've
selected two columns and here it's three
right so you can see here uh it's 1 48 5
6 7 6 R cross 3C that means you have
selected three columns if I navigate on
the four you can see we have selected
four columns right now right click and
select on insert and you'll have four
columns in between employee name and
designation now you might have to add
your second name manager's name manager
employee ID you know and the department
everything or you can add anything or
any number of columns in between the
existing columns now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet now you might want to you
know add uh some extension to your data
since we have sales here you might want
to add the dollar logo right so if you
have like five to 10 rows then it's easy
but if you have multiple rows then it
might be a little time consuming in such
scenarios you might want to select the
entire column right so how do you do
that in a shortest method so there are
multiple methods to do it so the easiest
one the first and the easiest one is
clicking on the column number or column
name so here we have the column name
that is e and if you click on it the
entire column is selected and here we
have numbers so let us imagine that you
wanted to select the row number two
click on number two and you have all the
rows I mean the entire row selected all
the cells are
selected right so this is one way and
again there is another way where you can
just you know uh click on the first
table header and press control space bar
so the combination key is control space
bar for columns and if you want to
select the entire row it shift space bar
so this is the method two and another
method so you might have a doubt here
right so when you click on the column
name or when you click on the row number
the entire row or entire column gets
selected right and you wanted to select
only the cells which have data so we
have another way for that so you can
select the cell now hold the control and
shift key and press the lower Arrow key
to select the entire column with cells
having data so there you go you have
selected all the cells in one single
column with only data and all the cells
which do not have data are not selected
same applies to rows as well control
shift right arrow key or left Arrow key
based on your rows and all the rows with
data will be selected I mean all the
cells in a row are selected not the
entire row and U coming back to the
first question that is adding the dollar
symbol so here we have General so go to
the data type and add
currency so you have rupees here so
currently we are in India so we have
rupees now what is the advantage of
selecting the entire row when you don't
have any data in the 57th row or the
next cell right I'll show you now let us
add the number 100 and press enter there
you go let us add another number like
1,000 and press enter so the data
formatting is automatically applied to
all the sales so most most of the time
your cells or the data sheet will be
varying you might have to add or remove
elements or numbers right so in such
scenarios this will be helpful now
comparing two different columns or
multiple columns happens to be an
important job when you're working in
data analytics as you have to come up
with some decisive decisions based on
the data now if you had to do it
manually then you might end up taking
hours or even days based on the data set
you're working with but if I say that
you can do it within minutes then it
would be interesting to work with right
now we'll be doing the same now we'll
work on a sample data set right on my
screen so here we have column one and
column two now our job is to compare the
column 1 and column two and come up with
the result now the first and the
simplest way to do it is use the
built-in conditional formatting which
comes with Excel by default now all you
have to do is select all the data and
navigate to home and in the home go to
Styles group and select conditional
formatting and in conditional formatting
you can see highlight cells so in that
you can use duplicate values when you
click on duplicate values a small pop-up
window will come on your screen and here
you have an option of choosing whether
duplicate or unique so duplicate means
you're comparing the cells and you can
see there are some duplicate cells which
are present in column one are also
present in column two now you can also
check how to uh you know find out the
unique values which are only present in
column one but not in column two so you
can just press unique and there you go
you can find it now you can also try to
you know change the color by filling
with green for The Unique columns and
duplicate cells with color red now this
was the first method and you can also
work out some different ones like uh you
can just directly uh press equal to and
select the cell and equals to and the
next cell press enter and if there is a
match it will give you true if there is
no match then it will give you false now
you can drag it down and see which all
are matching and which all are not now
you can also make some minut
modifications to this so uh if in case
you didn't find the data then you can
say not found so for that uh you can try
if and inside brackets and then you can
give the value as not found if true it's
found first you have to give the True
Values so for true you can write it as
found and in case if it's not found then
you can write it down as not
found there you go close the bracket
press enter and there you go if there is
a perfect match you will have found and
if there is no match then you'll get not
found now so far we have discussed uh
comparing two cells using conditional
formatting and also by using equals to
operator and trying to uh add some
tweaks to the equals to Operator by
involving with if operator and apart
from those we also have another way to
compare two columns in Excel so another
way is using the lookup functions so
we'll use a simple V lookup function to
compare both the cells so for that let's
type in equals to we lookup
space and uh select the cell you want to
check for and then the range of elements
you want to uh compare and then I'll
press F4 to log
them now uh you want the data from
column
one and now you want the exact match so
zero press enter so there you go so the
elements which are present in column 1
and column two are been displayed here
so but in case if the elements are not
found you'll get an error so let's look
at that simply drag the formula to all
the cells and there you go so the
elements which are matching will give
you the proper result but the ones which
are not matching will give you not
applicable or error message this can be
fixed we can make some minor tweaks to
the same
formula so uh we can add if
error
comma simply write an as not
found and close the bracket so that
should do so we have closed the bracket
and press enter there you go now simply
drag this and soon you can see the data
which is having no match is shown as not
found now uh there is another
possibility okay let's get back to
another different sheet so this should
work so uh we we already have the
formula so let's erase that first I'll
erase the whole
data and even this
one yeah now we have the clear column
for so here you can see we have Ford
India and here you can see we have just
Ford and similarly here you have
Mahindra and Mahindra and here you have
Mahindra right so in some situations you
might have to compare two different
columns but the names might be a little
different right so for example uh if
you're working with Oracle and if you're
working with Oracle America and you have
in the first case is Oracle and in the
second column is Oracle America then
those are one and same but you have some
minor text changes right just like here
you have Fort India and here you have
for so what if you had such kind of
issues so you can also make some minor
tweaks to it so using the same lookup
formula you can add equals to we look
up and also the comparision cell which
is this one and you're not you're not
stopping them you're trying to add the
wild card here so the wild card is HRI
which means if there is anything like uh
if you get the comparison between the
first cell and the second cell which
matches and if there is anything extra
rather than the actual cell please try
to consider it so that's what we going
to do so after entering entering the
wild card symbol you'll select the range
of columns which you have to uh you know
fetch the data from and then try to fix
them using function key
F4 you're looking from the column number
one and then you finding the exact match
now you can close it and
enter now let's try to drag
it there you go so you have the data
Mahindra and Mahindra Hundai India Honda
India so that's how you try to use uh
comparing cells in Excel now you can see
I'm on my Excel V worksheet and I have
one table on my worksheet right now so
you can you know transposing or you know
converting rows to columns is a very
simple task I'll explain you in two
different ways so the first way select
all the sales that you have on your
sheet and press on contrl C so it will
give you the copy option and then you
can also place in the same sheet or if
you want you can go to a whole new sheet
and
select the paste option over here but
before selecting the actual paste option
you can see a small drop- down icon
click on that and navigate to paste
special and in this you can see
transpose option click on that or you
know make sure that it's checked and
press okay now you can see all your
columns have been converted into rows
and all your rows are converted into
columns so this was the first way and uh
what is the second where you ask me so
it's really simple select one cell
somewhere and you know you can or let's
create a new sheet as well so here you
can you know write down the formula as
transpose and select the array which you
want to transpose so this is the
array so transpose is basically an array
function in Excel so once you are done
with you know selecting your data press
enter there you go so all your rows are
now columns and all your columns are now
the rows now on my spreadsheet you can
see some data which is the sales data of
quarterly basis and the four different
zones that is North West Southeast so
you can you know make things look better
by hiding these columns and if you hide
these columns it's critical for the end
user to identify which columns are
exactly hidden right to make things a
little easier for your end user you can
select The Columns and then go to the
data option and in the data option click
on the group option so this will group
these columns and you will have the
symbol of minimization which will help
you hide these columns automatically and
unhide these columns automatically now
let's also try to group GH J
columns and there you go now similarly
let's also try to group the rows of
North and rows of West
then you have the row of
South and rows of
East right now all these rows and
columns are been grouped now all you can
do is just click on the minimize button
and those will be minimized similarly
the rules right and to unhide them all
you can do is click on the plus icon and
they will be unhidden
you can also try to ungroup the columns
and rows all you have to do is select
the columns and click on the ungroup
option similarly the rows as
well and that's how you can group and
ungroup rows and columns in Excel now we
are on our spreadsheet and you can see I
have some sample data on my spreadsheet
and it does have some blank rows now how
do I eliminate these blank row so one
step is you can you know select the
entire row and try to right click and
delete
it again this sort of method might take
hours to get rid of all the blank rows
and most of the time you might end up
even selecting the rows with data in it
right so if I want to select multiple
rows then I'll be selecting some rows
with data as well which might be a
little Troublesome in the future now
let's try to use the easier way now for
that go to the find and select option
select the go to special option and in
that select the blanks option and press
okay now hold control key and press
minus key and you will have an option of
deleting the cells now select the entire
row now we are selecting the entire rows
with blank data and press okay and the
cells will be shifted now this was
simple but let me show you another
example so even here we have some blank
rows but in between those blank rows for
example take cell 17 or cell d17 or row
17 we have some data testing and here in
the employee ID we have some data in
a26 and again in b39 we have some data
that is first
name right in such scenarios how do I
eliminate data so we have a simple Logic
for it so all we need to do is add
another row which is to count the number
of cells in the row now that can be
count now here equals to the function is
Count
a let
Tab and the CES will be from A2 to
G2 press enter now you have seven so now
we are basically calculating the number
of cells so if you apply the same to the
entire um data set let's drag
it and there you go so there are certain
places where you find zero which are
basically the empty columns right now
let's do some formatting if you need
then let's try to add
filters crl a control D and now table
will have filters and
headers now here you can see the drop-
down icon click on that now instead of
select all what you can do is Select
zero now you will be highlighted with
all the rows which do not have any data
select all those and press on delete or
what you can do is the same way control
minus there you go
now clear the
filter now all you have is the data
without any kind of blank rows so all
the rows that had some amount of data
are retrained and all the data or all
the cells or all the rows which do not
have any data which are completely blank
they have been eliminated so here you
can see columns and rows so especially
the fourth row and the column C right so
uh currently we have data on our uh
spreadsheet and it is exceeding the
number of rows currently visible on our
screen right so when you scroll down you
can see that the header or the headers
of all the columns are getting vanished
or scrolled up along with the data right
and you might want to keep that so that
you'll have reference to every single
aspect of or every single cell data
you're referring to right so for that
reason you might want to freeze this and
also you might have a doubt what if uh
even even I had this data in the column
section right and what if I had to
freeze that and you know when when you
scroll this and keep that data
uh set on the column as it is right so
we can also do that let's look at both
of them so there is a simple process to
do that all you have to do is select the
cell or for which you want to uh you
know set the or freeze the column
adjacent to it or the row adjacent to it
right so currently I want to let me
expand it so currently I want to freeze
this particular row right and this
particular column so the cell I would be
selecting is the first cell here that is
D5 right so when I select this
particular cell I can be able to freeze
this particular row and this particular
column so now you need to navigate to
the toolbar and then select the view
menu and inside view option you can see
there is an option of freeze pains right
so click on the drop down so you can see
three different options as we discussed
earlier we can either choose to freeze
an entire row that is the second option
or you can freeze the entire column that
is the third option or you can freeze
both that is the first option right
freezing rows and columns so let's
select this one and see if our rows and
columns are frozen or not right so now
let's scroll down and you can see our
row is successfully Frozen there right
and similarly scroll towards right and
you can see our column has been
successfully Frozen right so this is how
you freeze rows and columns or you can
freeze panes in Excel now here on my
sheet you can see we have some numbers
that is $10 or
$10.20 $22 $ 53.1 two $12 and $110 now
the task is to convert these numbers
into word format that is representing
the numbers alphabetically right this
might be a little curious and we also
might end up searching for a predefined
method which is not readily available in
Excel but there is a way where you can
create a function using Excel VBA or
macros now again creating a macro is
completely complex now identifying the
trouble Microsoft has already come up
with a readily available macro code on
their official website which will
support the various versions of
Microsoft Excel starting from Microsoft
Xcel 365 to all the way up to the older
Excel version that is 2010 now you can
scroll down and use this particular
macro function which Microsoft has
readily made us available and use this
to create our own macro in Excel VBA now
let's get back to Excel and you can
create a macro using the developer
option now developer options will not be
readily available in Microsoft Excel to
activate developer option go to home and
go to the options menu in the
last and and here go to customize ribbon
and here in the second drop- down menu
you can see developer option by default
it will not be checked click on the
check option to activate developer
options and press okay now you have your
developer options ready click on
developer options click on Visual Basic
and here to insert a new macro click on
the insert button click on module and a
new macro window is readily available
for you now control V to paste your code
and your function is with the name
number to text right now close the
macro and here your function will be
readily
available equals to and the function
name was number to text press tab to
select the function and select the cell
where you have the data close the
function press enter now drag the same
formula across all the cells and here
you have the text convert ConEd from
numbers so here we have $102 and you
have $102 $22 and no cense $53 12 $12
and no cense and $110 with no cense now
that's how you can convert numbers to
words using the macro which is
predefined for excel in the Microsoft
website so for example uh let us imagine
that you wanted to create one single
cell for all the employees in your
company which stores the first name
second name or last name including the
email IDs at one place right if you want
to do so like let us let us let me show
you how it looks like so let me copy
this
here then that's the first name now it's
your second
name along with the email ID now let us
imagine that you wanted to store all the
employees in the same way right so you
can do this by using combine operation
in Excel now all it takes is just a
simple formula that is equals to and the
first cell
address that is
A2 and you can use an ample Center
sign now you can use the next cell
reference set as
B2 and then colon and the last address
that is E2 now press enter
so when you press enter or tab you will
get this particular answer but this data
is completely uh in a state where you
can't understand it right the first name
last name and the email ID has got
combined all together so you want to use
some spaces right so all you need to do
is just make a little modification to
this particular existing data so you can
press another ENT and include spaces
and then you can separate the email ID
and the name with some
colon so now we have separated the first
two cells that is the first name and the
last name with the space using the
amples sense and then again we have used
an ENT to include the colon and see that
we have also included a space between
the colon marks that it gets separated
cleanly and now let's try to press Tab
and see the result
so there you go the first name and the
second name is separated by space and
the email ID and the complete name is
separated by a colon now you can use
this to all the
sales and there you go all the first
name last name and the email IDs have
been printed here so that's how you use
the combine operation in Excel and you
can see on my screen we have the sales
data of one single employee in the month
of January okay so this is the sales
data of J John in January sales now let
us imagine that we have the same
person's or same John's data of sales of
all the three months okay so here we
have the sales data of John for January
February and March and you wanted to
Club all these three months and write it
down as quarter 1 right so let us try
doing it
now you can see that uh only January is
replaced as quarter 1 and February and
March are still uh remaining the same so
let us try to delete them so we have
deleted them and I think now it looks
like uh this is a sales data of one
single quarter that is quar 1 but again
quar 1 is under column B and anyone who
looks at it feels like this data is of J
January February and March and all the
quarter 1 details are only present in V
column but C and D are completely you
know different from this one right so
you don't want that kind of an
impression on your uh you know the one
who are presenting to you so in those
situations you want to merge all these
three columns and make sure that the
quarter one is present somewhere in
between the cells so that all the data
looks relevant and uh it it defines that
these data elements belong to photo one
right so there is an option in Excel to
do that so select all the Cs at you AO
merge and going to home button and in
home button get into the alignment group
and select merch and Center so you can
do it directly also you have a couple of
more options that is merge and center
merge across merge Sals and unmerge so
we'll go through it one by one so first
we'll go through merge and center so
there you go the cells got merged and it
is been aligned into center now again if
your manager or anyone Superior to you
wants this to be you know independent
like they want it to be in terms of
January February and March so that they
can have access to it in month-wise so
you want to unmerge it back right how to
do that now so the same menu and select
unmerge and there you go you have your
data back in the original form again all
you have to do is you know rename a few
sales that
and you have it back right so in a few
situations okay you can also add
thearters so that it looks more relevant
now um you know now let's try to March
this again and merch in Center yeah now
again uh let us imagine that you are
going through an appraisal cycle and you
also wanted to add some comments about
the sales happening in your company uh
regarding uh all the employees right so
also we have that here now let me expand
a little
bit yeah there you so again let's Marg
and
center
now uh you want it to you know uh you
want it to take a review of your level
one level two and level three managers
so you have all the three um rows here
but you can see the cells are not merged
and uh you wanted to merge every single
row so merging and centering everything
rowwise would be a little time consuming
I mean three columns is okay but what if
you had like uh you had to take a review
from a couple of more managers like 5 to
10 right or imagine you wanted to write
some random comments apart from review
you wanted to write some random comments
based on month-wise uh sales or
something like that so it would be time
consuming right so apart from that you
have another option where you you know
select all the sales and come over here
and select the option of merge
across and all the cells will be merged
all together at once and you will be
having those individual rows where you
can write down your reviews like review
one and so on
review two right so this is how the
option of merch across works and we
already have been through the merge and
center and merge is completely similar
to merge and center so this is how merge
and center merge celles and uh merge
across and unmerge celles in Excel now
there are multiple ways to add dat to
Excel spreadsheet for example equals to
today this is a shortcut method and you
can enter done you will have today's
state but again there is some problem
with this kind of approach so today's
date is 4th of September 2022 now if you
open the same spreadsheet after today
that is tomorrow or day after tomorrow
then you will have a concurrent date
that is 5th of September or 6th of
September right the date will always
vary or get updated according to time
now you don't want to change that or you
don't want that to be happening with
employee state of joining right it
should be stagnant it should not vary
right so there is another shortcut way
apart from using the datetime functions
there is a keyboard shortcut where you
can add date to excel that is control
semicolon so this is the shortcut way to
add date to your Excel spreadsheet and
this particular date will not change
this will remain the same constant date
throughout the time now there is a
chance where you might also have to add
time to your spreadsheet that is date of
joining and time of joining right so
there is another simple shortcut where
you can add time by just pressing three
keys that is holding control holding
shift and pressing semicolon then you'll
have the time so this is how you can add
date to your Excel spreadsheet and add
time to your Excel spreadsheet and this
date and time will remain constant it
will not vary like the 3D function that
we have used here so you can see on my
screen we are on the Excel spreadsheet
and on my spreadsheet you can see dates
in column A and different formats in
column C D E and F respectively Now by
default the data type or the data
present in the a column will be
considered as as general and there are a
few situations where even if you try to
format the date in your format like you
know the customized format you may not
be able to do it because it's still
under the general data type so for that
for being on the safer side what we will
do is select the data and navigate to
the data toolbar and in that you have
the text to columns option press that
and remember to have the delimited icon
you know you might be having the Dash
app as your icon or slash as your icon
for the D limited thing and select that
and next next and here you can see right
it's in general mode so you can press on
date and DMI will be your date format
that is date month and year now click on
finish so it's been formatted now now
let's copy the same data and paste it in
all the four formats so that will see
the different formats that we can change
to or customize to right so there you go
let's expand the columns a little bit
now we have day month and year so now
you might want to change a couple of
things right for example you wanted to
change okay let's see the menu so the
way is to select the cells and right
click and select the format sales option
and in here you can see the date
function and in here you can see
different types of modifications that
you can do to your data right
so you might want to also change your
data based on the location so right now
we are in India and imagine if you
wanted to you know change something
based on us or if you have if you're
having your client in us and he wants
the dates in US format you can also
change that so here you can see English
United States and press on that press
okay and you can see it's been changed
to us format where you have years in the
first place months in the second place
and dates in the last place right and
now let us imagine that uh your client
does not want the date all he needs is
just months right you can also do that
get back to the format sales option go
to custom and here instead of uh you
know uh month date and year all you can
do is just write down month and year and
select okay so you'll have only month
and year not the dates now your client
is being a little more you know he wants
a little more detail and he wants you to
add a lot of granularity to your data
which includes day time Etc everything
right so you can also do that so the
same way go to format sales custom and
here I think it's in date itself so
let's navigate a little yeah here so you
have the day date month and year press
okay so there you go right so that's how
you can do it and now let's try a little
bit more if you have a few more options
pending so go to formats
Els and
custom and you also have
timings so here you have date month year
and timings press okay and they you have
all the timings as well so since these
dates are you know I created them just a
few moments ago to keep it simple so I
did not have to add the diamonds here so
if you are Keen about adding the timings
you can also do that for example if you
wanted to add the timings of the
employees logged in and logged out you
can also do that using the same format
and you can see now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and you can see we have a
column of dates and on the column B we
have age now how do you calculate the
age using the date of birth so this is
completely simple all you have to use is
the dated IF function or if you also
call it as date diff function based on
your choice we also have a specific
entire tutorial based on date diff inex
for further information that video will
be linked in the description box below
you can go through it or you can use the
end screens and I cards linked to this
video to get back to the tutorial based
on date diff in Excel now let's
calculate the age of these dates or
these people with these date of births
so all you have to do is type equals to
and type dated
F and open a bracket we need three
parameters here that is the date of
birth that is the first parameter now
the second one is the today function
because you're calculating the age of
these people as per today right so we
have a today function in Excel press on
Tab to select it and give a close
bracket now comma and if you wanted to
calculate the age in terms of days you
have to um you know give d as the input
yeah here it should be D as the input
and don't forget to use the double codes
here and if you use the single codes
there might be an error so use double
codes if you want it in the Days part
you can give days and if you want it in
months you can give months for now we
want an ear so we will be giving y as
the third parameter and press enter
there you go you have the age here in 26
years you can drag the same function and
you have the ages here as you wanted
right so this is how you calculate age
in x Excel and on my Excel spreadsheet
let me expand
it we have two different timings that is
in and out so here we are considering a
scenario where we are calculating the
total number of hours worked by an
employee in an organization so the end
time will be the time where the employee
logged in and the out time will be the
time when the employee logged out so
here we have made some minor cell
formatting so when you right click on
any of the cell you can get back to the
formatting sales option and in that
option we have selected the am p.m so
there is also another option of choosing
the 24-hour timing that is 13 20 uh 1330
so this represents the 24-hour
format but since we are you know working
on office timings let's keep it as a
PM okay so there you go so we have our
uh timings of in and out now to
calculate the time difference between
the in time and out time so this this
particular calculation is completely
simple all you have to do is press
equals to select out time minus select
in time so there you go press enter and
you have the total number of ask the
employee has been working in your
organization so here also we have made
some minor cell formatting so usually it
comes out as Am Pm right but instead of
that we have made a minor cell
formatting we have navigated into time
and we have selected the 24-hour
formatting so that we have just are
in our output so that's how we have
calculated the time difference between
two in times and out times of an
employee using Excel now Dax in Excel is
a sophisticated formulas type language
that comes in handy while working with
relational data and extracting
information via Dynamic aggregation
functions Dax in Excel stands for data
analysis Expressions Dax functions are
completely familiar to the general and
default functions that are available in
Excel now Dax allows users to perform
slightly escalated and advanced and
custom calculations upon various data
types like character data date time time
intelligence functions and many more and
in Dax there are a variety of functions
such as Dax table valued functions Dax
filter functions Dax aggregation
functions time intelligence functions
date and time information time logical
parent and many more now in today's
session we will look into one such type
of Dax function in Excel that is Dax
date and time function in Excel now
without further Ado let's get into
practical
mode and we have started our Microsoft
Excel inside Excel we have opened a new
blank worksheet Now navigate to data
option in the toolbar and in that go
to the power pivot
window now we have entered the power
puot window and inside that you can see
the option of get external data click on
that and you can see a variety of
options that is you can get the external
data from a database you can get from
web servers that is from data service
and you have also other forms of data
sources and existing connections for now
we will take other forms of data that is
a Microsoft Excel data which is in our
local system select next now provide the
location of your folder just browse and
we will select Dax employ data
open and there you go we have our data
connected to our powerp window click on
next and there you go you have the
selected table and Views click finish
and you can see the data getting
imported into your power
window there you go by default if you
want to add any tax related functions
into your powerp window you'll have an
external added column over here which
looks something like this if there is
not an external column you can also add
the column it's not a big trouble now we
have some data here that is the employee
ID employee name designation of the
employee Department of the employee
salary and joining date Etc right let's
expand this View and see what's what's
more in
it so this column is the date of birth
and this column is the employee joining
date right now we have so much of data
now let us imagine that we want to
calculate the retirement age of all the
employees so now let's rename the column
to
retirement
date so we have our new column that is
retirement date now we will make use of
Dax date time functions to calculate the
age and find out the exact retirement
date of that particular employee so let
us imagine that every employee will
retire after the age of 65 so we have
our date of birth of every employee and
the joining date of every employee now
we'll come up with a Dax de and time
function and calculate the age and then
we will find the retirement date of that
employee now every Dax function starts
with the same method or the same way as
the simple Excel default method starts
that is by starting with an equals to
and then we will find e
date e dat
and and now our first parameter that is
the start date that is the employee uh
the date where the employee joined the
organization so our sheet name is sheet
one now our joining date is in the F7
column select F7 press tab to select it
and comma Now how many months so each
and every year will have 12 months so 12
months into the age that is 65 Star 65
and now you can close the uh function
and press enter and then you'll find the
retirement date of that particular
employee so there you go so we have the
employee dates that is Employee
Retirement dates for all the employees
so the first one that is Jack has the
retirement date of 19 February
2085 and similarly Jennifer has her
retirement date at 15th of August 2084
so that's how we use the Dax functions
in Excel so this is one of the several
Dax functions in Excel that is Dax date
and time functions in Excel so you can
see that I've got some data which is
first name of the employee last name of
the employee and phone number and let us
assume that uh your manager has given
you a task to identify all those uh
employees which did not give an phone
number so you wanted to identify them
using a check box right like you will be
providing a check for all the employees
that we have received the phone numbers
and you will not be checking the
employees which did not give the phone
number right so let's try to do that so
to include a checkbox you might want to
get into the developer option but for
few reasons Microsoft has disabled
developer option by default to any
developer option all you have to do is
just navigate anywhere on the ribbon
here and right click and then you can
see customize the ribbon option when you
click into it you will be redirected
into the ribbon option and here you can
see the developer option on the right
side right this one so by default you
can see that your developer option is
not enabled to enable it you have to
check in it and there you go you have it
now so press okay okay and you'll have
the developer option now go to the
developer option and select the insert
option and there you can see the check
boox now draw the checkbox
anywhere I'll draw it over here and
there you go you have the first check
box right now if you want you can even
customize
this so carefully click it
you can edit the
text and write it
as
done
okay now you can even copy this to all
the
celles just select and drag and there
you go now you can go ahead and check
all the employees which you have
received the phone numbers and you can
eliminate the ones which did not provide
you with phone
numbers that's how you can do it and
there's also another option where you
can use this to include it in a formula
since this data is only of 25 rows you
can manually check in the data and you
can leave the data which is you have not
received but what if you had 2500 right
then you might need formula so in such
scenarios you can use a formula so how
do you use that so for example uh if
this particular box is checked then you
will get a True Value here and if it's
not checked you will have a false value
then you can use that Boolean value to
include in your formula right sounds
interesting now let's try to implement
that you can right click the cell and
you can find format
control then you can see here you have
an option called cell link here select
the cell
link and press okay so here you can see
if you have checked this the value is
true and if if you uncheck
this you can see the value turned false
now you can use this particular cell
reference for including this in a
formula now let us also check how to
include checkboxes on Google Sheets in
Google sheet it's really simple all you
have to do is get into the insert option
and you can see a readily available
check box you don't have to use any
developer options over here and there
you go you can just check now let us
assume that you're giving an important
presentation and you're also requested
by your manager to add the Excel
document that you have used to create
that particular report which would be
something like this when you click on it
it will open a new Excel document or
Excel Window with all the data in it
right so how do we do that let's look at
the demo now let's have a blank slide
and let's get back to the source where
our Excel file is located that is in my
documents so we are currently in my
documents and we have the Excel file
which we used for creating that
particular report now if we copy and try
to paste it on our Excel document it
would look something like
this and clearly it's not visible and
it's not accessible right so instead of
this there is another way where you can
directly add the Excel document in the
form of logo which is a rather simple
idea all you have to do is just click on
the insert option in the toolbar then
navigate to the text group and here you
will find the option called object click
on the object and it will give you a new
window where you can identify which type
of document or object you want to add
either create or create from file so we
have the file in our local system so
we'll choose create from file browse and
from browse we will go into the
documents section where we have our
Excel file click on the Excel file and
click on okay now if you want the data
or Excel file to be displayed in the
form of an icon then click on the
display as icon section and here you can
change the icon so you can choose any
one of the given options let's choose
this particular one and click on okay
another okay and there you go the icon
will be now displayed on your Microsoft
PowerPoint PPD which is completely
clickable as the previous one whenever
you click on this the Excel document
will be opened so that's how you add
Excel document into Microsoft PowerPoint
now we are on our Excel spreadsheet and
here I'm trying to insert some images
onto my spreadsheet so here we have
company logos and Company brand names so
since we already have the brand names
what we need to add here is the brand
logos okay so how do I add such kind of
an image into an Excel spreadsheet that
you might be thinking that Excel
spreadsheets are just for data not
multimedia image of files right so no
it's not it's completely wrong you can
also add your images onto your Excel
spreadsheets is completely simple so
click anywhere on the Excel spreadsheet
navigate to the insert button select the
illustrations option from the addin
group click on that and you know in the
drop down you can see the pictures icon
or the pictures uh button click on
that and select from this device or if
you have an online stock image you can
take that or you can also check out from
online pictures for now I'll select the
device this
device and here I have some images the
images what we need are simply learn and
simply code logos press okay or insert
so here you have
them now you can also adjust the size of
the image using the small buttons
here PR it over
here and done
so you might be wondering is it all done
is there anything more to do uh or just
adding an image is done no most of the
times when you create or you work with
Excel spreadsheet you will not just you
know add some data and add a relevant
image to it most of the time you add
some graphs or you most of the time
you'll add some charts uh to showcase
the data dashboard right so it will be
something like this so this is how you
add the image or graph onto your uh uh
dashboard and sometimes you might not
have enough place to uh display your
entire dashboard during those situations
what you do is you try to hide the row
or column so now let's try to hide this
particular row let us imagine that you
wanted to show only uh two uh charts and
there is no space for your third chart
in such scenarios you might want to hide
or remove that third chart okay so let's
try to hide it and see if gets if it
gets hidden or not when you try to hide
it you can see the column A has no data
and the row number four is been hidden
so we have three and five but what about
the image it is still present right so
if you want to make sure that the row
also hides the image then you might have
to do a little formatting with it so
select the image go to picture format
or you can also right click and directly
navigate to picture format this opens up
a set of options and here you might want
to go to the U third uh one which is
picture format third and select the
properties and here select the option of
move and size with cells so when you
select this when you try to hide this it
will also I mean the graph of the image
will also hide along with the R so
that's how you do it so how to insert
PDF in Excel now there are multiple ways
to insert a PDF into Excel so we will go
through a couple of ways first is here
let us imagine that we wanted to insert
some PowerPoint presentation in PDF
format into our Excel sheet so that it
belongs to excel Basics now click on the
cell where you want to add the PDF or
just click any cell in the Excel
spreadsheet then go to the option of
insert in the toolbar
then navigate to text option click on it
and select
object and here you can select create
from file and then you can browse and
here you have your Excel Basics PDF in
my documents click on that select insert
so here you can just press okay and the
PDF will be inserted now you can
minimize the size of PDF to fit the
cell then there you go the PDF got
successfully inserted into your Excel
spreadsheet now let's discuss about the
second way now the second way is
completely same the only difference is
you can add some logo to your PDF so you
can see it has been added in direct form
of a PDF like what's the first slide of
the PPD but instead of that if you
wanted to highlight it as an icon then
you can select the display as icon
button here and press okay now you don't
have to re format the size of your PPD
or PDF all you have to do is add the
logo to your PDF and it will also
include the title so this is another way
of adding uh you know PDF to your Excel
sheet now another way so a few times you
don't want the first page of the uh PDF
to be visible or any kind of logo of
that PDF reader to be visible on your
spreadsheet sometimes all you want is
some dedicated image or a dedicated logo
right so this time let's try to add a
dedicated image to our PDF so go to
insert again here you can see the
illustrations option click on picture
and from this device so I will select
the simply Lars logo and now you have to
resize the logo a little bit to fit the
cell there you
go you can uh you know click on the
right click button
and and select the option of Link now um
select the existing file or web page
option so if you are interested to learn
more on hyperlink in Excel we have a
dedicated tutorial on that please go
through hyperlinks in Excel by simply
learn which will explain you everything
about hyperlinks in Excel how to insert
them different types of documents to be
inserted and how it works in real time
for now let's try to insert the existing
web page and uh go to documents navigate
to documents and inside this you have
the Excel basic PDF click on okay and it
has been added to your image so when you
click on it it will open the PDF
document attached to it so when you
hover over to the cell you can see it
will ask you a permission do you want to
continue or not just click on this
ignore the warning so you can see the
PDF has been successfully open convert
PDF into
Excel now to do this let's get back to
the Practical mode and try to convert
some PDF data into Excel now you can see
the PDF document which I'm looking to
convert from PDF to excel so this
particular PDF document has a table so
this is the statewise GST collections
that happened during March of 2020 now
we need to convert this tabula data from
PDF format to excel format now we are on
the Microsoft Excel now to initiate the
process we might want to choose a blank
workbook for this so now we are at the
blank workbook and the complete sheet is
empty now let's go into the data option
in the
toolbar and in the data option of the
toolbar we
have the ribbon of get and transform
data in this ribbon you can see get data
option select that and you can see
various options here from file from
database from ezure from other sources
Etc now we need the first option that is
from file and in that we have a drop-
down and in that drop- down you might
want to select the PDF if you have a
Json file you can also choose from a
Json and if you have the data from XML
you can choose that and even you can
extract the data from text or CSV as
well now we need the PDF option so
select the PDF Now navigate where your
file is existing so my file is on the
desktop and now let me select the PDF
document select import now Excel will
automatically analyze the tab data in
the PDF format and give you the results
now according to excel there are
multiple tabular formats table one table
two so basically this table is one and
the same so all the 29 states are fixed
in one table itself but since the PDF is
divided in in sheets this particular
document is considering the first table
as a separate table and the table which
is present in the third page as a
separate table so we have table 1 table
two and there are a few more tables
which Excel is assuming that it might be
table but it's not and another table
which is page number 002 it is a table
and another one is right here now there
is an option of selecting all the tables
all together at once or you can select
only one table which you want want to
select so if you select multiple items
Excel will automatically give you an
option of choosing your tables you can
just tick and select the tables you want
or you can directly select the table you
want on your Excel
sheet so right now let's try to select
multiple tables so I'll be selecting 1 2
4 and five and this particular one is
not a table so I'm eliminating that now
you might want to choose the load option
so Excel is now loading the
[Music]
data now all the data has been
successfully
loaded
now yeah it is giving us a notification
that all the data has been successfully
loaded and now just right click on it
and here choose the option load two and
here select table option and if you want
the data to be U you know loaded to a
new worksheet you can choose that and
select
okay now you can see all the data is
been successfully loaded in the form of
tabula format in the new Excel
sheet similarly let's try to load
another
page in the table
format new
worksheet select okay
and the third
sheet now get ready to impress your boss
by converting all the PDF data into
Excel sheet just in a matter of few
seconds with few steps and there you go
all the four tables are been loaded
successfully in the form of excel in
just a few steps now this is how you
convert PDF F to excel that is how to
add tick mark in Excel now on my
spreadsheet you can see some employee
data so they've been assigned a task and
they want to update the task status as
done and not done using symbolic
statements that is tick mark and into
marks now how to do that it is really
simple we'll discuss two different ways
the first way is to do it by conditional
formatting so click a sell on the task
status go to conditional formatting
click on the new rule yes of course we
can use the icon settings but we want to
automate it so click on the new rule
right so here instead of two color scale
select icon sets now go to the settings
here we don't want the third symbol so
select no cell icon and here instead of
percentage number formula let's add just
a simple number and the second one as
well just a simple number now in the
icon settings select Tech Mark you have
various types of them you know the
circular Tech Mark and let's select the
generic Tech Mark without any out to
circles and into here generate x mark
and now let's set the values when the
value is greater than zero it'll be
green and when the value is less than or
equal to zero it will be X and the
reference value is zero and here also
the reference value is zero everything
is okay click on okay and
done and here you cannot see the logos
yet we need to add some formula here
which is equals to if click on Tab to
select the symbol and if Cell address C2
is equals to
done then the value should be one else
the value should be zero close the
bracket
enter right now you can see this
particular logo here now drag the same
formula it's done now you can see we do
have numbers you can eliminate those
numbers as well just edit the
rules and here you can see show icon
only click okay and the numbers will be
removed also edit the second one and
there you go the numbers are gone and
only the symbols remain now what is the
second technique the second technique is
available in the developer options you
can activate it by you know uh going
into the options here go to file and
here go to options and here go to
Advanced customized ribbon and in here
on the right hand side you will get
developer options click on the tick box
and it will be enabled now go into
developer options and click into insert
menu click on the form controls or
active X controls select the checkbox
and now just place it over here you know
you can edit this particular checkbox
delete everything drag it as checkbox as
well now you can drag the same cell
across all the functions and you will
have the check box as well now you can
click on it and say if it's done or not
whereas how to add Watermark to excel
now on my sheet you can see some data so
here we wanted to add some Watermark
logo to your uh Excel spreadsheet so
that it looks genuine and work by you
right so that's the overall idea of
adding a watermark now go to the insert
window and in the insert window go to
the text option click on that select
header and footer once you select header
and footer you can see something on your
screen like this this so in this box
which is highlighted by a cursor is
where you're going to add the picture on
my top in the menu bar you can see
header and footer elements in this
select the picture element and it will
navigate to you to a different option
window since we are adding the image
from our local system select from file
or if you are adding from your Bing or
any search window you can also add that
or one drive as well but now let's go
with from
file it will directly navigate you to
the pictures folder in your local system
so here is my S logo click on it and
select insert now you can see the images
added in this format which is ENT and
picture and you might wonder where is
the picture it is actually present to
view it click on any cell in the
spreadsheet and there you go you can see
it now you might be wondering the image
is a little towards top and abnormally
placed right so no worries you can
always you know format your picture just
press enter and use ENT
to move your picture towards the center
of your data spreadsheet and also there
is another option of format picture alt
together here you can adjust the height
and width of your image by you know
increasing and decreasing width or
increasing and decreasing height using
the arrow marks also works and apart
from this there is another option of
picture formatting where you can choose
your image to be washing out black and
white gray scale or anything so
currently I'm going with automatic which
will automatically adjust the brightness
and you know everything for your image
it looks perfectly fine so click on okay
and there you go right so now this
should be
fine right now everything is done and
everything is automatically saved if you
are having that auto save option on your
spreadsheet and let's go back to the
normal view from the header and footer
view click on The View and go to
normal you might be confused right where
is the logo vanish did I have to save it
no it's already saved everything is fine
even the image is there but you cannot
see it in normal view to see it click on
file click on print then you can see the
logo it will be present only on the
printed Pages not on the normal view
okay so that's how you work with
watermarks in Excel and that's how you
can add and customize your watermarks
using Excel how to modify or increase C
size in Excel now most of you might
probably want to increase just the cell
size or you know just to increase the
visibility of the text so one of the
easiest way is just to press on the plus
icon on the bottom right corner of your
Excel spreadsheet so this will
automatically increase the text size and
you can see the text more clearly now
apart from that if it's just not that
what you want to do you can also modify
by hovering over to the line between two
columns and right click which will give
you the option of format cells or column
width so either of these options will
help you to maximize or minimize your
column width similarly you can apply the
same idea for your rows as well so you
can either format the cells or modify
the row height of yourself and this is
another way and another simple way is to
just hold that line and drag it so it
improves your width of the column and
another way is to just H onto that line
and hold it and drag it to improvise or
increase your width of the cell and same
applies to your row so this is another
way so apart from that there is another
way that is format cells from this
particular option in the home button you
can select this and here you have the
row height autofit row height column
width autofit column width for example
let us imagine that you wanted to you
know just by mistake you uh you increase
the cell size and you want it to restore
it back to the original thing right so
you can just click on the autofit height
and click on the autoit column width
there you go it happens in that way and
now coming back to
another simplest way let us imagine that
you are given a lot of data and you are
told to autoit all the rows and columns
now we have already seen the format cell
option where will autoit all the columns
and width of the column and also the
height of the rows Etc right but there
is also a key keboard shortcut to do
this so all you have to do is select a
cell and press CR a to select all the
cells in the spreadsheet and once all
the cells are selected all you have to
do is press and hold ALT key and then
release it then the combination of keys
that is H
oi so your column width has been now
adjusted now the same formula or the
same shortcut key with a small
modification press and hold
and release ALT key now h o and a to
adjust the row height so this is the way
where you can increase or decrease or
modify or autofit all the cells in Excel
now you can see that we have the First
Column that is a column and the first
set of that is text and all the other
cells are numbers but as a whole Excel
considers the whole column as a general
data format so why are we discussing
about this so to create a barcode in
Excel you have to make sure that all the
elements in the column are of Text data
type so the first step is to convert
this General data type to Text data type
so you can do that by going into the
data type and selecting text and now all
the elements in your first column A are
type
text now the next step is to convert
these elements into barcode now for that
let's create a new column called
barcode now our new column that is
barcode has been created now the next
step would be is to check for the
barcode font so the barcode font looks
something like this but let me remind
you the bar code font in Excel is not
available by
default don't worry if it's it's not
available we can download it from open
source so let's go back to
Google so on the Google you want to
search uh for barode font for Excel so
the one that I would recommend is three
of9 barcode
font now you can download this font by
just clicking on the download button
over here now I've already downloaded
this font on my local system let's now
try to install that now the three of9
barcode folder will come in the form of
zip folder you have to unzip that and
after unzipping you'll get the setup
file which looks something like this
which is three of9 new select that and
you'll be having the installer file over
here you can install by selecting the
install button over here so I have
already installed it in my local system
so it is readily available for me on my
Microsoft Excel now we might want to
create the barcode for this particular
cell in A2 so let's create that so to
create a barcode we need to write in a
formula that is equals to double
codes star double codes and ENT symbol
address of the cell that is A2 another
ENT symbol again double codes star
symbol and double codes so you can
either use this or instead of star you
can use brackets Sy
spell so let's try brackets now select
enter now this will generate another
type of code in your resultant cell now
we will change the font for this
particular resultant cell and we will
get our barcode now you can just drag
all these cells so that you can apply
the formula to all the codes now I got
all the codes over here now select all
the cells get into the fonts and here
select the barcode font and there you go
you have the barcode for all the numbers
you have in your column A so that's how
you create barcode in Excel Excel
flashfill is a feature of Microsoft
Excel where Excel can sense a pattern in
a cell and apply the same logic to
extract the similar resultant pattern
out of the remaining cells in a table
might be a little confusing right so let
us simplify it so let us imagine that
you have a text in one of the cells in
the Excel sheet and you wanted to trim a
part of that text for example let let us
imagine that there is an assembly an
assembly where the car parts are
assembled together to finish a car so
each and every part has a code the
serial number the product code and the
assembly code Etc right and you wanted
to separate all those three if you
wanted to do that you might want to use
the trim function which might be a
little tedious to apply to all the cells
but what if if I say there is a simple
key format using which you can fill all
the columns in the Excel sheet within a
fraction of second sounds interesting
right so that's exactly the flashfill
function in Excel
does now before we get started let me
tell you guys that we have daily updates
on multiple Technologies if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological Trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply now without further Ado
let's get started with the flashfill in
Excel for that we might want to start
the Excel to get in the Practical mode
now we are on the Microsoft Excel and
remember the example we discussed so
this is a similar example now the first
column in the sheet is the product
detail so this product detail consists
of the product code that is 112 next we
have the product serial number that is 1
025 637 and lastly the assembly code
that is a SN X now we want to separate
this product detail into three columns
where we have the First Column to be
storing the product code second one to
be storing the product serial number and
the last one to be storing the assembly
code so now if you want to do that using
trim function you might want to apply
the trim function here and trim out the
left part and again for the product
serial number you might want to use the
trim function again which might go into
a little complicated pattern So to avoid
the complications and and decrease the
time spent we might want to use the
flashfill in Excel now let us help Excel
about the pattern that we might want to
generate so the pattern is 112 and the
next one is
322 so now you can see that the text was
highlighted that was the intimation from
the Excel that it understood the pattern
now going into the next cell and holding
the control key and pressing the E
button will help us to fill the
remaining cells in the column B so
that's how it is done and similarly
let's try out for the serial
number for that the serial number is 1
02 5637
now in the next cell we have
13
6582 now we can go to the third cell and
press contr e for Windows and if you're
using a Mac operating system then you
have to press command e and all the
serial numbers will be filled so this
will reduce the time in separating the
pattern and filling the
columns now let's try the last column
that is a SX which happens to the
assembly code next we have FG and V now
the shortcut method that is CR e and
there you go now you might be wondering
will it work only for numbers etc etc or
the text which is properly aligned or
separated using a hyphen no it can also
be used for some random text which is
like this so let us imagine that we have
a text which is of length like 20 or 30
and you wanted to print only a part of
it so here I'm going to print the
alphabets from position 4th to position
8th so I've already tried the first one
that is taking out the alphabets from
fourth location to the eighth location
or the pattern of the text that is i f e
r from Jennifer lope and in the next
cell we have the numbers starting from
the location 4 to 8 so that is
7767 and similarly we have the other
cells consisting of the names of few
cars that is Alpha Romeo Bugatti Von and
and next we have Superman return returns
text so now let's press the shortcut key
that is contr e and make sure that all
the remaining cells are filled so that's
how the Flash Fill works so the Flash
Fill in Excel will reduce the time
consumed to fill all the columns by
separating the text in your main cell
that is the column A which we have here
in this example and it also reduces the
complexity of using a trim function in
Excel is hyperlinks in
Excel now hyperlink is is something
which is clickable and when you click on
it it will redirect you to a different
web page to a different worksheet or a
different location in your local system
so there are a variety of options and we
will explore all of them using Excel now
creating a hyperlink is really simple we
have multiple ways now let's write some
text on the Excel
worksheet I'll write simply
long now creating a hyperlink is really
simple you have multiple ways the first
simplest shortcut is clicking on the
cell where you want to place the
hyperlink and holding control key and
pressing K now this will enable the
hyperlink menu box or the dialog box
this is the first way and let me close
it now again we have selected the cell
there is another option where you have
to click on the insert menu on the
toolbar and navigate to Links group
click on the link option and and you
will again have the dialog box of the
hyperlink and Excel and the Third Way is
right click on the cell and you can see
the link option in the last and this
will enable the hyperlink option in
Excel now let's create a hyper link the
simplest way again contrl K now we have
a variety of options that is existing
file or web page place in this document
create a new document and an email
address so we will address all of these
one at each time so first one existing
file or a web page now you can select an
existing PDF file or any file in your
local system and hyperlink or create a
hyperlink to the text or you can select
a website link and place it over here
and create it as a hyperlink Let's uh
explore both the options first let's try
to explore the web page option so since
I have written as simply learn let's use
the website link of Simply learn and
create a
hyperlink let me open
Google new tag and let me type simply
learn.com let me copy the hyperlink and
now let's get back to the Excel webook
now here let's place the hyperlink now
you can press okay and there you go the
hyperlink has been successfully created
now this link is clickable when you
click on it it will redirect you to a
new simply learns home web page right so
this is how you create a hyperlink to a
website now we should explore another
option that is using an existing file
right let's create a new text box here
let's name it as
existing file and okay existing file
should be good again the same you can
either click uh you know right click and
select hyperlink or control key now
let's select existing file or web page
option now here you can see navigate key
press on that and let's navigate our
files let's select all files here
remember to select all files okay by
default it shows as office files now
let's explore our file
option so let's select uh fundamentals
of computer programming option which is
a PDF file press okay and there you go
we have created a hyperlink so when I
click on this you can directly navigate
to an existing PDF file in your local
system and it will be open as a web PR
click on it and you can see the PDF file
now close now another thing when you
navigate onto this you'll see the lenier
HTTP uh address and same happens here
right so if you're a little
uncomfortable watching this L your link
you can also edit it you can choose the
option of edit
hyperlink
and see the screen dip option click on
it and here you can change the text
display
option and write it as click here to no
more press okay
again press okay and now if you navigate
onto it instead of seeing a lengthier
hyperlink what you can see is click here
to nor more okay I think I made a
spelling mistake so I think I forgot an
e somewhere over here yes click here to
no more and press okay right so here you
can see click here to Norm more let's
try this again over
here so edit
edit hyperlink screen tap option and
instead of the lendia text box or
hyperlink you can write as click to open
nodes or
PDF click okay and click another okay
and you are done so instead of seeing
that L your hyperlink you can see click
here to open PDF right so so far we have
explore two options that is existing
file and existing web
page right now let's try to explore
another option again uh hyperlink right
click hyperlink and here you have seen
places in document all right so which is
like uh okay let me show this to you
instead of telling you so here what it
is doing is you have the cell A5 and you
want it to refer to A1 or any other cell
in the same worksheet so you can do that
right so now for your reference let me
cancel it and let me create a new sheet
and here navigate me to here right let
me write it as nav gate me to here okay
so now what we will do is so here we
will create that navigate link from
using the hyperlink option place this in
this document he can see the sheet two
option and the cell reference is E1
where we have written navigate me to
here so when I click this A5 cell okay
let me also rename
it write it as navigate cell navigating
cell right now let's create
that control
K let me select sheet two and the cell
address is A1 press okay
now what did uh what What's the change
right when you click on this you will be
redirected to sheet 2 cell A1 navigate
me to here right so this can be like a
shortcut when you have multiple sheets
like 100 sheets then you can uh you know
have a different column over here and uh
add the navigation address to all those
sale links you can just click on that
cell and go into the different sheet and
to the specific cell which you have
given the address in our case I have
given sheet to address cell A1 right so
this is another trick now let's get back
to the hyperlink thing again uh control
K and another option is create new
document so you might have been through
you know option of uh having let's say
some cheat sheets or uh clip on clip
boards right so uh let us imagine that
you're working through uh a huge
worksheet and uh you won't wanted to you
know uh have a a track of everything and
keep notes updating right so it might be
a little complicated to understand so
let me show it practically so let me
write it down as clipboard or sticky
note
right okay I think this has a hyperlink
let us okay this can be used no
worries back
to uh hyperlink option again
create new document now here you can
create a variety of uh documents right
so it can be a text document it can be
an Excel document it can be a PDF
document right for now we'll create a
text document okay uh we'll name it as
uh
tracker. txt so this should create as a
text
document and the location can be
anything so you can you know uh take it
as a desktop documents download so let
me take documents here and select okay
so I'll be having the tracker. txt
located in the documents
folder and uh you can also choose to
edit the document later or edit the
document now let us select edit the
document now press okay and there you go
so you have your text tracker here so
let us imagine that we have worked on
the Excel sheet and we wanted to write
down us a sticky note uh so that we can
remember what we have done on the Excel
sheet so update
one and uh update to now you can close
it so it'll ask for a save option save
it and done and it is a imagine that you
did something else and you also updated
something else on the sticky note I mean
Excel sheet and you wanted to update
that on your sticky note so click on it
and you'll see a minor notice over here
from Microsoft Excel based on potential
security concerns you can select es and
you'll be having access to your text
document again and write down your
update again here update three what you
have written right the latest update
what you
have and you can save it and
close so that's how you keep track of
your sticky note and you'll have all
your updates right now getting back to
the hyperlinks
again uh the last one is em email
address so you can also try to add uh
okay let us imagine that you're working
with a colleague and every time you make
an update in your Excel sheet or
anything and you wanted to send them out
an email right so it would be a little
timec consuming that you open your email
and uh compost something and send it
over here but what if you had a one
single click and access to the email
compose option right that can be done so
let us write down
email B me with the spelling so again
the control K and hyperlink select email
option and you can write down your
email which can be anything so you can
write down your friend's email address
so I'm just writing down some random
email here friend at gmail
and can write the subject about
update and press okay this will navigate
you to the Gmail option or the mailing
address
options click on it and you'll have a
variety of mailing options Outlook
Office 365 Yahoo iCloud Google Etc so
you can select any one of those since we
have written as gmail.com we'll navigate
to Gmail
and all you have to do is login you know
all the formalities and you're good to
go with
emailing so let's skip this for now so
you you know how to do the rest parts so
so far we have uh you know covered all
the hyperlink options in Excel that is
existing file or a web page place this
in the current executive worksheet or
document creating a new document for
your update thing and uh also including
the email right so so far we have have
covered everything around hyperlink in
Excel and if you have anything to know
more about or if you feel that we have
missed out anything important regarding
hyperlink in Excel you can feel free to
let us know roundoff formula in
Excel now for this particular tutorial
we will be using the student data set
now let's get back to the Practical mode
and start our Microsoft Excel now we are
in the Microsoft Excel and as you can
see on my sheet okay let me expand
this so as you can see on my screen we
have the data set belonging to students
so we have 10 students and every one of
them has name role number class blood
group and marks Etc and at the end we
have the percentage and as you can see
we have the percentage in terms of float
values and we have a lot of decimal
values like eight and above so what if
you wanted to just have one or two
digits after the actual percentage like
80.6 or 80. 66 right it would be a
little bit more or good to read right so
that's what a roundoff actually means so
now let's work on having rounded off
values for the percentage now let's
create a new
column let's name it as
um round
of person
great so to actually perform the
roundoff uh formula we do have a
predefined method for that for that you
just have to type
in equals to
round and they we have round up and
round down so both of them perform the
same operation let's select round up and
this is the m column and the row number
is three so we'll have to press M3 and
the number of values after the decimal
point so now let's select um
one and there you go press enter and the
value should be rounded off now 80. 66
is being rounded off to
80.7 now when you drag the cell to the
all the ruls then you can see all the
values will be rounded off here you can
see 7516 has been rounded off to 75.2
and 82.3 3 is been rounded off to 82.4
so we end up with having rounded
off so first we will understand what
exactly is standard deviation so
standard deviation is a calculated
square of variance now what is variance
okay nothing to worry let us also
understand what
variance now the next part variance so
what is variance variance is a measure
of variability it is calculated by
taking the average of squared deviations
from the mean now what are deviations so
slowly you can understand that we're
getting into the topic of statistics and
graphs so uh before getting deep into it
let's understand what is deviation so
the deviation is a measure that is used
to find the difference between the
observed value and the expected value of
a variable in simple terms deviation is
the distance from the center point so
for example when you are going through a
graph so you will be expecting some
value right and if you get some
difference that is above or below the
expected point that is called the
deviation what is the difference between
the expected point and the obtained
point so that is the deviation now next
is the observed value so the observed
value is the value that you get in real
time unlike the predicted value so now
you might be thinking to calculate
standard deviation we might need a few
more parameters and you're exactly right
so to calculate standard deviation in
Excel you need variance and then you
need deviation and then you need mean
right so all these parameters are
supposed to be calculated first and then
you will be having the final formula to
calculate standard DV now that we
understood the theoretical and formula
based explanation about standard
deviation it's time we calculate the
standard deviation using one of the most
popular business intelligence tool that
is Microsoft Excel so let's get back to
the Practical
mode so now we are on the Practical mode
and we have some sample data on my
screen right now let me expand it a
little
bit yeah there you go so as discussed
before to calculate standard deviation
we might require the mean variance
deviation and deviation squared and then
we can calculate the standard deviation
so let's go step by step so the first
one is calculating sum right so to
calculate average we might need sum of
all the scores so we have the index
values that is 1 to 10 and scores of
each index value that is 1 to 10 right
now let's calculate the sum of all
values here press tab to select the
function select and drag these cells
press enter and then you have the scores
now you want number of indexes so
clearly you can see we have 10 but still
let's count them C ENT tab space to
select and select the number of cells
press enter and you have count now
what's the mean so mean is simply the
average of all the numbers right so you
can either divide the sum by count or
you can simply use the average function
so let's try to is the average function
so that we also have an idea of how the
average function Works press tab to
select it and select all the cells press
enter now you have the average or mean
value now we have the mean value and now
after finding the main value we are
supposed to find out the deviation so
remember the deviation that is the
difference between the obtained value
and the predicted value right so the
obtained value is this one which is here
in C2 and the predicted value is is this
one that is 82.6 that's our mean right
according to formula we supposed to
eliminate the value of obtained minus
the mean right so select uh the cell
equals to
C2 minus the obtained value that is mean
now press F4 to freeze the value and now
press enter so that you can freeze the
value and drag the formula across all
the sets now you have the
deviation right
now the next step is to find the sum of
all the deviation numbers so either you
can apply the sum formula to all these
numbers or you can just drag this cell
over here and the formula will be
automatically copied now similarly the
count function to count all the values
that us drag it and you'll have it over
here right now the next step is to find
out the square deviations or the square
of the deviations which is really simple
all you have to do is equals to select
the cell and uh see that small hat kind
of logo on the number six use that now
into two press
enter you have the square similarly drag
the same formula across all the cells
and you'll have your squared numbers
similarly drag this summation function
over here so you'll have the sum of this
and the count number as
well now comes the final formula
now we have the mean value that is over
here let's color
it and we have the variation
Square now that is which is this one
let's color it in a different shape and
we have deviation as well let's color it
in a different
shape now we need to find the variance
and after we find the variance the last
step is to count the stand standard
deviation or calculate the standard
deviation so what is the formula to
calculate the variance so for variance
you need the sum of deviation
Square divided by total number of
values minus
1 the center and that's your variance
now the standard deviation so the
standard deviation is really simple you
need to calculate the
the variance to the power
of5 and that's your standard
deviation so that's how you calculate
standard deviation in Excel I hope all
the formulas and the explanation was
clear so you can see that we have got
started with Microsoft Excel and on the
left hand side we have a simple table
with all the teams in an IT industry
starting from it admin testing
development to client consultant support
we have got everything in this
particular
table now our main idea is to find out
the index of these particular elements
for example if you wanted to find the
index of the element marketing then how
could you do it so here let's try to use
the match function in Excel for that we
want look up value and position so on
the right hand side you can see that
I've created two separate columns as
lookup value and positions so in the
lookup value column we will be inserting
the value of which you want to find the
index now for example let us consider
that we want to find the index value of
Team
marketing so I'll be writing Marketing
in this particular lookup
value now how to find the index value of
the element marketing for that we will
be using the match function in
Excel now after writing the match
function you can see that it is asking
for three different parameters so the
first one is the lookup value second is
the lookup array and lastly we have
match type so lookup value is the value
of which you are trying to find the
index that is marketing this particular
cell so we have selected the lookup
value which is the first one next we
have to select the lookup array that is
from which set of elements you want to
find the index so the set of elements
are this it admin testing the column
which we have created the a column now
we have selected the lookup array and
lastly the match type is it you're
looking for less than or is it you're
looking for exact match or is it greater
than match so for now I want exact match
so I will be selecting the exact match
that is zero
now there you go you have the exact
index of the element that is five now we
have selected all the 10 teams starting
from it 1 admin 2 testing three
development 4 marketing five so that's
how you find the index of a selected
element in
Excel now we just have like 10 elements
so we have got the uh writing of the
elements or you know uh choosing the
elements in a easy way but what if if
you had like 100 elements right could be
a little different okay so let me put it
simple now you wanted to find the index
value of Finance so right now we have
marketing and you wanted to type in
finance and you missed out a letter
A okay now you're not finding the right
index to avoid such problems you can
always take the help of data validation
in Excel that is using the list in data
validation in Excel you can see a small
drop- down icon here right you can
choose that and here you can see all the
teams that we have created in the left
column right so here I can scroll down
and choose the finance and there you go
I have the index value okay again we
need to copy paste the same match
function in Excel over here
equals to
match look up
value look up
array and exact
match so there you go that's how you
make use of data validation in Excel and
using the list you can comprehend all
the list elements in this particular
column into the list of data validation
and you can choose the team which you
you want to find the index for so this
is how you can make use of match
function in Excel or index match
function in Excel to sort data in Excel
so on my spreadsheet you can see some
employee data and on the column f and g
you can see employee date of birth and
employee date of joining for example you
wanted to sort the employee data in the
form of earliest joining employee and
the latest joining employee right that
is who is the employee who joined first
to this company and who is the employee
who joined last to this company so for
that you just need to select the column
of date so let's select both the columns
and go to home and check or verify if
the data type is date or not so
generally the data type will be set to
General by default by Excel so we need
to make sure that we have the proper
data type which is State now that we
have the proper data type select the
entire column and go to the data option
and here select the sort option and in
the sort option select the expand
selection click on sort and here s by
employee date of joining and oldest to
newest that's what we wanted the oldest
employee or the you can also set it to
the newest employee to oldest according
to your requirement but we'll go to
oldest to newest according to the case
study right now just click on okay and
that should be done so Emily who's a
manager is the old oldest employee who
joined the company and Chris who is a
trainee in it support is the latest
employee who joined the company now
that's how you sort date in now on my
screen you can see the sales of four
quarters from different regions that is
east west south north and Central now
you might want to calculate the sum of
sales happened from all the regions in
q1 or you might want to calculate the
sum of sales happened in one region of
all the four quarters that is either you
want to calculate the sum of all the
regions from quarter 1 or you might want
to calculate the sum of all the quarters
in one region right so to do this you
have some simple functions in Excel so
you might say me you have some function
Etc right for that you might want to go
into the you know equals to mode and
fetch some option and subtotal or some
you have to select the function from
here but but what if I tell you that
there is one simple easy shortcut where
you just have to make one single click
and you'll have all the sum right so
that seems interesting so on the top in
the home bar select home and in on the
top right corner you have the editing
group in editing group you have
aggregation function that is summation
so you have different aggregations here
some average count numbers maximum
minimum more functions here you might
want to select the sum and you can get
all the sumission numbers here so I'll
select one cell so the second query
where we wanted to calculate the sum of
all the sales happened in east region
with all the quarters included that is
this one C2 to F2 right so let us select
G2 and select the autosome option and
here it will automatically select the
range for you that is C2 to F2 if you
want to change it you can also you know
change it like minimize the number if
you just wanted to calculate the sum of
three quarters you can do that so now we
want four quarters so select enter and
there you go you have all the sales of
all the four quarters of east region now
if you simply drag it you will have the
sum of all the four quarters of all
different
regions now let us calculate the
summation of q1 of all the regions that
is this one Select Auto some and it will
automatically select all the set SS for
you that is from C2 to C6 right press
enter and you'll have the summation
similarly you can you know drag it and
you have the numbers here of all the Q2
sales of all the regions Q3 sales of all
region and Q4 sales of all region now
let us try to change the color so you
can have a reference that is it's
different it's it's a total sum or right
you just have a reference to identif y
it now similarly to this one as
well so that's how you implement Auto
sum in Excel now we are on the Excel
spreadsheet so you can see that I have
five different sheets of the same data
so why do we have that so I'll be
explaining you how to sort data for
multiple parameters so firstly we will
try to sort data in the form of numbers
right so let us imagine that this data
is being shared with you by your manager
and he wants you to sort this data based
on the salary numbers so he wants you to
arrange the data in the form of
ascending order or descending order
maybe which will help him find the
employee with the highest salary right
so how could you do that so it's really
simple you could sort the entire data
just within a few clicks so how would
you do that so since you're focusing on
salary select any sell from the salary
column only right select this particular
column and select any sell in the salary
column get into the short and filter
options and here select this sort of
arrangement you need that is largest to
smallest or the smallest to largest
since the problem statement was to find
the highest salary click on largest to
smallest and there you go so you have
Tony and the designation is senior and
he works in it support and he draws the
highest salary of
80,000 right and there's also another
one which is Peppa and she works for the
analytics team and now the next sheet
let's get into the sheet two and this
time let us imagine that you wanted to
you know uh arrange or sort the data
based on the employee date of joining or
date of birth right again if you wanted
to arrange the data in which you find
the youngest employee or the oldest
employee of the organization you can do
that click on any cell in the date of
birth column and go back to the sort and
filter and here you will be seeing the
options sort oldest to the newest or the
sort the data from newest to the oldest
so since we want the oldest employee
select oldest to newest and there you go
so the oldest employee is Alfred who is
an associate designation employee and he
works in the admin department and he's
drawing the salary of
25,000 so that's how you can sort the
data when you are trying to sort the
data based on date wise so first we try
to sort the data on the number wise so
you can apply the same for your employee
ID salary and if there is any
possibility you can do that as well and
if you want to apply the same sorting
based on dates you can do that as well
using the Sorting function in the same
way now let's get back onto the third
sheet and here now uh single column wise
is perfectly fine there is no issues
with that now you wanted to you know uh
let us imagine that you have two columns
okay let's eliminate a few columns here
maybe we can eliminate the employee ID
and uh okay let's keep a few EMP columns
so we'll just keep employee name and
employee salary okay so here we are
trying to demonstrate if you are uh
trying to sort the data using one cell
in the column B will it maintain its
relationship with the cell a okay uh
that's our query right so let's see I'll
go a little detail so let us imagine
that you wanted to sort this data based
on highest salary okay so when you do
that will it also impact the cells in
the column A so it will basically impact
but just uh it's a query right any of
you viewers might have that query will I
uh if in case if I try to sort the data
based on this will it affect the cells
on the rest of the data set okay so in
basically it will impact so I'll try to
you know sort the data based on
ascending
order so this is the smallest to largest
and you can see uh the Tony and pepper
so since I selected the cell in the
column B it also impacted the change on
the cells of column A so that's how the
Sorting works now we'll get to a little
advanced
sorting techniques so here we try to I
mean already we try to sort the data
based on numbers based on alphabets
based on U you know uh date date of
birth right so I think we forgot the uh
ascending or you know of sorting based
on alphabets let's do that as well
select any um cell in the column A and
go to sort and filter try selecting a to
z or okay let's try to Z to way okay so
here you can see the U names have been s
based on the descending order from Zed
to a right so so far we tried on
alphabets so far we tried on numbers
date of birth and a couple of more
things so let's dig a little deeper and
try to sort based on colors right so for
that you don't uh you know find that uh
extra setting here in the regular
sortant filter so you might want to get
into the data option and here you'll
find another sort function which is a
little advanced so that's how you do it
so since we have colored in the cell or
column of salary select that salary and
we're going with cell value so in the
cell values section select the cell
color and here on the cell color options
you'll have green blue and yellow that's
what we have used in our um cells so
let's keep Green in the first position
which is on top and press okay now
you'll see green been sorted to the
first position now yellow and blue are
left out so why is that so because you
didn't provide it right so you can do
what that as well uh I mean you can
always add uh the setting to
it right select any cell go to sort and
add a level and then again select the
salary and sell values to cell colors
and now the cell color in the second
position would be blue and that will be
on bottom and I can add another level
the same salary
the cell values will be cell color and
uh cell yellow will be somewhere in
between or bottom okay so based on
hierarchy uh it will be selecting press
okay
and there you go so you have cell yellow
and blue at the bottom and green at the
top position as for your
suggestions now we are on the last sheet
so here in this this last sheet we are
going to you know um dig a little deeper
into the advanced sorting methods so
previously we try to apply the advanced
sorting methods for colors now we'll try
to apply the advanc Sorting methods
based on the data set we have here I me
the data we have in our data set right
so select the sort option and let's add
a few details right so firstly let's
sort the column employee ID okay okay so
let's have the smallest to largest or
yeah now that would be good now let's
add another level where we will
sort okay uh I think we will sort based
on employee name that would be a little
better so let's try to uh sort it on
employe name here and here will be
employ salary okay now the cell values
and this would be from a to zed and the
salaries will be from smallest to
largest so basically what we are trying
to do is we are trying to sort the
employee list based on employee names
from a to zed so the employe name
starting from a to zed will be ordered
first and another subset of the Sorting
will be done based on highest salaries
that is smallest to highest so let us
imagine that we have three employees
with Nam starting from a and their
salaries are 10,000 20,000 and 30,000 so
how would it sort so it will sort
basically uh in the alphabetical order
first so first three names will be
sorted and then it will also have
another condition to sort the data with
keeping the lowest salary on top and
highest salary in the last right so uh
this is how the algorithm works for
sorting now let's press okay and see the
output so there you go the names are
Alfred and you have the highest salary
here smallest to highest so this is
25,000 next we have Banner bars and Ben
so here you might be seeing why we have
been in the third position despite he
has a low salary and name starts with B
right so here it is trying to work based
on the alphabets in the order right so B
A and B E it's not just comparing the
first letter is also comparing the
following letters as well right so n
comes first R comes later so B is pushed
to the second position a comes first and
E comes later so B A letters are pushed
to the first position and Ben is pushed
to the third position so that's how it
works right so accordingly the set for
BA is created here 3540 next Ben well
and next you have Bobby Brian Brock
Chris Clark right so that's how the data
has been organized and sorted based on
multiple levels of parameters you
provide for sorting so that's how you
use sorting in Excel slicers and filters
in Excel so slices in Excel are software
filters used along with with Excel
tables or Excel pivot tables over a
large amount of data not just filtering
out data but slices also help you with
an easy understanding of the information
being extracted and displayed on the
screen now Microsoft Excel slices are
compatible with Windows and Mac and toou
operating systems now let us understand
how to implement slicers in Excel so for
that we might want to get back to the
Practical mode that is starting our
Microsoft Excel
now we are on our Excel sheet and as you
can see on my screen there is some data
available on the Excel spreadsheet and
this table is not just any table this
table from Microsoft Excel is been
converted into an actual table as you
know by default Excel considers all the
data which has been inserted into the
spreadsheet as a database and to
implement this license in Excel we might
want to create or convert the format of
database into a normal table for that
you can select all your data and just
press contrl T and that will allow you
an option called convert the data into
table now since this table is already
converted as a table we can directly
start implementing or inserting slices
into the
spreadsheet now for that select all your
data then going to the insert option
and in the insert ribbon you can see the
filters group and in the filters group
select the option called slicer now you
will be provided with multiple options
since we have the columns employee ID
employee name Zone designation
Department salary employees date of
birth and employees date of joining so
we can choose any of the options
available according to our columns and
create the slices now let me select the
first one that is Zone next designation
department and let's also select
employee
name now press okay and there you go we
have our slices now let us try to
rearrange these slices all you can do is
just select and drag them up
and done now let us imagine that we want
to see or take a look at the employees
who are working in the East Zone then we
have all the information displayed on
the screen who are working in the East
Zone they are Jack Tony Banner Fred Etc
and their Department designation etc etc
all on one single screen so this really
helps you while you're presenting your
data in a presentation now for a change
let's try try to select the department
now if your client wants to select the
data from only analytics Department then
you might want to select on the
analytics key on the department slicer
and there you go you have an employee
called luk hops who works in the East
Zone and his department is analytics and
his designation is contract based and
the salary he is getting is
65,000 now
similarly uh you can see that we have
only selected analytics and and your
client also wants data from it support
now you can see that analytics is gone
but what if you want both analytics and
it support then you have an option
called select multiple then you can
select analytics and it support and if
you want HR you can also do that and in
the zone if you want West along with
East then you can do the same east and
west and you have all the employee
details and in the designation let's try
to select uh senior traine okay select
multiple senior traine and manager so
that's how you do it so that's how it's
done and that's how you implement
slicers in Excel to simplify the
filtering options using slicers during a
presentation it is really simple to add
filters in Excel so we are on a
practical mode right now so on my screen
you can see an Excel spreadsheet of
sales data so here you have various
columns regions category state
subcategory sales quantity and much more
right so now let us imagine that we want
to add filters on the region part so we
have south west east Etc right so we
want to you know let us imagine that you
want to extract the data of only west
region and you wanted a filter so doing
it manually could take a lot of time so
using filters will be helpful now select
one cell on the headers part and select
the filter option in the data toolbar
you can see the data option on the
toolbar right so click on the data
option and navigate to sort and filter
uh group and in that select the option
of filter now you can see the filters
are been added to all the column headers
region category state subcategory sales
quantity right now we wanted the West
category so when you see or when you
click on the drop down icon you can see
all the options are selected right the
central east west south every everything
right but now we just want West one so
click on West and select okay there you
go so you have everything from the west
region now let's imagine that you wanted
to look into uh office supplies only or
technology only right you can do the
same with the technology and press okay
and now you'll have all the technology
related sales in the west region right
so that's how you use filters in Excel
or that's how you add filters in Excel
goal s in Excel so for this tutorial
we'll be considering the students
database now let's get back to the Excel
so now now we are on the Excel sheet and
you can see that in this particular
Excel sheet we have some student details
we have the serial numbers names role
numbers class blood group and some
subjects like math science computer
statistics social GK and the final marks
optain percentage and total marks right
so let us imagine that uh a company has
come for an interview so all these
students are going to attend an
interview and uh the minimum percentage
to attend the interview will be like
75% so you can see that we have 75 here
and all the students have got above 75
except for the one student which is Mike
right so for Mike to attend the
interview he needs 75 percentage or
above so uh he can make some
modifications in one of these subjects
right so there is always an exam after
the exam called as Improvement exam so
if you can like to score some extra mark
in the subjects which you have scored
less so that you can make up to the
percentage what you're expecting you can
do that so here in this particular sheet
uh Mike has six subjects right and in
six subjects you can see he has scor 76
91 45 71 94 and 62 so out of these he
have scored Less in one subject compared
to all the subjects one subject is
really low that is computers so what if
he can give an improvement exam and
increase his percentage to 75 right so
that can be done so we can do some root
Force methods like we can change the
marks like 55 and then check this
particular one so it's getting 74 right
so using the brute force method will be
a little bit lengthy so you can do this
because it is just a small uh table
which has least number of data and you
just have one single cell to modify so
that can be done in small tables but
what if you had some table with hundreds
of rows or thousands of rows that will
be time consuming right so for that we
have some inbuilt functionality in Excel
that is called goalseek in Excel so for
now let's eliminate the marks
here so we have eliminated the marks and
the upgraded percentage is 65 now we
need the target as
75 okay so let's uh write it as
Mike's Target right we need mic so
Mike's new Target
as
[Music]
75 okay now to make sure that we need a
Mark here which can get mic to 75
percentage we will use the the data
operation so here on the toolbar which
has file home insert Etc we have one
other option called as data so when you
click on data from toolbar you'll have
this ribbon and in this ribbon we have
various options so when you come into
forecast group we have an option called
wtif analysis when you click on wtif
analysis you'll have a set of options
out of which we have goal seek now for
goal seek we need to select a table cell
that is this particular table cell that
is
M9 so we need the value 75 here right so
what is the cell that you need to change
here for that you need to select this
one and select this particular cell here
right and now you can select okay now
you can see that Excel has automatically
run all the permutations and
combinations and has come up with a
number so that the overall percentage of
mic will be 75% right so the expected
marks that Mike should be getting in his
computer's Improvement exam should be
equal to 56 or greater than 56 to get
the final Target at 75 so that he can
attend the company's interview so this
is how we use goal set or goal seek in
Excel we are on our Excel spreadsheet
and here you can see I'm trying to
create an calendar for the employees in
the company where you might have to you
know write down down the day and month
and year or week of your birth date or
maybe your joining date or maybe also
your last working day right this might
be useful for all the employees to you
know uh avoid them from writing it down
manually so how do I create it so it
takes a few simple steps all it takes is
some data validation methods and also
there is an exclusive video specifically
made on data validation in Excel link to
which is in the description box below or
you can search it on our official
YouTube channel now you can see that uh
the word calendar is on the first cell
that is A1 but we have four cells below
it that is A3 B3 C3 and D3 so you might
want to add this to all the cells right
like may be in the middle so for that
you can do the option of mergin Center
also there is a tutorial on mergin
Center about all the options available
in this particular thing so you can go
through that also and uh yeah we have
done the first step now all we need is
day month year and week so in a calendar
or in a month you'll have days from 28
29 30 or 31 days right so let's create a
list or the drop- down menu for that so
that whenever you click it right so
whenever you click on that particular
cell you will have the list of all the
days available right so let's get
started with with that let's create a
new
sheet so why are we creating a new sheet
you won't want that all the numbers in
your calendar sheet right over here
right so for that so we are creating a
new sheet and all the data will be
available here so here let's write down
the days first and here the second
number also you can use the option of
Flash Fill so that you can you know uh
reduce the effort here so you can see
the Flash Fill option over here all you
need to do is select the sales and drag
them down until you get your required
dates right so let's keep it till 31
days there you go you have the days so
these will be your days and here now the
next option was month right yeah month
and here now using the same flash F
option you will you know add the months
into your sheet so this will be
Sunday so Excel has this smart flash F
option where you can just drag the data
and everything will be filled according
to your requirements so Sunday to
Saturday now the next one right that is
your
month so same as the before process
we'll create January
now you can use the flash Bill option
and all the way up to December now the
last one was the
year so
1990 and
1991 so you can select the cells and
Flash Fill Up to
2022
maybe yeah 2022 should be good enough
now this is the flashfill option you
have here and also we have an exclusive
tutorial on flashfill alog together you
can go through it for a detailed
explanation as well now coming back to
the original sheet so this is where you
create your dropdown list right so
select the cell where you want to add
the dropdown list navigate to data and
then here is your data validation menu
so we have a variety of data validation
options over here there is an exclusive
tutorial on that you can go through it
for now we'll look into the list option
only because we want to create a drop
down list right so here it will ask for
Source click on the source here the
source bar right now navigate to sheet
number two where we have the days
options select the
range so this will be your range and
select okay also you can add some
message here right what you can do is uh
in case if there is an error or
something right you don't want that to
be happening so all you need to do is uh
write down and select from
dropdown select from dropdown only
so this could be a message select from
dropdown only the title is Select
options or just
options in case if there's an error you
can write down your title as invalid
data and you can write down a messages
please
select from drop down only
so um in case of someone tries to write
as 32 or 33 to check the Integrity of
your data validation then they will
encounter an error and an error message
and then they must be understanding what
exactly they try to do and if it's
correct or wrong right so this is to
make sure that whatever the data you
enter is correct and Val valid so okay
and here you can see select from the
drop down list only options with with
option list as title and let's try to
enter 32 right and when you press enter
you will see an error so the error
messages invalid data please try to
select from drop down only so you can go
for a retry and select the drop down
right so let's eliminate them and now
select something from the drop down so
let's take it
as maybe 10 right so this is how you
cleared the day one now let's try to do
with the month same data validation
option settings will be list and Source
will
be this one
think I made a mistake here so let's
cancel this and go back to sheet two and
rename this as our week yeah now coming
back to the month
again it will be a
list and the s will be in sheet 2
navigate to the sheet 2 and select your
range and input message the same
options select from dropdown
only and error alert title will be
invalid
data this one will be please let
from drop
down
only it's okay and that's done now let's
continue with here as well let's quickly
do the same
it will be a list Source will be in
sheet to
this is your list press okay and lastly
the week same process it will be a list
Source will be in your sheet
to the input
message options
ble invalid
dat let drop down
only right so your drop down list is
ready now so the month will be anything
So currently we have me and here can be
anything anywhere so let's take it as
9096 11 and week can be you know the
adjacent week so what was 10th of May
1997 let's check our
calendars was a Saturday
so it was a Saturday and that's how you
create drop down list in Excel and if
you want you can also add borders to
your calendar right so that's how it's
done so what is data validation in Excel
so it is a feature by Microsoft Excel
where it can restrict data entry into
certain cells by using data validation
and it will prompt the users to enter
valid data in the cells based on the
rules and restrictions provided by the
creator of that particular sheet now
this would be a little confusing to
understand so to understand it in a much
better way let's get back to the
practical way where we will start
entering some data validation rules to
our Excel sheet and try to enter data
into it now we are on the Microsoft
Excel and this particular sheet is based
on employee ID employee name employee
Department employee salary fiscal year
and work timings of the
employees now we will be applying some
data validation rules to each and every
column and try to enter data based on
the rules we have entered now for the
first one which is the employe ID we
will enter rules based on the employee
ID number so to apply the data
validation you need to go into the data
tab on the
toolbar and inside the ribon you can see
data tools group and in the data tools
group you have the option of data
validation now select the entire column
go to the data tools group select data
validation option and you will have this
particular popup menu and here you can
see different types of options so since
we are entering employee ID it would be
a whole number so let us select whole
number option and now here you can see
the option of between not equal to equal
to not between greater than less than
Etc so let us select between and let us
assume that your employee ID has five
numbers and uh it should be between
10,000 to
11,000 so let us provide
10,000 and
11,000 now select okay and now the new
rule has been
applied so now the minimum value of each
and every employee ID should be equal to
or more than 10,000 and less than 11,000
and it should have five digits now let's
try to enter a wrong employee ID that is
just one there you go you can see that
Microsoft Excel is not allowing you to
include a wrong number it says this
value does not match the data validation
restrictions defined for this cell so
now you can press retry and try to enter
some number which is in between 10,000
to
11,000 now it is
10,901 and this will take the
entry now let us assume that because I'm
the creator of the shet I know what
should be entered here but what if I
give this sheet to you and you are the
person who's trying to enter the number
and it shows the error and you don't
know what was the error right to avoid
this kind of confusion what you can do
is you can do some uh ways where you can
provide the message to the user so that
can be done by okay let's select the
sheet again and go to the data
validation and here you have the same
settings now here you have another
option saying input message so before
input message let us go to error alert
now
here the error title would be data
entered is not
valid please enter this is the error
message please
enter
EMP
ID
between
10,000 to 11,000
press okay now when you try to enter the
wrong number it will show that
particular error alert
message see data entered is not valid
please enter employee ID between 10,000
to 11,000 now this is fine but how long
this will be you know what if there is
an option where you just hover over to
this cell and it automatically tells you
to enter the value between 10,000 to
11,000 without having to face the error
yeah even that can be done so you can
select the entire column and go to data
validation and here this is the input
message this is where you can do that so
here you can write the message name
valid
data please
enter data
between 10,000 to
11,000 now when you hover over to any
cell in this particular column it will
automatically show you this message
where you can avoid all the errors just
select okay see when you select any cell
in this particular column it will
automatically tell you please enter data
between 10,000 to 11,000 so here you
don't have to face any errors right now
let us try to enter the valid
data
1
9 0
2 and it will take it as the correct
value and again 1
903 now in case if you try to provide
the wrong number it will show the
error
see so that's how it is now we have
finished the whole number part now let's
get into the employee name where we have
to
provide uh the second type that is text
length now let us imagine that uh
in your company you're trying to provide
ID cards to your employees and you know
that ID card is really small and inside
that ID card you need to include the
employee photograph and your company
name employee ID blood group phone
number address everything and also you
need to include the name of the employee
so what if there is an employee with
very lengthy name like 30 characters 40
characters yeah in India it is really
possible that you might have a lengthy
name so what you can do is you can
provide the text length where the text
is limited to like 15 or uh 20 uh uh
characters so you can include that name
in the ID card so you can do that by
allowing the data validation criteria
with text length uh minimum can be
anything so minimum can be one and
maximum here you can provide 15 and
press okay okay minimum will change it
to at least uh two
and yeah let it be one so minimum is one
and maximum is 15 characters and press
okay and uh let us also provide the
input
message
enter character type character
data please enter valid name
and error
[Music]
alert invalid
data please enter valid
data okay please enter
characters less than
50 press
okay now let us try to enter a random
name okay uh we'll enter characters more
than 15 here
quy
z uh yeah it's like 1 2 3 4 5
11 okay now this is more than
15 okay I think it's not more than 15
let's try to enter a little bit more
characters yeah now we have entered more
than 15 characters and it is showing
please enter characters less than 15 so
now we can retry and try to enter some
valid
name
um now we have characters less than 50
so it will take as the proper name now
let us try to enter another
name I'm just entering some random
data so another name maybe
great now the next type of data
validation is also done now let us get
into employee Department employee
department is something really superb so
I'll tell you about it it's actually a
list now let us finish the other ones
first that is employee salary physical
year and work timings after that we'll
learn about uh the list one now let's
come into employee salary so salary is
something where you have to include
decimal points so now let us go to uh
data validation and inside the values we
have already dealt with whole
number uh text
length yeah now we'll uh deal with
employee salary that is decimal now
minimum is okay what is uh minimum can
be 1
point0 and maximum can be 1
lakh or let us put that as 10
lakhs press okay okay not not just them
and enter
valid
salary okay now let's change it to
minimum as 10,000
so the employee minimum salary will be
10,000 and input enter valid salary
enter
salary
between
10,000 to 10
lakhs let us include a comma here too
now error
alert invalid
salary please
enter
between
10,000 to 10
lakhs press okay now the message and the
data validation conditions are applied
to this column now let us try to enter
some invalid data first it will show the
error now we need to enter the valid
data yeah now it is taking the valid
data let us provide
20,000 and this has
35,000 now the next one
is fiscal year let us imagine that we
wanted to you know work on the employees
for current working year that is 2020 to
2021 and or you can consider 2021 to
2022 not more than 2021 and not less
than 2021 for that you can provide the
year option as well so for that you need
to select the entire column go to data
validation settings and inside here you
have an option of date so uh let us
provide the date option as between and
start date is
01/ 01/
2021 and end date is
01/01
SL
2022 and input
message let us provide data as
current fiscal
year Current financial
year and enter
date
between 2021 to
2022 let us copy this and go into error
alert error message will be SE
invalid
dat select okay now the error message
and uh the data input message and the
data validation rule has been applied
for this column so let's try to enter
some date here you can enter uh 02 of
February
2021 it will take as the correct data
now let's try to enter some wrong data
which is apart from 2022 02
02 20 22 it will not take this it will
throw error so that's how it works now
let us try to enter uh
2021 and this is
March it will take it now another
data 04 this time and
2021 so that's how your uh date data
validation will work now coming into the
next type of data validation that is
time so we have time here let us imagine
that you are providing some work timings
to your employees that should be from
9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. not more than
that so you want to keep your work life
balance for all your employees so you
just want them to work between 9 to 5
and that should be fine and anything
apart from that time should be invalid
so you can do that by selecting uh time
option between it should be in between
and the start time will be
09 0 0 and this should
be
uh 17
that is 5:00 p.m. in the
evening and input
message please
enter time
between 900
a.m.
to
okay 5
this should be the input
message now error
alert invalid time
error message okay
now okay work timings now this should be
okay we can do this as two columns
actually let us
cancel let us copy this and paste it
here you can do it as
login login timing and this should be
okay
this should be log
out so this should
be okay so this will be considered as
login and log out times now let us
provide the login time this should be
the right time and uh let's try to
provide wrong timings 08 now it will not
take it it will throw as error so it's
working fine let us provide 10 now let
us provide the logout time it should be
below 500 p.m. so let us provide 5 it
will take
it
okay let's try to provide something just
1 minute less than
five it is
59 okay there is some problem in this
let's check
it okay it is taking uh three that is
including
seconds okay let's provide seconds as
well 05 0 0 0 0
okay still there is some
[Music]
problem okay we have entered four we
should we are supposed to enter 24hour
timing right
14 okay uh it should be 17 I think this
will work yeah now we are following
24-hour timing here so let's provide
another timing that is
16 30 0 0 this will be valid and
1530 yes this is also valid now we have
finished almost all types of uh data
validation things that is we have
finished with any value whole number
decimal date timing test length and the
last one is list so this is where things
get interesting now let's cancel this
now select the employee column now if
you're running a company then definitely
you'll not have only one Department in
it you might have multiple departments
right so let us consider that you have a
software development company so in that
the basic departments will be software
development team and software testing
team so what you can do is you can
provide a
list so using that list you can just uh
H over to that cell select the drop-
down menu and inside that you can select
the option so we will try to work
something like that if we have selected
the entire
column
selection yeah let us select the entire
column again go to data validation the
selection contains some sales without
data validation settings do you want to
extend data validation to the sales
yes now let us provide the list option
[Music]
and here Source you can provide
as
developer and
tester press okay
okay now input message select
one select
one error
alert invalid
data select from drop
down
only press okay now when you select the
cell you can see small drop- down icon
right so when you press it you will have
developer and tester option so you can
select developer for first one and for
second one you can select uh tester
right okay this is good for uh one or
two options maybe three or even maybe
like five but what if you have more
departments okay let's go to this uh
second sheet where we have the
department data so here we have like 14
departments no 15 departments or 15
employee type names so the first one is
CEO second developer tester quality
analyst system analyst Finance human
resource so so many options are there so
you cannot keep on typing all of them
right so here it is 15 what if you have
like 25 like 50 departments right it
will be tough so for this you have
another option so let me select all this
data and copy this from this sheet to
our employee
sheet let us paste it
somewhere here let's expand
this okay now we have our uh list over
here now let us remove the data
validation from this
column clear all okay now everything is
cleared let's select okay now let us
erase this data as
well now let us apply the list data
validation again from scratch go to
list now here we can select the
source select this particular cell
and drag it until here and it has been
loaded now go to input
message data
options select one from the menu or the
dropdown copy error alert
[Music]
select only from the drop down
menu invalid entry yeah now let's select
okay fine now you have the icon here you
have all the provided
options you can scroll down and select
any one out of these you can select
knowledge transfer for the first one and
second one would be system analist
and the last one would
be human
resources now in the list everything is
fine okay this is showing you the menu
options and everything so but what if
you provide this sheet to your new joiny
or new employee in your company and by
mistake he messes up something like
deleting this okay so we have deleted
systems analyst and when you click on
the options here you don't have systems
analyist in that place you have blank
space right so so there is a way where
all your uh you know data can be messed
up so to avoid this what you can do is
you can actually um save this data in a
different sheet like I did here like
Department data you can hide this sheet
or you can protect this sheet with
password or something so that nobody can
mess this up so now let us get back to
the employee data and select this column
and uh clear everything press okay
and let us also clear
this and this as well this one too now
let us eliminate the rows or
cells the employee yeah
everything okay now we have basically
removed this data from here now let us
try to apply the data validation once
again
now here let us select as
list and
uh here let us provide the option let us
go to next sheet let us select all these
options and press okay okay let's
provide input
message data options
our department options
yeah now let's select
okay now let's hide this sheet now the
sheet has been hidden and you still have
the
options
developer or let us provide
CEO then we have
developer then we
have
test so that's how you can protect your
how to protect and lock cells in Excel
now why do we need to lock or protect
cells in Excel let us imagine that there
is an Excel sheet with really
confidential data and you need to pass
that data to your subordinate or your
colleague to make some minor edits now
let us imagine that the edits are
supposed to be done to only one or two
columns and rest of the columns should
be left as they are now there is a huge
possibility that sometimes unknowingly
or unwillingly there might be some edits
done by your colleague or your
subordinate So to avoid such kind of
unexpected mistakes you might want to
protect and lock your Sal that you don't
want your subordinate or your colleague
to edit so before we begin be kind
enough to get subscribed to our YouTube
channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to stay updated on the latest
it Trends and Tech
content now without further Ado let's
get started with our onepoint agenda
that is lock or protect sales in Excel
now now let's get back into the
Practical mode and start our Microsoft
Excel now we are on the Microsoft Excel
and this particular spread sheet is
related to employee
details yeah now the screen is visible a
bit better now let us imagine that this
is our confidential data and you want to
edit only two columns that is the
designation column and phone number
colum now let us imagine that the
company has finished one annual year and
now there are some promotions happening
in the company and let us also imagine
that the phone numbers of the employees
provided by the company have undergone
some changes so now the minor edits that
you want to make are related to the
designation column and phone number
column now you can see that all the
columns that is the blood group new
salary salary hike current salary and
name of the employee serial number
employ number everything is editable so
in such kind of scenarios when you pass
on the state
there might be a possibility where your
colleague or subordinate might end up
making some mistakes right so you want
to avoid that so you can do that by
locking the cells now let us rename this
sheet now the sheet has been renamed
successfully so now you can log the CES
by the following
process so in this process you have two
major steps first one is to log the
sales and the next one is to protect the
cells by a password now when you select
all the cells in this particular sheet
you can just click on this edge here and
you have all the cells selected and now
right click somewhere on the sheet and
you can see an option called format
cells so in this particular option you
have some options provided which is
number alignment font and you want to go
into the protection part so you can see
by default Excel keeps all the cells
locked now we want the phone number and
designation to be unlocked okay so let's
cancel it for now and get back to the
sheet and select the columns D and I and
now let's right click and go into format
cells and in the protection option make
sure that you uncheck the logged icon
now select okay and
now okay so you cannot include the merge
cell fine we have cell here which is
merged okay let's remove
that okay now again select the entire
column right click get into format cells
and uncheck the lock option select
okay now we have finished the first part
that is locking all the cells which you
don't want to get edit and unlocking the
cells where you want to make some edits
now the second stage is protecting the
sheet now right click on the sheet name
and you can see an option called protect
sheet click that and now here you can
see select locked CES and also select
unlocked CES so let us provide a
password here so let us use some simple
password so that we don't forget that so
I'll be selecting 1 2 3 and now select
okay reenter the password to proceed now
let us type 1 2 3 again now select okay
and now the sheet is
protected now we have successfully
locked and protected all the cells in
Excel now let us verify that the cells
you wanted to protect are really
protected and locked or not so we have
unlocked phone number and designation
and everything else is locked now let me
try and edit the blood group so when I
double click or try to edit this
particular sheet then I'll be receiving
a warning from cell it says the cell or
chart you're trying to change is on a
protected sheet to make a change
unprotect the sheet you might be
requested to enter a
password so it says that this particular
cell is locked and you cannot edit it
now let us try to edit the phone numbers
which we kept as unlocked so you can see
I can really edit the unlocked cell here
now let me try to change this phone
number let me enter some random phone
number
so you can see the cell is editable now
let us go through the designation column
and try to edit this particular column
now since I said that there's a
promotion happening in the company so
the deputy CEO is now the current CEO of
the company and software developer
happens to become the senior software
developer and the tester as well let us
imagine that he will become the senior
and so on okay so this proves that this
particular sheet is editable not the
entire sheet but only the s that we kept
in the unlock
mode
okay now this is how you lock and
protect your sales in X now you can see
that I have sales d data on my worksheet
so uh let us imagine that your manager
asked you to find the average of sales
happening in your company right so let's
navigate to the bottommost cell and you
know write it down as average
here okay average
sales so here this is a cell where you
want to keep your average right so here
we'll be writing a small formula that is
average and tab to select it now you
must select the array of data
right so this is my array since average
is an array function and now press enter
so there you go you have the average
sales data that happened in your
company so to understand the page setup
in msxl we will go through a demo
inventory in Excel where we'll be
considering some restaurant data now
without any delay let's get started with
the Practical demo now we are on the
Excel sheet and this is the data I was
talking about the restaurant data where
we have the First Column that is Rank
and next we have the restaurant name
followed by that we have the sales
happening through that restaurant and
then we have the segment category that
is what kind of service does that
particular restaurant offers now this is
the list what we made and uh what if we
wanted to represent this data in the
form of a printed paper right so I guess
you can see all the columns and rows
here so you can see that we have almost
like 250 rows so there is no chance or
there is no way to print all those 250
rows in one page of course it is
practically possible but when you try to
read the content it'll be so tough to
read Because all the rows will be clued
together so closely so that you cannot
read it so uh you need to print them
Page by page so and you need to also
take care of the data is aligned
properly according to the page size
everything and even you need to take
care of the margins of your page right
so that's what P set up basically means
so we had a detailed overview of our
data and what actually we're trying to
make now let us see how page setup is
possible in msxl so to go to the page
setup menu or go to the page setup
options we have three methods let's
start with the simplest method so the
simp simplest method is by just clicking
on file and go to print
option and you'll see all the page setup
options right over here and you can also
go to print menu by pressing a shortcut
method that is control P so you'll
directly end up on the page setup
options now let's look at the second
method so the second method is you can
see the toolbar over here right which
has file home insert
draw page layout formulas data review
View and help so the second method we
can use page layout option from the
toolbar and you can see when you click
on the page option from the toolbar you
have a new ribbon over here so this
ribbon is all about page setup options
so it will offer you margins it will
offer you orientation size print area
brakes background print tiles etc etc
right so all these options or menus in
this ribbon belong to page setup now let
us look at the third method so the third
method is something similar you have
view option on the toolbar so just
select View and you can see we have few
page setup options over here as well the
normal page break page layout custom
views and we have grid lines formula bar
heading zoom in zoom out out select to
zoom free certain panes right so all
these are also the page setup options so
we have the three methods to enter the
page setup options now we are familiar
with those now let's get started with
the Practical mode on page setup for
that let me use the simplest method that
is holding the control key and pressing
P which navigates me to the print
option now we have various set of
options here we have no scale normal
margins letter portrait orientation
cated print active sheets and note one
for Windows you can see this option is
the printer's option for example if
you're connected to a printer which is
the hardware printer then your msxl will
show the printer's name here so other
than printer you can also make some
other arrangements where you can just
directly print your complete data in the
form of PDF and then you can export your
PDF to your recipent that's also
possible okay now let's get started with
the first option that is print active
pages okay to understand this better we
need to create a new sheet not a problem
so you can see that we just have one
sheet over
here so let us kind of select all the
items and create a new sheet and try to
paste it away here or let's try to paste
it over
here okay
now let's try to extend
this yeah this should be fine now let's
rename this sheet sheet uh or let's
rename it as
Resturant sheet
2 for our reference now let us get back
to the print sheet option so I'll use
the shortest method that is holding the
control key and press P now you can see
that here we have six pages in total
from the active sheets so the current
active sheet is the top 250 sheet so
this particular sheet is the current
active sheet so if we print the entire
data in this particular sheet then we
will end up printing six pages now let
us select the other option where you
have to print the entire
workbook right so now you can see that
there's a change in the number that is
12 pages so what is a workbook so
basically workbook is the collection of
entire sheets in your Excel homepage so
in this particular Excel homepage you
have the first sheet that is top 250 and
the second sheet that is the resturant
sheet to right so the combination of
these two sheets make up a
workbook so when you select the entire
workbook option you'll have 12 pages so
that's how we use this setting where you
select the active sheets the entire
workbook and there is another option
where you can only print a selected item
so if you want to do this then let's get
back here now what if your customer or
what if your client wanted the top 10
restaurants only so you can select the
top 10
restaurants by doing
this now you have the top and
restaurants let's go to
print so you can see Excel has
automatically selected the selection
only print the selected content only so
you can see we have only the top 10
restaurants or top 11 restaurants that
we have selected in our sheet and it is
ready to get printed so this is how we
use the first option now let's get back
let's not select that and let's make the
pages normal now get back to the print
option again now you can see the next
option that is
collated right so in collated you have
different different options that is 1 2
3 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 and the next one which
is uncollated 1 1 1 2 22 3 3 3 so why
are these numbers present here and what
does collected mean anyway so this is
your question right now the answer for
this question will be a little little
similar to your examination Hall okay
let us imagine that you are an
examination Hall and you are the
invigilator and you have 10 students in
your room so you wanted to provide
question papers to all the 10 students
okay so you have your question paper
distributed into three sheets that is
you have marked questions and your
questions are fit into three papers
right in this scenario we have 250 rows
and all the data is split into six
sheets that is sheet one or page one
page two page three page four right now
if we wanted to print 10 copies then the
arrangement of papers will be page one
page two page three page 4 page five
page six in continuous order right that
is CED if you wanted 10 copies of
different different ways where you
wanted to print the first sheet first
then you wanted to print the second
sheet second and the third sheet third
that is you'll have 10 copies of first
page 10 copies of second page 10 copies
of third page and so on that particular
approach is called uncollated approach
and if you're printing the pages in
continuous order for 10 times then that
particular approach is called as
collated approach so this is what we had
to learn about collated and unol now
let's get back to the third option now
let's press again print now we have our
data
here there's something
wrong select all the elements control P
yeah now we have our data back now we
have the third option that is the
portrait
orientation okay so when we click that
we have two options that is portrait and
landscape so you might be having a good
idea like when you try to click a
picture in your phone we have two modes
as well that is portray mode mode and
the landscape mode so when you click on
the portrait mode this is how your data
will be looking now to understand the
difference let's click the landscape
mode so when you click the landscape
mode this is how your data
representation will change you'll have a
wider page to print so this is why we
use the page orientation for now let's
keep the page orientation as portrait
orientation and we have now the fourth
option so what is the fourth option we
have various sets of options in here
that is letter and A4 size there are
also some more page options over here
where you can select the page types you
want to
print so basically you'll be having few
more options that is A4 A5 A3 Etc but
here we just have two that is A4 and
letter so basically you'll get those
options and followed by that next we
have margins so here you can see we
don't have any margins for our data okay
so now we can add some margins by
setting up this one as an option like
last custom setting or you can also
choose normal wide narrow right so your
page will be changed according to your
margin
size right so this is how you can change
the margins now let's keep it as def
default let's set the normal
one now we have the next option that is
scaling
option so here you can see we are trying
to fit the page so when you're trying to
print these sheets using no scaling then
the actual size of the page will be
printed now you can also modify that you
can fit and print these sizes so you can
remember the first option that I said of
printing all the 250 rows in one single
sheet this is how you can fit it so fit
the sheet on one page where you can see
all the 250 rows are fit into one page
but the data is not readable so but we
don't want this type of an approach
right so let's keep it as the default
one which is no scaling so these are the
variety of options in print now if you
wanted to print the all the six pages
into the PDF format and mail to your
client you can also do that I think I
have explained it in the first place so
you can see we can do it by just
selecting this option where you can
print all the six pages and into PDF
format and then you can mail them to
your
client and you can also select the
number of copies you want you can
increase the copies to two three and any
number of uh copies you want for now
I'll keep it as one copy
[Music]
now let's print
this now let us select
the
location rename it and
publish now let's get back to documents
and see if the page is printed or
not here you go here we have the
resturant data in the form of
PDF so we have our entire six pages of
data in the PDF
format now we are back on the homepage
now we had some limited functions in the
print function over here we had tried to
export the data so you can also export
the data or try to print it from the
print option over here you can just
select that as well
you
PDF yes the pages are printed
now there you go we have the restaurant
2 PDF
[Music]
data so that's how you can print all
your data you can either
choose the export option or you can
either choose print option now when you
see into the print option we have
limited number of page setup options
over here now let's check out what we
missed so we are in the page layout here
so we had gone through the margins we
had set all the margins and then we have
also gone through the portrait and
landscape now you can see this size when
we were in the print menu option we had
only A4 and letter but here you can see
there are a wide variety of options that
is other than letter we have tabloid
legal statement executive
A3 right we have A5 and many more other
options and if you want some more paper
options you can go to more and you can
always select few more options that's
how you do it and yeah we didn't had the
break option so remember when we had
been through the print option we did not
have the break option there let's select
this to nor A4 so you cannot see the
break option over here here right so
here we have the break option so what
does break option does right you can
actually break the page uh remember we
spoke about the top 10 things or the top
10 rowes you can always do that so you
can just keep the top 10 restaurants in
your first page and then break the
remaining and to set page breaks you can
select the cell now I need the top 10 so
I'll select this particular cell which
is in the 11th
position and now I'll try to implement
the page break insert a page break and
now you can see on my sheet there is a
thin line which is separating the two
pages that's how you can see the
indication of app page break implemented
onto your page now how do you see it you
can see it by selecting contrl P where
you can see the first top 10 restaurants
being printed on your sheet so there you
go we have the first top 10 restaurants
printed on our sheets so that's how you
use the page
break now let's try to eliminate all the
past brakes so you can select braks and
reset all page breaks so the page break
has been
eliminated now you can always choose a
background for your data as well you
just uh if you want you can add a
picture to your background I think
that's not available for
now okay you can work offline as well
let us select this
one so you can see that we have added a
background to our
data we can select all the text files
and then you can change the color so
that the text becomes a little visible
yeah that's how you do it now if you
don't want the image to be added on your
file you can also remove that delete
page background and there you go all the
images are gone now the next important
part that is the print
titles now why do we need print titles
for that let's try to print this so now
you can see the first page in the first
page we we have the title rank
restaurant sales segment category but if
you go to the second page you don't have
that title right you don't have the
title rank name of the restaurant sales
and their service category so if we want
that then we need to add titles now for
that let's select the print titles
option now let's select the rowes to
repeat on top now for that we need the
first row select the first row and this
particular row will be repeating into
all the pages now let's try to print it
so yeah now you can see the titles are
being added to all the sheets you can
see the page two page three page four
page five and page six so you can see
the titles added to all the sheets now
we are on the spreadsheet so here what
exactly are page breaks so page breaks
are something which help you during your
trying to print your data or or present
your data in the form of a web page
right in those times you cannot fit your
entire Excel data in one spreadsheet or
one paper or one web page right so in
those scenarios Excel will try to
eliminate a few parts of your
spreadsheet or it will try to split the
spreadsheet so how exactly it looks like
so go to the view option and click on
The View and click on page break preview
here you can see the dotted lines right
so these are the things which separate
your data in form of pages so that it
can be printable on one single page so
some of the times the user or the xuser
manually inserts a page break right so
how do you insert it just go to the page
layout and here you can see the page
breaks insert a page break and you have
successfully inserted a page break again
go to the view go to page break View and
here you can see the solid line so these
solid ones are the ones which are
inserted by the users or anyone who I
had the access to the data now how do we
eliminate them right so we can eliminate
them and we can try to you know get the
shade back to the normal way so all you
have to do is click on the cell which
has the page break which is right under
the page break go to the insert page
break yeah page layout menu go to the
brakes option click on remove page break
and there you go you have successfully
eliminated the page break and page break
preview to make sure that the page break
has been successfully removed so you
cannot see that anymore so that's how
you try to insert or eliminate a page
break in Excel so conditional formatting
is a method to visualize your worksheet
we already have the charts in Excel to
visualize our Excel sheets in graphical
form but what if you had to see or
visualize the data in your worksheet as
it is so that is where the conditional
formatting comes handy now let's get
back to the Microsoft Excel and try to
implement some conditional formatting
now we are on the Excel worksheet this
particular data set is based on a store
now we have various columns in this
particular data set we have row ID order
ID customer name Etc and finally we have
quantity discount and profits now let's
go to profits uh let us imagine that we
have provided this particular store with
a target of minimum 15% profits now let
us find out the stores that have hit the
15% Target and the ones which did not so
for that let us select the entire column
now you can find the conditional
formatting option in the home tool bar
and in that ribbon the ribbon with
Styles has the conditional formatting
option click on that and you have
various options over here highlighting
the cells top bottom rules data bars
data scales and icons so datab bar are
actually the bar graphs which highlight
them El on each and every cell if you
implement them and these are the color
scales if you want to implement some
colors you can go through that and if
you want to represent your sales with
icons you can also do that for now let's
highlight the CES so select that and
inside this select the greater than
option and here you can provide the
percentage that is
15% and the cells or the stores which
hit the target should be highlighted
with green color and select open okay
and there you go you have your stores
that hit the 15% Target and the ones
which did not hit the 15% Target now if
you want to highlight the ones which did
not hit the 15% Target you can highlight
them with the color
red
so conditional formatting highlight the
Cs less than
15% with color red and text dark and
there you go it's done now let's let us
consider another example so this
particular example is based on train
data set and here we have the passenger
ID survived passenger class name Etc now
we have a train accident incident over
here now one is indicated that they are
alive and zero is indicated that they
are not alive now let us use this column
and conditional formatting highlight the
cells containing the text as one with
color green
okay
and highlight the
cells that contain text zero as red that
indicates they are not
alive and let us select the
icons now we have the icons over here
the X indicates that they're not alive
and the Green Tech Mark indicates that
they're alive now that is how you use
conditional formatting in Excel Excel
now here on my spreadsheet you can see
some data so this particular data has
some color markings so we have used
color codes to Mark the designations of
all the employees with different colors
so for example blue for manager purple
for senior and so on right now our duty
is to count the total number of
employees present in a company based on
the color code this can be done using
filters but let's try with color tools
now we don't have a readily available
function in Excel to count based on the
colors but we can make use of macro now
to make use of macro you might want to
enable the developer options so by
default these will be disabled in Excel
to enable them right click on the
toolbar and you can see this particular
option click on the customize ribbon
option and you will be provided with
various set of options now on the right
side you can see develop options so make
sure the checkbox is clicked to enable
developer options and press on okay to
completely enable developer window right
now when you click on developer options
you can see various options here visual
Basics macro Etc now click on the macro
to create a macro now just give a name
to the macro function so I'll give
simply
long and press on create to create that
particular macro function so we have
already created a macro that is Count
colored cells which we will be using in
our current spreadsheet for counting the
colored cells now let us erase the newly
created function now getting back to the
original code so how does this
particular count colored cells works so
let us understand the function first
then we will try to make use of it in
the spreadsheet so the function name is
Count colored cells as you can see and
this particular function will have two
parameters current cell and spreadsheet
area so the current cell will be the
cell address where the color you want to
count is present and then the
spreadsheet area so what is the range of
cells where you want to locate that
particular color and count the number of
reputations that is the spreadsheet area
and then comes the variables used color
cell range color code and color cell
count so the colored cell which
particular cell is having that
particular color and what color code is
involved in that colored cell and
colored cell count so what is the total
count what is the total number of
colored cells you have in that
particular range that is colored cell
count now let us consider color code is
equals to current cell interior color
that is current cell do interior do
color so this is the function which will
identify the interior color of a
selected cell let us imagine that
initially color code is equals to the
current cells color code okay now we
will have the for Loop and that for Loop
will include colored cell which is the
current cell in the spreadsheet area and
if the colored cell the currently
selected colored cell do interior do
color is equals to the color code that
we have selected then colored cell count
the variable which is used to count the
number of colored cells is equals to +
one initially by default it will be zero
in case if this particular if condition
is true that is the current cell color
and the color code given is equals to
same then the value of colored cell will
increase by one and this particular if
Loop will run as many number of times
the condition is true so let us imagine
that the condition will remain true for
five times then we have obtained five
similarly colored cells in the given
range of cells in a spreadsheet and once
the condition fails then the latest
value present in color cell count
variable will be displayed which will be
a final result so this is how how the
macro function works now let's close the
macro window and get back to our
spreadsheet now let us try to make use
of the macro function that we just
created so that is equals to count
colored cells press tab to select the
macro function and the first one is the
current cell so this is the current cell
where the current color is being
provided comma the cell range so our
cell range will be from C2 to
c31 right so this is the range where we
want to count the similarly colored
cells that is sky blue colored cells
close the function and press enter now
you can see the function has identified
six repetition of sky blue color in this
particular range of cells now you can
drag the same formula across all the
cells and it will be providing the
results of the same so six senior colors
that is pink or purple color then two
reputations of this particular color two
reputations of trainy color five for
dark blue and six for green right so
this is how the macro function works and
the key point to remember here is this
particular macro will work only for
manually colored cells so there are
situations where we have used
conditional formatting to color a single
cell let us imagine that we have used
conditional formatting to recognize the
employees with salary above 30,000 as
green color and if we try to use that
particular green color to be counted by
the color count sales fun function no it
will not happen it will not consider
that color as a feedback or an input now
in future we will also try to design a
macro which can recognize the colors
made by conditional formatting as well
but this particular function will be
exclusively used for manually colored
CES only dated IF function is majorly
used to find the differences between two
individual dates so it is also called as
dated if by a few people and a few
people also reference it to date diff
that is date difference so anything is
good now to find the difference between
any two dates let's select a few dates
so the first date would be uh let us
imagine that you're an employee and you
wanted to find out how many years that
you've been working with an organization
so for that you might want to need today
and the date where you join the company
right so it might be date of joining and
today so what's the difference right so
let us imagine that you joined the
organization somewhere around
2010
01
05
2010 and today so for today can you can
give any particular
date let us imagine that uh today is 1st
of January 2021 or 2022
now we have up both the dates that is
the joining date and the current date
which can be the current date so the day
can be anything so you might be watching
this on a different date as well so the
date of that day for today would be a
little different so we'll imagine the
today's date as an imaginary date now we
might want to find the difference that
is in terms of ear so you wanted to find
the difference in terms of ears so here
you can find the difference in terms of
years days and months as well so
currently let's try to find out the
difference in terms of years so for
years you might want to specify the
third parameter in the data function as
why if you wanted months you have to
give the M as the third parameter and if
you want to find the DAT you might want
to give d as the third parameter uh so
we have discussed the third parameter so
what are the first two parameters right
so the first two parameters are the
first date and the last date so the
first date in this situation is your
date of joining and the last date or the
final date which you want here is your
today so let's find the difference so
for that equals to so it can be dated if
or date
diff to date if and the first date which
is the A2 and comma the last state that
is P2 and your parameter third parameter
in terms of ears that is is Y close the
bracket and press enter so there you go
you have your date here so it's been
like 11 years that you're working with
your organization so that's how you find
out the differences so we have 11 years
because uh we did not finish the 12th
year completely so if we had given the
month as U maybe six where we have
finished our total years then it will
automatically change to 12 years
so now for this particular task we will
be considering the student database now
let's get into practical mode and start
our Excel so on my screen you can see
some data related to students now let us
try to duplicate some of the rows
here so we have selected the rows 8 9 10
and 11 now we shall copy them and paste
them so now these are the duplicate
elements right now there might be
possibilities about the duplication of
class because all the students all the
10 students are in same class so there
might be a duplication but we are not
looking for such kind of duplications
right we are looking for the duplication
of the entire row for example we have
the details of mic over here in the
eighth row which has the role number or
serial number as seven name as mic role
number class blood group and subject
scores percentage round of percentage
and total marks so the entire eighth row
has been copied here and it is in the
row number 12 we have the exact same
details so what if you have the exact
same rows duplicated so that's what
we're going to deal with we're going to
eliminate the duplicate rows all
completely together now to carry over
this task we have to select the data
from toolbar so you have various options
file home insert Etc so you need to
select the data and inside data toolbar
we have the ribbon and inside ribbon you
have got the duplicate values or remove
duplicates uh option in the ribbon so
select all the data select remove
duplicates and now you can see that we
have all our uh column names over here
and make sure that you have selected my
data has headers and then select okay
and now you can see that Excel has
automatically removed four duplicate
values so four duplicate values are
found and removed 10 unique values
remain now another type of uh remove
duplicates can also be done so you can
see that here we have another data set
which has phone numbers or phone names
that is phone makers that is Samsung
Huawei weo Oppo Etc so there are some
duplicate values in this I've copy
pasted them so now you can also do that
so just select all the
data and now go into home and select
conditional formatting and here select
highlight cell rules and inside that you
have duplicate values selecting this
option will help you identify the
duplicate values in your data set but
not to remove them so you can select
that and you can see the duplicate
values are highlighted over here in the
red color now again you can get back to
data and select the option of remove
duplicates and select okay and the
duplicate values will be automatically
eliminated so that's how you delete or
eliminate duplicate values in uh data
set and you can also see that we have
another duplicate in this particular row
and if you wanted to select a particular
row and eliminate the duplicates you can
also do that now for that you need to go
to the same process remove duplicates
and here Microsoft Excel is asking you
if you had to expand the selection to
the entire data set or you want to
continue with the selected data set
itself or selected column itself so for
that you need to select the continue
with the current selection and remove
duplicates and press okay and you can
see one duplicate value was found and it
has been removed and six unique values
remain so that's how you use the
function of removing duplicates in Excel
so what is sum in Excel now you might
want to calculate uh the total sum of
sales right so let us assume that this
is your entire stores sales data and you
wanted to calculate the entire sum of
sales so there is a su function in Excel
where you just have to you know select
all the cells and apply some function
onto it and you'll get the sum of all
the sales right so with something like
this you'll select all the sales and
then you'll apply a sums function and
you'll get the sum here and average
everything right so this is fine but
what if you just wanted to find the
sales that are happening in only western
region as you can see our column f is
based on region so we have four regions
Southwest East and Central so your
manager asks you to find the sales
happening in suppose say west region so
how do you calculate it would you
manually go into each cell and check if
it's West and calculated that will be
time consuming right so what if you had
a method which could do it for you just
in a matter of few steps or few clicks
right so that's exactly sums so it will
basically add a condition calculate the
sum of sales where the region is equals
to West simple to like or similar to
seal query right so that is exactly what
we're going to do in Excel today that is
using Summits now let me add here Sales
of West Region now in the next cell
let's add uh sumus function remember
there are multiple sum functions in
Excel so when you type in suum you can
see so many options based on sum right
you just have sum followed by that you
have some if it is just some if not some
ifs today we are concentrating on some
if ifs so not just some if we'll go to
some ifs so we'll be having an option of
placing multiple if conditions there so
let's also try that more on that later
now let's press tab to select our sum
ifs function now okay we forgot another
important step so before we apply sufs
we need to convert our table into a
table format yes it looks table but
right now it's not in tabular format it
is in the format of database we know
that Microsoft Excel consider
its data as a database by default so to
convert the database into table just
click anywhere on the data and press
contrl T so that you'll have a new
dialogue box and it will ask if your
table has headers just make sure that
you have ticked in it our table does
have headers so select okay now our
database has been converted into a
perfect table and it's ready for
applying sus function so now you can see
our database has been successfully
converted into a table now let's begin
with some ifs now again remember we are
using some ifs here not some if or some
so select some ifs and press T and we
have our sus function now the first step
which column are we looking at what are
we finding out right which is a sum
range what sum do you want for now we
need sum of sales so select the sales
column and we have a simple key function
here let's hold control again press
shift and hold shift together so we're
holding control and shift key together
and now we're pressing lower Arrow key
once yes the entire sales column has
been selected comma Now where do you
want to look so we want to look I mean
which part of the table you want to
fetch right so this is the region part
we want to fetch right now so again hold
control and shift together lower Arrow
key the entire column is selected now
the next last part so we want to look
into the both of the columns that is
sales column and region column now which
typee of data you want so for now we
want Western type of data that is the
sales data which is happening only in
West right so we'll select this cell
with the data as West or you can also
manually enter it for now let's select
the data so I'm selecting the cell F7
which has uh data as West right now
let's close the parenthesis and press
enter so there you go you have the sales
happening in the western region now you
can also try to format it in the form of
currency so let's use uh dollars since
it is based on American states so let's
use dollars so there you go now we are
having the sales data of West now let's
try to copy the same to all the for Cs
and uh now here let's type in
East and this can be South right and
this can be your
central there
go right now you can also copy the same
formula and make minor edits to it so
here instead of f8 you can select uh
East so where is East here and press
enter so you have the sales related to
East now let's try to edit F9 with South
select South Region enter so you have
South sales and what remaining is
Central so let's edit Central as well
and press enter so there you go right
now you have all the separate sales data
from west east south and Central now
again uh you might want a bit more
granularity in data right or in your
reports right like you wanted to find
the sales data happening in West and you
wanted to find out the category based on
only Furnitures so your manager will ask
you okay if fantastic job so now just
give me another minute detail on the
data I want to calculate the sales
happening on West based on category
Furniture right so he wants furniture or
he wants office supplies only right you
can also do that it's not an issue at
all now let's try to copy the cell and
paste it here and sales invest let's add
another input here on
furniture right now you wanted to
calculate the sales happening in west
region only on furniture so you can also
do that now we can use the same formula
as well just copy paste the formula here
right and you can add few things here
when you try to add a comma it will
automatically generate the next criteria
it is expecting that you are looking for
adding another criteria right now which
column you want you want category so
let's select category you want to select
all the cells same track contr shift
lower key and again press comma and you
wanted to select only uh Furniture so
select on furniture cell there you go
now press enter so there you go we
successfully have the sales data from
west region based on category Only
Furniture so that's how you do suf in XL
you can also add a few more details to
it like in Furniture you can also look
only for tables so here you can see in
west region we have furniture sales data
and we have sales data of West Region
based on furniture which includes only
tables you can also do that using sums
function in the same way all you have to
do is select the subcategory column and
select the cell which has the data as
tables so this is how you use Su of in
Excel now creating a pivot table is just
away from a few clicks trust me it is
just a couple of clicks and you'll have
your pivot table ready to operate now
click any cell or select any cell on
your spreadsheet which has the data and
navigate to insert menu on the toolbar
and select pivot table and that's how
simple it is now automatically Excel
will choose your data you can see the
lines over here dotted lines that means
the Excel has already selected the range
of data that you want to put into your
pivot table and you can either select
the existing worksheet or a new
worksheet I'll select a new worksheet
over here and just press on okay and
there you go you have your pivot table
ready now here you can see your pivot
table is a little empty all you need to
do is drag and drop the data elements
that you want on your pivot table so
here you can see on our spreadsheet we
have some business data related to a
store which has furniture and states and
subcategories of the furniture and all
the you know in in category you have
furniture office supplies technology Etc
right so those have some subcategories
as well and different states and the
regions as well and the quantity total
sales happen right so using this
business data we can find out some key
insights of this particular data using
our pivot table right so here we'll add
the data now let me drag the region into
rows click and drag and let me drag uh
categories into columns which are the
different categories which are involved
in the sales data and values what are
the sales happened right and there you
go you have Furnitures office supplies
technology as the three
different categories and those are the
sales happened in central East South and
West regions and this is the grand total
and instead of regions you know you have
all the regions over here right so
Central East Southwest or instead of uh
all the regions or instead of all the
categories you can you know place a
specific category in your pivot table
for example let me push the category
into the filters and here you can see
the total sales happen in those
particular regions now what if someone
asks you to find the sales of Only
Furniture right so your manager comes to
you and he'll ask you getting the sales
of only Furnitures you can select that
and there you go you have the furniture
sales in all the regions right or you
can also do the vice versa you can also
drag uh regions into the filters and if
you wanted to find out the region wise
sales of furniture you can also do that
right so here we have furniture and here
you have all the regions and let us try
to find the sales of furniture in the
central region and there you go right so
this is how um the priver table works
and you can also remove the regions for
example if you wanted to remove a
certain element from filters or anywhere
if it is columns rows anything you can
just drag and drop it right so that's
how it works and also you can increase
the level of detail or improve the
granularity right so here we have
categories on our uh you know columns so
you can also include subcategories into
the
columns right
and and you have the region wise
sales so in the region filter select
all press okay and in the category
select
all press okay and you have the
furniture here office supplies here and
Technology here and also if you want to
include the quantity how much or how
many number of um you know things got
sold in those particular categories and
subcategories you can also do that so
here in the furniture section books
these are the sales and these are the
number of quantity or elements sold in
in those particular you know sectors so
you can you can also improve the level
of granularity you can also improve the
level of detail using pivot tables
in now AutoFill in Excel is a feature
where you can add some series
automatically using Excel for example
let us imagine that you wanted to add
index numbers right so starting from 1
to 10 so manually you will be typing in
the numbers and you'll be don't it right
so instead of this what if I said you
there was a simple way where Excel will
fill all the data for you right so just
start with one two and select these two
cells and you can see the flash logo
over here right so that's the indication
that Excel has understood your pattern
and it is ready to fill the remaining
numbers so as long as you drag this logo
or that ending part where you have a
small square box that will fill all the
numbers until where you have draged it
so that's how autofill works and you
might be wondering will it work only for
numbers no it will also work on some
Logics as well okay this was the first
part let us also look at some other
tricks with autofill now most of the
time you might be just adding one number
and try to drag that cell and the result
is it'll copy the same number all the
time right so you can change it by
clicking on this menu you can click on
fill series and it will change to series
and this was one more trick with numbers
now getting back to the the next type so
let us imagine now the next type of
series you want to add is weeks in a day
right so you'll be having
Monday Tuesday Wednesday right so you
can also do the series of weekdays using
AutoFill in Excel as well so drag that
cell and it will give you all the days
or week days in a week now let's try
January and this will give you the
months in a
year in the shortcut way right since you
just added the first three letters of
the month it will recognize the pattern
and it will do the same for you now let
us try the full names of
months right and now let's try to drag
it it'll fill all the full names of all
the
months now let's try the dates so let us
imagine that this is the first day of
the current
year right it will now give you all the
dates of that current month or until the
end of the year as
well there you
go now let us imagine that your manager
tells you to add the dates of working
days in the month of January so how can
you do that it's simple all you need to
do is select the cell go to the fill
option select series and here select
column wise since you want the dates and
columns and here in the type select date
date unit should be weekday and the stop
value should be the next month right
since your manager asked for the week
days of January so your stop value will
be the 1st of February press okay and
there you go so since the 1st of January
is Friday it's selected over here and
the rest two Saturday and Sunday are
eliminated similarly we have all the
dates here of working days only so
that's how you use AutoFill in Exel so
on on my screen you can see a simple
spreadsheet with student names and their
marks on my sheet so we will be
calculating what are the total marks
obtained by the students in overall
subjects and calculate what is the
percentage now we will carry forward a
few simple inbuilt functions in Excel to
calculate that first we will be
calculating the sum of marks so here
equals to sum
function and select the range of cells
close the bracket press enter so you
have the sum
now so we have to calculated repeat so
by clicking on the same formula now we
have the total of all the subjects for
individual students and now let's
calculate percentage so usually we use
the you know divide by option that is
divide the total number of marks
obtained by the total number of marks
available that is we will be dividing
adding 47 by 500 and then we will be
multiplying that into 100 so that's how
we calculate the percentage
so cell G2 divided by cell H2 press
enter and you will end up with you know
uh the decimal format that's perfectly
all right now we have also extended the
same formula for all our cells now
select this overall column or select the
highlighted cells right and get into the
data type here you have General so
that's why we have got that uh decimal
format but when you press percentage
you'll have the actual percentage of all
the students according to their marks
achieved now we are on our Excel
spreadsheet and this spreadsheet has
some values of employees that is their
employee ID name designation Department
salary date of birth and date of joining
now our concern is to highlight some
some cells which are duplicate in this
or some rows which are duplicate so for
example here you can see on row number
seven we have the details of Mara and
you can see the same details of Mara in
the row number 14 as well right so you
need to eliminate those cells or you
need to eliminate those rows now you can
say there is a quick way just few clicks
and those will be eliminated that is
conditional formatting yes that is also
one way but I'll show you what's the
problem with that okay so let us select
the entire table and get into
conditional formatting and here you have
duplicate values highlight cell rules
where duplicate values and there you go
the problem so here we have designation
which is duplicated in certain ways
department and salary state of joining
right so there are certain conditions or
scenarios where you cannot directly
identify which is the duplicate row
again you can use the same for this
right so you can select the
entire uh column of employee ID and you
can uh identify the duplicate cells here
since the employee IDs are unique for
everyone so this is a way but let's dig
a little deeper and understand the way
of highlighting duplicates with an
advanced technique so let me cancel this
and for that let's create a new um
column and let's name this as duplicate
flag e
flag so the new column has been created
which is D flag so here we will be using
a simple formula that is Count F and
here press tab to select the formula and
here we will be adding our uh range that
is which range are you considering so
the range will be the employee ID since
employee IDs are unique for every
employee
and and let's press function F4 to fix
it and now uh again the criteria and the
criteria will be the same cell that is
A2 and now close the bracket and press
enter now let's track the same formula
to all the
rows okay now here we have now what you
can do is uh sort it in an advanced way
go to sort and filter and custom sort
and here you'll be sorting by the D flag
and it will be smallest to largest
so now uh you can apply the conditional
formatting to highlight it you can
select the column H or the D flag go to
conditional formatting highlight cell
rules and here you can get into greater
than and give the value as one okay so
all the cells which are you know
repeated multiple times will be selected
here and they will be highlighted with a
selected color what you have given so
I've given Red so now you can select
these cells and highlight them or delete
them from your
spreadsheet and now all your data in the
spreadsheet is unique and clean now
let's quickly get onto the Practical
mode where we will have some data sets
over which we will be trying to apply
the charts now there are various types
of charts in table and those are the pie
chart the column chart the bar chart
column versus line pav chart and Spark
line charts so so we will discuss one
after the other first let us discuss
about the pie chart so as you can see we
have a small data set on my screen which
I have personally created and uh this
deals with the companies and this deals
with the shares of the automobile
industry so now for this let's create a
pie
chart select all the data and then get
into the toolbar and inside the toolbar
you can see various options and inside
that we're going to use the insert
option and when you select the insert
option you will have a ribbon here and
inside the ribbon you can see groups
tables illustrations addin and here you
go these are the charts so now we needed
a pie chart so select on that icon and
you have various types of pie charts you
have two dimensional pie charts three
dimensional pie charts donut type of
charts Etc right so I would like to go
with the threedimensional pie chart as
it looks a little more appealing and
easy to understand and now there you go
this is the title of the chart and these
are the legends of the chart and this is
the chart area and these are the values
now we can uh you know kind of add the
data labels as well so you can just have
to press the plus icon over here and
you'll have the options you can add the
data labels which will give you a lot
more interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this will be uh a great
way of presenting your data to your
clients
right yeah and there is another option
where you can directly explode this like
you can pick it out you can see this
right Point explosion where you can
split it out and you can show that
especially like you can highlight it and
show it so that's the you know a great
way of presenting your data so that's
how you can work with pie charts in
Excel now let's quickly move to the next
one that is the the column chart and in
the column chart we have the data
related to some company and uh the
profits of that company based on a year
so you can see that the year has started
from 2008 and it has gone until
2021 and these are the profits of that
company year after year so since we are
dealing with column chart I'll tell you
the simplest way to create a column chat
there is a shortcut key for that which
is alt f one and there you go you have
the chart right on your
screen now you can uh expand the chart
just by dragging it like that and you
can see that there is some problem with
this chart that is we have numbers here
instead of es right you can see that the
First Column is the es which is 2008 to
2021 but here you can see we have 1 2 3
4 which is not proper right so to change
the axis that is you can see the axis
which is 1 2 3 let me expand my screen a
little bit
Yeah so if you look at my screen we have
two different columns one column is
about the ear and the second column is
about the revenue now what we want to do
is we want to create a line graph where
we have ER on the x-axis and revenue on
the y- axis and we will be generating a
line graph based on the data we have now
for that we have to select the entire
data what we have then we need to go
into the insert option in the toolbar
and then you can see a lot of chart
options in the insert ribbon now here
you can see that we have a line chart or
area chart option select that and here
you can see 2D line graphs now let's
select the first one and there you go
you have the line chart here now let's
rename the
title and there is one problem with the
chart here you can see that the x-axis
is not actually pointing the ear you can
make a change to that no
worries just right click and then you
can see the select data option and there
you go you have the edit option here
just edit it and now select the
range I am selecting the ears now let's
select okay and there you go you have
the ears here you can just try to expand
it a little
more
yeah so now you have the revenue on the
Y AIS and ear on the x-axis and this
shows the growth of Revenue in your your
company so this is how you create a l
graph in Excel
playar now let us imagine that you are
the CEO of an IT company and you have
taken up multiple projects let us
imagine that you wish to keep track of
all the projects so what if there was a
tool which could keep track of all the
projects in the form of a detailed
visualization with the percentage in the
form of a graph or a bar chart
interesting right that's exactly what we
going to design today using Microsoft
Excel so without further Ado let's get
started with our onepoint agenda that is
progress tracker in Excel now to design
a progress tracker in Excel let us get
back to the Practical mode where we
might have to use our Microsoft
Excel now we are on the Microsoft Excel
and we have taken some sample data to
make things look simple so here we're
considering a set of students and their
attendance percentage so we will be
using this particular data and design a
progress
tracker now let us try to increase the
size of the
celles now select all the cells in the
attendance
column now we have selected all the
cells in the attendance column and in
the toolbar select the Home tab and
inside the Home tab you have styles
group inside the Styles group select
conditional formatting and inside the
conditional formatting option select new
rule so in the new rule we want to
select the first option that is format
all cells based on the
values now here you can see format style
since we trying to create a databas we
need to select the option of databas
here
and under the data bar options we have
some more options on the drop- down
menu so here in the type select
number and the minimum number is zero it
is automatically stored here and the
maximum value is again a number and let
us provide it as one now here you can
select the color for your pass now since
we have already chosen green for all the
column headers let's choose
blue
and select okay now here you can see
that the values are been indicated using
bar graphs right and you can also see
the percentage values but we can make it
look a little more better by shifting
them to the left side and text could be
given as white so that it's more uh
vibrant to look at and now we can also
apply some conditional formatting onto
these attendance columns so let us try
to highlight the students having
attendance less than
65% so highlight cell heru less than
65% attendance
with red color select okay and there you
go you have the progress tracker right
on your screen and using the same
principles you can track the attendance
for all the students and also you can
apply some conditional formatting onto
all your cells and highlight the ones
which are not on the track now this is
how you can Implement progress trackers
using Excel
now for this particular example we going
to use the employees
data now let's quickly get back to the
Practical mode and enter into
Excel now you can see that we are on
Excel sheet right now so let me expand
my screen a little
bit so that the data is a little more
visible yeah so here on my screen you
can see that we have employees data so
the First Column is the name of the
employees and the the second column is
the start dates of the employees that
when have they started working with the
organization and when they have ended or
resigned to their position in that
particular organization and the duration
gives us the number of days they have
worked in that particular organization
so to create a Gant chart is really
simple you just have to select the data
and then go to the insert option and in
there you can see the charts icon and
select all charts and in that select the
bar chart and here you can see the
Stacked bar chart select that and press
okay and there you go you have the
Stacked bar chart right on your screen
let's expand this a little more so that
we have the clear visualization of the
dates as well now you can if you want
you can change the title as org data or
employee
data and now we are partially done with
our chart now the next thing we have to
do is Select the bar chart right click
on it select data and here select the
add icon now you need to select the
series name so the series name is
duration for our Gant chart and series
values are let's select
this and select let's move a
little yeah so these are the data series
let's select okay and you can see the
Gan chat on my screen right here select
okay and it's done and still now it's
not complete yet so to finish it you
need to select the blue colored bars
here and right click on them and select
format data
series go to the fill icon and select no
fill and it's done for now and you can
see that there is a difference in this
particular arrangement we had Joe at the
first place and Susan at the last place
but here you can see Joe is in the last
place and Susan is in the first place so
we need to make some arrangements here
for that right click select format
access and then here you can see
categorize in reverse
order and there you go it should be done
and there you go you have your Gant
chart right on your screen Excel is a
really powerful tool for data analytics
and Reporting
and pivot tables are one of the features
that Excel offers for creating tabular
reports to summarize our data let's
begin by understanding what is a pivot
table a pivote table is a tool that
summarizes and reorganizes selected
columns and rows of data in a
spreadsheet to obtain a desired
report it does not actually change the
spreadsheet data it simply pivots or
turns the data to view it in different
perspectives pivot tables are espcially
useful with large amounts of data that
would be time time consuming to
calculate
manually now let's understand the
different components of a pivot table so
there are four main components first we
have rows when a field is chosen for the
row area it populates as the first
column in the pivot table similar to The
Columns all row labels are unique values
and duplicates are removed columns is
the second component when a field is
chosen for the column area only the
unique values of the field are listed
across the top then we have values each
value is kept in a pivot table cell and
displays the summarized information the
most common values are sum average
minimum and maximum finally we have
filters filters apply a calculation or
restriction to the entire table so let's
jump over to Microsoft Excel and let me
show you the data set that we will use
in this demo so with India being ready
for its 16th census in
2021 that is next year it is a good time
for us to analyze India's last census
data from 2011 and see where different
states and cities across India stood in
terms of population literacy and other
socioeconomic factors we will analyze
this data by creating different pivot
tables in Excel and explore some of its
features so let's begin first I'll show
you one of the features that Excel
offers us so suppose I click on any cell
and hit control+ Q you can see our
entire table is selected and at the
right bottom
there's an option of quick analysis now
you can see by default Excel has
prompted certain features such as
formatting we have charts totals and
there's one more called tables now Excel
by default has created some P tables for
us now the first one you say sum of
district code by state names next we
have sum of sex ratio by state name then
we have some of child sex ratio some of
male graduates and some of female
graduates by state name and there are
others before creating our pivote table
so let's have a final look at our data
set so First Column you see is the city
column so there are different cities
from different parts of India then we
have the state code we have the state
name district code we have the total
population followed by male and female
population next you can see we have the
total literates from each City then we
have the male and female literates next
we have the sex ratio then we have the
child sex ratio next we have total
number of graduates and finally you can
see we have male and female graduates so
using this table we'll create several
peot
tables now first of all let's create a
peot table to find the total population
for each state and sort it in descending
order so you can see here we have the
problem statement so our first P table
will have the toal toal population for
each of the states in descending order
so to create a p table you can click any
cell in your data go to the insert Tab
and here left you can see we have the
option to create a pivot table so let me
select P table now my range is already
selected the entire table and here I'll
choose existing worksheet because I want
to place my pivote table in the same
worksheet and I'll give my location
I'll point to cell Q5 now let me click
okay you can see the P table Fields
appears here on the right now since we
want to find the total population for
each state so what I'll do is I'll drag
my state name onto rows so here in our P
table you can see we have the different
state names listed now we want the total
population for each of these states so
in the field list I'll search for total
population which is this one and drag it
under
values you can see we have a sum of
total population for each of these
states by default Excel will sum any
numeric column you can always change it
to average minimum maximum anything you
want now we want to sort this column in
descending order so I right click go to
sort option and choose Zed to a that is
largest to
smallest you can see here in 2011
Maharashtra had the highest number of
population or the total population in
Maharashtra was the highest then it was
utar Pradesh we had Andra Pradesh and if
I come down we have nagaland and andan
and nicobar Islands towards the end so
this is a simple pivot table that we
created now the next problem we have is
we want to find the total sum of
literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so let's see how to do it
I'll click on any cell go to insert and
here I can click on pivot table my range
is selected I'll choose existing
worksheet and give my location which is
Q5 I click on
okay now here we want to find the total
sum of literates so what I'll do is
first let me drag total literates column
to values you have the total sum of
literates from all the
states next I want to see the sum of
total literates based on states and
cities so let me first drag state name
onto rows and then we'll drag City onto
rows you can see here we have our pivot
table
ready to the left of the pivote table
you can see we have the state names and
the cities per state and on the right
you can see the total number of
literates from each City if I scroll
down we have Assam then you can see we
have
Bihar and if I keep scrolling we have
all the states harana Himachal Pradesh
that's Jammu and Kashmir which has now
become a union territory we have jarand
Karnataka and other states as well
moving
on okay so the next thing we want to see
is what is the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state with that
we also want to find the states that had
the highest and lowest sex ratio in
2011 so let's create a pivote table for
this I'll click on any cell go to insert
choose P table click on existing
worksheet I'll select cell Q5 and click
on
okay now since we want the average sex
ratio and the child sex ratio so first
I'll drag those columns either you can
manually scroll and drag it or here you
have the option to search for it so if I
look for child you can see we
have the same column listed can just
drag it from there let me delete this
and I also want the sex ratio so I'll
place it on top of child sex ratio next
we want to see it based on different
states so what I'll do is I'll take
state name and put it under rows so here
you can see we have our pivote table
ready on the left you can see we have
the different state names listed and on
the right we have the values now we want
to find the average Now by default Excel
will sum the numeric columns you can see
it tells you sum of sex ratio child Sixx
ratio so what you can do can click on
this drop down and go to Value field
settings and here summarize values by
you can choose average you can see the
custom name it says average of Sixx
ratio click on
okay our entire column is now giving us
the average sex ratio similarly for this
column let me convert it into average
I'll again click on the drop down go to
Value field settings click on average
and click
okay and you can see here we have the
average of child sex ratio for each of
the states now the next question says
which states had the highest and lowest
sex ratio so we'll consider this column
so we'll sort it in any order you want
you can do it either ascending or
descending let me short it in descending
order
you can see we have our column sorted
now so in
2011 Kerala had the highest sex ratio
and if I scroll down to the bottom you
can see himanchal Pradesh had the lowest
which is around
[Music]
8818 up next let's explore one more
feature of peot table so suppose you
want to see the top or bottom few rows
of a pivote table you can do that as
well so here we have a question at hand
we want to find the top three cities
with the highest number of female
graduates so let's see from the entire
pivote table how we can filter the top
three cities so I'll go to insert click
on the pivote table option go to
existing worksheet click on Q5 and hit
okay now since we want to find the top
three cities I'll drag City column onto
rows and then
we want the female graduates so in the
search bar I'll look for
female and I'll choose this column that
is female graduates and drag it here
onto values so I have the sum of female
graduates for each of the Cities now
since we want to find the highest number
of female graduates in the top three
cities so let me first sort this
column I'll sort it in descending order
now we have it sorted now from this you
can say that Delhi greater Mumbai and
bangaluru are the top three cities but
it's displaying all the cities for us so
let's filter only the top three so what
you can do is right click and go to
filter under filter you have the option
of top 10 I'll select this here I only
want the top three so either you
can go down like this
or you can directly type
three your column is already selected
let me just click on okay there you go
we have the required pivot table ready
and it only displays us the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates now the next thing we want to
see is how to use a Slicer in a peot
table so we have a question here What's
the total population for all the cities
in Rajasthan and Karnataka
so let's create a poot table for this
and see how you can use a slicer to
filter the
table click on existing I'll click on a
location this time
q6 click
okay now since I want the total
population so I'll drag total population
onto values and then I'll select the
city onto rows and then the state name
also
I'll place it on top of City so you
have in the pivot table all the states
and their
cities and on the right you can see the
total population for each of these
cities but our question is we want to
find only for Rajasthan and Karnataka
now for that what you can do is go to
insert and create a slicer either you
can create from this option or you can
go to pivote table analyze option
and here you have the option to create
or insert a slicer I click on this and
since we want to slice the table based
on state that is Rajasthan and Karnataka
I'll choose state name as my slicer
field you can see this is my slicer here
now you only want the data for Rajasthan
and Karnataka so I'll search for
these two so here we have Karnataka so
let me select Karnataka
first and I also want for
Rajasthan so let me select Rajasthan
also you can see in our pivote table we
only have data for Rajasthan and
Karnataka so this pivote table shows you
different cities from Karnataka and the
total sum of population from each of the
cities and similarly we also have for
Rajasthan moving ahead now we will see
another very interesting feature of
pivot that is how you
can create percentage contribution of a
table for example we have a question
here what's the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state now we want to see in terms of
percentage and not as sum or average
let's do that I'll create my pivote
table click on
existing and I'll select an empty
cell okay now here since we want to find
the percentage contribution of male and
female literates so first I'll
drag male literates onto values followed
by female literates onto values by
default it has summed up the male lit
and female lit value and also I want to
drag State
column to
rows so here you can see the sum of male
literates and female literates per state
I want to convert this as percentage
contribution so what we can do is I'll
select any cell and I'll right click and
I'll go to so value as and here I have
the option to select person percentage
of grand total so I'll select
this you can see we have the percentage
contribution of male literates through
the total now if I sort this you will
get to know which state contributed or
has the highest percentage
contribution so we have Maharashtra for
male
literates then we had utar Pradesh in
2011 if I come
down we had migala nagaland and andan
and nicobar
Islands as those states which had little
or minimal contribution to male
literates similarly let's do it for
female literates I'll go to so value as
and select percentage of grand
total so you can see here also
Maharashtra utar Pradesh then Gujarat
and all had the highest percentage
contribution to female
literates so this is another good
feature to convert your data and SE and
terms of
percentage now moving ahead let's say we
want to find the bottom three cities
from each state that had the lowest
female graduates we can do that as well
I'll go to insert click on
pivot go to existing worksheet select an
empty worksheet and click on
okay now since I want to see based on
States as well as cities so let me drag
the state name first onto row
and let's drag the city column onto
rows next we want female graduates so
let me look for female graduates in the
field list I'll drag it onto
values now we have the list of states
and the respective cities and to the
right of the P table you can see the sum
of female graduates from each
City now first I'll sort this
column I'll right click go to sort and
click on sest to largest now we have
sorted our female graduates
from shortest or smallest to largest now
since I want to find the bottom three
cities from each state I'll come to the
cell right click go to filter and select
top 10 now I'll
replace top 10 with bottom and I want
the bottom three cities from each state
I have my column selected that is some
of female graduates if I click on okay
you can see here some of the states
don't have three cities so you can see
andman and nicobar islands has only one
city that is Port player while the
remaining you can find the bottom three
cities with the lowest number of female
graduates so Andhra Pradesh had the
these three in Assam we had Naga then
there was dier and Sila similarly if I
come down in harana we have palwal
kathal and
zind if I come further here you can see
for Karnataka there gangavati this Rani
benur and the scholar similarly you can
see for Kerala as
well now moving
ahead now in the next example I'll tell
you how you can create a calculated
field or a calculated column in Excel
with the help of a pavot table so in a
pivote table you can create or use
custom formulas to create calculated
fields or items calculated fields are
formulas that can refer to other fields
in the pivote table calculated Fields
appear with other value fields in the
pivote table like other value Fields a
calculated Fields name May proceed with
sum of followed by the field name so
here we have a sales table that has
columns like the items which has
different fruit fruits and vegetables
and those have been categorized as
fruits and vegetables we have the price
per kg and this is in terms of
rupees and we have the quantity that was
sold now let's see if you want to find
the sales for each item in the table you
can create a calculated field so your
sales column is going to be the product
of price per kg and quantity so let me
show you how you can do that with the
the help of a p table I'll create a p
table
first click on an empty cell hit okay
now if you see on the top under P table
analyze and under calculations we have
the option Fields items and sets if I
click on this drop down I get the option
to create a calculated field or insert a
calculated field and click on this I'll
give my field name as sales
and I'll select my
formula I'll first click on price per kg
and hit insert field I'll give a space
hit shift 8 to give the product symbol
and then I'll double click on quantity
now this is my formula for sales that is
price per kg multiplied by quantity I'll
click on ADD and I click on okay if you
see here there's a calculator field that
is present in the pivote table fields
which is seals but it did not add it to
our original table or original table is
the same but here we have added a
calculated field which is present only
in the pivote table list now we can use
this it has already taken it under
values now let's say I want to find the
sum of sales for each item under each
category you can see it here we have our
category fruit and we have our category
vegetable and under that we have
different items like apple apricot
banana similarly in vegetables we have
broccoli the scrots corn eggplant and
others so this is how you can create a
calculated field in a pivote table now
there's one more good feature that Excel
offers us in pivote table is to create a
pivote chart so you can use your pivote
table and create different charts so
I'll show you how to do that if I go to
insert here I have the option of
recommended charts I click on this Excel
gives me some default charts which you
can use let's say I'll select
this let me drag it a bit to the right
here you can see I'll close this pivote
field list this is a nice bar chart that
Excel has created this this is called a
pivote chart now here you can see the
category fruits and vegetables and the
different fruits and vegetables are the
items in the y axis you can see the
total seals if you see from the graph
guava meet the highest amount of seals
now if I sort this let's sort this
first you can see it here fruit guava
meet the highest amount of sales now
since I sorted and changed my my P table
the peot chart also automatically gets
updated similarly there are other charts
also that you can create let's go to the
insert Tab and let's click on
recommended charts again let's look for
a pie chart so this is a pi chart that
you can create let me click on okay so
here is our piie chart and each Pi
represents a certain item and the pi
that has the highest area represents it
had the highest amount of sales in this
case you can see it is quava and
similarly we have other items as well
this is fruit
banana that's
corn and we have spinach and
others let's explore a few other charts
so first I'll click on my pivot table go
to insert and under recommended charts
let's now select a line chart if I hit
okay move it to the right so this is a
line chart you can see it starts from
guava which had the highest amount of
sales then it
drops and in the x-axis you can see the
different items similarly when it starts
with the vegetables broli made the
highest amount of sales with 2,800 rupee
and our lowest was eggplant at 900
rupees for fruits papaya sold the least
at 700 rupees let's take take another
chart I'll go to insert under
recommended charts let's
see this time we'll see a bar chart now
this is
a horizontal bar chart and not a
vertical one we just saw a vertical
column chart like this this is an
horizontal bar chart now you can always
increase and decrease the size of these
charts let's explore a last chart let's
take the area chart for now so this is
an area chart again it looks similar to
the line chart it starts with guava
which had the highest amount of seals
similarly papaya under fruits had the
lowest amount of seals under vegetables
it was broccoli and finally eggplant
made the lowest amount of sales under
vegetable now let's go to our first
sheet and summarize what we have done in
this demo for pivot tables in Excel so
we we had our
data this is a 2011 Census Data from
India we had the different cities the
state names and we had the total
population total literates female
literates male literates we had the sex
ratio total graduates and other
information so we began by understanding
how to create a simple pivot table where
we calculated the total population for
each state and sorted it in descending
order we found that Maharashtra utar
Pradesh had the total population in
2011 then we saw another preo table
where we calculated the total sum of
literates in each City belonging to a
certain state so you can see we had the
different state names and the cities
under each
state then we saw another feature where
you could calculate the average of a
certain numerical column so here we
calculated the average sex ratio and the
child sex ratio for each state and found
out which one had the highest and lowest
sex
ratio after that we saw how you could
find or filter
tables we saw how to find the top three
cities with the highest number of female
graduates we found out that Delhi
greater Mumbai and bangaluru were the
top cities with highest number of female
graduates next we saw how to use Slicer
in a p table so we sliced our table
based on Rajasthan and Karnataka State
and saw the total population for all the
cities in Rajasthan and
Karnataka in the next
sheet we explored another feature that
was to find the percentage contribution
of male and female literates from each
state then here we saw how to find out
the bottom three cities for each state
having lowest female graduates now one
thing marked that some of the states did
not have three cities for example
Andaman had only one city that was Port
player but the others we found out the
bottom three cities that had the lowest
female graduates finally we looked at
how to create a calculated field in a
pivote table so we saw how to create a
calculated field called Sals and then we
explored how to create different charts
and graphs so this was an area chart
that we saw there a column chart
we also saw or looked at a bar chart
that was a horizontal bar chart
similarly we saw how to create a pie
chart as well so how to create a p chart
you ask it is really simple all you need
to do is just follow few steps and you
have your P chart ready which is
completely interactive now all you have
to do is select any cell in the data set
you have and rush into the insert
toolbar then in the group of charts you
have an option called pivot chart select
on it now you'll be asked to select the
data range and you can see Excel has
automatically select all the range that
you want to include in your PIV chart
then you have another option which is
asking you to either create the PIV
chart in the current worksheet or a new
worksheet for now let's select a new
worksheet and there you go voila the PIV
chart is completely ready you might ask
me this is completely empty yes yes the
default pivot chart what you get from
Excel will be completely empty but you
can add the Legends and all the data
that you want to add onto your PIV chart
just by dragging and dropping the data
from the right hand side of your Excel
sheet that is from the P chart Fields so
you can see we have various options
region category state subcategory sales
quantity Etc now I'll add
region I'll add region to access
and comparatively we will see the sales
that are happening in those particular
regions by dragging sales into values
now you have all the data in the form of
pivot chart which is completely
interactive which represents the sales
happening in those regions now you can
also select a particular region right by
default all the regions are selected but
if you want to select only Central then
you can do that by deselecting
everything and select only Central and
select okay and there you go you have
all the data related to the sales
happening in the central region now if
you want to you know kind of see all the
uh categories of sales happening in all
the regions you can drag the category
into values again and uh in the region
part okay I think we have to add
category into Legends yes now select uh
regions that that is old regions and and
select okay and you can see the category
wise sales in all the regions at one
single go and I hope you did not observe
it clearly uh the XEL also gives you the
completely prepared pivot table as well
right which is also interactive you can
also get to choose the data from here as
well and select okay and you'll see that
being reflected on the pivot chart so
here you can see both pivot table and
pivot charts are completely Interactive
now here we have four different sheets
of the sales so the first sheet is the
West Zone next is South Zone East Zone
and central zone so all this data
belongs to one single sheet that is
Superstore data set so I have
categorized or I have taken a part of
the data which belongs to central region
South Region west region and east region
now we are going to use all these four
sheets and create one single sheet which
is the pivot table of all the four
sheets now without further Ado let's
start the process now for that we might
want to use the shortcut key that is alt
D now press P now this starts the pivot
chart
wizard now here we have to choose the
option multiple consolidation
ranges then click on
next and here you can see the pivot
table is clicked by default now we'll go
to next now here click cck I will create
page fields or the pivot chart wizard
will automatically create if you want
that to create for you now click on next
now here let's select the
range now I'll be selecting the
range add
it now next we'll Select
East
it followed by that we have sub
and finally we have
best now we will name these according to
the
regions so the first one will be
West next one will be South
next one will be
East and the last one will be
Central click on next and here select
new worksheet and finish and there you
go you have the pivot table here now you
might want to change the submission
value so click anywhere on the pivot
table and change it from count to
sum so that you have the summation of
the total number of sales subcategory
sales and grand total of sales Etc now
here you can see all option now let's
select Central and you'll get the
details of the central region the grand
total and the sales happening quantity
of sales Etc now here can you can see
the furniture office supplies technology
and the grand total all in one single
sheet now let's get back to the original
sheet so as you can see this is the
original sheet and in the original sheet
you can see various more
categories which is the which is the
shipment mode customer customer segment
country City State uh and you also have
uh product name subcategory Etc so if
you had added all these into this sheet
you can also create a separate option of
adding my new details to your p table so
that is how the pivot table is created
using multiple sheets mail March in
Excel is a simple yet spectacular method
to write similar emails to hundreds and
thousands of recipients without a hassle
or even a single error let us imagine
that you are supposed to write an
interview call letter to multiple
recipients so what if you had like five
recipes you could do five different
emails and you could send them but what
if you had 50 or even 500 right that
would seem a little Troublesome and you
might even feel that you might want the
whole team to do that right but what if
I say that you can do the same with one
single mail within a matter of minutes
you send all the emails to all the 50 or
500
recipients sounds interesting right so
now in this particular tutorial we are
going to do the same now without further
Ado let's directly get onto the
Practical mode and start our Excel and
try to do some mail merch in
Excel now we are on practical mode and
we have started our Microsoft Excel so
regarding the example we discussed
earlier that is sending an interview
call letter to multiple people that's
what exactly this Excel sheet does so
here we have about 25 members or 25
candidates with their first name last
name and email and their address written
over now where is our call letter now
this happens to be our call letter so
the call letter is been sent from an
imaginary company that is smart
Solutions private limited India and
followed by that we are having one
recipient here who happens to be Mia and
uh the subject and everything all the
text related to the interview call now
we are trying to send this one single
interview call letter to all the 25
people now the only change that is going
to happen is the recipient's name and
address is going to change and the
addressing for example here you can see
dear Mia so instead of dear Mia we're
going to greet the recipient with their
particular name so that's what we're
going to try to do now so to do that you
have to go into the toolbar and select
mailings option in the mailings option
you can see the start mail merch select
recipients edit recipient and all other
options so here you might want to select
the second group and inside the second
group you have an option called select
recipients click on that and now it will
show you some options the first one is
Type in new list so if you are having
some list then you can type in or if you
already have an existing list like what
we did creating an Excel sheet and
storing all the email and address and
all the recipients complete details you
can use that as well so here we're going
to use the existing list so click on
that
now it will show you a new dialog box
using which you have to navigate to the
existing list so our existing list is
named as mail merch so click on that and
select
open now press
okay now the next part is to address all
the details so here you can see that two
address and after that you can see the
address ing of the recipient now we have
to encode this mail in such a way that
to all the recipients automatically
Excel will replace the addresses names
and the greetings right now let's try
that now let's try to encode the address
part so highlight the address part and
in the same mail links option you can
find the address blog in WR and insert
Fields ribbon
so let's select that and now you can see
the address of everyone
right so this is the preview of the
recipient's address now you can see that
the recipient's full name and state is
only available here not the street and
house number Etc now you can fix that by
selecting the match Fields option and
here you can include the address so
which might be the house department and
the second one would be Street and uh
postal code you can match it with PIN
code and that's all yeah remaining we
have everything else let's look at the
preview and this is how it looks like
perfect now let's select okay
that's
fine and uh similarly we will also try
to match
the just a moment yeah similarly we'll
try to encode the recipient's name now
for that let's go into the greetings
line here you can see you can select the
option Dear Sir or dear ma'am or to
whomever may may concern and uh here you
have another option to or just deer so
we'll go with dear and this is how the
preview looks like and if you're happy
with that it's okay and if you want to
parly check for other things I mean
other recipients you can also do that
for example the next recipient is Santos
shastri and followed by him we have
prakar RI Rajesh sahu right you can also
check everything and here you can also
see the address changing on the mail so
we can check for jagadish charari his
address and his name right so it looks
like it's working perfectly now select
okay and that's
done now we are in the final stage and
in the mailings option you can see the
last two options that is the preview
results and finish so before merging and
finishing the mail merge we should go
through a quick preview to check if
everything is fine or not so here you
can see we have the address block this
is how the encoding looks like and uh if
you replace the encoding with the actual
address and name this is how the actual
address and name look like and you can
check all the letters you can just click
on the Arrow key here and you can check
all the recipients address and their uh
names right so if you can find any
errors you can replace them and if not
if everything is fine then you can just
quickly press on the finish and merge
option when you finish merge option or
finish and merge option you get three
different
options that is edit individual
documents print documents and send all
these to the recipients now if you had
any queries or if you had any doubts
about or if you find any errors on the
mails then you can go to that particular
individual document and edit it with the
first option and in the second option
you can print all the documents like if
you want to send a hard copy then you
can print it so you can see here all and
select okay and and then you can you
know kind of save it as a PDF or you can
send the location of your printer and
then just press
okay right you can just save them in the
form of
PDF or you can directly send the emails
right now I'm not connected to any
printer so I'm not going to print any
documents now let us try the last one
this should be
interesting now when you select the mail
option then it it automatically selects
the email column from your Excel sheet
remember we had an email column from
Excel sheet right this particular column
word automatically selects that column
from Excel and you can just select okay
and all the mails will be sent to all
these imaginary mailing
addresses so that's how it's done what
is Excel V
lookup V lookup stands for vertical
lookup V lookup let's use search for
specific information in your spreadsheet
it allows you to search for a particular
value in a column and returns another
value from a different column but of the
same Row V lookup takes advantage of
vertically aligned tables to quickly
find data associated with the value the
user enters now let's look at the syntax
to write a vlookup function so vlookup
takes four parameters or arguments you
can see it here there are four arguments
in the vup function
so the first argument is called the look
of value the look of value represents
the value that you're searching for next
is the table array the table array
represents two or more Columns of
information the third argument is called
the column index number now this
represents the column number in the
table from which the value must be
returned the First Column is 1 the
second column is two and so on and then
we have the fourth parameter which is
called the range lookup now this param
parameter is optional now range lookup
is used to find an exact match so if you
want to find an exact match you need to
enter false or zero meanwhile if you
want an approximate match you need to
enter true or one if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
scaleup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know
more now let me give you a brief
overview on what's going to be in our
demo
so for our demonstration we'll use a
sales data set you can see the data set
on the left using this data set we'll
understand how V lookup performs an
exact and approximate match we'll see
how V lookup is case insensitive then
we'll perform a wild card character
search we'll understand how to handle
errors when a match is not found and
finally you will look at two-way
lookups now here is a small example of
how V lookup works so we want to find
the unit sold by Morgan using the data
set on the left so here you can see I
have the data set it has some rows and
columns so these are the columns which
are order date region there's a
representative column item units there's
unit cost and total and from this table
I want to find the units that were sold
by Morgan if you look at the table at
the bottom you can see the
representative name Morgan
and Morgan has sold 30 units now I want
to find this value using the V lookup
function so here on the right you can
see I have my lookup value which is
Morgan and this is my V lookup formula
and using this formula I'm getting the
result as 30 now let's go to our Excel
workbook and perform all the demos one
by one so this is my Excel workbook that
we are going to use for our demo and
here is the data set we'll be using now
this is the same data set that you saw a
while ago so this data set has seven
columns you have the order date the
region Representatives name item there's
units unit cost and total which is
basically the total or the amount of
sales that was
generated we are going to use a chunk of
this data set and perform our vlookup
analysis so let's see our first example
and the problem we have at hand let me
go to the exact m match tab all right so
here I'm going to use this chunk of data
which is actually taken from the
original data set so we have taken the
first 11 rows from the data set you can
see from row
two till R 12 is going to be our data
set that we'll use so we have a question
here we want to find the items sold by
Thompson so here Thompson is my lookup
value which means looking at Thompson I
want to find the item that he sold so if
you consider our table here you can see
we have the representatives name
Thompson right here and from the table
you can see Thompson sold pencil and I
want to get this value which is pencil
using my vlookup function so let's go
ahead and write our vooka
function I'll consider this as my lookup
value and here under item I'm going to
write my vooka formula to write the V
lookup formula I'll write first equal
two and I'll write V lookup if I hit tab
it will autoc complete all right now
let's give the parameters so first is
going to be the lookup value which is
nothing but Thompson so I'll just select
this cell which is
j7 comma now it's asking to give the
table array so the table array is the
table from which you want to retrieve a
value one thing to keep in mind is that
the value you are looking for should be
the first column of a table and you can
select the table array till the end of
the data set or till the column which
has the value you want to find so here
I'll select my table array starting from
the representatives column till the end
of the item column which is going to be
my table array then I'll select the
column index number so the column index
number is based on the table array you
have selected in this case my column
index number is going to be two because
we have selected just two colums and the
value which I'm going to find is in the
second column so I'll give two comma Now
the range lookup I'm going to give us
false because I want to find an exact
match so either you can hit tab or you
can write zero which means
false if I close the bracket and hit
enter it will return me the item that
Thompson had sold which is pencil you
can verify from the table that Thompson
had sold pencil all right now let's try
to change the table array and see what
result are we getting so this time I'll
slightly change the table array so again
we are trying to find the item that
Thompson had sold so I'll write my
formula equal to V lookup I'll hit tab
to autocomplete I'll give my look of
value as Thompson comma this time I'm
choosing my table AR starting from the
representatives column till the end of
the data set which is till
p12 again my column index number is
going to be two because if you consider
this table array the item column is the
second column in the selected table
array so I'm going to write it as two
comma the range lookup I want to give as
false because I want to find the exact
match if I close this and hit enter you
can see it has return me the the same
result that we saw earlier now suppose
let's say this time I want to start my
table array from the region column which
is this column so I want to select my
table array starting from the region
column now this is going to show me an
error because your table array should
always start from the look of value
column so if you consider Thompson as
the look of value my table array should
always start from the representatives
column so let's just try this example so
I'll write V lookup my lookup value I'm
going to give it as Thompson comma the
table array as I mentioned earlier I'm
going to choose from the region column
and let's say I'll select till the item
column give another comma and this time
my column index number is going to be
three because since the table array has
three columns and my item column is the
last column so I'm going to give my
column index number is three comma I
want to get the exact match so I'll give
zero if I close the bracket and hit
enter you can see it has given me an
error okay now let me just show you
another method to use vlookup in Excel
so here on the top you can see there's a
formulas Tab and under formulas tab
under function Library you see we have
an option to select look up and
reference if I click on this and if I
scroll down below you can see there's an
option called vlookup let's choose this
all right now here you can give your
lookup value your table array column
index number and the range
lookup under this function arguments
dialog box so here I want to select my
lookup value as Thomson my table array
is going to be from the representatives
column till let's say the end of the
data set my column index number is going
to be two
I'll write two and range lookup I'll
write as false because I want the exact
match if I hit okay you can see it has
given us the exact same result so this
is one of the other ways to use V lookup
in Excel now let's move to the next
sheet which is regarding approximate
match okay so sometimes you might have
cases where you don't have the lookup
value present in the table in those
cases you can tell V lookup to return an
approximate match now one thing to keep
in mind is that your lookup value column
should always be sorted in ascending
order while trying to get an approximate
match so here we are going to use this
table and my lookup value column which
is going to be the representatives
column is already sorted in ascending
order and let's see the question we have
here so I want to find the item sold and
the unit cost for Matt so my lookup
value is going to be be mat now if you
see this table I don't have the
representatives name Matt anywhere in
the table now using an approximate match
I want to find the item and the unit
cost so let's do it so here under item
I'll write my vooka formula so I'll type
V lookup I'll hit tab to complete it and
this time my lookup value is going to be
mat so I'll select this cell comma my
table array I'll select from the
represent column till the end of item
column because I want to find the item
value for mat I'll give a comma my
column index number as per the table
array is going to be two comma my range
lookup this time I'm going to give us
true or one so I'll write one close the
bracket hit enter all right it has
written me binder was the item sold by
Matt now let's try to figure out why we
look up returned binder as the
item now let's say you were asked to
insert the name Matt to the
representative column in alphabetical
order so where would you place it
ideally you should Place between KL and
Morgan since this column is already
sorted Matt should appear before Morgan
and after Kel so in an approximate match
we look up we consider the previous
highest value in this case the previous
highest value
before Matt is Kel and hence we look up
returned the corresponding item
purchased by Kel which is binder now
similarly if you wanted to find the unit
cost for
Matt again V up will return the unit
cost of KL which is
125 let's just write out so I'll write
we look up my lookup value is Matt comma
my table array for this time is going to
be from Representatives column till the
unit cost column I'll consider I'll give
a comma Now the column index number as
per the table array is going to be four
I'll give another comma and this time
I'll double click true because I want an
approximate match if I close the bracket
hit enter you can see it has returned me
125 which is actually kl's unit cost
okay we have another question and this
time I want to find the units sold by
Rob now Rob is going to be my lookup
value if you see the representatives
column we don't have Rob now let's see
what V lookup is going to return as the
item for Rob so I'll write V lookup I'll
give my lookup value as Rob comma my
table array is going to start from the
representatives column I'll select till
here I'll give a comma the column index
number is two
give another comma I'll double click on
true I close the bracket hit enter you
can see vup has written me pen now let's
understand why V lookup returned pen for
Rob now if you are asked to insert the
representatives name Rob into this
column so ideally Rob would appear
somewhere between Morgan and sorino
because since this is sorted in
ascending order ra
is actually greater than Morgan and is
less than sorino so as you know we look
up in an approximate match Returns the
previous highest value which is Morgan
here and the corresponding item for
Morgan is pen and hence we look up
returned pen for Rob all right now
moving to the next
sheet which is another property of V
lookup which tells V lookup always looks
to the right this means that your lookup
value must always be on the left and the
value you are going to find out should
always be to the right of the table now
consider this scenario where your lookup
value is on the left in this case it is
the representatives value and I have
taken svino for an example and we want
to find the order date for svino now if
you consider this table your lookup
value which is s know is actually this
column the representatives column and we
are going to find out the order date so
your representatives name is on the
right of the table and the value we are
going to find out is on the left of the
table now as per the property V lookup
only looks to the right so if I use the
vlookup function for this example here
I'll write V lookup I'll give my lookup
value as svino comma my table array I'll
consider from the order date because I
want the order date till
the representatives column I'll give a
comma and this time my column index
number is actually the first column if I
consider my table array as the first
three columns
selected and my range lookup is going to
be false if I close the bracket hit
enter it returns me an error the reason
is V lookup always looks to the right
and this time the value we were trying
to find out was to the left of the table
now if you consider the opposite case
suppose you have the order date and you
want to find the representatives name
you can do that easily because your
lookup value which is the order date is
on the left and your representatives
column is on the right so let's just try
this I'll write V lookup my lookup value
is going to be S Vino's order date so
I'll select it from the table I'll give
a comma my table array will start from
the G column let's say I'll select the
entire table comma and my column index
number will be three if you consider
these as my table
array comma my range lookup is zero if I
close this hit enter you can see we have
got s weo corresponding to the order
date all right now let's move to the
next
tab now this tab says we lookup returns
only the first match so we have a
question at hand the question is find
the units sold by Jardine if you see
this table we have the representatives
name Jardin twice you see here and if
you look down we have Jardin here as
well but the item sold by jardan at the
first instance is pencil and at the
second instance it's desk now as per the
property we lookup always returns the
first match now ideally when we write
the vup function and look for the units
sold by Jardine you will see vup will
return 36 instead of three let's just
write
out I'll write the vup
function my look of value is Jardine
comma my table array I'll select from
the representatives column till the end
of units column I'll give a comma my
column index number based on the
table array is three I'll give another
comma Now I want the exact match so I'll
select zero close the bracket and hit
enter now as you can see it returns me
the first match of Jardine which is 36
so we lookup did not consider the second
match now
similarly if you consider this table we
have Jones repeated Thrice so you have
Jones here you have Jones
here for the second time and also we
have Jones for the third time and let's
say you want to find the unit cost for
Jones so if I write the vook of
function I'll consider my look of value
as Jones comma my table
array I'll select from the
representatives column till the end of
unit cost column I'll give a comma based
on the table array my unit cost column
is at the fourth index so I'll write
four comma the range lookup is zero if I
click on this and hit enter you can see
it here V lookup has returned the first
instance of Jones and it did not
consider the second and the third
instance so our unit cost for Jones is
1.99 because we lookup only Returns the
first
match okay moving ahead to the next
example we have here is V lookup is case
in insensitive if you consider this
table I've added another row in green so
if you see here I have a representative
name called Gil which is in proper case
or popularly known as sentence Kee here
I have added Gil's name
in capital letters or all in uppercase
so I want to find the total revenue
generated by Gil the total revenue is
basically the total column let's do it
I'll write V
lookup my lookup value is Gil which is
actually in upper case I'll consider my
table array from the representatives
column till the end of total column or
the sales
column based on this selection my column
index number is
five comma the range lookup is false so
I'll just double click on
false I close the bracket hit enter you
can see it here our vook of function has
returned the total as
53973 which is actually the value for
this row so clearly V look up did not
consider Gil which was present at the
bottom of the table in upper case so
this shows that V lookup is clearly case
insensitive all right now moving to the
next example the vuca function supports
wild cards which makes it possible to
perform a partial match on a lookup
value for instance you can use vlookup
to retrieve values from a table after
typing only part of a lookup value to
use wild cards with v lookup you must
specify the exact match by giving false
or zero for the last argument that is
range lookup now we have a question here
I want to know how much sales did the
representative whose name starts with Ki
make now here sales represents the total
column
actually so I want to find out the
person whose name starts with
Ki so if you consider the representative
column I have one representative whose
name starts with Ki that is Kel so using
Ki as my lookup value I want to find the
total so let me show you how to use
wildcard characters and find the value
using vlookup so I'll write my function
vlookup okay now now in lookup value
I'll give
Ki after that I'm going to write Amber
scent followed
by double inverted commas then I'm going
to write a star and close the inverted
comma this means the value starts with
Ki Amber sent actually represents
concatenation and star represents
anything followed by Ki so this is going
to be my lookup value into total I'll
give a
comma next I'll select my table array
starting from the representatives column
till the end of total column because I
want to find the Sals I'll give another
comma my column index number based on
the table array we have selected is five
comma the range lookup is zero because I
want to find an exact match close the
bracket hit enter you can see it here V
lookup has returned me
999.50 which is actually equals
total now there's another way to do it
instead of selecting the cell in which
we have the lookup value I can directly
write it in the v lookup function so
I'll write the V lookup function
something like this so my lookup
value I'll pass Ki within double
inverted commas because Ki is a
character value
So within double inverted commas I'm
writing Ki followed by Amber Cent which
is for concatenation followed
by a
star within double inverted commas so
this is going to be my lookup values
this in total means anything that
appears after Ki will be considered as
the lookup
value again the table array I'll select
as these rows and columns comma my
column index number number would be five
comma the range lookup is zero if I
close the bracket hit enter you see we
have the same value so this is another
method or another way of using
vlookups okay now moving ahead let's
explore another feature of vlookup so if
the vlookup function cannot find a match
it returns a hash na a error now if you
want you can use the if na function to
replace the has na error with a friendly
message so suppose you want to find the
region in which an order was placed on
10th of May
2018 now if the order date is not found
I want to return a message that is
invalid date
so if you look at the order date column
we don't have any value for 10th of May
2015 you can see these values we don't
have any value corresponding to this
date so if my vup function cannot find
the this lookup value I'll return
invalid date so let me show you how to
write
this I'll type my V lookup function I'll
give my order date as 10th of May
2015 as my lookup value and then I'll
consider my table array starting from
the order date column till the end of
region
column I'll give another comma my column
index number would be two this time
based on the table aray we have selected
comma I want an exact
match so I'll give zero close the
bracket and hit enter there you go it
has returned me an error now I want to
convert this error to a friendly message
saying invalid date so let me show you
how to do it I'll do it here so to
return a valid
message I'll use the if any function and
within ifna function I'll give my V
lookup function so let me type if na
I'll hit
tab now for the value parameter I'll use
my V lookup function so my lookup value
is going to be the order date comma my
table array I'll select from the order
date column till the end of region
column comma my column index number is
going to be two comma my range lookup is
zero I'll close the bracket give another
comma Now if this expression results in
an error I want to display a message
that is invalid date so I'll put invalid
date within double codes since it is a
text
message I close the bracket hit enter
you can see the result which is invalid
date now moving on to the final section
of the demo we have two-way
lookup now in the v lookup function the
column index parameter is not normally
hardcoded as a static number however you
can also create a dynamic column index
by using the match function to locate
the right
colum and this technique allows you to
create a dynamic two-way lookup matching
on both rows and
columns now let me first show you how a
match function works so
suppose I want to find the index where
unit cost column is present so here I'll
use the match function I'll give my
lookup value as the unit cost column
name comma suppose I'll choose my lookup
array starting from Representatives
column till the unit cost column comma
I'll give my match type as zero for
exact match if I close the bracket hit
enter it returns me four because my
array was selected from the
representatives column till the unit
cost column and in this array unit cost
is at the fourth index
all right now using this idea let's
solve the following problem I want to
find the cost of each item sold by
Morgan so let's write our vlookup
formula write V
lookup my lookup value is J5 which has
the representatives name as Morgan comma
my table array I'll select from C2 till
F12 I'll give a comma and this time I
know that my column index number is at 4
but I'll be using the match function to
find the
same so I'll write
match my lookup value is unit cost comma
my lookup array is from C1 till
fub1 comma my match type is zero
I close this bracket give another comma
and I'll give my range lookup as zero
close the bracket hit enter you can see
for Morgan the unit cost is 19.99 you
can verify from the table for Morgan the
unit cost is
19.99 all right now we have another
question
here I want to find how much sales did
Andrew make in the central region so
here I have two lookup values one is
Central one is Andrews now looking at
these two values I want to find the
total to solve such
problems let me first create another
table I'll place the table somewhere
here okay so let me just paste the table
here all right now I'll create another
column where I'll merge the values of
region and representatives so here let
me create another column okay I'll just
name this column as
region
rep all right now this
column I'll use the concatenation
operator so I'll Select East use amberon
and then select Jones I'll hit
enter now the same thing I'll just
duplicate it for the other rows as well
so I have my new column created Now
using this table I can easily solve the
problem now to find the total I'll write
my vlookup
formula so my lookup value will be a
combination of
G11 Amber
Cent
k11 comma while table array will start
from the region rep which has the values
of region and rep combined till
the last
column and from this table array my
column index number is five and my range
lookup is zero if I close the bracket
hit enter you can see for central region
which is this one and for Andrew's
representative the total is 149.
25 all right now we are done with our
demo let's have a quick glance at what
all we did did in this demo okay so
first of all we saw our data set which
was a sales data set that we used then
we started with our first example to see
how vooka performs an exact match we
also saw how using the formulas Tab and
lookup and reference you
can write V lookup in another way so you
can use the function arguments to give
your vup parameters next we saw how vup
performs an approximate match so we had
Matt and raw which were not present in
the representatives column after that we
saw an important property of V lookup
that is V lookup only looks to the right
followed by V lookup only Returns the
first match following which we saw that
V lookup is case insensitive so here we
had added a new row where Gil was
present in upper case but still we look
up found the total revenue for Gil which
was in sentence case or proper case next
we saw how we can use Wild Card
characters to use
vlookups and here we saw how to use an
if any function along with v lookup and
finally we saw how to use two way
lookups choose from over 300 in demand

link in the description to know more now
we are on on the sheet of Microsoft
Excel and here you can see some data on
my
sheet that is employee name employee ID
and salary so here we are going to
perform our horizontal lookup but before
that let me show you that this
particular drop- down menu so this
particular drop- down menu has all the
names of the employees in this
particular table and we have created
this using data validation in Excel if
you want to create the drop- down menus
just like this then feel free to check
out our data validation in Excel
tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement H lookup in Excel so here we
have employee name but we want to find
out the employee ID so for that let's
create the H lookup now for that equals
to H
lookup now the first one is the lookup
value so this one is the cell which is
the employee name now after that the
table array we have to select all the
table arrays here
now the row index number so the employee
ID is in row index number two according
to the table so for that provide two and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false and close the bracket press enter
and there you go and if you select Jack
then you'll find the employee ID of Jack
and if you select Jerry you'll find the
employe ID of cherry reflecting here now
similarly let's find out the salary of
all the employees using H lookup so
equals H
lookup and lookup value that happens to
be the name of the employee now the
table
areay and next we have uh row index
number that is salary happens to be the
third row in the table so three
and exact match close the bracket and
enter so now if you change the values in
this particular drop down menu you'll
find the employee ID and their
particular salary so Jack happens to be
carrying the employee ID as 10001 and
his salary is 10,000 so similarly let's
try to find out Peter's employee ID and
salary so there you go one5 and 50,000
as salary so that's how you use H lookup
in Excel here you can see the first
chart so this particular data is
converted into a table format to avoid
confusion while you're fixing the data
so here you can see the name of the
employee employee ID Department salary
and date of joining and here you can see
the salary column and the bonus
percentage of each and every employee
based on their salaries now coming to
the new data table and here on the table
two which is an updated table here you
can find we're going to find out the
department of the employee and the
current Department of employee and the
bonus percentage based on his or her
salary so why are we finding current
Department again so here you can see
that we have an intern Emily who has
joined in the year 2020 but recently she
got promoted as a developer so her
department has been changed from
Department intern to Department
developer in 2021 so that's what we're
going to find out here in the current
Department using X lookup now let's
start to implement X lookup so for that
equals to X lookup and for lookup you
can see if you need to find out the
lookup value lookup array return return
array and all the other two are not
important right now but you can use them
to get some exact matches in the future
we'll also use that in the future for
now let's try to use the first three
parameters that is lookup value lookup
array and written array so the lookup
value is the name of the employee Mary
and lookup array is right here which is
this one now we going to select the
lookup array then comma and uh we're
going to look up the department so this
is the department lookup array and
that's all we
need close the bracket and press enter
okay I think we missed out the lookup
value so the employee uh or the lookup
value which we required was missed so
I've added it here so that is the lookup
value the first one which is Mary and
there you go press enter and you have
the department here now let's add it to
all the rows and here you have all the
rowes and all the data related to all
the employees now we will find out the
current Department as you can see here
you have Emily as intern which is the
old data but what if you needed the
latest data that is the developer in the
year 2021 right for that you might want
to TW the X lookup formula a little bit
so let's try that X
lookup look up value which is the same
and comma Now where you have to look for
the array that is look up array this one
and the return array which happens to be
this
one and
next you can find the exact match for
this one so that's all right exact match
and here comes the important part where
you have to search last to first by
default X lookup searches for first to
last that is
like this in the starting place to the
last place so that's the reason why we
had Emily as intern so now if we give
last two first then it retrieves the
latest data where Emily will be shown as
developer now select that and now you
can close the brackets and press enter
so let's add that to all the rows there
you go now you can see Emily Clark Peter
and James all they have got their
updated job profiles as you can see in
the original data Emily is a developer
now so is Clark who was originally a
tester and he got promoted to
development team in 2021 similarly Peter
became a senior financed executive in
2021 and James the manager of sales now
let's try to find out the bonus for all
these employees based on their salary so
this one is quite simple so X
lookup now the lookup value is their
existing salary comma and the bonus part
so the lookup array is the salary range
then here is another important point so
here you might want to find the exact
match but finding the exact match will
not help you here you might want to
declare another type of value where you
can get exact match or next smaller item
so you'll understand it why I'm
selecting that so now let's close the
bracket and enter
so so now we have the bonus values now
let's add the bonus value to all the
factors all the r I mean so you can see
we have different variety of salaries
that is 388,000
22,39 ETC but here in the ranges we have
provided 10 20 30 40 and 50 so what if
the value is between 30 and 20 that's
when you want the less number right
that's when you want the number which is
equalent to 30 or less than 30 which
happens to be 15% so that's how it has
worked here that is 0.15% bonus to the
actual salary now we are on our Excel
sheet
here you can see the employee names and
employee IDs of different employees from
different zones let us imagine that the
blue one is from East Green one is from
West and the black one is from or the
purple one is from South and the orange
one is from North so this data is a
little small but what if you had a data
with hundreds or thousands of rows
including all the employee names
employee IDs or or another relevant data
typee like sales of an employee and his
employee ID and you were supposed to
combine all the data from all the four
different zones into one single sheet it
would consume a lot of time right so
recently Microsoft has released some
latest updates based on arrays and datas
so one of those is wack function in
Excel so how to use it since it is a
latest function I recommend you to go to
the file menu and in the file menu you
can navigate to account and in the
account you can see the option of update
options then you can select update now
and your Microsoft Office will be
updated to the latest version and you'll
get access to the latest functions in
Excel and all the other office related
things like B on presentation Etc now we
going to implement the vack function in
Excel it is completely simple all you
need to do is equals to stack and then
select the data remember to select the
data from column A and cell two or the
row two we are not selecting the
employee name and employee ID we are
just selecting the data now separate
them by comma then again this one here
this set and again this
one and again lastly this particular law
set now close the bracket and press
enter
and there you go you have all the
employee names and their respective
employee IDs all together in one data
set so this is how you use W stack
function in Excel and there are also a
few more new updates from Microsoft
Excel and we will discuss on them sooner
so the name itself conveys that it is
something like a reference function
right so it refers to a cell which is
present in a particular sheet or the
current sheet or it refers to a
particular range in the current sheet or
it can also refer to an entire workbook
in a current window right so you can
stay here on the sheet number one and
you can refer something which is present
on the sheet number 10 or 11 you can
stay in this current workbook and refer
to something which is around in a
different workbook all together so
that's exactly how the indirect function
in Excel works okay so I guess the
definition was a little uh difficult to
get let me show you a simple demo here
so that it becomes a little easy for you
so currently I'm in the cell number A2
right now here I will implement the
indirect function press T to selected
and now I'll refer to the cell
C2 and let's enter and there you go let
me properly close the window it's there
so let me implement the indirect
function here so equals to indirect and
press tab to select now I'll be
selecting the cell C2 and inside C2 we
have E2 address now the formula is fine
I have implemented the indirect function
and selected the cell E2 and now if I
press enter see the magic there you go
so in the cell E2 we have the text hello
world so when I use the indirect
function to refer which is something in
C2 it is indirectly referring to another
cell address that is E2 which has the
text hello world now this one was a
little pretty simp
now let's check some complicated ones
and we'll move to sheet number one here
we have some student names and their uh
you know uh marks on the individual
subjects that is math science English
computer science and here and here you
can see I'm selecting the student names
and accordingly I'm getting their
average score and the total marks
obtained right seems interesting how did
I do this so this is done exactly using
the indirect function so let's do it
again so this is how you do it now here
I will be using okay before we get into
this uh we need to do some fundamentals
before we do it right so the
fundamentals are you need to name your
individual columns so here I have Brian
and his marks so I'll select entire
marks of Brian ranging from B2 to B4
right click and here you can see Define
name
and I'll be naming it as
Brian it's already named we might get an
error so it's already named okay let's
add another one
maybe uh Jennifer let's cancel this so
let's uh add
Jenny and her marks will be
96 87 I'm selecting some random numbers
here so 87
so we have the new column here now we
need to name this column Define a name
and it's joury so Excel has
automatically selected the name for this
column so let's press okay now we have
our columns ready now here if you see
the drop down we have Amy bana Brian
Brock Emily Jenny John everyone over
here right so the columns are named the
individual columns are named so now the
student name so here you can use some
simple called Data validation here
select the data option in the toolbar
navigate to data tools here select data
validation and uh in this instead of any
value select list and here give the
source as this particular
set press okay so that you get the drop
down menu over here you can also type
the individual names again when you type
the individual names you might go wrong
with the case or spelling right so it's
better always to use this kind of list
options which will make things easier
for you now getting into the average
calculation so here the average will be
uh equals to average press tab to select
now the indirect function indirect
of the cell address and close the
bracket first you might get an error
because currently it is empty so select
some name and you'll get your average
score now same thing applies to uh you
know total uh you can press these some
function select the Su function and uh
type in the indirect function and uh the
cell V1 close the brackets and press
enter so that's how you do it PR web
Query in Excel now you might be
wondering what exactly is web query so
you all know that Excel is a brilliant
data analytics and business intelligence
tool right so it requires some data to
be stored or some data to be analyzed
right that creates as an opportunity for
the sources so don't think that Excel is
something where you just you know copy
paste the data and that's how it stores
or you need to manually enter the data
no it can get connected to a various and
wide variety of data sources ranging
from a simple file database CSV and
Microsoft Access Data analysis services
and many more and including web right
now there might be a case where you are
you know interested in getting the data
from a direct web page which is dynamic
for example you might be interested in
stock market right and you wanted to you
know take the data which is dynamic
directly from the stock market right so
is it possible for Excel to take and
store the dynamic data yes you can do it
so now here we are on the stock market
India website and let's get into the
most active stock St able click on
that and you are navigated to the most
active shares in India currently now
select the URL of this particular web
page get back to your get back to your
Excel and here on the data button in the
toolbar you can see from text CSV from
web right so let's uh select the get
data option from other sources from web
you can either choose this or feel free
to choose this as well over here so
let's go to web and here you might want
to place your url paste URL and press
okay and you will have some time
connecting to the server give it some
time now while we are at it let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
Microsoft Excel and also a lot more
Technologies in the current ID industry
so if you want to get updated on all the
Technologies in the C in it market then
make sure that you subscribe to our
Channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to never miss an update from
Simply La now you can see that we are
successfully connected to the data and
you can see various data tables over
here so for example let's select on the
table zero so all this data is the
current active and dynamic data from the
website we selected so let's just press
on load to load just one table as of now
and see how it
works so the data is loading again we
might have to give a little time for the
data to load onto the Excel
spreadsheet now you can see the data has
been successfully loaded and all the
details that is the company name highest
price low price loss price change
percentage and the value in coros
everything has been updated including
the 5ay performance right now you can
you know hide this because it's a lot of
information to grasp all together
together now here you can see all the
data has been currently stored onto the
Excel spreadsheet now you might be
wondering if this particular data is
valid or if this particular data is
really dynamic or not right so to answer
that question let's see to the data
option again and here you can see the
refresh button so click on refresh all
and you can see there is a query running
in the background from the web right so
here you can see running background
query so this will run a query and the
numbers will be
updated so let's remember any one of the
numbers maybe they might be so I'll take
a quick glance here and try to remember
the numbers you can take a screenshot
and after the query has successfully run
you can see some changes in the numbers
right so maybe some numbers are changed
here since we have finished our query so
that's how the web Query in Excel works
with the dynamic data that is user form
in
Excel so what exactly is a user form so
user form is a graphical user interface
that helps you have an live interaction
with your worksheet which enables you to
enter or eliminate data from your Excel
worksheet through the graphical user
interface now let's get into the
Practical mode and start the Excel
workbook now we have launched our
Microsoft Excel so let us create a blank
workbook for now
now we have the blank workbook or
worksheet now before we get started with
the user forms in Excel the fundamental
step is to enable the developer menu on
the toolbar here you can find the
developer menu so basically it will not
be enabled as default to enable that you
need to get into file menu and inside
the file menu you can see the last menu
that is the options menu select that and
you will have a dialogue box on your
screen
and inside that you need to go into the
customize ribbon option and inside the
customize ribbon option you have the
main tabs scroll through the main tabs
and here you can find an option called
developer by default it will not be
enabled it will look something like this
but to enable that you need to select
the check option in this and click on
that and select okay now the developer
option will be enabled on your tool menu
so now you have your developer option on
your toolbar so to get started with
userforms in Excel click on the
developer option and here you can see
Visual Basic so click on that Visual
Basic and now you have your new window
opened right on your
screen so this is the visual basics for
applications so here is where you create
your user forms Now to create a user
form just select on insert menu and you
have the option called user
form now a new user form will be created
for
you and that is user form
one so this is the user form which you
can design and enable to interact with
your worksheet and help you insert data
or eliminate data for now let's try to
create a simple user form for employees
now here you can see the controls option
where you can find the various options
to provide an object into your user form
so it might be a label it might be a
text box it might be a multi-page it
might be a command button it might be a
frame or a toggle switch many more for
now let's make it simple let's create a
label so this is our first label we have
just dragged and dropped it and let us
name it app
okay so let us select it and rename it
as employee
ID now let's insert another
label drag and drop as simple as it
looks select
that and rename it as
employee
name now another one you can also copy
that and paste
it and this should be our employee phone
number now we have our three labels on
the
screen let's try to ins insert the text
box now this is our first text
box for employ
ID now let's copy and paste it so
another text box for employee name copy
and paste again and the last text box
for employee phone now let us try to
insert the
button so the First Command button let
us rename it as
insert now let is relocate it to a
little bit left now let us try to insert
another
button and here it is the second button
would
be refresh
sheet uh the refresh button will play
the role of clearing the text boxes in
case if there is some data already
entered if you want to clear that you
can just press on refresh and it'll be
cleared now we have our user form so let
us try to rename our user form so here
you can see that we have the properties
Tab and inside the properties tab we can
always rename it and to rename it let us
go into caption and rename it as
employee data
and that's done so our basic user form
is ready now let's get back to Excel
sheet so remember that we have created
three labels employee ID employee name
and employee form we need to create the
exact same columns here so
employee
ID let us expand the column a little
bit now em l o y e
e name let us also increase the width
and finally we have employee
phone there you
go yeah we have our three
columns let us select all the three
columns
and align to
middle you can also format your sales
let is select the green color and text
as
white and let is
hold
yeah pretty
good there you go so we have created our
sheet and it's ready now now the last
part remaining is we need to code this
particular user form so coding in the
sense we have two buttons over here
right so those buttons should be
performing some kind of operation so for
insert button the operation should be
inserting the data which we have entered
into these text boxes so to program it
just double click on the insert button
and here eliminate everything and paste
this code so basically what we did is we
had this particular code segment so this
is the starting part of the code segment
and this is the ending part of the code
segment so we are writing our code in
between these two lines so what did we
write here so end of the row is sheets
of sheet name so this is the sheet name
right here we have our sheet name as
sheet one so that is the sheet name
where we want to perform the operations
and range from a to row count and XL up
row that is we counting the number of
rows here that particular state
statement will count the rows till the
end of the sheet automatically and after
that it will shift to textbox value that
is once the row number is counted that
is from 1 to n it will start entering
data from the first available row that
is a column a column then once the a
column is finished it will enter into B
column and subsequently into C and once
the text boxes are entered the data that
is let's come back to here so once we
have entered all the text that is the
employee ID name and phone after
selecting the insert button
automatically these three text boxes
should go blank again you cannot have
the same data again in your text
box so that is why we have included text
box value one null textbox value two
null textbox value 3 null so that was
for command operation insert now we
should program the command operation for
refresh double click on
that and you have the code option over
here so this particular code will be
automatically loaded from The Click
button one now for click button two you
need to add some more data that is
refreshing so whenever you press the
refresh button the text should go blank
for that we'll use the same code from
the previous click button or the command
button paste it over here and they
should perform the clearing operation
and it's done now close this so select
the employee data user form and here you
can see the Run option so select that
run option and the sheet has the user
form here now let us enter the employee
ID as 1 2 3 4 5 and employe name as JN
okay caps Lo is on J H and John employee
phone as some
18800 2 3
1 and select the insert option and the
data got inserted now let us try to
insert another data 1 2 3 4
6 employee name
Wick and employee phone number 1
18345 yeah by now you might have guessed
I'm a fan of John Wick yes and yeah
there you go we have entered the second
data over here now let me show you
another trick where you can place all
this user form as a macro and replace
this by just one single button so
whenever you press that button this data
form or user form will pop up and you
can directly start entering data so for
that let's get back to the Visual Basic
and stop this particular execution and
and you got your user form back now you
need to insert a model get into insert
option and select the module or model
yeah it is module not model so inside
this module you need to write the
command for
macro so here it
is so what we basically doing is a m p l
o y e e data Dosh show or we can use an
UND go and get back to user form and
rename this
as
dat cool so what we are doing is
entering the subject as enter employee
details this will be the macro name and
when this macro is called the employee
data user form should be shown and once
it is shown the code should be ended
that is end subject now we we have
designed our
module now let's get back to the
sheet and here go to the developer
option go to the insert menu and select
button and draw the button
somewhere and now you can select the
enter employ details macro and press
okay and now you have a button here now
you can edit
this edit it as press to enter
enter employee
details and there you go done so now
whenever you press this particular
button the user form will activate
Okay and you need to play
this okay the error was related to the
employe data sheet name we had to rename
the employee data from user form to
employe data initially it was just user
form we have renamed that to employee
data and now the code is fine so let's
get back to the sheet now if you press
this button the user form will
automatically start now let us try to
enter the data again 1 2 3 4 5 7 this
time and uh some
name let's enter
as
Jenifer and her phone number would be 1
18345
by 098 some random number and select
insert and the data is been inserted
here so this is how you work on
userforms in Excel now at times you
might be working on a really important
spreadsheet on your Excel or you might
have the sales data of your company or
some confidential data of your
organization and you might have shared
the file with your junior or you might
face some paret issue and you forgot to
save or you missed to save your data and
what to do if you cannot save your data
and how can you recover it right so this
might be a really big hassle today we
are exactly going to discuss the same
and see how to do it in multiple ways so
Excel comes up with an option to
automatically save the data also it will
try to warn you that your data is not
being saved would you like me to save it
or not right so we'll do the first one
so here you have the autosave option you
can either say okay to it or you can
ignore it in in case if you ignore it if
you choose to ignore it or if you choose
to manually save it and then if you want
to close the file remember we haven't
saved the file if you wish to close it
Excel will automatically come up with a
dialogue box asking you want to save
your changes to your data.
xlsx that means it is asking you if I
have to save it or not let's try to
ignore this and forcefully let's try to
close it you can go to task manager
option here we are trying to simulate
the option of bar issues so we are
forcefully closing Excel without saving
any
data so we have closed it now here you
can see we do not have Excel running in
the background now when you directly
open or try to start Excel when you get
the power backup again and if you want
to open that same data file it will ask
you the document recovery option it says
you have closed the file without saving
the changes
and you can choose to you know come back
from the same place where we left last
time okay now that was the poet issue
and now let's see uh another way okay
let's imagine that somebody uh
eliminated few important data files from
your uh organization's confidential data
employee ID employee name Etc and again
uh let's simulate the force uh close of
the
Excel now we are closing it again
without saving no data was been
saved now it will also ask the same uh
data it has another version here the
original one which wasn't saved so here
you can recover the same file again
however it was initially so you can save
it and it will get back to the original
place so this was one way also we have
another few multiple ways just we have
to navigate to file and here you can
open and in the open menu you have a
button called recover unsaved workbooks
not just the current workbook it will
also have all the remaining files which
are related to excel that are not saved
so here you have a few workbooks which
was not saved this is one option and we
also have another option we can just
navigate to info and there you have
another option called manage workbook
and in the manage workbook you have
another option called recover unsaved
workbooks which will also redirect you
to to the same file that is Microsoft
Office unsaved files and you'll have all
the unsaved workbooks which are related
to excel so this is how you can recover
the unsaved data in Excel using multiple
ways first thing Excel will
automatically ask you if you have to
save the file or not and in case if you
forget to save it you can directly
recover it by default by Excel it will
automatically show that some folder was
not saved on the left side of your Excel
spreadsheet by default and in case if
you missed out on that one you can
manually go to file and you can either
choose open option or info option to
recover the unsaved folders from your
default file location from your PC that
is Microsoft Office unsaved files
Etc which will have all the list of all
unsaved workbooks related to excel let's
see what is a project plan project plan
is a basic thing that is needed to
execute a project according to project
management book of knowledge a project
can be defined as an approved
elaborative do doent that guides the
team during project execution and
project control when we making a project
plan a project plan must answer several
questions for us these questions are
like what are we expecting our project
to deliver how are we expecting to get
our deliverables within the desired time
who all will be a part of a project and
what tasks they will have in the project
when will the project start and when it
is expected to end that is the deadlines
of the project now let us learn about
project management in Excel Microsoft
Excel is one of the most common
application these days it is used in
both offices and at homes Microsoft
Excel is an easy project management tool
that allows the team members to easily
see the tasks in a project develop a
plan and track its progress before we
learn more about project management in
Excel let's first have a look why do we
use Excel Microsoft Excel is an easy
tool to plan a project so it can be used
by people who are beginners in terms of
project management in Excel one can find
several analytical tools like
concatenate Len and counter so this make
data analysis easy and effective as the
entry of data is easy same is tracking
and controlling of project status then
there are several project management
templates in Excel that help us to have
an effective distribution of project
data we will be checking several project
management templates towards the end of
this video now let's have a look at the
process of making a Gand chart in Excel
before we begin this it's important we
know what is a Gand chart a gan chart is
like an horizontal bar chart that is
used for project management with the
help of a Gand chart we can check the
status of the task the date they start
the date they end and their dependencies
on each other Gant chart helps in
coordinating and monitoring different
tasks in a project now let's have a look
at the steps that will help us in making
a Gand chart first step we have is make
a project table we have several rows in
columns like here we have three columns
in the First Column we have the tasks in
the second we have a start date and in
the third column we have the duration or
tenure of the task the second step is to
make a bar chart in Excel for this we
will select the entire second column
then we will go on the insert Tab and
click on the bar graph chart there we
can select stag bar graph in 2D bar
charts as a result we will have the
entitled bar graph on the screen in the
third step we will add the duration to
the bar graph we will right click on the
chart and in the menu that appears we
will select select data option a window
that appears on the screen in that
window we will select add option as
shown we can also see the start date is
already in the entry section then in the
dialogue box that appears type tenure in
the series name and click on the range
selection icon that's shown in the
figure now select the relevant data from
the tenure column and click on okay now
we can see a bar graph that has two
colors on the screen this bar graph now
has the duration of the tasks the fourth
step we have is adding description to
the Gant chart now we will open the box
again and in that box we will select the
edit option as shown in the figure then
we will select the tasks as we had
selected the duration of the tasks
before and click on okay we can now see
the tasks have appeared towards the left
side of the Gant ch the fifth and the
remarkable step will help us convert
this bar graph into a Gant chart we will
now click on the bars and select the
format data series option from the menu
that appears then in the format data
series dialog box we will select no fill
option we can find our Gan chart on the
screen now in accordance with the data
that we had entered now we can see the
tasks on the left side are in the
reverse order so what we will do next is
we will click on the task panel then go
to the format access dialog box and
select the categories in reverse order
option now we can find our tasks in the
right order order one more thing we can
notice is Gan chart is starting with
some other date and not with the dates
that we had entered so for this we will
copy the first date in some other cell
then clicking on the copied cell we will
go to the home menu to select the dialog
box as shown in the figure then in that
drop down menu we will select the number
option we can now find a value displayed
in the copied cell we will copy that
value click on the dates on the chart
and as the format access dialog box
opens we will paste that value in the
box that says minimum show in the figure
as a result we will have our final Gan
chart on the screen in the last step we
can give several designs to a gan chart
change colors and make it more
presentable for us now when we know the
basic steps of making a Gant chart I
will show that practically to you in
Microsoft Excel our first step is to
open Microsoft Excel and in Microsoft
Excel we will make a project table in a
project table we will have three columns
the First Column will be task the second
column will have the start date the
Third column will have tenure or the
duration of the task so beginning with
tasks we have task one in task one we
have 1.1 1.2 1.3 then comes task 2 in
task 2 we have 2.1 2.2 2.3 and 2.4 then
we have task three in task three we will
have two subsections 3.1 and 3.2 then we
will start with the starting dates in
starting dates we'll put 1st January the
Task 1 1.1 will be 1st of January then
this will be 4th January let's say this
is 5th January then we will put this as
11th of January and this will be again
11th January only this will be 15th
January let's put this as 17th January
let this be 19th January task 3 begins
on 23rd January and it the 3.2 section
begins at 26th of January now let's put
the tenure or the duration of the task
we will begin with task one it takes 12
days then 1.1 takes 7 days we say this
takes 4 days and this takes 8 days then
for task two it again takes 12 days it
takes 5 days 5 days and let's say this
takes 6 days and this takes 4 days then
we come to task three this takes 8 days
and let's say this takes 6 days and the
3.2 section takes 5 days so this is how
our project table is ready in the second
step we will select the entire second
column after we have selected this
column we will go to the insert tab in
the insert tab we'll go to the bar
columns and in this we will select 2 D
stacked bar charts now we have the
entitled bar chart in accordance to our
data on the screen then comes the third
step we will add the duration of the
tasks to the bar graph we will click on
the chart and after we click on the
chart we will select select select data
option in the select data source dialog
box we find the start date is already
there now we will click on ADD and after
we click on add in the series name
section we will put tenure then in the
series value we will click on this icon
and select the entire tenor series and
click on okay so this is the bar graph
that we have now this is now in two
colors the orange color and the blue
color this bar graph now has the
duration of all the tasks in our project
table now in the fourth step now it's
time for us to add description to our
Gand chart instead of this 1 2 3 4 5 we
will put task one task two and the
subtasks so what we will do is we will
again go to that box we will left click
on the Gant chart select the select data
option and then we'll go to the start
date here we'll select the edit option
in the edit option we will select all
the tasks and click on okay now we can
see all the tasks s are aligned towards
the left of the bar chart as we can see
this is a bar chart or a bar graph and
not a gan chart the next step we have is
converting this bar graph into a Gant
chart so we will click on the bars and
select the format data series option
from the menu that appears here we have
this format data series option now we
can see the dialog box on the screen
here we'll go into the color section
fill section and then we will select no
fill now we can see the blue lines have
disappeared so this looks like a gan
chart so now when we have a gan chart on
the screen we can notice that the tasks
here are in the reverse order so what we
will do is we will click on these tasks
and select the format X as option here
we'll select categories in reverse order
we can see our G chart is now in order
like we have our task one on the top and
task three at the bottom the dates are
starting from 11th of December but the
dates we have have provided are from 1st
of January now we will copy this cell
then go on the dates box here we'll go
to format access in the format access we
can see minimum in this minimum we will
paste this value and press enter as we
press enter we can see our Gan chart
starting from the date that we wanted to
start and that to in the correct order
starting from task one to task three now
as a result we have our final g chart on
the screen in the last step what we can
do is make our Gand chart more
representable we can change the color of
These Bars we can give them shapes and
we can do many other things to make it
more presentable we will first select
the bars like what we will do is we will
select task one and let's say we give it
the color blue then task two we will
give it color green and in task three
we'll give it give it the color black so
here the subsections will give different
colors to the subsections as well then
we come to task two .1 this is how we
can change the color of these cells or
apart from changing colors we can select
a bar graph and do the gradient fill so
this is how we can make a gan chart more
presentable after changing the colors or
changing the shapes we have our final
Gan chart on the screen finally let's
have a look at some Microsoft Excel
templates for project management
Microsoft Excel templates help in
collecting data putting them into order
and check the dependencies with each
other with the help of these templates
we can monit the status of the tasks and
we can also check the progress our
project has made moving forth we will
check some important Microsoft Excel
templates the first template we have is
Excel project review template this
template helps us have an overview of
the project we can have a clear
understanding of all the tasks that are
planned and that are completed this
helps project managers to measure the
progress of the project and take further
steps accordingly second template we
will check is Excel budget template in
this template we can monitor all the
expenditures of our project it helps us
in managing the budget of a project and
also helps in comparing the budget of a
project at different phases let's have a
look at the budget template in Excel on
we can download this template from
Office timeline.com the Gant chart
towards the right is in accordance with
the dates towards the left if we
fluctuate the date we can see the
template working the start date for task
one could be changed to 10th June if we
change this date to 10th June we can see
the fluctuation in the Gant chart so
this is how we can use this template
directly let's have a look at the third
template now third template we will see
is Excel Sprint Project tracker template
this template is used majorly in agile
projects where the project is made in
several Sprints or sessions this
template includes the start date the end
date and the duration of each task we
can also see the percentage completed of
each task let's have a look at this
Sprint Project tracker template as well
we can see the Gan chart towards the
right and the data towards the left so
if we change any data we can see the
Gant chart changing for example we can
change the data in Sprint 2 feature 3
let's change the start date to July 2nd
we can see the Gand chart changing this
is how we can use this template directly
to track our sessions let's have a look
at the fourth Excel template this
template is Excel project tracker in
this template we have the data of all
the tasks with the status and owners we
can track the percentage of tasks
completed and also compare the planed
duration of the task to the actual
duration of the task after the critical
part tracker let let's check the Excel
project schedule template this template
helps in effective management of the
project as it helps in monitoring the
time that each task of the project takes
it provides a clear view of all the work
associated with the project let's have a
look at this template in Excel on we can
see the Gan chart in accordance to the
data if we change the estimated as at
two places let's say at the design
review we make it 15 hours instead of 5
hours and at the create Staffing plan we
make it 2 hours instead of 20s we can
see the Gant chart fluctuating this is
how we can use this template to manage
the schedule in a project moving forward
the next template we will see is Excel
project status report template this
template helps us having a list of
project deliverables and the risks
associated with that project this
template helps the project managers
about different crucial activities
involved in a project after this we have
Excel Milestone tracker the Milestone
tracker helps us in tracking or
monitoring different tasks in a project
project manager use this template to
monitor the project performance with
respect to the timelines the last
template we will see is Excel project
planner Excel project planner includes a
list of task with the respected owners
along with the start date and the end
date of that task this helps in
monitoring each task and comparing the
estimated task St with the actual ones
let's have a look at this template in
Excel we can see the Gan chart with
respect to the data entered let's make
changes at several places in the data we
can make this 22 to 24 we will make this
23 go to 2 and we can make this 5th
September go to 15th September and when
we make the changes we can realize the
Gant chart is fluctuating so this is how
we can use this template to plan a
project effectively and efficiently so
first let's understand what exactly is M
report in
Excel so Mis stands for management
information system Mis reports provide
data on different categories for
accurate decision making so Mis in Excel
is a procedure to create interactive
report using Microsoft Excel so Mis
reports help management to access the
performance of organization and allow
faster decision- making so if you know
to create the Mis reports using various
business intelligence tools such as
Excel then you might find a very good
job opportunity in a well established
company now let us try to learn how to
create Mis report using Excel in a
practical mode so let's get back to the
Microsoft Excel IF getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit skill up by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so here you can
see that I've got some sales data of
various car manufacturing companies and
I've also got some slices so using these
slices I can get the real-time
information from the dashboard so I'll
select an ear from the first slicer and
I'll go into the second slicer and I'll
select a company now I'll select BMW and
SUV type so we have the data of all the
SUV types cars manufactured by BMW car
manufacturing company in the year 2018
now let's start and create something
similar to this
one so how did I create this mis report
let's go through this in a step-by-step
way so on my screen you can see that we
have created a completely new Excel
workbook and we have some sample data
with five rows and 20 columns so this
particular data is based on the
manufacturer year and the car
manufacturing company and the type of
the car manufactured and number of cars
manufactured in that particular year and
also the price of that particular car
now to create Mis reports we need to
play around fav tables so we also have
tutorials on fav tables and you can go
through that in our simply learn YouTube
channel and also we will try to link
those in the description box below
now let's select the entire data and go
into the insert ribbon and there you can
see the first option that is pivot
table so after selecting the pivot table
option it will show this particular
dialogue box where it will ask you for
the range of cells you need to select
and the next one is to create the P
table in the same sheet or a new sheet
so we'll take a new sheet here now
select okay and there you go you have
the pivot table here so first you have
an empty pivot table and on the right
side you can see we have pivot table
Fields now you can either drag these
options into the rows and columns or you
can also click it so now let's drag and
drop these first we will select
here and
card followed by that we will take type
quantity and price to
columns so there you go we we have our
pivot table now let's select all the
data in the pivot table and again let's
get back to the insert
option and here you can see an option
called pivot chart select that and you
will have various pivot chart options
here now you can select any one which
you can prefer or which you like or
whichever you think can represent your
data in a best way possible so now let's
go with column chart first let's select
okay and we have our column chart over
here now this happens to be our first
chart now let's create a few more charts
so to create few more charts we'll go
back to the same original data select
again insert and pivot
table now again a new
worksheet so here we have another empty
PR table in the similar way let's drag
the same data into rows and columns
there you go and again we will select
all the data and create a pivot
chart go to insert option PIV chat and
now let's try to select py
chat select okay
and we have our pie chart over here now
let's try to create one more same
procedure select table select pivot
table then create new worksheet for the
new pivot table and now drag and drop
the
data now let's go to insert again
let's select all the data go to insert
option and pivot chart now let's try to
select the bar chart select okay and
there we have our bar chart now remember
the first chart we created that is in
sheet two this one so we will try to
move all the charts to this particular
table or this particular
worksheet so let's get back to the sheet
number three right click and you can see
an option called pivot chart analyze so
from here you can move the chart select
the option of moving the chart and don't
select the first one select the object
in option and select the sheet number to
which you want to move this chart for
now we want to move this chart to sheet
number two select that press okay now we
have the chart moved to the sheet number
two and in the same way let's go to the
sheet number four and let's move this
particular chart to sheet number two
there you go the chart got moved to
sheet number
two now you can insert the slices so we
have selected the third sheet or third
chart and inside the pivot chart analyze
option we have an option of inserting
the slicer now we will insert the slices
for ear car
and
type now select okay and you will have
all the three slices onto your sheet now
let's rearrange
them so I'm just a izing them in a neat
way there you
go and you can also customize your
designs for all the
charts so that they look a little more
better now if you see if I make some
changes only one chart will be
interacting for this right so if I
select Ferrari and year 2020 and option
as Sports you can see only one chart is
interacting to these particular slices
why because all these slices are
connected to just one chart here so you
need to make sure that all the slices
are connected to all the three charts
what we created so let's erase all the
filters and select one slicer at a time
right click and you will see an option
of report connections select that and
you see that the connections are only
connected to the pivot table 3 so select
the remaining pivot tables as well
select okay and in the same way select
the second slicer select the report
connection option connect pivot table
one and two and select okay and in the
same way the third
one so now all the slices are connected
to all the pivot charts now if you make
some changes here they will respond
automatically in the same way now let's
select the for company the year 2019 and
hashack option and you have all the cars
which were made in the year 2019 from
Ford Company in the segment of
hashack so this was the sample data set
that we worked on now you can also work
on some complex data set such as this
Superstore data
set now one thing you need to make sure
that when you're working with Excel Mis
they need you need to make sure that all
the macros are disabled on your data set
and you convert the entire data into the
regular table format of excel right now
Excel is considering this particular
data as a database so for that you need
to select all the data press control T
and then convert the entire data in the
form of tabular data and also don't
forget to click this icon which reads my
table has headers so the first row is
the headers now let's select okay and
your entire data will be converted into
tabular form now let's reset this to the
normal type which has the clear color
not all the fancy colors now the entire
data is converted from the dbms to the
Tet form and with that we have reached
