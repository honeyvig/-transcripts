welcome back to our simply learn YouTube
channel in this video we are going to
discuss an essential tool for any
developer or data science that is
virtual environment and before
proceeding I have an insight for you
guys if you are aiming to get certified
as an AI and ml engineer and want to
build a career in AI in that case you
can check the professional certificate
program in Ai and machine learning that
is in collaboration with IBM and Purdue
University by simply alert which will
open the doors for the best career
opportunities and to find the details of
this professional certificate program in
Ai and machine learning you can check
the link in the description box below
and the pin comment and now let us have
a simple question to brush upon our
knowledge
and your question is what command turns
on a virtual environment and your
options are the first option is Source
script slash activate and the second
option is python minus M way environment
virtual environment and the name of the
folder and the third option is Source
virtual slash scripts slash activate OD
all of the above please answer in the
comment section below and we'll update
the correct answer in the pin comment
you can pause the video give it a
thought and answer in the comment
section
now moving on to our topic that is
virtual environment most python projects
have dependencies that we installed and
use for example we use flask for web
applications and we use these libraries
returned and tested by many developers
so you don't have to write them again
these libraries change over time
they get new functionalities and Bug
fixes with some newer versions for
example let's say you are a python
developer working on two different
projects and each project has different
package requirements project a requires
flask 2.0 version while Project B
requires flask version 2.2 you cannot
have both versions stored globally on
your system because they will conflict
with each other and you might break one
or both of these projects this is where
virtual environment comes in handy and
now we'll see what is a virtual
environment
virtual environments are isolated
environments that allow developers to
work on multiple projects with different
dependencies without conflicts this is
crucial when working on multiple
projects simultaneously especially those
with different dependencies because the
virtual environment ensures that each
project has its own set of dependencies
that will not conflict with those of
other projects in Python virtual
environments are created using the
built-in virtual environment module
which creates a directory with a
specific structure that contains a copy
of the Python interpreter as well as
other necessary files every virtual
environment has a python version and a
folder of third-party libraries that you
will install for a particular project
python libraries are frequently updated
with new versions that include bug fixes
new features and performance
improvements upgrading a library to a
newer version can have various effects
on a virtual environment in general it
is a good practice to keep libraries
updated to the latest version but it is
also important to consider the impact on
the virtual environment and the
application before upgrading it is
recommended to test the upgraded library
in a separate environment before making
changes to the production environment
this can help to identify any potential
issues and ensure a smooth upgrade
process if we update the library maybe a
should not work as the functionalities
would have been changed with the update
now we'll see why do you need a virtual
environment if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit skillup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more
when you installed packages globally you
run the risk of breaking other projects
or application that rely on the same
packages virtual environment provides a
solution to this problem by creating an
isolated environment for a project that
doesn't interfere with your system
environment now we'll see a Hands-On
demonstration to create a virtual
environment on our system so for that we
will go to our projects folder and
inside here we will create a folder and
name it as virtual environment
so inside this folder first we'll open
the command prompt
so creating a virtual environment is a
straightforward process will demonstrate
how to create a virtual environment
using Python's built-in module that is
virtual environment
and we have opened the command prompt
and navigated into a folder that we have
created that is virtual environment I
will write a command that would be
python minus m
the name of the
module virtual environment and now we'll
write the name of a folder we want to
create
so we'll press enter and
now
we'll see that we have a directory here
that is with the name my environment
once the command gets executed
successfully we'll have a new directory
that is
my environment but we have made
now we have to activate our virtual
environment first we'll do that but
before that
what we can see is in the script section
we have
pip and the python files here that is
the python.exe file that is application
file web file so we have Python's
version installed here
so if we ask
the command prompt what version is
installed in our virtual environment
will ask him
it says 3.10.2 but it's the global
python that is
command prompt is showing
so first we have to activate the virtual
environment and after that it will show
us what python version is installed in
Dua environment so to activate our
virtual environment we will write a
command that is the path we will write
and this is for the windows for that
we'll write
the name of the folder my environment
slash you have seen the scripts folder
slash and then we have
activate
and now we'll press enter
you can see my environment folder in
Brackets this shows that a virtual
environment is active now now if we ask
him what is the python version that is
installed inside our virtual environment
it says that is 3.10.2
so we have the global installed python
version that is 3.10.2 and in a virtual
environment it's also
3.10.2 and we have a command to
deactivate
our virtual environment that is
deactivate so it has been deactivated
that is you can see that my environment
from the circular brackets it has been
managed now we'll check what packages
are installed into our system
so now we are in the global system
for that we'll write pip
phrase and press enter
so you can see these old packages are
installed into a global environment
system
these are many packages
so you can see these are the packages
that are installed
we'll get back to our virtual
environment and activate it
so to activate it we will get into the
folder slash Scripts
slash activate
and press enter you can see that our
virtual environment is active now
and now in here write the command with
freeze and see what packages are
installed it says no packages are
installed into a
virtual environment
so here we will install
Django
pip install Django and press enter
so you could see that it has started
installing it
and it is installing 4.1.7 version
now you have seen that Django is
installed into a system now you can work
on any Project without worrying about
any package that conflict with other
projects like if you name this as
project a then the Django is installed
into this project and if you want to
work on Project B then you need to
create another virtual environment for
it using the same virtual environment
command just above and you can work on
Project B without worrying about any
package conflicts or breaking project to
deactivate we have seen that we can just
write deactivate and the virtual
environment would be deactivated so now
if you want to give a particular project
to another person for that you have to
ask him to install all the particular
version of the packages so to find all
the packages installed into an
environment I've seen the command pip
freeze it has shown us all the packages
that were installed into a the system
environment or the global environment
now we'll write a command to see what
packages
are installed in our virtual environment
so for that you could use the previous
command prompt or we could just have a
new command prompt here and here we have
to activate a virtual environment again
as we are not able to see the name of
the virtual environment in circular
brackets so for that we'll write
the name of the
directory then scripts and then activate
now you can see
our virtual event is active
now I'll write the command pip freeze
and it has shared us all the
packages that are installed into our
system and these are the packages that
are installed with the Django package
so now if you want to share a particular
project with another person then you
have to
create a file that would be
requirements.txt file and you have to
write all the
projects with the version names
installed for your project so for that
we will write the command pip freeze and
the greater than sign and then we will
write
requirements Dot
txt and press enter
so what this will do is it will create a
file requirements.txt and it will get
filled with all the packages with the
particular and respective versions so
you can share this file to a particular
person and the particular person can
install all the packages just by a
single command so what command he could
write as pip
install minus r
then
the requirements
Dot txt
so it's Dot txt
and press enter
so you could see that the requirement is
already satisfied as in this virtual
environment we have the Django installed
and with the Django these are the other
packages that will be installed
automatically
so the particular person has to run the
Quant pip install minus r
requirements.txt and all the packages
with the particular versions that are
mentioned in the requirements.txt file
will be installed for him that's it for
today's video we hope you find
