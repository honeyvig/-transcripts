1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
how do I learn to code this sounds like

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,910
a very basic question but when you start

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,880
exploring and you ask yourself how do I

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,960
learn to code

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,450
you start to realize it's actually not

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,490
very straightforward as a matter of fact

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,670
it's just the tip of the iceberg for so

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,590
many years people would come to me and

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,170
ask questions like how can I make my own

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,109
apps how can I learn to program or how

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,090
can I get into the world of technology

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,689
this is why I wrote my book hello Swift

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,540
it's my journey of learning how to code

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,750
in book form and I wrote it keeping in

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,899
mind beginners of all ages it's the

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,170
perfect combination of science

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,090
technology and mathematics working

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,090
towards better steam learning my goal

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,579
through hello Swift is not just to teach

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,320
the syntax of a programming language

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,660
because that's not what development is

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,879
all about development is about

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,280
leveraging computational thinking in

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,469
order to use the fundamental building

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,260
blocks that computers provide in order

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,500
to solve problems since I've had very

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,939
little coding experience

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,920
hello Swift helped me to think like a

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,310
programmer it really had to focus on the

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,680
kid so the way the way the child would

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,290
learn it really tuned its teaching

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,150
towards that so it didn't use high

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,710
language and it didn't use things the

34
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,119
kid wouldn't understand it made it fun

35
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,040
and it made it interactive so that they

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,560
could actually become more and more

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,329
excited as they read the book I believe

38
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,270
that everyone can code as long as you

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,420
believe if your learning language and

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,100
simple counting and simple geography

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,960
straight from when you're four years old

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,290
then why not code we shouldn't be

43
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,990
treating code as this exotic and next to

44
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,630
unachievable subject it's just another

45
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,240
thing to learn so you're prepared for

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,840
the future

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,570
hello Swift is a perfect example of the

48
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,540
way I believe everyone should learn you

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,719
should start small start easy and of

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,899
course start playful thank you can they
