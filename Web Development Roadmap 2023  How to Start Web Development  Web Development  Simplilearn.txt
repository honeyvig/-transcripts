in 2010 there were over 2 billion
internet users and this number doubled
in 2022 with over 5.07 billion internet
users currently according to the U.S
Bureau of Labor Statistics the
employment of web developers is
projected to grow by eight percent from
2019 to 2029 much faster than the
average for all occupations
this data demonstrates the Unstoppable
demand of web developers worldwide in
the current IT industry
many people are motivated to concentrate
and become experts in web programming
languages that can help them learn their
ideal career because of the sheer demand
of web developers across the world yet
only some know how to rule the field and
secure a position with the tech Giants
now that's the topic for discussion
today hello everyone and you are already
watching simply love here we are with
the complete roadmap to become a web
developer in 2023 before we start if you
guys enjoy watching these videos and if

web development
web development is a branch of computer
science that deals with creating and
maintaining a website or a web
application
every website you come across is a mix
of certain methodologies a website is
generally divided into three parts front
end the section that is visible to you
backend the website section is not
accessible to the user database where
all the data of the website is stored a
web developer not only creates the
website but also ensures that the
website should not face any issues right
after the deployment before moving on to
the job profiles it's important to
understand the different fields of web
development web development is further
divided into three parts front-end web
development back-end web development and
full stack map development front-end web
development front-end development is the
branch of web development that
concentrates on user experience the main
motive of the front end is to ensure
that the data is presented in an
understandable and Visually appealing
manner without front-end development you
would see incomprehensible codes on a
website or web application but thanks to
front-end developments loan programmers
can easily use and comprehend websites
and web applications
so how to become a front-end developer
and what technologies do you need to
master to call yourself a full-fledged
front-end web developer the first step
to becoming a front-end developer is to
find yourself a technology that is easy
to understand
many Technologies are present in the
area but which one should you choose
HTML creates the structure of a web page
it shows how the content should be
placed on a web page CSS is used to
style the web page because it's
important to make it look more appealing
to them JavaScript for them adds
interactivity to any web page it can
help you create a dynamically active web
page by adding elements to engage the
user once you learn JavaScript for logic
building as well generally these three
Technologies HTML CSS and JavaScript are
enough to create the basic front end of
any web page you can work on projects
like creating a calculator app an
e-commerce website or even a model game
using JavaScript you can take reference
from the videos mentioned in the
description box below create one of your
own bootstrap is another front-end
technology that is not necessary to
learn but always adds to your skills a
framework based on CSS and JavaScript it
is used to make a web page more
interactive and mobile friendly as well
JavaScript Frameworks like react angular
View and jQuery are also used for
front-end web development it depends on
the learner if they want to pick one or
all of the Frameworks I would suggest
you to go for react as it is the most
widely used JavaScript framework however
some professional developers prefer
view.js because of its ease of use now
these are all the Technologies you need
to master for front-end web development
but possessing the knowledge of any
additional website deployment tool can
act as the cherry on top while applying
furniture
netlify and virtual are free deployment
tools to take your application online it
is rightly said that you can Master a
language only by programming so projects
also play a vital role while you go
through the learning process you can
create Facebook or a YouTube clone with
the help of react.js the link mentioned
in the description box below for the
same so this is what the proper roadmap
for front-end development looks like
what about the salary of a front-end web
developer according to glassdo the
salary of a front-end developer in the
United States ranges between fifty
thousand dollars to hundred thousand
dollars with an average salary of
seventy six thousand dollars per annum
with additional benefits next comes
back-end web development
back-end development the backbone of web
architecture is the term used to
describe tasks carried out while
executing programs on the web back-end
development handles the server-side
functionalities and activities like
designing apis creating libraries and
working with system components since the
backend makes an API call and the server
side rendering is handled entirely by
the backend functions designed to
perform specific tasks the skills
required in back-end web development
differ from what we came across in front
the first step to entering the back end
is understanding the concept of web
servers web server manages websites and
responds to user requests by storing
processing and delivering online pages
when a web server receives a request
from a user an HTTP server accepts it
and finds and Returns the requested
material to the browser using HTTP open
source platforms that distribute content
in response to queries include web
servers like Apache and ngis the next
step in backend web development requires
knowledge of programming languages
additionally Frameworks are collections
of libraries that simplify and
facilitate programming although many
programming languages are available only
a few are frequently advised for backend
web development node.js is a JavaScript
framework used for backend API services
the power provided by node.js and the
beauty of JavaScript can be used
together to create the back end of a web
page python engine python is the most
user friendly programming language and
when combined with Django it makes a
fantastic website building too PHP with
learn PHP is a quick adaptable and
practical language that runs the most
well-known websites and looks laravel
and PHP can work on the back end of a
web page as well now it depends on you
to choose the technology set out of
these Technologies to get data from a
database a back-end developer writes
code that does the relational mapping my
sequel SQL Server goes to a sequel
mongodb and Oracle database are the most
popular database Management Systems you
must be quite familiar with how they
operate using a version control system
is the best practice because it allows
you to alter the source code whenever
you want rapidly get a free and open
source Version Control System may be the
ideal option due to its secured
adaptable and simple to edit
characteristics two apps can communicate
with one another thanks to apis which
serve as software mediators back-end
developers utilize apis to connect
services or applications and start
conversations to enhance user experience
you should be familiar with some apis
like rest Json soap and Json the list
goes on but you can start with any one
of your choice everything including
software application services and
products is moving towards cloud
services
a back-end developer should know what
clouds are and how to use mostly use
cloud services are Google Cloud Amazon
web services and Microsoft Azure so you
can pick one of these cloud services and
then you'll be ready to become a
back-end developer you can practice for
projects particularly related to any
language like pH
you can also learn how Python and Django
are used for web development refer to
the videos mentioned in the description
box below these videos are specifically
designed to make you guys understand the
basics of backend web development so
what salary can you expect after
learning back-end web development
according to glassdo the salary of a
back-end developer in the United States
ranges between forty six thousand
dollars two hundred thousand dollars
with an average salary of eighty
thousand dollars per annum with
additional benefits a little about
front-end development of course the
learning path for back-end developers is
slightly harder than the front
now coming to full stack web development
they are individuals capable of
developing a website's front-end and
backend full stack technology refers to
the total depth of a web application
there's no special technology related to
full stack development a full stack
developer should know about every
technique there is no shortcut for this
you should know Technologies like HTML
CSS JavaScript followed by any framework
and back-end Technologies like node.js
PHP and many additionally a full stack
web developer should know databases apis
and almost everything they have the
expertise to handle any tasks including
customer interaction system engineering
database management server
Administration and architecture you
cannot follow a specific roadmap to
become a full stack developer if you are
done with both front-end and back-end
congrats you are good enough to call
yourself a full stack web developer
reports from glassdoor.com have shown
that a full stack developer in the
United States earns between 50 thousand
dollars to one hundred and twenty five
thousand dollars per annum with
additional cash benefits the salary of a
full stack developer makes you apply for
a job but the learning curve is also
steep everyone could Master the
programming languages we discussed for
different job rules today but the real
deal is to implement your learners as
you enter an interview picture yourself
stating I have a respectable portfolio
of projects I learned about the
company's future endeavors which aligned
with my goods now who could possibly
reject that right in particular
businesses that want to think creatively
and break convention to create something
remarkable will never say no to such
candidates web development is a vast
form and the future looks promising now
more than so if you are looking to
upskill yourself and I know that you are
