dealing with hoards of customer data is
part and parcel of business management
meet joe who runs a consultancy firm
from the leads generated by the
marketing team to the personal
information handled by the sales team
juggling so much data needs an efficient
system joe was in a similar predicament
the rapid influx of leads proper
delegation of client duties to his team
and customer retention post service
all of these duties were making joe
lou's sleep due to overworking have you
ever wondered how companies like amazon
and google can maneuver such
complications with ease kevin joe's
friend introduced the concept of crm
systems to joe in order to help him
manage the company's day-to-day
activities
crm platforms help in streamlining this
process which ultimately leads to better
management of company resources
increased revenue and higher customer
satisfaction
but joe wanted to understand first
what is crm
crm which stands for customer
relationship management refers to any
business development customer retention
and customer acquisition strategies
techniques systems and technologies
the objective is to strengthen
interactions with customers in order to
promote client retention and increase
sales
crm systems gather information on
customers from various points of contact
between them and the business such as
the company's website the company phone
line web chat email marketing content
and social media crm systems may also
provide staff workers who deal with
consumers with in-depth knowledge of
their personal data purchasing history
shopping preferences and challenges
the best thing about a crm system is
that it can be used by virtually every
organizational unit from sales and
customer service to hiring marketing and
corporate development
a better approach to handling external
interactions is the crux of crm
platforms
joe like kevin can use the crm platform
to centralize all customer data track
service issues located potential clients
and manage marketing campaigns
it will help joe's team access data much
faster and collaboration will become
very smooth leading to increased
productivity
crm platforms can serve companies of all
sizes from small startups to
multinational corporations
kevin's own startup uses a crm platform
that utilizes cloud computing also
referred to as sas software as a service
or on-demand crm and stores data on an
external remote network that employees
can access whenever they need to
businesses with little technological
know-how or resources are drawn to the
cloud's speedy comparatively simple
deployment possibilities
joe wanted to know how crm platforms
streamlined back in operations which
kevin clarified gladly back-end
processes like manufacturing warehousing
shipping engineering or finance are not
intended to be assisted by crms
naturally crm technologies cannot
control what they are unable to observe
therefore it reduces the efficacy of the
system for the entire team if employees
work leads or transactions outside of it
some crm applications are simply used
for data management to help
entrepreneurs like joe and kevin run
their complete business more
successfully an all-in-one crm system
also provides crucial functions like
landing pages quotations and invoicing
joe was still not convinced which led
kevin to explain how his startup
benefits from their crm platform
one
all of kevin's contacts are managed by a
crm which also collects crucial customer
data like demographics purchase
histories and prior communications
across all channels
and makes it readily available to
anybody in this organization who needs
it
this guarantees that kevin's staff has
all the information they want about the
client at their fingertips and can offer
a better customer experience which
usually increases client satisfaction
two
by streamlining kevin's sales process
creating a sales funnel automating
crucial processes and gathering all of
your data in one location
a crm platform may help him boost
productivity and sales performance
three
crm software often includes analytical
features that contextualize data
dividing it into useful metrics and
actionable things
kevin may assess the performance of a
marketing strategy and adjust his
optimization strategies using metrics
like click-through rates churn rate and
demographic data
four
one more thing that crm software excels
at is creating a single database that
houses all of kevin's company's client
information and makes it readily
available to anyone who needs it
this improves and increases the client
experience while saving a staff time
from having to go through outdated files
and information
five
kevin may see important trends and gain
a sense of what to anticipate from his
future sales cycle performance with the
automated sales reports and crm software
he can then modify his goals and targets
to fit these estimates
crms automate operations like contact
communication and collaboration so joe's
team's daily tasks and procedures will
move much more quickly thanks to the
software the crm can also minimize
mistakes and guarantee that all
communications are sent to the
appropriate recipients at the
appropriate times
thanks to kevin's guidance joe can now
focus on the important aspects of
running a business rather than manage
the nitty gritty details on a logistical
level
