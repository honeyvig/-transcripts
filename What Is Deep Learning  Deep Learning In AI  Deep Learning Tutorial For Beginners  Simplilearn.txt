quick info for you if you want to learn
AI ml from the industry expert try a
simply learn postgraduate program in Ai
and machine learning from P University
in collaboration with
this score teaches in demand skills such
as machine learning deep learning NLP
compter Vision reinforcement learning
generative AI prompt engering chat GPT
and many more so don't forget to check
out the course link from the description
box below and the pin command so without
any further Ado let's get started so
what is deep learning deep learning is a
subset of machine learning which itself
is a branch of artificial intelligence
unlike traditional machine learning
models which require manual feature
extraction deep learning models
automatically discovers representation
from raw data so this is made possible
through neural networks particularly
deep neural networks which consist of
multiple layers of interconnected nodes
so these neural network are inspired by
the structure and the function of human
brain each layer in the network
transform the input data into more
abstract and composite representation
for instance in image recognition the
initial layer might detect simple
features like edges and textures while
the deeper layer recognizes more complex
structure like shape shapes and objects
so one of the key advantage of deep
learning is its ability to handle large
amount of unstructured data such as
images audios and text making it
extremely powerful for various
application so stay tuned as we delve
deeper into how these neural networks
are trained the types of deep learning
models and some exciting application
that are shaping our future types of
deep learning deep learning AI can be
applied supervised unsupervised and
reinforcement machine learning using
various methods for each the first one
supervised machine learning in
supervised learning the neural network
learns to make prediction or classify
that data using label data sets both
input features and Target variables are
provided and the network learns by
minimizing the error between its
prediction and the actual targets a
process called back propagation CNN and
RNN are the common deep learning
algorithms used for tasks like image
classification sentiment analysis and
language translation the second one
unsupervised machine learning in
unsupervised machine learning the neural
network discovers Ms or cluster in
unlabeled data sets without Target
variables it identifies hidden pattern
or relationship within the data
algorithms like Auto encoders and
generative models are used for tasks
such as clustering dimensionality
reduction and anomaly detection the
third one reinforcement machine learning
in this an agent learns to make decision
in an environment to maximize a reward
signal the agent takes action observes
the records and learns policies to
maximize cumulative rewards over time
deep reinforement learning algorithms
like deep Q networks and deep
deterministic poly gradient are used for
tasks such as Robotics and gameplay
moving forward let's see what are the
artificial neural networks artificial
neural networks Ann inspired by the
structure and the function of human
neurons consist of interconnected layers
of artificial neurals or units the input
layer receives data from the external
resources and it passes to one or more
hidden layers each neuron in these
layers computes a weighted sum of inputs
and transfer the result to the next
layer during training the weight of
these connection are adjusted to
optimize the Network's performance a
fully connected artificial neural
network includes an input layer or more
hidden layers and an output layer each
neuron in a hidden layer receives input
from the previous layer and sends its
outp to the next layer so this process
continues until the final output layer
produce the network response so moving
forward let's see types of neural
networks so deep learning models can
automatically learn featur from data
making them ideal to tasks like image
recognition speech recognition and
natural language processing so the most
common architecture and deep learnings
are the first one feed foral neural
network fnn so these are the simplest
type of neural network where information
flows linear ly from the input to the
output they are widely used for tasks
such as image classification speech
recognition and natural Lang processing
NLP the second one convolutional neural
network designed specifically for image
and video recognition CNN automatically
learn feature from images making them
ideal for image classification object
detection and image segmentation the
third one recurrent neural networks RNN
are specialized for processing
sequential data Time series and natural
language they maintain and internal
state to capture information from
previous input making them suitable for
task such as a spe recognition NLP and
language translation so now let's move
forward and see some deep learning
application the first one is autonomous
vle deep learning is changing the
development of self-driving car
algorithms like CNS process data from
sensors and cameras to detect object
recognize traffic signs and make driving
decision in real time enhancing safety
and effic efficiency on the road the
second one is Healthcare diagnostic deep
learning models are being used to
analyze medical images such as x-rays
MRIs and CT scans with high accuracy
they help in early detection and
diagnosis of diseases like cancer
improving treatment outcomes and saving
lives the third one is NLP recent
advancement in NLP powered by Deep
learning models like Transformer chat
GPT have led to more sophisticated and
humanik text generation translation and
S sentiment analysis so application
include virtual assistant chat Bots and
automated customer service the fourth
one defect technology so deep learning
techniques are used to create highly
realistic synthetic media known as def
fix while this technology has
entertainment and creative application
it also raises ethical concern regarding
misinformation and digital manipulation
the fifth one predictive maintenance in
Industries like manufacturing and
Aviation deep learning models predict
equipment failures before they occur by
analyzing sensor data the proactive
approach reduces downtime lowers
maintenance cost and improves
operational efficiency so now let's move
forward and see some advantages and
disadvantages of deep learning so first
one is high computational requirements
so deep learning requires significant
data and computational resources for
training whereas Advantage is high
accuracy achieves a state-of-the-art
performance in tasks like image
recognition and natural langage
processing whereas deep learning needs
large label data sets often require
extensive label data set for training
which can be costly and time consuming
together so second advantage of deep
learning is automated feature
engineering automatically discovers and
learn relevant features from data
without manual intervention the third
disadvantage is
overfitting so deep planning can overfit
to training data leading to poor
performance on new unseen data whereas
the Third deepar learning Advantage is
scalability so deep learning can handle
large complex data set and learn from
massive amount of data so in conclusion
deep learning is a transformative leap
in AI mimicking human neural networks it
has changed healthare Finance autonomous
vehicles and NLP so with this we have
