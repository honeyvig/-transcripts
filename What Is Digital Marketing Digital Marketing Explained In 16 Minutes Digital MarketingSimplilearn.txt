in simple words digital marketing is the
promotion of a product or a brand
through one or more forms of electronic
media such as internet mobile phones
google search engine marketing etc it's
a way to reach client on time and retain
them with interactive marketing using
digital technologies also it is the most
accessible easy to use and contemporary
method of promotion which is also known
as online marketing
so now we have a clear understanding of
what digital marketing is we also need
to acknowledge that it has several
components and understanding each is
essential so let's jump into the
different components of digital
marketing
seo seo stands for search engine
optimization seo is the act of taking
steps to help a website or a piece of
content get higher ranking on google
moreover seo includes organic rankings
which means you do not have to pay to
appear there
up next we have ppc ppc stands for
pay-per-click it includes paid
advertisements and promoted search
engine results
it does the same thing as seo but the
key difference is that it's inorganic so
you have to pay to be in that space the
next component is social media marketing
social media marketing is a form of
internet marketing that uses social
media apps as a marketing tool brands
can communicate with their audience
using social media platforms whether
they are building a brand increasing
sales driving traffic to our website or
building followers to share and engage
with the content
next we have content marketing content
marketing aims to increase brand
awareness by telling stories and sharing
information ultimately the goal is to
encourage leaders to become customers by
signing up for an email list asking for
more information or making a purchase
email marketing involves sending
promotional messages to many people at
once in most cases it's used to generate
lead for sales but it can also include
advertising
the next component that we will be
discussing is affiliate marketing
affiliate marketing is a component of
marketing in which one person promotes
another company's or person's product a
person who promotes a product or service
is called an affiliate and the affiliate
also gets a certain amount of commission
up next we have mobile marketing with
this type of digital marketing you will
reach your target audience on the
smartphones mobile marketing reaches
people through text messages social
media websites emails and mobile
applications
now we are on to our last component
which is influencer marketing
influencer marketing involves promoting
your product through mentions and
endorsement from influencers
individuals who have a dedicated
following on social media are seen as
industry experts
now let's have a look at the business
models in digital marketing
b2b which means business to business
b2b refers to business transaction
between two companies in the world of
b2b digital marketing is a crucial
element
through a digital market campaign we can
reach another company's decision maker
one of the best example is linkedin
advertising which many b2b companies use
to target their potential customers
next we have b2c which is business to
consumer
b2c refers to business transactions
between business to consumer b2c digital
marketing allows you to reach out
directly to your potential customers
using digital channels
as we know millions of people are using
internet and are active on digital
channels for example using facebook ads
and google ads you can directly target
consumers by their age group interest
location etc
and the final one is c2c which is
consumer to consumer
c2c refers to a business transaction
between consumers nowadays consumers are
using social media platforms and
intermediaries to market their products
and services as a result they can reach
a wider audience for example olx serves
as an intermediary by allowing
individuals to list their products and
services for sale and other individual
can purchase them
now let's look into digital marketing
versus traditional marketing
several new and old businesses are
harnessing digital marketing and
rethinking their marketing funnels in
the age of digital marketing a digital
revolution has reshaped how we live
interact and conduct businesses
traditional marketing seems to be losing
its relevance in today's era of
technology knowing which marketing
method will work best for your business
is essential
traditional marketing methods such as
printing material radio and television
are quickly becoming outdated they are
too expensive ineffective and time
consuming however digital marketing is
the future of advertising now let's talk
about a few reasons why digital
marketing is a better choice than
traditional marketing
firstly there is a global reach a
website that allows you to find a new
market and trade globally for only a
small investment
lower cost a properly planned and well
targeted digital marketing campaign can
reach the right customers at a much
lower cost than traditional marketing
methods
the next benefit is analytics several
tools are available to analyze and
report on marketing data collected
through digital channels and the data is
precious to any business
now we are on to our last benefit which
is retargeting suppose we have a website
that sells shoes and hundred people
visit our website but only two purchase
the item
with the help of digital marketing we
can still target those 98 visitors and
display our ads to them
people used to rely on traditional
marketing before digital marketing
traditional marketing is nothing new as
we have all seen and heard of it at some
point
it is an effective way to reach a
particular audience via offline methods
such as magazines newspaper billboards
etc traditional marketing has its
challenges such as time consuming a
limited number of customers served in
one go and a high cost similarly digital
marketing has its own challenges
now let's look into the challenges in
digital marketing learning about your
customers the internet has lot of users
with lot of different interest which
makes identifying the right sort of
audience for your product and service
challenging at times the next challenge
is the generation of qualified leads in
a competitive market the digital
revolution has resulted in businesses
using digital marketing but sometimes it
becomes challenging to compete against
your competitors
next is compliance with privacy and data
sharing regulations
most people have their own website which
can attract visitors from anywhere in
the world
ensure that you are compliant with any
laws that apply to your target audience
up next we have developing an
omni-channel marketing strategy
multi-device and multi-platform use are
increasing among customers the days of
relying solely on a single strategy like
email or facebook are over
your strategy must be based on multiple
platforms
staying up to date with google's
algorithm the digital empire of google
continues to grow to compete you need to
stay up to date with the latest features
rules and algorithms released by this
giant search engine
now we are on to our last challenge
developing a mobile first strategy
the number of people browsing and
shopping from smartphones and tablets
has increased if somebody wants to
capture a share of ever spending mobile
market
they must ensure that their website is
mobile friendly
