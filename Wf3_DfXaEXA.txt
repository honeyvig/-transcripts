1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,040
so welcome back to part three of the

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,400
Drone series uh and of course this time

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,119
is an extension of part two with my

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,600
mentor from IBM Marcus van kempen uh and

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,960
today we're going to be showing you how

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,560
you can instead of just using a

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,000
dashboard online to control the Drone

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,759
you can use a car dashboard which was a

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,760
sort of default example of Watson

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,960
conversation to actually use a drone so

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,480
you can literally Converse uh with a bot

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,960
and have it control the Drone for you

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,399
let's begin shall we so now to begin let

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
me explain sort of work here's a here's

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
a high level overview from from from our

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,399
scenario and you jump into more details

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,280
now yeah so essentially uh we have a few

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,760
components here so to begin we of course

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,719
have our Watson car dashboard so I'm

20
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,680
going to write here we have the Watson

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,799
car dashboard right this is one of our

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,960
components uh and of course we have more

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,159
Watson services for example Watson

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,840
conversation uh so I'm just going to

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
call this

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,200
conversation all right so that's one

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,119
more of our modules I guess you could

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,320
say we also have speech to text and text

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
to

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,119
speech so these are all of our wats

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,880
components that do most of the

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,399
conversing converting your speech to

33
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,600
text converting the text of the IB Moon

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,560
conversation to speech and all of that

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,640
sort of stuff and of course the Watson

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
uh car

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,640
dashboard uh now of course we do have

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,520
our node red

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,399
end we also of course do have our

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,119
Raspberry Pi which I'm just going to

41
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,360
call Pi for now and we of course have

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,840
our drone

43
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,759
all right so this is our drone uh so now

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,600
essentially how does this work uh what

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,879
we're going to do is let's say you talk

46
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,280
to the Watson car dashboard what's going

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,800
to happen is it's going to send an mqt

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,319
message to node red so this is bya

49
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,120
mqtt all

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
right now essentially just in case you

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
were wondering what we do in order to

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,800
get back to Watson the Watson car

53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,959
dashboard we actually send a message

54
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,920
through websockets so I guess you could

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
say we're sort of cheating there but uh

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
it works all right it's uh much simpler

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,640
than setting an mqtt message back to

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,680
wats and card dashboard uh so now uh

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,560
essentially what happens is wats and

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,040
card dashboard is able to then

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,000
communicate with a few things first of

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,800
all Watson conversation uh it's able to

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,920
communicate with speech to text and of

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,560
course it's able to communicate with

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,680
text to speech and they're all able to

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,280
communicate back uh via http

67
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,319
uh so they're able to communicate back

68
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
via

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,560
HTTP and to to and from HTTP

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,799
here now that's essentially how the card

71
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,680
dashboard works and how the node red end

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,239
Works however the pi as you probably

73
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,360
know from part two uh is essentially

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,799
able to send mqtt messages to and from

75
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,560
node red these are both ways mqtt

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,120
messages being sent through the iot

77
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,080
platform and of course uh the pi is

78
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,159
connecting to our drone here as well via

79
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,840
WiFi and of course every around second

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,159
it's grabbing new data via Wi-Fi as well

81
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,040
sending that to node red which in in

82
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,080
turn sends it to Watson car dashboard

83
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,040
puts that into the context of Watson

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,599
conversation which is really the

85
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,439
interesting part if you think about it

86
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,280
uh when when the pi finds out what the

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,720
battery level is in the Drone currently

88
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,920
it notifies node red which in turn

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,799
notifies Watson car dashboard which

90
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,840
again in turn notifies Watson

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,720
conversation which adds it to its

92
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,360
context so now Watson is quite literally

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
aware that the that the drone's battery

94
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,840
percentage is so many perc and of course

95
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,599
Watson currently knows whether the Drone

96
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,799
is turned on turned off connected or

97
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,880
even disconnected uh and so that's what

98
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,199
makes it really interesting because

99
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,560
Watson actually knows what's going on

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,639
with the Drone and where it is or not

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
where it is it doesn't have GPS location

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,759
just yet but what it's doing all right

103
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,360
right so now we're going to be showing

104
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,199
you a quick demo of the car dashboard uh

105
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,240
you've probably already seen this uh car

106
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,680
dashboard uh it's as I said one of the

107
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,280
default examples of Watson conversation

108
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,039
uh but we've essentially modified uh the

109
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,800
Watson conversation flow uh to include

110
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,880
how to use a drone or how to or how to

111
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,039
control a drone let let's go back to

112
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:55,680
that yeah let's do it so first of all we

113
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,320
still have the the little program

114
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,520
running on on our Rasberry Pi with which

115
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,000
sends all the uh Telemetry data from the

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,880
Drone to our node red this is from part

117
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
two this is from part two as you know

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,199
remember still the same thing the one

119
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,680
thing we we changed is um obviously we

120
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,039
added this car dashboard right so the

121
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,160
card dashboard as T May said it's it's

122
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,360
actually sending whatever we have as

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,800
input and also the interpretation from

124
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,919
our input to no dreat so if I say uh um

125
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,080
you know

126
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,880
let's say uh turn lights on I hope the

127
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,360
Drone is not

128
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,440
starting uh probably won't yeah okay so

129
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
it's going to it's going to turn the

130
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,479
lights on it's actually talking back to

131
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,479
us and uh we do see these messages also

132
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,639
coming into our not rad now you can ask

133
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,080
it drone status we could we could ask

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,800
drone status do we type it in yeah right

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
I have to let me type it in here or

136
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,639
check drone status

137
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,960
status like this yep and as you can see

138
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,680
it says the Dr status is currently

139
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,440
online says it's online so Watson or the

140
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,400
car dashboard whatson the context is

141
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,440
there he knows that the the car

142
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,680
dashboard is on on online right exactly

143
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,639
all right so now let's try asking what

144
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
the battery level is so we know if it's

145
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,680
good enough for flight is the battery

146
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,400
level you think like

147
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,639
this that question is out of SC for this

148
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,440
application enhanced application to the

149
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,680
battery remaining in the Drone is 64% as

150
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,720
you can see it is contextually aware of

151
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,240
what's currently going on with the Drone

152
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,599
which as I said makes this really

153
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,319
interesting yeah so now let's say we

154
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,199
wanted to take off the Drone what's

155
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,120
going to happen is we're going to be

156
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,840
able to talk to Watson card dasboard in

157
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,160
that case that'll send the request

158
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Watson conversation which will do its

159
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,560
sort of processing and come back with a

160
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,120
response which will go back to node red

161
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,479
via qtt uh or uh yeah by mqtt uh and so

162
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,039
essentially uh node rad will then be

163
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,960
able to do its processing send that to

164
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,160
the pi VI mqtt and then finally it'll be

165
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,479
able to send a request to the Drone via

166
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,680
Wi-Fi to do something so yeah let them

167
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,319
show real quick like you know we did

168
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,960
create these uh these intents right yes

169
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,720
in um in the conversation workbench as

170
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,840
well we created a new entity and we

171
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,800
added a you know Appliance we added the

172
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,919
Drone as an appliance to the car

173
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,800
dashboard yes and then you created this

174
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,479
dialogue for dialogue where was it stus

175
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,199
or battery battery yeah battery for

176
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,960
example so battery and here you can see

177
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,199
that we

178
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,720
actually we used some of the content or

179
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,599
the context which we shot back via um

180
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,759
websockets to to the car dashboard right

181
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,639
yes so let's try do you want to try

182
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,319
flying this thing now sure why not okay

183
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,560
so if you go to the Watson car dashboard

184
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,240
if we can look at the Drone as well for

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,720
a second like zoom out so we can see the

186
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,159
TV of the Drone if

187
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,360
possible uh so okay you T you type it in

188
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,120
all right sure so now let's say we

189
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,759
wanted to tell the Drone to take off

190
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,039
we'd say uh take off for example pretty

191
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,840
straightforward as you can see the Drone

192
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,520
takes off all right so as you can see

193
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,759
the Drone has taken off and now let's

194
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,960
say we wanted to rotate counterclockwise

195
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,280
or rotate clockwise actually

196
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,800
not sure

197
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,919
s things turn on my lights are all right

198
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,320
so as you can see I'm going to tell to

199
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,760
rotate clockwise do it man okay rotates

200
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,599
clockwise and if I tell do one more

201
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,279
other other

202
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
way all right now if I tell it to rotate

203
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
counterclockwise it rotates

204
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,080
counterclockwise for a second Super and

205
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,880
if I land then it will land the Drone ah

206
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,640
excellent exactly her Demo's never never

207
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,240
usually go that smoothly but yeah I did

208
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,959
this time that was fun so so again the

209
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,760
flow I mean you can see this here we we

210
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,760
orchestrate this here in U in node red

211
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
so we get we get the messages from the

212
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,519
cboard from the car dashboard we filter

213
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,160
out some of the the the data and then we

214
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
have a switch basically for the four

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,079
intens or the five intens we have and

216
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,959
then we can either take off uh rotate

217
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,079
clock

218
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:33,200
or counterclockwise land we also

219
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,079
experiment tweeting a picture and so

220
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,920
forth and uh that's where on here on the

221
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,160
bottom we shoot back the the the context

222
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,720
about the the the the Drone itself uh to

223
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,160
the car dashboard okay exactly that's it

224
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,720
so that was it for part three of the

225
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Dome series and much more is coming up

226
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,640

228
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,320
