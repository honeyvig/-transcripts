everyone it's no secret that the
majority of our internet usage is at the
risk of being hacked be it via unsafe
messaging applications or misconfigured
operating systems to counteract this
void of digital security penetration
testing has become the norm when it
comes to vulnerability assessment K
Linux is an operating system that has
become a well-known weapon in this fight
against hackers a Linux distribution
that is made specifically for
penetration testers K Linux has layers
of features that we will be covering in
today's lesson
let's take a look at the topics to be
covered in this
video we start by learning about Ki
Linux and a basic explanation of its
purpose we take a look at the history of
K Linux from the story of its origin to
its current day
exploits next we learn a few distinct
features of Khali that make it an
attractive choice for penetration
testers
worldwide finally we take a look at the
multiple ways we can install kinu to
start our journey in the world of
nutrition testing let's start by
learning about K Linux in
general K Linux which is formerly known
as backtrack Linux is an open-source
Linux distribution aimed at Advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing it contains several hundred
tools that are targeted towards various
information security tasks such as
penetration testing security research
computer forensics and reverse
engineering color Linux is a multiple
plat platform solution accessible and
freely available to Information Security
Professionals and
hobbyists among all the Linux
distributions K Linux takes its roots
from the Debian operating system Debian
has been a highly dependable and stable
distribution for many years providing a
similarly strong Foundation to the Kali
desktop while the operating system is
capable of practically modifying every
single part of our installation the
networking components of Kali become
disabled by default this is done to
prevent any external factors from
affecting the installation procedure
which may pose a risk in critical
environments apart from boosting
security it allows a deeper element of
control to the most enthusiastic of
users we did not get K Linux since the
first day how did it come into existence
let's take a look at some of its
history K Linux is based on years of
knowledge and experience in building
penetration testing and operating
systems during all these project
lifelines there have been only a few
different developers as the team has
always been small the first project was
called wopex which stands for white hat
nopex as can be inferred from the name
it was based on the npix operating
system as its underlying OS opix had
releases ranging from version 2.0 to
2.7 this made way for the next project
which was known as wax or the long hand
being white hat slacks the name change
was because the base OS was changed from
KNIX to slacks wax started at version 3
as a nod it carrying on from wopex there
was a similar OS being produced at the
same time auditor security collection
often being shed to just auditor which
was once again using
knopic its efforts were combined with
wax to produce backtrack backtrack was
based on slackware from version 1 to
version 3 but switched to uban to later
on with version 4 to version 5 using
using the experience gained from all of
this Ki Linux came after backtrack in
2013 Ki started off using Debian stable
as the engine under the hood before
moving to Debian testing when kalii
Linux became a rolling operating
system now that we understand the
history and the purpose of K Linux let
us learn a little more about its
distinct
features the latest version of Khali
comes with more than 600 penetration
tools pre-installed
after reviewing every tool that was
included in backtrack developers have
eliminated a great number of tools that
either simply did not work which
duplicated other tools that provided the
same or similar
functionality the Kali Linux team is
made up of a small group of individuals
who are the only ones trusted to commit
packages and interact with the
depositories all of which is done using
multiple secure protocols restricting
access of critical code bases to
external asset greatly reduces the risk
of source contamination which can cause
K Linux users worldwide a great deal of
damage as a direct victim of cyber
crime although penetration tools tend to
be written in English the developers
have ensured that Kali includes true
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need for the job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a
stronghold over the configuration and
the device in
general since arm-based single board
systems like the Raspberry Pi are
becoming more and more prevalent and
inexpensive the development team knew
that Khali's armm support would need to
be as robust as they could manage with
fully working
installations K Linux is available on a
wide range of armm devices and has arm
repositories integrated with the
mainline distributions so the tools for
armm are updated in conjunction with the
rest of for the
distribution all this information is
necessary for users to determine if K
Linux is the correct choice for them if
it is what are the ways that they can go
forward with this installation and start
their penetration testing
Journey the first way to use scal Linux
is by launching the distribution in the
live USB mode this can be achieved by
downloading the installer image file or
the ISO file from the Kali Linux website
and flashing it to a USB drive with a
capacity of at least 88 GB some people
don't need to save their data
permanently and a live USB is the
perfect solution for such cases after
the iso image is flashed the Thum Drive
can be used to boot a fully working
installation of the operating system
with the cavar that any changes made to
the OS in this mode are not written
permanently some cases allow persistent
usage in live USBS but those require
further configuration than normal
situations but what if the user wants to
store data permanently in the installed
OS the best and the most reliable way to
ensure this is the full-fledged hard
disk installation this will ensure the
complete usage of the systems Hardware
capabilities and will take into account
the updates and the configurations being
made to the OS this method is supposed
to override any pre-existing operating
system installed on the computer be it
windows or any other variant of
Linux the next alternative route for
installing K Linux would be to use
virtualization software such as VMware
or virtual box the software will be
installed as a separate application on
an already existing OS and K Linux can
be run as an operating system in the
same computer as a window the hardware
requirements will be completely
customizable starting with the alloted
ram to the virtual hard disk
capacity the usage of both a host and
guest operating system like K Linux
allows users a safe environment to learn
while not putting the systems at risk if
you want to learn more about how one can
go forward with this method we have a
dedicated video where Ki Linux is being
installed on VMware while running on a
Windows 10 operating system you can find
the link in the description box to get
started with your very own virtual
machine the final way to install Kali
Linux is by using a dual boot system to
put it in simple words the K Linux OS
will not be overriding any pre-installed
operating system on a machine but will
be installed alongside it when a
computer boots up the user will get a
choice to boot into either of these
operating systems many people prefer to
keep both the windows and K Linux
installed so the distribution of work
and recreation activities is also
allotted effectively it gives users a
safety valve should their custom Linux
installation run into any bugs that
cannot be fixed from within the
operating system there are multiple ways
to install K Linux we can either install
it on a normal hard drive in a virtual
machine software such as VMR or virtual
box or we can do that in hard bare metal
machines now for the convenience of
explanation we're going to install K
Linux today on a virtual machine
software known as VMware VMware is able
to run multiple operating systems on a
single host machine which in our case is
a Windows 10
system to get started with K Linux
installation we have to go to the
website to download an image
file we go to get Kali and as you can
see there are multiple platforms on
which this operating system can be
inverted as per our requirement we're
going to go with the virtual machine
section as you can see it is already
recommended by the
developers this is the download button
which will download a 64-bit ISO file we
can download 32-bit but that is more
necessary for hard metal machines or if
you're going to use it for older devices
which do not support 64-bit operating
systems yet after clicking on the
download button we can see we have a
window archive which will have the ISO
files for now we have downloaded the ISO
file and it is already present with me
so we can start working on the VMware
side of things once the ISO file is
downloaded we open up VMware
Workstation go to file and we create a
new virtual
machine in these two options it is
highly recommended to go with the
typical setup rather than the custom one
the custom is much more advanced and
requires much more information from the
user which is beneficial for developers
and people who are well versed with
virtualization software but for 90% of
the cases typical setup will be
enough here we can select the third
option which will be I will install the
operating system later in some operating
systems we can use the ISO file here
directly and VMR will install it for us
but right now in the case of K Linux the
third option is always the
safest K Linux is a Linux distribution
so we can select Linux over here and the
version as you can see here it have
multiple versions such as the multiple
kernels every distribution has a a
parent distribution for example K Linux
has Debian and there are other
distributions which are based or forked
from some parent distribution kinus is
based of Debian so we can go with the
highest version of Debian which is the
Debian 10. X
64bit go on next we can write any such
name we can write K Linux so that it'll
be easier to recognize the virtual
machine among this list of virtual
machine instances the location can be
any location you decide to put by
default this should be the documents
folder but anywhere you put it will hold
up all the information of the operating
system all the files you download all
the configurations you store everything
will be stored in this particular
location that you
provide when we go next we are asked
about the dis capacity this dis capacity
will be all the storage that will be
provided to your virtual machine of K
Linux think of your Windows device if
you have a one terab of hard drive you
have the entirety of the hard disk to
store data on how much data you give
here you can only store up to that
amount of data not to mention some
amount of capacity will be taken up by
the operating system system itself to
store its programs and applications for
now we can give around let's say 15 GB
of information or if a recommended size
foran is 20 you can just go ahead at 20
it depends all on the user case if
you're going to use it extensively you
can even go as high as 50 or 60 GB if
you have plans to download many more
applications and perform multiple
different tests another option we get
over here is storing virtual diss as a
single file or storing them into
multiple files
as we already know this virtual machine
run entirely on
VMware sometimes when transferring these
virtual machine instances let's say from
a personal computer to a work computer
we're going to need to copy up the
entire folder that we had mentioned
before over
here instead all virtual machines have a
portability feature now this portability
feature is possible for all scenarios
except it is much easier if the split
the virtual dis into multiple files now
even if this makes porting virtual
machines easier from either system to
system or software to software let's say
if you want to switch from VMware to
Virtual box or vice versa the
performance takes a small hit it's not
huge but it's recommended to go with
storing the virtual L as a single file
if you have no purposes of ever moving
the virtual machine even if you do it's
not a complete stop that it cannot be
ported it's just easier when using
multiple files but in order to get the
best performance out of the virtual
machine we can store it as a single file
over
here this is a summary of all the
changes that we made and all the
configurations that have been settled
until now now at this point of time we
have not provided the ISO file yet which
is the installation file for the K Linux
that we downloaded from this
website as of right now we have only
config triggered the settings of the
virtual machine so we can press on
finish and we have K Linux in the list
now to make the changes further we press
on edit virtual machine
settings the memory is supposed to give
the ram of the virtual machine so
devices with ram of 8 GB or below that
giving high amount of ram will cause
performance issues and the host system
if the memory has some amount of free
storage left let's say on idle storage
my Windows machine takes about 2 GB so I
have 6 GB of memory to provide although
if you provide all of the 6gb it will be
much more difficult for the host system
to run everything properly so for this
instance we can keep it as 2 GB of
memory for the virtual machine instance
similarly we can use the number of
processors and we can customize it
according to our liking let's say if we
want to use One processor but we want to
use two different Cod course we can
select them as
well hard disk is preset up as the SCSI
hard disk and it does not need to be
changed for the installation of this
operating system at
all CD ID DVD this is where the
installation file comes you can think of
the ISO file that we downloaded as a pen
drive or a USB thumb drive which is
necessary to install an operating system
to provide this you're going to select
use ISO image file you're going to click
on brow
browse go and go to downloads and select
the IMO file over
here select
open and we can see it is already loaded
up next in the network adapter it is
recommended to use natat this helps the
virtual machine to draw the internet
from the host machine settings if your
host machine is connected to the
internet then the virtual machine is
connected as well there are some other
options such as as host only or custom
segments or land segments but those are
not necessary for
installation rest of them are pretty
standard which do not need any extra
configuration and can be left as it
is press okay and now we can power on
this virtual
machine in this screen we can choose how
we want to proceed with the
installation we have a start installer
option over here
so we're going to press enter on
that we're going to wait for the things
to load from the ISO
file um the first step in the
installation is choosing the language of
the operating system for this we can go
with English as
standard this is a location this will be
used for setting up the time and some of
the internal settings which depend
depend entirely on the location of the
user so for this we're going to go with
India configuring the keyboard it's
always recommended to go with the
American English first many people make
a mistake of going with the Indian
keyboard if it is possible and it
provides a lot of issues later on so
it's always preferred to go with the
American English and if later we see
some necessity of another keyboard
dialect that is NE required we can
install it later but for now we should
always stick with American English as a
basic at this point it's going to load
the installation components from the ISO
file it is a big file of 3.6 GB so it
has a lot of components that need to be
put into the virtual machine which can
also be used to detect Hardware
once the hardware and the network
configuration is done by the ISO file we
want to write a host name for the system
this host name can be anything which is
used to recognize this device on a local
network or a land cable let's say if we
use the name
Kali domain name you we can skip it for
now it's not necessary as such for the
installation this is the full name for
the
user let's say we can provide the name
as simply learn as a full
name next we're going to set up a
username this username is going to be
necessary to identify the user from its
root accounts and the subsequent below
accounts for now we can give it as
something as simply one 12
three now we have to choose a password
for the user now remember since this is
the first user that is being added onto
this newly installed operating system it
needs to be a password for the
administrator we can use whichever
password we like over
here and use the same password below and
press on
continue at this point it's going to
detect on the components on which the
operating system can be
installed like here there are multiple
options like the use entire dis use
entire disc can set up lvm this entire
disc can set up encrypted lvm for new
commers it is recommended to just use
the first one since lvm encryption is
something that you can learn afterwards
when you're much more Hands-On with the
Linux operating system for now we're
going to use the use entire dis guided
installation and press on
continue when we set up the virtual
machine on vmw we had set up a dis
capacity that we gave a prose 20gb that
is the hard disk which is being
discovered here even though it is a
virtual dis on VMR it acts as a normal
hard disk on which an oper operating
system can be installed so we select
this one and press on
continue here there is a multiple
partition system all the operating
systems that are installed have
different components one is used for the
a keeping of the applications one for
the files other for the RAM management
and other things for newcomers it is
always recommended to keep it in one
partition and we're going to select that
and press on continue
this is just an overview of the
partition it's going to make as you can
see it has a primary partition of 20.4
GB and a logical partition of 1GB used
for swap memory now these kind of naming
can be confusing for people who are not
well versed with Linux operating systems
or in general virtualization but for now
you can go ahead and press on continue
as this will be fine you can press on
finish partitioning and write changes to
disk and
continue it's just a confirmation page
and as you can see it's WR that scsi3 is
our virtual hard disk of 20gp disc
capacity write the changes to the disk
we press yes and click on
continue at this point the installation
has started now this installation will
take a while depending on the amount of
ram provided the processors provided and
how quickly the performance of the
system is being hampered by the host
machine on quicker systems this will be
rather quick while on the the smaller
ones this will take a
while since this is going to take some
time to install as it is being run on a
virtual machine with only 2GB of RAM
we're going to speed up this part of the
video so we don't have to waste any more
time just watching the progress bar
now that our core installation is
completed it's asking us to configure a
package manager the work of a package
manager on Linux operating system is
similar to the Google Play Store on
Android mobile devices and on the app
store for the Apple
devices it's an interface to install
external applications which are not
installed by default let's say for
Google Chrome or any other browser which
can be used to browse the
internet at this point of time is ask us
to select a network mirror we're going
to select as yes and move forward with
this next it's going to ask us for an
HTTP proxy which we can leave it as
blank and press it as continue
forward at this point of time it's
looking for updates to the Kali Linux
installation this will fetch the new
builds from the Kali server so the
installation is always updated to the
latest
version now that the package manager is
configured we have the grub bootloader
the grub is used for selecting the
operating system while booting up its
core functionality is to allow the
operating system to be loaded correctly
without any faults so at this point of
time if it ask install the graub boot
loader to your primary dive we can
select this as yes and press
continue remember the installation was
conducted on dev
SDA so we're going to select
installation of the ground load on the
same hard disk that we have
configured we press this one and press
continue so now the graub bootloader is
being installed the graub is highly
essential because it it shows the
motherboard where to start the operating
system from even if the operating system
is installed correctly and all the files
are in correct order the absence of a
boot loader will not be able to launch
the OS
properly and as you can see the
installation is finally complete so now
we can press on
continue and it's going to finalize the
changes now you can see K Linux being
booted up straight away it doesn't check
for the ISO file anymore since the
operating system is now installed onto
the virtual hard disk storage that we
had configured before
here we're going to enter our username
and password that we had set up
before and we have the coloro system
booted
up and this is your homepage we can see
the installed applications over here
which are being used for penetration
testing by multiple security analysts
worldwide all of these come pre-install
with K Linux and others can be installed
using the AP package manager that we had
configured we can see a full name over
here and with this our installation of
the K Linux is complete so if you are
looking to learn K Linux and get
certified into ethical hacking explore
the wide range of cyber security and
ethical hacking courses by simply learn
find the course Link in the description
box basics of K Linux let us take a look
at the agenda for our demo
today we start out with a few terminal
commands that are a basic part of a
Linux operating
system configure our own proxy chains to
maintain anonymity while running
penetration testing attacks on our
victims next we run a few nmap scans on
a local Windows 10 machine to to find
out the type of information that can be
gathered in such a
scenario moving on we use y shock to
monitor internet traffic and understand
the importance of encryption and
security when browsing the worldwide
web next we learn about metas plit and
its various applications in the line of
vulnerability assessment of a device and
finally we use Mattis plit to take root
access of a fully updated Windows 10
computer system let's begin with some
terminal Basics on
Linux when most people hear the term
Linux they Envision a complex operating
system used only by programmers however
the experience is not as frightening as
it appears Linux is an umbrella term for
a collection of free and open-source
Unix operating systems there are many
variants like Ubuntu Fedora Debian these
are distributions which is will be a
more precise term when using a Linux
operating system you will most likely
utilize a shell which is a command line
interface that that provides access to
the operating system Services the
majority of Linux distributions shipped
with a graphical user interface also
known as GUI as their primary shell this
is done to facilitate user interaction
in the first place having said that a
command line interface is suggested due
to its increased power and Effectiveness
by entering the commands into the CLI
tasks that require a multi-step GUI
procedure may be completed in a matter
of seconds you can start the terminal by
clicking on the prompt icon here on
top once the terminal is open we can put
up our commands the First Command that
we are going to look into is PWD PWD
stands for present working directory as
of right now what you're seeing is the
terminal window by default if I write
PWD and press enter this shows the
directory in which the terminal is being
run on as of right now it's in the NF
folder of my desktop which is
specifically this folder if I open up
this folder you can see it is currently
empty as in it has no contents if I use
another command known as
mkdir which is supposed to stand for
make directory and I write nf2 shortage
for new folder
too if I open up the NF you can see the
new folder is created this is how the
PWD command Works another important
command to change directories it's
called the CD command let's say right
now if I am in NF I want to create a new
file in nf2 folder or something else in
the nf2 folder I have to shift to CD
nf2 Now if I write
PWD it'll show the present working
directory of Home simply learn desktop
NF and inside that I am in nf2 right now
it is done to navigate through the Linux
files and dis directories it requires
either the full path or just the name of
the directory
if we have to move a completely
different folder on a completely
different file then we can use the
entire path like this for now CD Works
another few commands is we can write CD
dot dot and it'll come back one folder
now the PWD will be just NF and not
nf2 let's say we are in this folder and
we want to go a different file let's say
if we just go for
CD home
simply
learn that's
it right now these are the folders in a
current present working directory we
have the desktop the documents downloads
Etc from here we can again go to the
desktop using the same CD
command cross check the changing of
directories and check the files again
and yes there we go NF how do we know
this what are the command that are used
to show the file and folders that folder
is known as the ls command LS can be
used to view the contents of a directory
by default this command will display the
contents of your current working
directory if we add some other
parameters we can find the contents of
other directories as well there are some
hidden files as well in Linux which
cannot be showed just with ls for
example if you just go to CD Etc which
is a configuration folder for Linux if
you write LS now these are the files
that can be seen
if we want to see the hidden files we'll
have to add one more parameter here like
LS minus a and as you can see the number
of files have increased this time
around there are other things as well
that we can see with Linux LS minus a
will show the hidden files along with
some of the parameters and some of the
permissions that has been provided for
each file as you can see many of these
files have root access ACC some of them
can write some of them can read it
differs file to file and the ls minus Al
command is used to check each of these
files permission and change them
accordingly if
needed the next command that we can look
for is the cat command or
concatenate it is one of the most
frequently used commands and it is used
to list the contents of a file on the
output for example let's say if I have a
file at the desktop in this nf2 folder I
will create a
document cre an empty
file e
file I'll open up the document and I'll
write it as hello
Kali I will save this
up now to change the directories from
Etc to NF to we have already discussed
how to use the CD command using just the
folder name now if you want to go to the
entire directory we can write CD home as
you can see it is already prompting us
to complete the name of the directory at
this point we just have to press
Tab and it completes it for ourself next
we already know we have to enter the
desktop NF and
nf2 and this brings us to the current
working directory here if we press LS we
can find a file over here now as
discussed for the concatenate it is used
to show the contents of a file so right
now if we press C A which stands for
concatenate e file as you can see we
have written hello K in the text file
and we can see the output right now we
can also use it to create new files for
example if you write
cat any file name such as e File 2
here we can write anything Hello Ki
again once we press cr+ C here we can
check e File 2 and we have hello Kali
again printed over here we can see the
same using the concatenate command as
well if I press LS you can see we have
two files here and I can go with cat e
File 2 and I have hello Cali again this
is how the concatenate command Works
apart from this it can be used to copy
there is a different command like called
CP which is used to copy the files from
one place to another mind you this is
not moving this is only going to copy
the command for example currently our
PWD which is the present fcking
directory is in the nf2 folder as you
can see over
here let's copy the E File 2 to the NF
folder we can write
CP e File 2
and give the path of the NF folder which
will be
home simply
learn textop
nnf now if I press LS I'll find both the
files and nf2 since I
copied to go back to the NF folder again
we can again use the same command
of no we can again use the home simply
learn desktop
and just NF no nf2 this time just NF as
you can see this will change back our
present working directory now when we
press LS we will find the eile to file
and the nf2 folder and we can confirm
this using the GUI as well this is the
NF folder and you can see the nf2 folder
and the eile 2 document if I write Cat
eile
2 cat e File 2 we can see the contents
of the file now this can be done using
moving as well for example if I go to CD
nf2 which is the inside folder it has
both the document files like e file and
E File 2 let's say I want to move the E
file completely from nf2 to NF1 instead
of writing CP the command I'm going to
use is MV MV e file and again give the
path of the folder into which I have to
copy which will be again home
simply
learn
desktop and NF as you can see the
contents of the nf2 have appeared here
and E file has been moved from
nf22
NF this is the nf2 and we don't find e
file here anymore if you press CD dot
dot and we go back to NF LS right now
and we can file both the files e file
that we moved and eile to that we copied
from the nf2 folder so this is how
copying and moving will work using the
terminal now this is just a simple
oneline statement that might take a
couple of clicks when using GUI this is
why the command line interface is
considered to be much more streamlined
for Linux operating
systems another very important command
for Linux operating system is the pseudo
command pseudo is short for super user
do the command enables you to perform
tasks that require administrative or
root permissions you can think of it as
how we run programs as administrator on
Windows systems it is not advisable to
use this command for daily use because
it might be easy for an error to occur
and the permissions of root are very
intricate so new beginners are advised
to use the pseudo command only when
absolutely necessary for example Pudo Su
with this command I am giving this
Terminal A root permission this Su
stands for this
user at this point it's going to ask for
my admin
password once I enter my
password and I now have root access note
how the password that I entered did not
show up here this is a security measure
to prevent people from snooping on your
root password which is the end game of
all this operating system as you also
can see the symbol changed if the dollar
symbol is showing it serves as a
standard user when you switch to root
you can easily see a hash
symbol this opens up a separate shell
inside this terminal command for example
we can exit out of the root user to the
standard user using the command exit and
once again we have the dollar sign and
the root has vanished over here there
are some commands that will only work
with administrative access for example
when updating the K Linux system we have
to use AP
update as you can see it says problem
unlinking the file because permission
denied now let's try this using
pseudo Pudo APD
update as you can see it is updating the
package repositories which work as the
software installed on the
system this can be done using either
writing the pseudo command every time we
want to perform a root access
or we can just write pseudo su1 and
write AP update
alone the fetching is complete over
here for the second example let's say I
just write pseudo Su and this time is
not going to ask me the password because
at this current terminal process I've
already provided the ru password once
and it is in memory right now now when
we used to update the system we had to
write pseudo AP update that was because
we were running it as a standard user
now we are running it as a root user so
all we have to write is APD update and
it's going to continue its
work there you
go another command that can be useful is
a ping command it's pretty
self-explanatory it's going to be
checking the internet connectivity it
can be used to check internet
connectivity or you can see if that
there is a local server on your system
which needs to be pinged then then you
can check that for example if we have to
write ping and we can use either IP
address or domain let's say if we want
to check that if we can access
google.com using this K Linux
installation or not we can write ping
google.com and you can see it shows the
bytes being sent and received and how
much time it took to take up the request
this can be done for local systems as
well for example this installation of Ki
Linux is being run on a virtual machine
once this machine is running I still
have my host machine running over here
the IP address of which is 192.168 29
179 if I try to Ping this from
here as you can see the time to complete
the request is drastically low compared
to a website on the internet considering
this is on the local network this is how
the Ping command is worked and it can
show you what kind of packages are
transmitted how many are received if
there was any kind of packet loss
between the connection window and other
details a very important command when
working with the terminal for a long
duration is a history command pretty
self-explanatory there are so many
commands that are being run sometimes
people forget what was the change they
did or what was the directory name they
put a history command helps to recover
some of the commands that you have
written it doesn't go all the way back
but it takes up many commands that were
inputed in the last few processes this
is how the history command works these
are some of the most commonly used
terminal commands if you want to learn
more about this terminal and every other
feature of this please let us know in
the comment section and we'll try to
make an in-depth tutorial especially if
you could repeat if you want to learn
more about the terminal please let us
know in the comment section and we will
try to make an in-depth tutorial
specifically for terminal commands on
Linux
moving on we learn how to configure
proxy chains on our
system proxying refers to the technique
of bouncing your internet traffic
through multiple machines to hide the
identity of the original machine it is a
good tool that hackers use to accomplish
this goal is proxy chains essentially
you can use proxy chains to run any
program to a proxy server this will
allow you to access internet from behind
a restrictive firewall which hides your
IP address proxy chains even allows you
to use multiple proxies At Once by
chaining them together one of the most
important reasons that proxy chains is
used in a security context is that it's
easy to evade detection attackers often
use proxies to hide their true
identities while executing an
attack and when multiple proxies are
chained together it becomes harder and
harder for forensic professional to
trace the traffic back to the original
machine when these proxies are located
across countries investigators would
have to obtain warranties in their local
jurisdictions where every proxy is
located to to see how proxy chain Works
let's open Firefox first and check our
current IP
address write
Firefox and there we go
as we can see Firefox is now open let's
check our current IP address right
now if you go to an address called my
ip.com
and you can see it easily detects our
country is in India and this is a public
IP address now if we move to the
terminal again
here we can now
write proxy
chains minus H what this minus H does is
it finds a help it it stands for the
help file this is for help
file what we found out using this is
proxy chain has a config file here Etc
proxy chains 4. NF this is the config
file found using this config file we we
can customize how our proxy change
should work if we want to open that we
have to use it in a text editor on
Windows we have notepad and other things
like that Microsoft Word to edit
documents on Linux we have a tool called
Nano to access the Nano we use the
command Nano and give the path of the
file that we want to check as of right
now the proxy chain config file is
located over here so we're going to
follow the path
there chains 4
do
CF and here we go we see the config
file there are three basic types of
proxy chaining here we have a strict
chain where all the proxy in the list
will be used and they will be chained in
order we have a random chain where each
connection made through proxy chains
will be done by a random combo of
proxies in the proxy list and you have
dnamic chain it's the same as strict
chain but dead proxies are excluded from
the chain
and here we can set up whichever type we
want to enable or disable a particular
type we use the hash symbol here as you
can see right now all the lines have a
hashtag symbol at the front except this
one a dynamic chain this is the current
one being used let's say if I want to
use a strict chain method so I can add a
hash value
here and remove the hash here at one
point of time any one of these three
four types should be enabled let's go
for the Dynam um Dynamic
chain we can disable this strict Chain
by putting the hashtag in front and
removing the dynamic chain as you can
see below we have few commands to how to
handle the Nano text editor this symbol
is known as the control button on your
keyboard now if we want to write out
which is synonymous to saving the file
supposed to go with control O So if I
press crol o on my keyboard it says file
name to right and we have to press enter
here since we want to overwrite the
proxy chain 4. CF file we don't want to
create a new file over here so just
press
enter and we get a permission denied
this permission denied we're getting is
because we have opened this using a
standard user Etc is a system folder to
be able to use make some changes we have
to use it using a suit command to exit
this Nano we have to use the control X
command we use contr
x we're going to
clear and this time we're going to use
the pseudo command pseudo
Nano
Etc proxy chains
4nf and we have the same file open up
again now this time if you want to make
a change let's say we're going to add a
strict chain in instead of a dynamic
chain which remove the hashtag from
straight we're going to use contr o for
the save file option we're going to
press enter and it says R 160 lines
again if you want to reverse this change
we put the hashtag over here enable
Dynamic chain we press CR o press enter
and it says root 160 lines now we can
exit straight away using the contr X
format right now we have not provided
any file or a proxy chain we can have
proxy IP addresses from the internet but
we have to make sure that they are safe
and they don't Snoop on our
data when there is no proxy chains being
provided personally it going it's going
to use the T network but for that we
have to start t t is a service in Linux
to know more about the store we can
write Pudo system CTL which is used to
know the status of services on the Linux
operating
system and status of
t uh system CTL sorry uh instead of STL
it should be system CTL status Tor as
you can see it is a to service
anonymizing overlay Network for TCP
connections and it's currently inactive
now to start this up we have to write
sudo system CTL start T now if we repeat
the same sudo system CTL status store as
you can see it's active
now you can see the green logo over here
okay to integrate the Firefox and the
browser we can use the proxy chains
command directly over here we can write
proxy chains we can use Firefox to
launch our web browser and let's say if
we want to visit
google.com we press enter and the
Firefox window is launched
and it should open up google.com next
and there we go if we go to myip.com
once
again as you can see we have a different
IP address and the country is unnown as
well so this is how we can use proxy
chains to anonymize internet usage when
using G
Linux next on our agenda is the ability
to scan networks using nmap
at its scoree nmap is a network scanning
tool that uses IP packets to identify
all the devices connected to a
network can learn more about nmap using
the help
file as you can see these are some of
the parameters that can be used when
scanning ports of a system you can see
the version and the URL of the we of the
service over here the primary uses of
nmap can be broken into three C
processes first the program gives you
detailed information on every IP active
on your network and then each IP can
then be scanned secondly it can also be
used to providing a lot of live hosts
and open ports as well as identifying
the OS of every connected device thirdly
nmap has also become a valuable tool for
users looking to protect personal and
business websites using nmap to scan
your own web server particularly if
you're hosting your website from home is
essentially simulating the process that
a hacker would use to attack your site
attacking your own site in this way is a
powerful way of identifying security
vulnerabilities as you already discussed
The Host Windows 10 machine on the
system has an IP address a 192 168
29179 if you want to test the OS scan of
the system we're going to first get the
root permission over here we use the
pseudo command and now we are root user
we're going to launch the command n map
minus o which is supposed to be an OS
detection scan the IP address we can use
of the host
system
192.168
29179 in a legitimate penetration
testing scenario we can use the IP
address of the vulnerabilties device
over here we are going to let it scan
for a while and it's going to give us
some guesses on what can the OS be
as you can see the scan is done and it
has shown some of the ports that are
open you can see the msrpc port open the
https 443 Port open which is used to
connect with the internet and it has
some aggressive OS guesses as well for
example it thinks there's a 90% 94%
chance that it's going to be a Microsoft
Windows XP Service Pack 3 that's partly
because a lot of the Windows XP update
packages are still prevalent on Windows
now that the OS detection is confirmed
there are multiple more details that we
can gather from
nmap let's go with the nmap minus a
command which is supposed to capture as
much data as possible there is also a
speed setting you can call it a speed
setting or a control setting of the
minus t minus t ranges from t0 to T1 to
T2 all the way up to T5
this basically determines how
aggressively the victim is being scanned
if you scan slowly it'll take more time
to provide the results but it will also
give a less chance for the intrusion
detection system on the vulnerable
machine firewall to detect that someone
is trying to penetrate the network for
now if we want to go with somewhat of a
high speed we can go with the T4 and
provide the same IP address of the local
machine I am trying to attack it's going
to take a little bit of time since it's
trying to capture a lot of
information as you can see the results
are now
here it launched a scan and took a few
top ports that are most likely
vulnerable from a Windows XP perspective
and it showed a few ports over here it
has not shown 991 filtered ports which
could not be attacked anyway since they
were closed for outside access it shows
a few fingerprint settings like the
connection policies and the port
details it shows an HTTP options some
other intricate details that can be used
when you attacking its servers it shows
a VMware version that it's
running and some few other ports over
here apart from that we also have the
aggressive OS guesses over here just
like we did with the minus o and you can
see this time it is showing Windows 7 as
98% no exact o matches since uh if there
was any exact oise matches we could have
seen a 100% chances over
here this is a trace route a trace route
will be the time and the path a
connection request takes from the source
to the destination for example this
request went from 19 to 168
172.2 to a destination address since
this is is a local machine it took only
a single step on multiple occasions if
you're trying to access a remote system
it's going to be a number of Trace rots
when it jumps from firewall to firewall
and router to
router this is how we can use nmap to
find information about a system and find
some vulnerable ports we can
access moving on we have a tutorial on
how to use wire shck to sniff Network
traffic to start using wire shck we're
going to have to open the application
first now during installation of wire
shock there is an option to enable if
nonroot users can be able to capture
traffic or not in my installation I have
disabled that so I will be launching my
Shark when using the root user
itself also to capture data we need an
external Wi-Fi
adapter you can see it over here in the
VM tab removable devices
R link a2.1 NW Lan this is a external
Wi-Fi adapter which is inserted into my
USB
system you can see it over here if I
write IW config this is the one W l0
this is absolutely necessary because we
need to have a monitor mode required we
won't need it for sniffing data on
Yar right now but it's going to be
necessary later on in this tutorial as
well as we will see for now we can just
start up via shark by writing its name
on the command line and it should start
the
program here we
go here it's going to check which of the
adapters we want to use for example
right now the eth0 which supposed to
stand for ethn Z Port you can see data
is being transmitted up and down we're
going to select
eth0 and we have has started capturing
data you can see the data request from
The Source the destination from the time
and the which protocol it is following
everything we can see and we can see the
ipv4 flags here as
well as you can see over
here to capture internet traffic we can
try running
Firefox if Fe just write
wikipedia.com
and you can see the number of requests
increasing okay this is spelling mistake
Wikipedia here you can see the
application data of all these request
going up and they connected to a desk
destination server of 103 10 to
16622 4 now if you even if you check the
transmission control protocol Flags over
here and so many more things we cannot
find anything beneficial as you can see
the information over here is gibberish
which is supposed to be since it's
supposed to be
encrypted now this is possible due to
this being an https website hence you
can see the lock symbol over here and
connection is supposed to be secure now
what about HTTP ports we have seen a
many people recommend to not visit HTTP
ports repeat we have seen many people
recommend to not visit HTTP websites and
even if you have to visit to not provide
any critical information for example
let's go to a
random HTTP page over here as you can
see this is saying connection is not
secure and this is an HTTP HTTP page and
not a
https now let's check for some of the
information that is passing through this
this is a login form let's say I have a
legitimate account over here if I write
my account
name and my password is supposed to be
password 1 2 3 4 I press
login and uh the password does not match
because I do not have an account over
here but let's say I did and I was
logged in as expected we can go to wi
shck we can use filters over here now
all the requests that I'm sending it's a
TCP request so I can write a filter
containing
TCP
contains whatever string if it is being
passed let's say for the end username I
write my account name so I can just
write my account name over
here and press enter
to find a request over here now as you
can see there are many flags over here
if we go to the HTT HTML form URL
encoded and open up some of its flags as
you can see I can see my account name
and simply learn password over here this
is the
same details that I input on the website
let's say I did have a legitimate
account on this website I would have
logged in with no problems but anyone
who would be using wi shck to sniff on
the data can easily get my credentials
from here this is why it's recommended
to not provide any information on HTTP
Pages the security is not up to the mark
and always look for the lock symbol when
visiting any website or making any
internet transactions or providing any
information this is how we can use wies
shck to detect transmission and sniff
packet data that is being transferred to
the network adapter next we have we have
to learn about what is
Metasploit the Metasploit project is a
computer security project that provides
information about security
vulnerabilities and AIDS in penetration
testing and IDs
development we can open up the terminal
here we're going to allow root
access and to open up Metasploit the
keyword is msf
console it's going to take a little bit
of time to start it
up now the Metasploit con has been
loaded from here we can decide what type
of attack we want to launch and what
kind of exploits we can launch against
vulnerable targets for example like we
had already discussed I'm running this
virtual machine on a Windows 10 host
machine so if I open the command prompt
from my Windows 10 over
here if I need to check the IP address
once I go with ip
config here you can see the the IP
address of this local
machine moving
on if we have to attack that machine
let's say we want to see what kind of
exploits are going to work over there
now we already know that Windows has
some common vulnerabilities one of those
vulnerabilities is the HTA server
vulnerability HTA is supposed to be a
HTML application but when pass the right
payload it can be used to open a back
door into a system this to start off
with the Metasploit and accessing such
applications we're going to use the
command use exploit and the name of the
reverse HTA server is this
Windows Misa for misscellaneous
HDA
server as you can see it already found
this
one all right now the there are some
options that we need to set for this
exploit to go through for example you
can see some of the options over here
there's a payload the payload is
supposed to be the malicious file that
we are going to send on the HTML
application which allows us to give the
back
door for example right now the payload
which is the malicious file is a Windows
meter prer reverse
TCP completely understandable now let's
set the L host L host and R host and SRV
host should be the one where we are
going to launch the attack from for
example if we launched another tab of
this
console and we just press if
config the IP address is2 + 168
72130 so we're going to set the L host
as 1921 68.
72130 and we're going to do the same
thing with SRV
host we're going to set a port where we
need to capture the back door
access next the payload has already been
set this payload will launch a back door
and give us meter pritter access to the
system meter pritter is can be
considered as an upgrade of a normal
command prompt shell we will look into
it once we get the access in the first
place now that we have set the commands
we can press on exploit and press
enter now you can see we have a URL over
here we're going to copy this
URL once the URL is copied we take it
into the browser and paste
it this will ask us to download this
file now as per browser security
settings this file should be blocked by
default we can decide to keep it and
with the correct formulation of this
malicious package even the website
browser antivirus softwares will not be
able to detect good payloads we're going
to save this
file and we're going to open
it publisher could not be verified if we
press run and we go go back to our meter
Peta access over here you can see it has
already captured a URL of an HT server
and it is writing delivering
payload just have to wait for a few
seconds till the payload is delivered it
has sent this much amount of data meter
P session one is
opened and we should get the access
soon there we go now to understand where
is the session set we can write session
minus
I as you can see it has a meter over
here we're going to write sessions minus
I the session ID is one so we're going
to write one and we have the meter
access now to get a fair idea of the
system we're going to write s info and
it's going to the computer name the OS
architecture all these things we can
write the help command to see what are
the things that we can get out of the
system we can take screenshots we can
control the webcam and start a video
chat we can take a lot of things over
here there are other commands as well
where we can change the file directory
like the cat command CD command there
are so many things that work in the
normal CMD which we can run on the
metera as well now if you want to access
this command prompt of the system
directly we can go with this we have to
write
shell and there we go we are in the
downloads folder right now to see if
this is the same computer or not we're
going to write ip
config as you can see it is our M victim
machine with 192 168 or
29171 we can just press exit and we're
back with the meter AIS this is how we
can use meter and Metasploit to gain
access to a Windows 10 machine next
let's take a look at how we can get root
access from a Windows 10
system we just learned how we can get a
meter perer access from a system we can
background this meter prer session by
writing background and pressing enter we
can still we can still see the sessions
sessions minus I it's still present over
here
now these kind of aess are not
administrative axess these are the kind
of back doors that can be created for
standard users but to get a complete
access of a system including the program
files the windows documents we need to
have root access or administrative
access to do that we're going to use
another exploit reminder that the meterp
session of the standard axis is already
present and we're not messing with it
right now we're going to set up another
session allbe with the same
machine that exploit name
is use exploit Windows
local bypass
USC Event Viewer
and there we go now if we check the
options that we can put in the system we
have to choose an exploit
Target we need to put a session as well
let's say we going to use the session
one this is the session that has the
meter PR access with the standard user
it doesn't have the system
user we're going to write
set session
one and we're going to run exploit run a
few commands and it open a second meter
session as you can see it is the session
two if I write s
info you can still see I'm not
the system user right now I'm still just
a normal user how can we check that if
you go to
Shell I still seec users J downloads all
these things
if I press exit and go back to the meter
Peter there is a command on meter Peter
get system it attempts to elevate your
privilege to that of the local system
which basically means you get promoted
into root access so if we write get
system and due to pip impersonation we
now have the system root
access as you can see now it has become
x64 and we are the admin users now if I
go to
Shell I can easily go
back
windows and I can easily access these
things this kind of control over the
windows folders and the program files
folders these kind of things are not
possible if you're not an admin access
or the command prompt has not been run
with admin permissions this this is how
we can use privilege escalation to get
into an admin access system we use the
second exploit which was the bypass us
Event Viewer exploit and essentially
used it with the first session as you
can read here Windows escalation us
protection
bypass it was first disclosed on 2016
but it still works on some
systems this is how we can get root
access on our Windows 10 installation
hello Wizards and digital explorers
welcome to a journey into the core of
Linux the operating system powering over
2.3% of desktop computers globally and
it's staggering 96.3% of the world's top
1 million servers I'm abisa and today we
are deling into one of the most vital
components of Linux its file systems
imagine a world where every piece of
digital information is meticulously
organized where every bite of data has
its own unique place that world exists
right inside your Linux machine so so
buckle up as we dive deep into the
intricate Maze of Linux file systems
exploring how they work why they are
important and what makes them so unique
in the realm of operating systems in the
realm of Linux file systems like ext4
xfs and btrfs areen just names they are
sophisticated architectures that manage
how billions of bytes of data are stored
accessed and organized these systems are
the unsung heroes ensuring data
integrity and efficiency in our digital
world today we will uncover how these
file systems support everything from
your personal blogs to the largest data
centers hosting pedabytes of information
we will explore in notes journaling
mounting and more terms that might sound
complex but are incredibly fascinating
once you get to know them and just a
quick info for you if you're an aspiring
cyber security professional looking for
online training and certifications from
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading experts to
enhance your credibility then search no
more simply learns postgraduate program
in cyber security from MIT University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
your right choice through this course
you will gain knowledge and work ready
expertise in skills like Advanced
hacking Concepts Network packet analysis
ethical hacking network security and
over a dozen others and that's not all
you also get the opportunity to work on
multiple projects and learn from
industry experts working in top tier
product and security companies and acadm
misss from top universities this course
is designed to accommodate a diverse
range of Learners and this course
requires just a bachelor's degree with a
50% average and no prior programming
experience and one plus year of work
experience is preferred if you're
passionate about making your career in
this field then make sure to check out
the link in the pin comment and
description box to find a cyber security
program that fits your experience and
areas of interest and now Linux offers a
diverse are of file systems each
tailored to specific requirements and
now let's explore some prevalent Linux
file systems so starting with ex2 and
then we have EX3 ext4 xfs btrfs ZFS JFS
and then we have Riser FS so now
starting with the first one that is EXT2
so EXT2 extended file system to that is
one of the Linux earliest and most
commonly used file systems EXT2 has long
been a default choice for many Linux
distributions it's known for its
stability and suitability for small to
mediumsized partitions though it lacks a
journaling feature which can complicate
file recovery post crash now moving to
the next file system that is ext3
extended file system 3 building on EXT2
ext3 introduces journaling to track file
system changes reducing data loss risk
after crashes it's a popular choice for
its stability reliability and
performance and now move to the next
that is ext4 extended file system 4 as
the evolution of ext3 ext4 addresses
some of it predecessors limitations it
supports larger files quicker file
system checks and enhanced performance
for larger disk features like joural
check summing also enhances data
Integrity ext4 is a default file system
in many modern Linux distributions now
moving to the next file system that is
xfs so xfs that is x file system that is
designed for large scale storage and xfs
excels in performance and is suitable
for file systems up to 16 exabytes it's
a Top Choice for large data centers
offering scalability reliability and
featuring like Jing and file level
languages now moving on to the next file
system that is btrfs B3 file system a
newer Linux file system btrfs supports
copy on right snapshots and sub volumes
allowing for multiple file systems
within a single partition it also
includes rate and compression support
btrfs is still under development and
isn't as commonly used as other file
system systems next we have is ZFS ZFS
zetabyte file system initially developed
for Solaris ZFS is a robust system with
features like snapshots data compression
D duplication and built-in rate Renown
for its data integrity and selfhealing
capabilities ZFS is not typically
included in Linux distributions du to
licensing but can be installed
separately now moving to the next file
system that is GFS GFS Journal file
system that is developed by IB M JFS is
known for its performance and
reliability it offers Jing file level
compression and online resizing making
it a strong choice for high performance
systems and now the next one that is
resizer FS so targeted at high
performance Computing resizer FS
includes features like journaling file
level encryption and support for larger
files while known for its speed and
reliability it's less common compared to
other file systems listed here now
moving to key Linux file system
directories so the Linux operating
systems file management is predominantly
handled through directories commonly
known as folders these elements are
crucial in the Linux file system serving
not just as file holders but also as
organizational tools imagine directories
as virtual boxes each capable of storing
files and other directories directories
in Linux play a vital role in providing
an order hierarchical framework for file
Arrangement this hierarchy commences at
the root directory denoted as and
extends into various subd directories
this approach allows for a logical and
systematic organization of complex
systems enhancing the use of file
management and access so key Linux file
system directories each directory in the
Linux file system serves a distinct
purpose here are some of the significant
directories starting with the number one
that is root directory so root directory
is the highest level in the Linux file
system hierarchy all other directories
and files are nested within this through
now moving to the next directory that is
bin standing for binaries this directory
contains essential command line
utilities and programs vital for basic
system management and then we have boot
so here lies the boot loader files and
the kernel images necessary for system
startup and then we have Dev this
directory host device files representing
both physical like printers and disk and
virtual devices like Terminals and then
we have Etc directory that is home to
system configuration files these are
utilized by various applications and
services and then we have home directory
it houses individual users directories
providing personal space for file and
setting storage and then we have Library
directory this directory stores shared
Library files needed by System programs
next we have media directory am mounting
point for removable media such as USB
drives CDs and DVDs and then we have MNT
that is mounting directory that is used
for temp rarely mounting file systems
like Network file systems or disk images
next we have OPD directory a location
for additional software packages that
are not part of the standard system and
then we have standard bin directory a
directory for system binaries and
administrative tools essential for
system upkeep and then we have user
directory that contains user level
programs libraries documentation and
shared data files so these were the
directories in Linux file distribution
system and now here are the key Concepts
in file systems starting with journaling
file system so these systems maintain a
log refer to as Journal this log records
changes to files that are not yet
permanently saved on the disk this
feature is particularly useful for
recovering lost changes in the event of
a system failure and the next we have is
versioning file systems these systems
preserve earlier versions of files
essentially they save file copies based
on their previous States at specific
intervals offering a backup mechanism
that could be based on minute or hourly
updates and next we have index nodes an
i note symbolizes a file or directory
detailing attributes like size
permissions ownership and physical
locations and now we'll see the demo for
the Linux file distribution
system so for that we'll open the
terminal with Control Alt t
and
now first we'll see in which directory
we currently are in so we are in home
abisara
so first we'll move to the root
directory for that we'll write the
command CD space slash so now we have
moved to the root directory and here
we'll see what types of directories we
have we have bin Dev boot Etc op run
swap file so now we'll move to the bin
directory so in bin directory it
contains binaries or essential
executable
files so these are the binaries and
executable files that we can use in the
terminal only so
now as I will show you there's a bin and
there's sbin also this is
sbin so now we'll move to the sbin
directory for that we'll write the
command CD
sbin and here we see the directories of
sbin so what does sbin contain it
contains system binaries like Mount or
delete and the user that are used by the
root user so these binaries can be used
by the root user only and then we have
other directories that is
Library so to move to the library
directory we'll write the command CD Li
and now we'll see its
directories so what does it contains it
stores common libraries between bin and
S spin so many directories are stored in
the library directory
only so then we have another directory
that is user directory under the root
only so to move to that we'll write CD
user so it says
that so first we'll move back to the RO
directory and then we'll move to the
user
directory so it says that no such file
or
directory is present here we'll just
check
I think it's USR for
user yeah it's USR so user directory is
named as
USR we'll move to the user directory and
to see the director inside user so these
are the directories in user so user has
its own bin and sbin directory and the
binaries here are non essential binaries
and there's a local directory under user
so it contains binaries that you can
combine manually so these are all
the directories under root and you can
go to other directories also as I have
shown you the diagram of all the
directories under user or under the root
that I have shown in the previous thing
so you can check it out so in conclusion
the Linux file system with its directory
structure is a Cornerstone of the
operating system
it facilitates efficient data management
while upholding system stability and
security Linux file system is
characterized by its hierarchical tree
like structure with the root directory
at its apex various file systems in
Linux cater to different needs each with
its pros and cons the Linux directory
structure encompasses an area of
directories each designated for specific
function like system binaries boot files
device files and user files hello Tech

the link in the pin comment and
description box to find a cyber security
program that fits your experience and
areas of Interest now moving back to our
topic that is Linux versus Windows so
Linux an open- source and complimentary
operating system debuted in 1991
courtesy of lus stals while he was a
student at the University of henai
drawing its foundation from the uni
system Linux is acclaimed for its robust
stability and enhanced security and
versatile adaptability it's extensively
utilized across various platforms
including servers supercomputers mobile
devices embedded systems and desktop
computers on the other side Microsoft is
the architect behind the proprietary
operating system Windows launched
initially as Windows 1.0 in 1985 it
served as a graphical overlay for the MS
St system over the years Windows has
evolved through numerous substantial
updates this operating system is
prevalent across a broad spectrum of
devices encompassing personal computers
tablets and other similar Technologies
while Linux has established dominance in
server and supercomputer applications
Windows enjoy widespread popularity in
the personal Computing realm Windows is
often loaded for its userfriendly
interface whereas Linux is celebrated
for its formidable stability and
security features in the past few years
Linux has seen a surge in its adoption
as a desktop operating system this rise
in popularity can be attribute primarily
to the emergence of accessible and
userfriendly versions like UB 2 and mint
despite this Windows continues to
maintain its stronghold as the global
prefer desktop operating system
nevertheless Linux is steadily carving
out a significant Niche for itself in
the market now moving to the difference
between Linux versus Windows so starting
with first that is Windows uses
different data drives like CDE to store
files and folders and whereas Linux uses
a tree like a hierarchical file system
Linux files are ordered in a tree
structure starting with the root
directory whereas in Windows files are
stored in folders on different data
drives like C D or E now moving to the
next difference that is hard drives cdrs
printers are considered Ed as devices
and whereas in Linux peripherals like
hard drives cdrs printers are also
considered files in Linux or Unix
systems now moving to the next
difference that is there are four types
of user account types in Windows that is
administrator standard child and guest
whereas in Linux there are three types
of user account types regular root and
service account moving to the next
difference so Windows administrator user
has all administrative privileges of
computers and in Linux root user is the
super user and has all administrative
Privileges and now moving to the next
one so in Windows you cannot have two
files with the same name in the same
folder whereas in Linux you can have
that is the naming convention is case
sensitive the sample and the case
uppercase sample are two different files
in Linux or Unix operating system and
moving to the next difference in Windows
my documents is default home directory
whereas in Linux for every user
directory is created which is called his
home directory and talking about more so
Linux is an open source operating system
so user can change source code as per
requirement whereas Windows OS is a
commercial operating system so user
doesn't have access to source code and
Linux is very well secure as it is easy
to detect bugs and fix whereas Windows
has a huge user base so it becomes a
target of hackers to attack Windows
system and if we compare Windows File
system versus Linux file system Linux
runs faster even with older Hardware
whereas windows are slower compared to
Linux and in Linux as you can see you
can have two files with the same name
and in Linux you would find the system
and program files in different
directories whereas in Windows system
and program files are usually saved in C
drive we are diving into 50 Linux
commands that are absolute must knows
for anyone us using this powerful
operating system so let's get started
just a quick info for you if you want to
upskill yourself master cyber security
skills and land your dream job or grow
in your career then you must explore
simply learns cohort of various cyber
Security Programs simply learn offers
various certification and postgraduate
programs in collaboration with some of
the world's leading universities like
MIT I kpur EC Council and many more
through our courses you will gain
knowledge and work ready expertise in
skills like Advanced hacking con cepts
Network packet analysis ethical hacking
network security and over a dozen others
and that's not all you also get the
opportunity to work on multiple projects
and learn from industry experts working
in Top Tire product and security
companies and academicians from top
universities after completing these
courses thousands of Learners have
transitioned into a cyber security role
as a fresher or move on to higher paying
job and profile if you are passionate
about making your career in this field
then make sure to check out the link in
the pin comment M and description box to
find a cyber security program that fits
your experience and areas of Interest so
now let's get started and the first
thing we have to do is open the terminal
so we'll just press control alt p and
here's our terminal and we'll get
started with the commands now so the
First Command we'll see here is
LS so what does Ls do it list all the
files and directories in the current
directory so as as you can see we are on
the home screen only so it has listed
all them that is desktop documents
downloads music pictures public snap
templates and
videos as you could see uh so this is
the home screen and these are the
directories that are listed in the home
and that this LS command has provided
all the directories here and I'm running
the ento in the virtual box for your
information so if if you have the window
install on your system so it's well and
good and I was using Windows so I use
the virtual box to install the one two
and here we are running all the commands
and if we use LS minus Al so it will
give all the hidden directories also
hidden stuff so these are the hidden
stuff that was there so it has listed
them also so now moving on to the next
command that would be
PWD and what what does the PWD command
do it prints the current working
directory where we are working so
PWD so we are at home abisara so this is
our current working directory and now
we'll see the next command that is CD
and what does it does is change the
directory if you want to move to any
directory you can just write CD and the
name of the directory and we'll see
which one we will go to
documents we'll just write documents
and press enter so now we are in the
documents
directory and with the command CD dot
dot you will jump back to the previous
directory that is CD space dot dot oh
sorry now you have been redirected to
the previous directory that is home only
and if you want to just get back to home
you can just write CD space and click on
you'll get back to the home as we
already on the home so we have not
changed any directory and the next
command would be mkd that is to create a
new directory so for that we'll just
write mkd and the name of the new
directory what you want to create so I
will create the new directory with the
name abisal so we have created the new
directory you can check here that abar
that has been created and if you want to
remove that directory you just have to
use the command rmd space abar and press
enter and that dictive would be removed
from there that has been removed and now
we'll see the command to create a file
and this is the easiest way to create
any file so we'll just use the touch
command that is to create a file and
after touch you just have to write the
name of the file so I'll write abar do
txt so you'll see so the txt file has
been created here so here we have
cleared the terminal and now we'll see
another command to create a file that is
cat so just write cat greater than
symbol and the name of the file that
would be abr2 do
txt okay and press enter and now you can
write the content you want to insert in
this file so I'll write my name is
AAR
and today I am creating
of video in Linux
okay and after writing this you just
have to press contrl and D so this will
be inserted into your file so after
pressing the control+
D this content has been inserted so we
can just check
it you can see here that the content is
already been insert it in the file
okay so moving back now we'll see the
next command that is Echo and Echo is
mainly used to get something to display
in the terminal only or you just want to
talk to yourself you can use the echo
command so here I will write echo in
inverted commas I will write simply
learn and press enter you could see that
it has returned simply learn so it get T
the text or anything you want to display
on the terminal only and now we will see
another command that is CP and that is
used to copy files or directories so
here we'll use the command CP and here
we'll copy a file that is uh abis 2. txt
into documents so for that we'll write
CP after that the name of the file that
is abar 2 do txt
and then the folder name that was
documents and then enter now we'll check
in the documents we have the visad 2.txt
file and that has been copied into that
and the next command is MV so if you
want to move any file into any directory
you just write MV and we have the file
that is abh sr. txt this file we will
also move into docum commments so we'll
just write the name of the file that
is sir. txt
and
TT and the name of the directory in
which you want to move it so that is
documents Flash and then enter and now
we'll check it so you can see that it
has been moved so it has been moved from
home to
documents and now uh we'll see another
command that is RM that is to remove any
file or
directories so from the documents only
we'll remove the file aisar 2.txt
okay so here we'll write
rmar
2.txt
and from where you want to remove it
that is
documents
okay uh can we it's a directory okay so
we'll
just write this
command we in the home so first we'll
move
to
documents sorry
CD
documents and here we will remove the
file that is RM abar 2.txt and now if we
see that has been removed from here
and now we see another command that is
nano and that is also used to create a
file or if you have the exact file what
file name you will enter here if it's
there it will open that or else it will
create a new file so we'll write obar
3.txt
enter and here you can
directly like edit the file you could
just write the
file so you could edit it here and write
anything
that is we are learning
Linux and to save it we'll just press
crol x y and then enter so it has been
saved we learning
Linux so this is also the mode to create
a file and you would just go with the
editor directly and you could just enter
in the file and then to save it you just
have to press control x y and
enter and now uh the next command that
is shred command if you want to hide
something or you w don't want to show
any content in a file to anyone so you
will just write or use the shred command
that is shred and after that file name
that
is that is file name obar
3.txt and press enter
and we'll use cat to open
that that
isar 3. txt and press enter you can see
that it won't show any content to
anyone so after that we'll see another
command that is
htop and what does it do is uh like it's
not found here and it's not installed so
if you want to install
it you could just write this
command that
is sud
sudo to
inall HED top and press
enter and now it's asking for
password and now moving on to the next
command we will create another window
for that close these
windows close this thumbnail and in this
thumbnail we'll use the command
less and this command is used to view
the contents interactively of the
file so we'll use less and see the
contents
of. txt press enter so you could see
that the contents are I am a
and see that the content is
imisa and
now we will see another
command and for that we'll create a new
window and close the previous
Terminals and in the new terminal we'll
use the grp command that is used to
search for specific patterns or words
within the within the files so G
and then the special term that is abisa
we will search and then the file name
that is abisa do txt and press enter so
it will return the full sentence in
which that pattern is found that is I
aisar and you could see in the file that
we have aisar text and that is in the
line I'm Aisa and it has returned us
that and to the next one we'll use the
find command and with the find command
you could search for various files or
dories based on a given criteria so we
will find the ab txt file here and like
it has returned that we are in documents
only and it has returned the abis txt
file so this was about the find command
and moving on to the next command that
is to change file access permissions and
that command is
chmod so missing oint uh so we have to
add the openend also that is CH mot and
we'll write
755 and the name of the file that is
abisa do txt and press enter so the
permissions of the file have been
changed
here and what does this indicate so we
have set the file permissions of ab
visa. txt file to read write an execute
for the owner and read an execute for
other sale
and if you want to change the ownership
of the file we
will
cut and now moving to the next
terminal and here we will use the
command gzip that is to compress the
files so gzip and then the name of the
file that is
a.txt and press enter so it has been
compressed you could see that it has
been compressed and to un compress or
decompress the compressed files we'll
just write the
command gunzip and then the name of the
file that
is resert do txt and it has been
compressed so the extension has been
changed not gz and now if you see that
has been
decompressed so now we will use another
command
and now we will see another command that
is date so we'll just write date and you
could see that that date has been
printed and then we have command who am
I and it will just showcase the current
username that is abisara and the next
command is which and that is to locate a
program or command in the system path
you could just write history to get all
the commands that you have executed in
today's terminal and there's another
command that is up time so what does it
indicates is it display system up time
and load average so system has been up
from which time or how much time so that
is up
time and then there is another command
that is DF that is to display this space
usage and then we have another command
du that is to display disk usage by file
or
directory so this directory has been
using 12 memories and the next command
is you
name so un name is used to check the
complete OS information of the system so
we are using Linux here so it has
provided Linux over here and now moving
on to the next
command that is clear command if we use
use the clear command so all the things
in the terminal would be cleared so the
next command is M command the man
command displays a user manual for any
commands or utilities available in the
terminal so we'll just write MN LS and
so these are the commands that are
present in the terminal including the
name description and
options and now moving on to the next
command that is we will use the W get
command to help me download the files
from the internet so for
that if I want to download a YouTube
video just open the Firefox
browser so we just copy the URL from
here and get back to a terminal and use
the command W get and paste the URL here
and press
enter so you could see that it has
downloaded the file for
us and there's another and we will open
a new terminal for the
command that is shutdown command and for
that you just
route B for that you will just write
shut down space and now and press enter
and the system will be shut down now
only or you could just write shut down
and the exact time at which time you
want to shut down the system so it will
shut down at that point so these were
the commands for the Linux today we will
dive into the vast and vared world of

description box to find a cyber security
program that will fit your experience
and area of Interest so now moving on to
the demo part and here first we'll see
the Linux Mint website and do you know
that Linux Mint has three versions so
first we'll click on download and here
you can see the first version is cinemon
Edition and then M Edition and xfc
Edition so cinan Edition is the popular
version of lenux Min and is primarily
developed for and by Linux Mint only
like it is Sleek beautiful and full of
features it has many features and we
have a demo session for that only where
we will see the features of cinemon
version and then we have the matte
Edition that is for stable robust and
traditional purposes and then we have
xfc version that is extremely stable and
very light on resource usage so I have
installed the cinamon Edition and that
to on the Oracle virtual box so if you
want to install it you can either boot a
pen drive and install it as your main
operating system as I was running
Windows and for this demo I have
installed this so I have installed it on
the virtual box so here we'll start with
the demo for the cinamon Edition so the
first thing we'll see is first thing
we'll go for his preferences and the
display option so here in the display
option you can set the resolution for
your Cinema Edition Linux Min like
which resolution you want so I will set
this and if you want the rotation for
your display screen you can do that so
this was one of the feature and moving
on in preferences only we have one more
that is we'll see what we have yeah we
have accessibility also so in
accessibility you could either do the
large text or the smaller text
you could do for the high contrast
enable Zoom you could move to keyboard
and use visual indicator on caps and
numlock so these are the things you
could do and yeah uh like there was text
size increase or the enhancement option
we can also do with the font selection
for that we'll go
preferences in preferences
only uh there would be one phone
selection one here here you could just
select the default font also which font
you want and the size of the default
font so you could select that for the
desktop font document font monospace
window title and the text scaling Factor
so we could enlarge it according to your
requirements and now moving to other
options in preferences only we'll see
so we have Mouse and
touchpad so in Mouse and touchpad you
could just adjust the pointer size you
could see the pointer size here pointer
speed pointer size and accordingly we
have other options if you have operated
on any of the operating system you would
easily have a catch on it so I will show
you where all the like settings and all
the things you could get on so in
preferences on only or we could just
customize this panel we can just right
click on it and go to panel settings and
you could see the font size for the left
zone so this is the left Zone allow them
to determine font size and scale two or
we can just increase the icon size here
or if we go to the right zone so the
icon size will increase for these as you
can
see so this is how you could assess all
these and if you want to change the
desktop background you could easily do
it you just have to right click it and
click on change desktop
background and you could have any
pictures you want as I have the default
ones I will use this one so you could
see that the desktop has been
changed and
now uh yeah I want to tell you that
these settings
would be changed after you reboot the
system so all the settings will be lost
so now we will go to accessories and if
you want any app on the like this
navigation bar or on the desktop you
could just right click on that app and
add to panel so you could see here it
has been added to panel and you could
also unpin from panel also we have
unpinned it and in accessories like
calculator only if you want it on
desktop you could add it on desktop so
it's on desktop now so similarly you
could add any app here and now if you
want to configure menu just right click
on the menu and there's a configure
option and here you could configure it
if you want to increase the size in the
menu you could do that if you want to
change any text or add any text you
would do that and if you use want to use
any menu animation you can do that so
these are the features of Linux Mint and
if you want to capture snapshot then you
will go to
administrator and then there's a option
with time
shift and it will require a password so
for that we will enter the password so
you could create any snapshot here and
you could have recent ones also using
the wizard
option and now we'll see the driver
manager and that's also in the
administrator section so driver manager
so it will show you what are the drivers
installed on your
system so it shows that no drivers need
your computer does not need any
additional drivers in the current
landscape of cyber security the tools
wielded by professionals are crucial in

professional version offers Advanced
features for more in-depth analysis and
if we talk about the basic commands so B
suit primar uses a GUI that start by
configuring your browser to use BP as
its proxy then navigate to the site you
want to test so this is about the BB
suit now coming on the list is number
five air crack NG so Wi-Fi network
security tool and it is mostly around
for that purpose only so air crack NG is
a suit software tools specifically
designed for auditing and securing Wi-Fi
networks it's recognized for its

network analysis task and now talking
about about its userfriendly and
versatile nature although it is command
line based air crack is known for its
straightforward interface making it
accessible for both beginers and experts
and it's compatible with various
operating systems and wireless adapters
and now talking about its practical
usage and ethical hacking so primarily
used for network security assessments
aircrack NG is a go-to tool for ethical
hackers and cyber Security Professionals
for diagnosing and strengthening Wi-Fi
security protocols and we talk about its
basic command to start monitoring
networks so the command is air mode a m
n hyphen NG space start space w l n o or
zero and that's you could run the
command that's the basic command for
that and the next on the list is Jon
theer that is the Premier password
cracking tool so Jon the Raper is
renowned for its efficiency in password
cracking originally designed for Unix

additional functionality through plugins
and then we have the application in
security auditing Beyond password
recovery Jon the repper is an essential
tool for cyber Security Professionals to
conduct password strength Audits and
enforce robust password policies in
organizational networks and we talk
about its basic amount to crack password
hashes that is joone space hyphen iph
word list equal to pathore toore word
list and the sum hash hashes do text txt
that is a file name so this is the file
name that will use to conduct a password
checking so this was about the Jon the
Raper so the next on the list is Hydra
THC Hydra it's a dbit Network login
cracker Hydra often referred to an THC
Hydra is celebrated for its speed and
efficiency in cracking Network
authentication credentials it supports
numerous protocols including FTP https
SMTP SSH and more making it incredibly
versatile for various penetration
testing scenarios and it's parallelized

Hydra key features that is its ability
to perform rapid password guessing by
parallelizing attempts across multiple
threats or even across different IP
addresses significantly reducing the
time required to find successful
credentials so extensive protocol
support and flexibility so hydra's
extensive support for various protocols
coupled with its ability to be scripted
and integrated into custom workflows
making it a favorite among penetration
testers for automated and targeted Brute
Force attacks and then we have the
Practical applications and penetration
testing that is used by security analyst
to test the strength of passwords on
network services and identify potential
V abilities that could be exploited by
malicious actors it's a critical tool
for ensuring the authentication
mechanisms are robust and secure and the
basic command for this is that is for
the Hydra or txc Hydra is to perform a
Brute Force attack on an FTP server that
is Bash copy code Hydra minus I user
minus p/ paath SL2 slw list.txt
FTP SL that the port number now moving
to the next on the list is that is Zed
attack proxy o wsp zap so web
application security scanner ow ASP app
is an open- Source tool primarily used
for finding vulnerabilities in web
applications It is Well regarded for its

enables hashcat to adapt to virtually
any password cracking environment or the
requirement making it a go to solution
for Security Professionals and about its
user accessibility and Community Support
despite it Advanced capabilities hashcat
is accessible to users of varing skill
levels it benefits from a strong
Community backing and shuring regular
updates and a rich source of shared
knowledge and strategies and then we
have gidra on the list that is NSA

ucational value it's widely used for
malware analysis bability research and
understanding propriety software get is
also an excellent educational tool for
those looking to delve into the entry
cases of reverse engineering we have the
malware analysis and that two we have
talk over the increasing adoption of
cloud computing Solutions will offer
robust opportunities for both the market
of the forecast period and allow
introduction of newer Technologies the
use of cloud computing Solutions is
quickly growing worldwide o to the lower
cost of cloud-based services and the
lack of the need to set up separate it
infrastructure the penetration testing
Market is predicted to also grow in the
near future due to the increasing use of
cloud-based Solutions and services for
multiple workloads be it email data
backups CRM and collaborative Services
Cloud deployment exposes software to
more vulnerability and makes it more
accessible to unauthorized users this is
where penetration testing for security
testing comes in with handheld devices
seeming to be the primary device of
choice for the future one such framework
that facilitates this service is the
offensive security back kalii net Hunter
so let's take a look at the topics to be
covered in today's video on Khali net
Hunter we start with a small
introduction to what Kali net Hunter is
followed by going through the different
versions of Kali net Hunter we then
learn about the different components in
the Khali framework and some of the most
helpful attacks or features that are
featured in this
distribution finally we take a look at
the pros and cons of K net Hunter as a
whole before we get started with the
video be sure to subscribe to our
channel for more videos like this and
hit the Bell icon to never miss an
update again so let's get started with
what is khi net
Hunter khi net Hunter is the very first
Android penetration testing framework
for Android smartphones because net
Hunter is an open source project
developers can freely utilize it without
fearing copyright infringement or other
threats the project grants access to the
kalii toolkit to compatible Android
devices which allows penetration testing
furthermore net Hunter provides several
unique capabilities unavailable on other
Hardware
platforms a userland refers to space
outside of an operating system kernel
meaning anything that doesn't have root
access we can use an app to system
supported on Nexus or OnePlus and rooted
Android phones while this is pretty
incredible there are some limitations to
this in general you can communicate with
the instance of whatever Linux device
you want via SSH or VNC using kly net
Hunter the best device for hackers is an
Android phone installed by K Linux
because mobile phones are more
convenient and portable than laptops for
personal purposes the net Hunter
interface also allows users to work
easily with complicated configuration
files through a local web Apache
interface aside from this functionality
modified Kernels at Android 802.11
wireless injections and securely linked
preconfigured VPN Services comprise a
strong network security breakthrough and
a separate Dropbox with K Linux
constantly at your
disposal we now have a basic
understanding of what K Linux net Hunter
is however there isn't a single
distribution to learn about here K Linux
net Hunter has multiple different
versions depending on the device at the
hands of the users let's cover them in
more detail
so let's cover them in more
detail while K net Hunter functions as a
portable operating system designed for
penetration testing there can be other
tools you want that isn't pre-installed
to solve this problem there is a net
Hunter store at the address store.net
hunter.com this function is the same as
a Google Play Store on Android or app
stores on iPhones except the difference
is that the tools in this repository are
more in line with ethical hacking and
net BR
penetration the first of the three
versions that net Hunter provides is the
net Hunter rootless this works on almost
all devices without any issues the
number of tools available in this
version is the lowest among the three we
then have net Hunter light which
requires root privileges to work
properly it doesn't need any custom
kernel flashing to power up and has
comparatively more tools than net Hunter
rootless finally we have the original
net Hunter package with all the tools
available at its disposal however your
device must have root privileges and the
custom net Hunter kernel to install this
version as we can clearly see the more
open our device settings and preferences
are the more tools K net Hunter can work
with root privileges provide
administrative access to many
functionalities that net Hunter can
leverage and ultimately perform Network
penetration with some tools are
exclusive to the original net Hunter
core and net Hunter light so you may
have to cross shake your requirements
before installing any version on your
device now that we have covered the
different versions of kinet Hunter let
us cover its different components and
how they help in the working of this
distribution we look at the various net
Hunter components which are effectively
the building pieces of net Hunter's
operation net Hunter's room comprises of
various pieces that communicate and rely
on one another to function properly
below you will look at the three
components that comprise net Hunter the
first is a modified Android kernel
followed by net Hunter Android app and
finally but not least the K Linux chro
itself let's examine these in
depth the program that provides a UI to
simplify the user task is a graphical
component of net Hunter which is its
Android app the software provides a
straightforward interface for
controlling the K Linux CH rout the fact
that it has a simple UI does not imply
that it is not capable of Performing
comp it tasks this application contains
all the configuration files necessary by
net Hunter and is transferred to the SD
card during the first run aside from the
UI the program also serves as a bootup
service allowing the server to activate
when the device boots
up the next in line is a custom Android
kernel the kernel is a system component
that allows applications to link to
Hardware that meet users needs aside
from facilitating communication the
kernel also Main maintain system
resources Now the default kernels inside
Android do not supply at all utilities
for security and
exploitation still with a custom Android
kernel any device can empowered with
unique features which are not accessible
in the stock
bu now we have the Ki CH rout CH root is
essentially a full K Lance installation
that allows Android to share network
storage and other resources the K Linux
Chu is effectively the heart of net
Hunter and the configuration settings
have been updated so that net Hunter
functions seamlessly with the Android
ecosystem net Hunter has a CH manager
that simplifies the download and
installation of Chu this component is
stored in an internal app storage region
and one must meet the installation space
requirements now that you have covered
the different components of Kali net
Hunter let us cover some of the tools
that distribution offers that may be
used in penetration
testing at the top of the chain ize nmap
nmap stands for network mapper and is a
free and open source utility for network
discovery and security auditing many
systems and network administrators who
also find it useful for tasks such as
Network inventory managing service
upgrade schedules and monitoring host or
service up time it is most beneficial in
the early stage of exploitation where a
hacker must figure out the possible
entry point to a system before running
the necessary exploits uses raw IP
packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network what
services are being run what hosts are
offering Etc it was designed to scan
large networks but it also works fine
against single host moving on we have
mitm framework mitm or man in the workk
framework provides a One-Stop shop for
man in the middle and network attacks
while updating and improving existing
attacks and techniques originally built
to address the significant shortcomings
of other tools has been almost complet
ritten from scratch to provide a modular
and easily extendable framework that
anyone can use to implement their own
version of a Man inth the-middle attack
it contains built-in SMB HTTP and DNS
servers that can be controlled and used
by various
plugins the next tool at hand is the CeX
manager it stands for the Khali desktop
experience K net Hunter desktop
experience puts the Ki Linux desktop in
the palm of your hand it provides the
the graphical user interface or GUI of
Kali desktop on your Android device
making penetration relatively easier for
people not comfortable with the command
line however the major tools all include
command line functions so this is more
of a convenience inclusion rather than a
functional one finally we have
Metasploit the metas framework is a very
powerful tool that can be used by cyber
criminals as well as ethical hackers to
prove systemic vulnerabilities on
networks and servers because it's an
open source framework it can be easily
customized and used with most operating
systems with Metasploit the ethical
hacking team can use rate or custom code
and introduce it into a network to probe
for weaker spots as another flavor of
threat hunting once the flaws are
identified and documented the
information can be used to address
systemic weaknesses and prioritize
Solutions we now have a very clear
understanding of what K net Hunter is
and its features let's cover some of the
pros and cons of this particular
framework when it comes to the
advantages net Hunter provides features
that are not by default included in the
original kernels of Android Fones the
new tools can be used to perform Network
penetration and system checks for
security
vulnerabilities qualcom checks and
Snapdragon have monitor support enabled
monitor mode helps listen to wireless
traffic and capture data packets which
can then be unencrypted and snooped
on the Kernel build presence assess the
easy creation of kernels that are not
yet available to the public similarly
the use of gitlab C or command line
interface speeds up the release
timelines it allows the input of other
developers making the bug squashing
process easier and the development of
the tools more
collaborative the human interface device
Hardware is fully supported by default
but it must be enabled and configured
through user Space
controls so when it comes to the
disadvantages of K net Hunter so not
every Android phone is supported as part
of the official net Hunter release
therefore be cautious while downloading
and running them since the wrong net
Hunter may break the phone in some very
rare
circumstances because some internal
Wi-Fi systems do not allow monitor mode
or data packet injection an external USB
Wi-Fi adapter may be required for some
devices who want to pursue wireless
network penetration Professionals in
security testing penetration testing and
ethical hacking utiliz l as the
preferred operating system provides
several configurable distributions that
me May configure based on your end use K
Linux and parat Os are two popular
penetration testing
distributions while these operating
systems each have unique offerings the
overall Choice can differ between
Personnel thanks to the various tools
and Hardware specifications today we
will look at both these distributions
and settle on the perfect choice for
each type of user let's go through the
agenda for this
video we will learn about K Linux and
pilot security Os from scratch while
understanding their primary selling
points as a Linux distribution catered
towards penetration testers next we know
about some features of these operating
systems that stand out of their
package finally we directly compare K
Linux and Par security OS thereby making
a clear-cut conclusion on which OS is
perfect on a per requirement basis
so let's start by learning about K Linux
from a ground
level K Linux which is formerly known as
backtrack Linux is an open- Source Linux
distribution aimed at Advanced
penetration testing and security
auditing it contains several hundred
tools targeted towards various
information security tasks such as
penetration testing security research
computer forensics and reverse
engineering K Linux is a multiplatform
solution accessible and freely available
to Information Security Professionals
and
hobbyists among all the Linux
distributions K Linux takes its roots
from the Debian operating system Debian
has been a highly dependable and a
stable distribution for many years
providing a similarly strong Foundation
to the K Linux
desktop while the operating system can
practically modify every single part of
our installation the networking
components of K Linux come disabled by
default this is done to prevent any
external factors from affecting the
installation procedure which may pose a
risk in critical environments apart from
boosting security it allows a more
profound element of security control to
the most enthusiastic of
users now let's take a look at par
security operating
system paret security OS is a Dean based
Linux distribution with an emphasis on
security
privacy and development it is built on
the Demian testing branch and uses a
custom Harden Linux
kernel par security contains several
hundred tools targeted towards tasks
such as penetration testing computer
forensics reverse engineering and
security research it is seen as a
generally lightweight distribution that
can work under rigorous hardware and
software
specifications it features a distinct
forensic mode that does not Mount any of
the syst systems hard diss or partitions
and has no influence on the host system
making it much more stealy than its
regular occurrence this mode is used on
the host system to execute forensic
procedures a rolling release is a
paradigm in which software upgrades are
rolled out constantly rather than in
batches of versions and software
development this ensures that the
software is constantly up to date a
rolling release distribution such as
parot security OS follows the same
concept it provides the most recent
Linux kernel and software versions as
soon as they become
available with a basic introduction to
the operating systems out of the way let
us take a look at the unique features of
both K Linux and parro security
OS the latest version of K Linux comes
with more than 600 penetration tools
pre-installed after reviewing every tool
included in backtrack developers have
eliminated a significant number of tools
that either simply did not work or
duplicated other tools that provided the
same and similar
functionality the K Linux team comprises
a small group of individuals who are the
only ones trusted to commit packages and
interact with the repositories all of
which is done using multiple secure
protocols restricting access of critical
code basis to external assets
dramatically reduces the risk of source
contamination which can cause C Linux
users worldwide a great deal of damage
as a direct victim of cyber
crime although penetration tools tend to
be written in English the developers
have ensured that Kali includes proper
multilingual support allowing more users
to operate in the native language and
locate the tools they need for their job
the more comfortable a user feels with
the intricacies of the operating system
the easier it is to maintain a
stronghold over the configuration and
the device in general
since arm-based single board systems
like the Raspberry Pi are becoming more
prevalent and inexpensive the
development team knew that kali's armm
support would need to be as robust as
they could manage with fully working
installations Kali Linux is available on
a wide range of armm devices and has
armm repositories integrated with the
mainline distribution so the tools for
armm are updated in conjunction with the
rest of the
distribution let's take a look at some
of the features of parat security
operating system
now along with the giant catalog of
scripts parad security OS has its own
hardened Linux kernel modified
explicitly to provide as much security
and resistance to hackers as possible in
the first line of
defense the configurations in the
operating system Act is the second gate
view taking care of malicious requests
and dropping them off this is
particularly beneficial since should
there be a scenario where the latex
Linux kernel is causing some particular
issue the paratos development team will
most likely iron it out first before
passing it on as an
update if the custom hardal kernel was
inreasing enough pallet security
developers managed to install more
hacking tools and scripts to ensure a
smooth transition for the KH Linux users
all the tools you find in Kali are
present in parent to us and a few extra
ones for good measure and this has been
achieved while keeping roughly the same
operating system size between both of
them however it's not all productivity
points for pirate OS they provide a
choice between two different desktop
environments mate which comes
pre-installed by default and KDE for
those unfamiliar with Linux terminology
you can think of desktop environments as
the main UI for a distribution being
highly modular in nature one can use par
security OS while adding another desktop
environment that they find appealing
while K Linux has only a single option
par security has provided two optimized
builds with M desktop and KD
desktop one of the primary advantages of
parro os over Kali Linux is that it's
relatively lightweight this implies that
it takes significantly less dis space
and computing power to function
correctly with as little as 320 MB of
ram required in reality paratos is
designed to operate successfully off a
USB stick but K Linux does not work well
from a USB Thrive and is generally
installed in a virtual machine parat is
more of a niche distribution if you're
searching for something lighter than K
Linux features are great but what about
Performance Real World metrics let us
compare both these operating systems
directly with respect to their Hardware
specifications and usability in in the
end we can decide on what distribution
is fit for each type of
user for our first point of comparison
let's take a look at the ram required
for Optimum performance of the operating
system which is highly essential when
trying to crack hashes or something of
similar nature rme usage is a very
important facet while K Linux demands at
least 1 GB of RAM Paras secur can
operate optimally with a minimum of 320
MB of
RAM for correctly displaying graphical
elements K Linux requires GPU based
acceleration while this is not the case
with parent security OS which doesn't
require any graphical acceleration
needed from the user
side once these operating systems are
installed on VMware using the live boot
isos they take up a minimum amount of
hard disk storage both of these
operating systems have a recommended dis
storage of minimum of 20 GB in K Linux
and a minimum of 15 GB in parent
security so they can install all the
tools necessary in the ISO
file when it comes to the category and
the selection of tools K Linux has
always been the first in securing every
single tool available for hackers in the
penetration testing industry parro
Security on the other hand has managed
to take it up up a
notch while specializing in Wireless pen
testing parage security makes it a point
that all the tools that K Linux provides
has been included in the iso while
simultaneously adding some extra tools
that many users will have to install
from thirdparty sources in K
Linux being a decade old penetration
testing distribution K Linux has formed
up a very big Community with strong
support signature par Security on the
other hand is still growing and it is
garnering much more interest among
veteran penetration testers and ethical
hackers a primary drawback of car Linux
is the extensive Hardware requirement to
perform optimally it requires higher
memory than parro security it also needs
graphical acceleration while demanding
more virtual hardk Storage parro
security on the other hand was initially
designed to run off a USB drive directly
thereby requiring very minimal
requirements from a hardware perspective
like just 320 MB of RAM and no graphical
acceleration needed this means par
security is much more feasible for
people who are not able to devote
massive resources to either their
virtual machine or on their laptop hard
disk
directly with the comparison done
between both of these operating systems
let's take a look at the type of users
both of these are catered
to one can go with K Linux if they want
the extensive Community Support offered
by its users if they want to go with a
trusted development team that have been
working on this distribution since many
years if they have a powerful system
which can run K Linux optimally without
having to bottleneck performance and if
they are comfortable with a
semi-professional environment which may
or may not be very useful for new
beginners one can decide to go with par
security if they want to go with a very
lightweight and distribution that can
run pretty much on all
systems it also has a lot of tools
pre-installed and some of them are not
even present on G
Linux it is much more suitable for
underpowered DS where users do not have
a lot of Hardware resources to provide
to the operating system and thereby it
is much more feasible for people with
underpowered laptops or no graphical
acceleration compared to K Linux parad
secur ities desktop environment is also
relatively easier to use for new
beginners for people who are just
getting into ethical hacking par
security does a relatively better job of
introducing them to the operating system
and to the various toools without having
to dump them into the entire
intricacies if you are a Linux developer
or you are preparing for a Linux
developer role so this video is for you
hello everyone and welcome back to
another video by simply learn this is
anub and in this video we will be
learning about lenux interview questions
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and
press the Bell icon so you will never
miss any update from Simply learn so
without further Ado let's begin and see
what's in it for
you first we will see the introduction
to Linux after that we will see Trends
and recent changes in Linux commands
moving ahead we will see how to become a
Linux developer after that we will see
the opportunities and salaries of Linux
developers and after that we will see
Linux command interview
questions Linux platform gives its open
source Natures has integrated a wide
range of innovation Minds who have given
their best to introduce world changing
ideas into reality
Linux is basically an operating system
which is popular for its efficiency as
well as its
performance it can run on various
Hardware platforms manufactured by IBM
Intel and
HB now let's see some Trends and recent
changes in Linux
commands Linux is supercomputing the
development and deployment of Linux
powered supercomputers is a trend that
shows no signs of abing given the
flexibility structure of the Linux
system as well as the compatibilities it
has the usage of Linux as a super
computer operating system is guaranteed
to remain one of the most important
Linux Trends in
2022 let's see the next Point New Linux
based
Hardware the Linux platform has gained a
repulsion since Raspberry Pi and
Chromebooks gained the attention of the
particular domain of viewers these Linux
based components are breaking new
grounds as the new pass thanks to their
small from size and ability to perform
routine task with ease the platform has
now witnessed Advanced implementations
throughout the prior calendar year now
the next point we will be discussing is
the cloud and the Linux although Linux
is popular in the technological
Community it is going to continue to
increase in popularity in line with the
open-minded techniques of
2022 as cloud-based Technologies and the
Linux system are so interconnected the
Linux system is expected to grow with
the cloudbased alternative now let's see
the next point which is Chromebooks and
Chrome OS Chrome OS has transformed into
the most flexible operating system
available in the market Chrome OS just
obtain the ability to connect with
Google Play Store and run just about any
Android app giving user one of the most
trained web ciruit experience possible
talking into consideration the
improvements on the operating system it
is too soon going to be on a quick
survey towards possibilities becoming
the most flexible platform compatible on
running Android and Linux
softwares now let's see how to become a
Linux developer
let us take a look at the required
skills needed to make a career as a
Linux developer first one is learn C
programming the first and the foremost
thing which is needed is learn C
programming most of the part of Linux
are written and C if you want to
contribute lowlevel parts of the system
you should know the Assembly Language as
well however intentionally it is
important to learn the C language next
step is to learn algorithms and data
structure to become a Linux developer
you should have a fundamental knowledge
of data structure and algorithms and
algorithm is basically a step-by-step
approach to solve a particular problem
on the other hand data structure works
on organizations data both these
components help the programmers to solve
the problem within a
minute The Next Step you should learn is
operating
system now that you have have acquir
some knowledge of the programming the
next thing on your to-do list should be
learn everything about the operating
system and then do some
programming competitive programming can
help you Master's algorithms and data
structures it also shows you how to
solve a program in a short period of
time a competitive programmer must be
able to solve an issue in a short amount
of time now let's see the opportunities
and salaries of Linux
programmers when it comes to Linux
professionals you have two choices you
can either work towards becoming a
developer or you can go into
Administration furthermore the
professional option are not limited to
Linux platform they Encompass the wide
range of application the following are
the areas where hiring managers are
looking for hiring Linux developers
first one is system architecture Linux
system architecture salary in India rang
between 6.3 lakhs to 44 lakh with an
average annual salary of 21.1 lakhs the
next one is system administration the
average salary of a system
administration in India range between R
2.4 lakh perom to rupes 4.5 lakh perom
the next one
is web developer and development Linux
developer average annual salary in India
range from rupees 3 lakh to 8.9
lakhs and for desktop and app
development every starting salary for
Linux developer and app developer is in
India is rupees 3 lakh per year now
we'll move ahead with the Linux command
interview questions the first question
that we will discuss is what is Linux
Linux is a uni based open source
operating system lenux to walls was the
first to introduce Linux
the primary goal of Linux was to give a
free and lowcost operating system for
people who couldn't buy Windows iOS or
Unix now the next question is Define
Linux kernel is it legal to edit Linux
kernel the answer is the Linux kernel is
a low-level Software System it is used
to keep track of resources and give a
user
interface yes it is legal to edit Linux
kernel Linux is released under the
journal public license which is GPL and
any project which is released under GBL
can be edited and Modified by the end
users let's move on to the next
question which is what is l
l l l denotes Linux loader it is
basically Linux boot loader which loads
Linux operating system into a main
memory to start execution most of the
computer systems are featured with boot
loaders for certain versions for Mac OS
or Windows OS so if you want to use
Linux OS you have to install a special
boot loader for it when a computer gets
started bios conducts small initial test
and transfer control to the master Boot
Road for from here L loads the Linux OS
and started the benefit of utilizing L
loo is that it ensures a quick boot of
the Linux operating system moving ahead
let's move on to the next question which
is what are the basic components of
Linux the following are the basic
components of Linux first one is
shell it is a Linux interpreter which is
used for executing commands the next one
is Kernel kernel is the co-art of the
operating system which is used to manage
hardware and
operations after that the next one is
system utilities these are the software
functions which help users to manage
their computers the next one is GUI GUI
donates graphical user interface through
which the user can interact with the
system but unline CLI GUI compresses
buttons images and text boxes for
interaction the next one is application
programs software programs are designed
to complete a particular
task now the next question is which
shell are used in
Linux the following are the most common
types of shell used in Linux the first
one is fish friendly interactive shell
offers some special features such as web
based configuration fully scriptable and
auto suggestions with clean scripts the
next one is Bash borine again shell is
the default for most of the Linux
distributions the next one is zsh z
shell offers unique features like
starter files file name generation login
or log out watching and closing comments
the next one is
CHS C shell follows C like syn and has
features like spelling correction as
well as job
control now let's move on to the next
question what is swab space swab space
is the extra space utilized by Linux to
temporarily keep concurrently running
processes when Ram space is sufficient
when you start a program it is stored in
Ram so that the CPU can quickly retrieve
data
if you have more running programs then
Ram can accommodate the swap space is
used to store these programs the
processor will now search for the RAM
and swap space for data swap space is
used in the form of execution of ram by
Unix let's move on to the next question
which is differentiate between dos and
Bash Bash is a command which is SC
sensitive and do commands are not K
sensitive in bash there are eight
characters for file name post fixed with
three characters for the extension and
in DOS no naming conventions are used
again bash is used as an escape
character and dos is used in the form of
directory
spater now let's move on to the next
question which is what is file
permission
in Linux the following are the three
types of permission in Linux first one
is the read it allows its user to open
and read the file the next one is right
it allows its user to open and edit the
file and the third and the last one is
execute it allows its user to run the
file the next question
is what are iode and process ID iode is
is a unique name provided by the
operating system for each file similarly
process ID is also a unique ID provided
to each
process what are Linux directory
commands given below are the five main
directory commands in Linux the first
one is pwt it displays the path of the
present working directory the next next
one is is list all the directories and
files in the present working directory
CD it is used for changing the present
working directory
rmd it deletes a directory and
mkd it is used to create a new directory
mkd is also known as make
directory now let's move on to the next
question
what are the various processes States in
Linux given below are the process states
of
Linux the first one denotes ready the
process is ready to
run the second one running is the
process has been
executed the third one is wait or
blocked this shows the process is
waiting for the input after that it's
completed or
terminated this process shows com the
process is completed execution or was
terminated by the system the last one is
zombie the process terminated by the
information is still available in the
process
table let's move on to the next
question what are Process Management
System calls the following are the
system calls used to manage the process
the first function is Fork function it
is used for creating a new process then
next is a exec function which is used
for executing a new program the third
one is a wait function wait until the
process completes the
execution after that it's exit function
it is used to exit from the process
after that it's get P ID function get
the unique process ID of the
process and the last one is get PP ID
function gets the parent process unique
ID let's move on to the next
question what are the redirection
operators the redirection operator is
used for redirecting the output of the
specific command as an input to another
command the following are the two ways
to use this the first one is this symbol
which is overwrites the files existing
content or creates a new one the second
one is the symbol which shows the add
the new content to the end of an
existing file or create a new
one let's move on to the next question
which is explain a latch a latch is a
temporary storage of device that is
controlled by a training signal which
can be either stored as zero or or One A
latch is a primarily used to retain
State information and has two stable
States high output or one or low output
or zero as long as a latch is powered on
it can store one piece of
data the next question is what is
microprocessor a microprocessor is a
device which is used for
execution instructions it is is a single
chip device that fetches the
instructions from the memory decodes it
and executes it the following are the
three basic functions which are carried
out by a
microprocessor the first one is addition
substraction multiplication and division
are example of mathematical operations
the next one is make decision based on
the circumstances and then jump to the
new different instructions as needed
last one is move data from one position
in memory to
another now let's move on to the next
question how to rename files in Linux
there is no such particular command for
renaming a file in Linux however you can
use the copy or move command to renew a
file the First Command which we use is
move command
we write it like dollar sign MV which
donates at move old name and then the
new name of the file like this only we
will write a copy command in that there
will be a dollar sign CP means copy old
name of the file and then the new name
of the file like that only if we want to
delete a command we'll write dollar sign
RM which donates as remove and the file
name let's move on to the next
question how to write the output of a
command to a file you have to use the
redirection operator to do this write
dollar sign the command which you want
to use and the greater sign and then the
file
name the next question is how to copy
files to a floppy dis the following
steps will guide you to copy file to a
floppy dis the first one is Mount to
floppy disk the second one is copy the
files and the last one is unmount the
floppy
disc let's move on to the next
question how should we identify which
shell you are
using open the terminal and run dollar
sign e CH o which which is Echo then
again dollar sign and shell all in
capital let's move on to the last and
final question for this interview
question
series how would you sort the entities
in a text file in ascending order you
can do this by using the sort command
for this you have to write the dollar
sign sort sample. text sample do text is
the file name that I'm using here you
can use the name of your file you which
you want to do a sending order operation
