hey guys welcome back to another video
by learn in this session we gonna learn
all about unions in c
and while we are at it please leave us a
like if you find our content helpful and
a sub to the channel would be
appreciated so now without any further
delay let's begin
this session will help you to understand
what unions is in c then let's
understand the union definition in c
after that let's see how to create a
union variable later on how to access
members of a union
now let's begin by understanding what a
union is in c
union is a special data type that holds
elements of different data types at the
same memory location
the concept of structure and unions are
the same however the only difference is
in terms of storage space and the
keyword so for unit declaration we use
the keyword union
now let's have a look at a union
definition in c
the union definition starts with a
keyword union and is followed by tag
name or union name then a list of union
members inside the curly brackets and
finally a union variable declaration for
example
the definition begins with a keyword
union then student as a tag name and the
union members are name of typecad and
age of type int followed by s1 as a
union variable name
now we know how to declare members of a
unit yet the memory is not allocated to
these union members moving ahead let's
look at the creation of a union variable
similar to the concept of structures in
c even in union memories are located
once the variable is created and the
union variables are created to access
and assign the values of a union members
in c
the syntax to declare union variable is
as given below it starts with a keyword
union followed by tag name then a list
of union variables
for example
the keyword union then tag name
student followed by the variable s1
now let's consider the below given
example and understand how the
structures in c is different from the
unions
as i discussed before the only
difference between structure and union
is in terms of memory space
in structures the memories are located
separately for every single structure
member
in a union memories are located at the
same location for all the members of a
union the highest memory space of a
member is considered and memories are
located
in this example we have members name and
age as a type care and int respectively
so with this example let's understand
the difference between structure and
union elements in the memory
once the variable is created the memory
for the members are allocated
in that case the memory will be
allocated for s1.name and s1.h
as we know the size of a car is one byte
so according to the size of a name four
bytes of memory space will be allocated
and two bytes for each
so the total memory allocated is 14
bytes
in the case of union the memory for the
element's name and age will be allocated
at the same location
so
in this example the highest memory space
of an element is considered that is the
size of an element name is 12 bytes
now let's look at how to access the
members of a union
we use the period operator to assign
values and access the union members
the syntax that we follow to access the
unit members are union uninvariable dot
union member
to an example let's see how to assign
values
so we have s1 as a variable name
followed by a dot operator then h is a
union member and with the help of the
assignment operator we assign a value
and to access the member we have an
example s1.h
now let's execute a simple program
from this program we are going to find
the difference between structure and
union in terms of size we have same list
of members in both structure and union
so we're going to find the size it's
occupying in the memory now let's run it
as you can see the name in union occupy
largest memory so the total size of
union student is 12 and structure
occupies this as 20. i hope it's clear
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the unions in c
programming i hope the session was
informative and interesting until next
time thank you stay safe and keep
learning
