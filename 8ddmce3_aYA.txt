1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,120
in this video you're going to learn how

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,000
you can use the power ai vision toolkit

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
this toolkit allows you to build deep

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,560
learning systems with ease without

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
having to worry about any of the

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,439
architectures code or even underlying

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,800
infrastructure

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,039
best part is that you don't even need to

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,439
worry about getting the toolkit set up

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
because the nimix cloud platform allows

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,399
you to spin up an instance of power ai

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
vision on the hardware of your

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,200
preference instantly

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
so hello there and welcome to another

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,760
tutorial my name is tanya bakshi and

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
this time we're going to be going over

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,480
how you can use the power ai vision

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,160
platform on nimbics in order to create a

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,039
cat dog classifier neural network now

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,480
this is very interesting essentially

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,160
what we're going to do is we're going to

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,480
train out an entire neural network

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,840
system and deploy it as a rest api it's

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
going to help us do image classification

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
in the cat dog classification task that

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,920
you may have seen by watson visual

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,799
recognition video but the best part is

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,799
that we're not going to be using any

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,600
code at all and not only are we going to

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,520
be using a watson visual recognition

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,759
kind of system rather we're going to be

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,960
using power ai vision which uses neural

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,759
network technology specifically to give

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
you all the raw statistics uh the

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
metrics of how great your neural network

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
system is running it gives you the

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
estimated time train and all that other

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,159
valuable information that you need while

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,400
you're training your model this is

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,479
actually hosted on the nimbix cloud

41
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
platform with their powerful jarvis tool

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
in fact there's going to be an entirely

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,399
separate video about jarvis and how it

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,720
works and how you can use its rest api

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
to control the nimix cloud platform spin

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
up jobs all that kind of stuff in a

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,280
separate tutorial but for today we're

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,600
going to be using the power ai vision

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,159
platform again because it's powered by

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,920
the power ai toolkit which is

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,640
essentially an ibm modified version of a

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,720
bunch of different open source tools

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,520
like tensorflow caf and so much more

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,599
that are optimized to run on the power

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
platforms that means that the neural

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,520
networks that you're trying are running

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
as fast as they possibly can on power

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
hardware they've been optimized for it

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
and of course you've got powerful nvidia

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
gpus going behind that training and of

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
course the powerful nv link between the

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,200
cpu and gpu allows you to have faster

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
memory transfer speeds as well but

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,680
that's not talking about power ai and

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,519
now what i'd like to do is get over

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,519
straight into the programming part where

67
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,440
i show you how you can use the nimix

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,519
cloud platform to start the power ai

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
vision tool and then from there train

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,959
neural network in under around five to

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,040
ten minutes all right so now let's get

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
to the programming part

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
all right so welcome back to the

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
programming part and now we're going to

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,400
take a look at how you can actually

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,040
implement this system let's get started

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
so now as i mentioned we're going to be

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,680
using the dog cat data set uh as i did

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
in my watson visual recognition tutorial

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
there will be a link to that in the

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
description below

82
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
however now as you can see i've already

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,319
gone ahead and downloaded the data set

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,959
i've unzipped it from its archive and as

85
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,560
you can see kaggle provides us with 12

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,040
500 images of cats and 12 500 images of

87
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,200
dogs so if i just keep scrolling down

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,440
here you'll see all the thousands of

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
cats and dogs that we have

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,760
now these are all to be used to train

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,319
the machine learning algorithm

92
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,879
however there's a small catch with the

93
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,440
power ai vision i don't want to upload

94
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
say twelve thousand five hundred for

95
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
each category right now because for the

96
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
videos purpose that'll take a little bit

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,959
of time to upload so what i'm going to

98
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,239
be doing for now is i'm going to be

99
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,680
uploading say

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
around 1500 to 2 000 images per category

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,560
and we'll take a look at what our

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,799
performance is like at the time and

103
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,319
depending on that we can either give

104
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,720
more if we're not satisfied or if we are

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
satisfied uh we will be good to go to

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
deploy with a rest api let's begin so

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,120
first thing that i'm going to do is

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,200
let's just say i want two thousand so

109
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,040
since we're starting at an index of zero

110
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,000
that's gonna be our

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,560
1999 images cats and then the same for

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
dogs so i'm just gonna scroll down until

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
we get the correct number of cats

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,759
right click new folder with selection

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
and i'm going to name these right as

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
it's done moving

117
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,840
as

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
cat

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
all right there we go it's almost done

120
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,960
moving those into a separate

121
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,600
well folder

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
uh oh perfect done

123
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
it's a little bit uh intensive all right

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,199
so there we go we've got our first

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,800
folder down

126
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
let's just scroll down and

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,800
right as we reach docs we're going to do

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,320
the exact same thing for dogs we're

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,199
going to select from the zeroth dog

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,520
to the

131
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,160
1999th dog

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
somewhere here's our partition

133
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
right there perfect

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
all right so just scroll down

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
a little bit too far

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
perfect so just right around here we

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,680
should see

138
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,120
1 999 there we go right click new folder

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
with selection once again 2 000 images

140
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,960
of dogs there we go it's moving it all

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,639
into a separate folder

142
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
right as that's done we'll name both

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
folders accordingly as they should cat

144
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,840
and dog number one being cat number two

145
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,039
being doc

146
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,039
and then we'll be training the machine

147
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,960
learning system itself all right so cat

148
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
and

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,039
if we just scroll back down again

150
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,039
we can see over here dog perfect we've

151
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,440
got our two folders which if we sort by

152
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
the kind of

153
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,520
file we should be able to see there we

154
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,400
go cat and dog folders each containing 2

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
000 images that are entirely unique and

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,960
we are now ready to train the power ai

157
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,759
vision system now before we can actually

158
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,400
start using power ai vision we have to

159
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,199
see where we can actually host it itself

160
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,199
so now i'm actually using the nimbics

161
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,400
cloud platform to host power ai vision

162
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
on the mimic style platform if i want to

163
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
train this cat dog classifier and i want

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
to spin up an instance power ai vision

165
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,479
it's as simple as quite literally

166
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,199
clicking on power ai vision telling it

167
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,960
what kind of hardware i want to run at i

168
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
can scale from 1k80 to 4k 80s all the

169
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
way up to four p100 gpus if i want to

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
and again since it's powered by power8

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,919
architecture we've also got nv link that

172
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,039
we can use

173
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,199
alright so i am going to click on let's

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,319
just say one p 100 gpu as power ai

175
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,800
vision does not use multi gpus yet we're

176
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
also going to get 128 gigs of ram and in

177
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,000
total 32 threads from this power 8

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,759
processor again one of the great parts

179
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,919
about power is we is that we've got a

180
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,919
lot higher threads per core

181
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,080
and so now we are able to submit

182
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,800
and there we go now you might wonder

183
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,319
well we were using power 8 here isn't

184
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,240
power 9 out shouldn't we be using power

185
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,280
nine and well yes the mix cloud platform

186
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
is indeed getting support for power nine

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
currently in fact they're going to be

188
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,160
hosting the ac 922

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,599
nodes if you were to take a look at that

190
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,199
online those are essentially the new

191
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,039
power nine nodes that ibm is coming out

192
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,120
with those is the highest end ones or

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,599
one of the highest end ones uh they have

194
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,560
two power nine cpus to run really

195
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
massively parallel operations on cpu as

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
well and all the way from two to six v

197
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,599
100 gpus instead of the pascal 100 gpus

198
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,280
that we're using with power eight

199
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
servers right now anyway but that's

200
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,000
going to be released very soon for now

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,639
let's use power 8 and the p100 gpus

202
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,960
already provided to us and let's start

203
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,479
by clicking on the click here to connect

204
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,120
button that's all we had to do nimix has

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,960
brought up the power ai vision tool and

206
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
there we go just like that i can start

207
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,199
using it so what i'm going to do is i'm

208
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,840
going to create a new data set and now

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
as you can see either i can run an

210
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
object detection task or i can run an

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,560
image classification task there's going

212
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
to be another video on the object

213
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,879
detection task for now let's open up the

214
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,160
image classification task

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
all right so as you can see i can choose

216
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
the data sets name let's just say

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,680
cat dog i can tell it which scenario

218
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,200
we're running i'm just going to click on

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,120
other and not give it much information

220
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,039
assuming this is some kind of arbitrary

221
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
use case and of course cat dog isn't in

222
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,959
this list either

223
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,360
i click on add data set and just give it

224
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,200
around a minute

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
and it's going to process that and

226
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
create a new data set for you

227
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
once it creates a new data set you have

228
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,240
two options either a you can zip up both

229
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
those folders bring some json

230
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
information of the data set itself into

231
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,560
that and then send it over to power ai

232
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,440
vision or you can upload the raw images

233
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,560
themselves

234
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
now what i usually do is i actually

235
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
upload a new data set with the zipped

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,880
the actually zipped folders or files so

237
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
let's go ahead and do that now so as you

238
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,519
can see we've created a new blank data

239
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,040
set let's just add a category dog

240
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,360
and let's also add a category

241
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
cat

242
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
all right there we go now what i'm going

243
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,160
to do is even though there's nothing in

244
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,240
this data set i'm going to click on

245
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,800
export as zip file now again what you

246
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,080
could just do is drag in uh or actually

247
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
because we haven't uploaded anything

248
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,519
here it won't let that what let us do

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,240
that now again as i was mentioning uh

250
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,480
you could just take the two thousand

251
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,959
cats and drag them into

252
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,000
uh nimbics or not mimics power ai vision

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
and in fact let's go ahead with that

254
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
method for now

255
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:01,839
so

256
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,839
there we go i'm just going to go over to

257
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,680
my downloads over to train

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
go over to dog

259
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,600
there we go

260
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
now i'm going to take all of the images

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
in the dog folder click on open

262
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,959
now it will go ahead and upload every

263
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
single one of those images to power ai

264
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,440
vision and this might take a little bit

265
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
of time so what i'm going to do is

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
instead of having you watch paint dry

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,959
here i'm going to go ahead and pause the

268
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,519
video while it uploads and right as it's

269
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,200
done uploading i will be right back

270
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,959
all right so as you can see we have

271
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
successfully loaded in the two thousand

272
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,920
dog images and now it's time to load in

273
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,000
the 2000 cat images so again i'm going

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,880
to click on select images go up a

275
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
directory go to the cat folder select

276
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
them all click open and then we must

277
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,079
wait a few more minutes and then we

278
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,000
should have all of our images ready in

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,079
our data set to train the deep learning

280
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,360
model all right so it should take

281
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
another

282
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
five to ten minutes and we will be good

283
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,640
to go

284
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,279
all right so as you can see the cat

285
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,839
images have now imported into the data

286
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,519
set and we are now ready to actually

287
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,760
train the deep learning model

288
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,839
so what you need to do now is just go

289
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,920
back as you can see i we've got the data

290
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,560
set ready so you can go over to my deep

291
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,519
learning tasks and power ai vision

292
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,680
once you're there click on create new

293
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,440
task and this is where we can actually

294
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,519
start training the neural net click on

295
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,200
classification to let it know that we're

296
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,360
not doing object detection and i'm going

297
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
to call this cat dog

298
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,600
try one

299
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
there we go i'm going to tell to use the

300
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
cat dog data set and i'm going to tell

301
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,519
it to use the precise first training

302
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
strategy if you want to train in a hurry

303
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
you can use speed first or you can

304
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
customize this to fit your needs let's

305
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,720
just say i increase the maximum number

306
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,399
of iterations to 2000 uh test iterations

307
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,200
to 100 test intervals to 20

308
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,920
and from there the learning rate to

309
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,200
0.001 and the weight decay to 0.0005

310
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
all right there we go now what i'm going

311
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
to do is click on build model

312
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,440
and there we go so now what it's going

313
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,959
to do is it's going to give us an

314
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,519
estimated time which is currently 21

315
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,680
minutes but it's usually a lot less than

316
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,000
the estimated time so i'm going to click

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,560
on create new task

318
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
and there we go all right so now as you

319
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,200
can see the model is truly training it's

320
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
currently starting up the task which is

321
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
why you can't see much

322
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,560
however usually when you use tools like

323
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
for example ibm watson visual

324
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,560
recognition you're kind of left in the

325
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
dark as to what exactly the accuracy is

326
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
and all those other metrics that you

327
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
really want to know like the loss

328
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
however in just a moment when the power

329
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
ai vision neural net actually starts

330
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,279
training

331
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,279
you'll be able to see that power

332
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,440
elevation actually shows us all the

333
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,760
different stats about this model if you

334
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,120
want you can actually go ahead and

335
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,480
refresh

336
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,959
and it should show the graphs again in

337
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,120
around uh a minute or so writers

338
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
actually initializes everything and

339
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
imports the data it will be showing us

340
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
those graphs and i'll be back right as

341
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
those graphs appear after that we'll

342
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,560
wait for the model to train we'll take a

343
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,519
look at it we'll deploy the rest api and

344
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,079
implement that rest api in python

345
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,760
alright so let's take a look at the

346
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,560
model and how it trains

347
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,480
all right so as you can see the model is

348
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
currently training our graphs have

349
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,720
appeared and on the left you can see the

350
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,880
training loss this is the last value on

351
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
the training data set as expected this

352
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,440
is indeed going down

353
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
on the right you can take a look at the

354
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,320
testing loss and again thankfully this

355
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
is indeed going down meaning that the

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,639
neural network is starting to generalize

357
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
to the data meet because the test data

358
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,600
is indeed um is indeed showing a low

359
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
loss and we can also take a look at our

360
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
accuracy as you can see over time this

361
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,160
is going up it has a little you know

362
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,320
kind of plateaued here but then again

363
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
though if we give this a little bit of a

364
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
little bit of time uh this should

365
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,399
increase and even right now it is

366
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,000
extremely accurate we've already reached

367
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,560
97.2

368
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
accuracy and we can only expect it to

369
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,800
get higher from here

370
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
of course this is only 820 ish training

371
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,560
iterations in this is increasing every

372
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
single second so let's take a look at

373
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,839
what actually happens when we reach

374
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,560
around 1500 and then 2 000. however

375
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,320
power a vision also does show us an

376
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,920
estimated time left which is currently

377
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,680
around 140 seconds uh so around say like

378
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
two minutes

379
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,880
a little bit more than two minutes so we

380
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,040
will be back in uh just a few minutes uh

381
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,120
i'm going to speed up the footage and

382
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
let's take a look at how the neural

383
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,519
network trains and generalizes

384
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,680
all right so as you can see the model is

385
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,160
now successfully done training and we

386
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,079
are ready to deploy the neural network

387
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,480
model however just before we go i'd like

388
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
to show you the final statistics as you

389
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,399
can see we have successfully gone

390
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,160
through two thousand entire training

391
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,639
iterations and have reached a test or

392
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,160
train loss of zero zero zero point zero

393
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,440
zero five

394
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,240
two so that is actually very very low

395
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,600
and of course as you can see we've

396
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,959
reached a test loss of 0.07

397
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,279
uh and so we have reached an accuracy of

398
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,519
around 98

399
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
which is considerably high actually very

400
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,640
high considering the fact that we had to

401
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,839
do absolutely no coding the architecture

402
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,000
development and everything else was all

403
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
handled by power ai vision you don't

404
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,679
need to care about any of the underlying

405
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,360
infrastructure the scalability or

406
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,400
anything else

407
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
because power ai vision takes care for a

408
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,199
care of that for you automatically and

409
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,400
you don't even need to care about

410
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
getting power ai vision set up in the

411
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,919
first place you just sign up for an

412
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,160
account with nimx spin up a server on

413
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,559
any hardware that you desire and power

414
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,200
ai vision will adapt to it it's that

415
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,320
simple

416
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,919
all right so now as you can see the

417
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
neural network model done training again

418
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
but let's go ahead and deploy it

419
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
all right so as you can see it is indeed

420
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,760
creating a web api out of it just before

421
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,200
we do that though i'd like to show you

422
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
the my train models page as you can see

423
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,679
this is our cat dog model over here

424
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,360
we can see the accuracy that it's

425
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
reached and we can actually go ahead and

426
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
run an action on it too for example i

427
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
can even export the model as a zip file

428
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
if i want to i can mark it as a sample

429
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
model do really whatever else i want to

430
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
but anyway let's go back over to the web

431
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
apis and let's run a test on it

432
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
all right there we go so now that we are

433
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,320
at the run test page we are ready to go

434
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
ahead and upload new images and actually

435
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
run them against the model to see what

436
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
it gives us so i'm going to upload my

437
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
own image here

438
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
now again we don't want to give any

439
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
images that were already in the training

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
set that we gave the neural network

441
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,880
model so outside of the dog and cat

442
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
folders let's just say i choose a

443
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
different cat

444
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
i'm going to upload that into the power

445
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,799
ai vision software

446
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,679
and there we go as you can see if i were

447
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
to zoom in here for example you can see

448
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,000
that there is this slightly uh

449
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,240
not um not exactly the correct i guess

450
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
you could say aspect ratio sorry so it's

451
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,840
not the correct aspect ratio it was

452
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,360
squished down to work with the neural

453
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
network size but you can see that this

454
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
is an image of a person holding a cat

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
and so as you can see over here what's

456
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,400
this this is a heat map of where the

457
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,520
neural network saw specific attributes

458
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,440
that led it to believe that this is an

459
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
image of a cat this is something that

460
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,520
you don't get with most other neural

461
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
network based softwares either even if

462
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
you were to develop your own neural

463
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,360
network architecture it would take you

464
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
some time to implement the entire

465
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
attention mechanism to get this kind of

466
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,400
heat map working

467
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,760
luckily though this is done

468
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,559
automatically through power ai vision

469
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,080
and if you were to take a look at the

470
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,880
right here it correctly classifies this

471
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,160
as a cat with

472
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,880
99.149 percent confidence it is that

473
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,960
simple to get up and running with power

474
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,039
ai vision in fact let's go ahead and

475
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,120
feed in the dog image shall we so i'm

476
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
just gonna scroll down over to my dogs

477
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
here uh and over here as you can see

478
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,760
this is an image of a dog let's feed it

479
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,919
into the neural network software and as

480
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
you can see this is so sure that it is

481
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
actually rounded it's uh it's called

482
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,200
it's actually work it's confidence up

483
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
from 99 point however many nines there

484
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
were to 100

485
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
confidence as you can see this is the

486
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,000
dog this is the heat map this is where

487
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
the neural network saw

488
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,080
whatever it sought in the image that led

489
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,880
to believe that there is indeed a dog in

490
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,200
this image as you can see it has learned

491
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,520
to generalize to the face it's not

492
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,200
focusing on any of the other features in

493
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
fact if you want to take a look at some

494
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,200
more examples let's just say we were to

495
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,039
take this cat over here

496
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,120
this cat shows its entire sort of body

497
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,960
here and it's just sitting down with no

498
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
obstructions if we were to feed that in

499
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
what does the heat map look at you can

500
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,280
see the neural network has generalized

501
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,240
to find specifically faces that's what

502
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
it's really good at looking for if

503
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
there's a cat face or a dog face that's

504
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,200
what it looks at and recognizes you can

505
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
also see that it kind of looks over here

506
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,919
at the tail and the rest of the outline

507
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,240
of the body like the legs but the number

508
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,600
one thing by far is the head of the cat

509
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,320
itself this is very very fascinating the

510
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
heat map gives you insight into why the

511
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
neural network makes the decisions that

512
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,280
it makes and also how the neural network

513
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
makes the decisions as well in fact if

514
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,880
we were to do something similar with a

515
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,440
dog here as you can see for example here

516
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
the dog is not showing its face let's

517
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,640
see what the neural network actually

518
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,600
thinks

519
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
as you can see it's still thought it's a

520
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,080
dog because it realized there's no face

521
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
visible and it inferred based off of the

522
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,919
rest of the body that it is indeed a dog

523
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,080
and you can see that infer

524
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
or that inference that it made through

525
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,159
the heat map over here and then of

526
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,919
course you can combine the heat map and

527
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,159
the actual image you can uh find out how

528
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,559
you can actually for example crop items

529
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,039
or objects out of images and in fact in

530
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
my next video i'm going to be showing

531
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,760
you how you can run full-on object

532
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,840
detection with the power ai vision

533
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,760
platform and plus i'm going to be

534
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,679
showing you how you don't even need to

535
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,320
train full-on machine learning models uh

536
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,880
in the first place or manually train or

537
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,159
manually label that data because instead

538
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,320
you can actually use pre-trained neural

539
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,880
networks to help you label that data in

540
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,880
the first place that is coming up in the

541
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
next edition of my power ai vision

542
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,960
series

543
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,799
all right so that was a quick tutorial

544
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
as to how you can use the power ai

545
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,799
vision platform to recognize cat and dog

546
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,720
images really do hope you enjoyed that

547
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,200
tutorial you were able to learn how you

548
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,760
can actually use power ai vision

549
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,360
and how you can train deep learning

550
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,400
models that simply again we started with

551
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
the nimbic star starvis platform

552
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,320
what happened is you could actually spin

553
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
up an instance of power ai vision

554
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,880
without dealing with anything all you do

555
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,240
is you tell it that you want to start

556
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,080
powering a vision you tell it which

557
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,679
hardware you want to use and it does it

558
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,480
for you instantly after that we actually

559
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
used the power ai vision software which

560
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
allowed us to quite simply upload images

561
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
into the software and right as the

562
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,520
images were in all we needed to do is

563
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
set a machine learning model to trade

564
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,200
you can set the hyper parameters however

565
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,039
you want to and once it's at the hyper

566
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,360
parameters it'll train on your gpu

567
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,480
hardware it is that simple from there

568
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
though you can actually deploy that uh

569
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,600
train machine learning model onto a rest

570
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,080
api a web api and once it's on a web api

571
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,960
you can actually send new images over

572
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,360
and not only does it give you back those

573
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,760
images with the predictions as to what

574
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,080
class they are instead it also gives you

575
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,720
a heat map as to where the neural

576
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,799
network was most activated

577
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,559
where it actually thought that hey this

578
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,200
is a dog or this is a cat and that is

579
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
how the power ai vision platform works

580
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,400
again we had to fiddle around not at all

581
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,760
with the actual architectures of the

582
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
neural network the way the underlying

583
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,679
infrastructure works it was all handled

584
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,080
for us automatically and we reached an

585
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,679
astounding 98 accuracy on the test data

586
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,919
which usually takes quite a bit of work

587
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,480
to get done even with a simple library

588
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
like cross

589
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,360
alright so i hope you enjoyed that

590
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,039
