foreign
's YouTube channel in this session we
will learn what is data analytics
followed by the fundamentals of data
analytics we will go through the
introduction to the most important data
analytics tool which is the power bi
once we understand the fundamentals of
power bi we will try building charts and
tables in power bi then how to build
stories in power bi then we will get to
the most important part of this tutorial
which is how to build a real-time
dashboard in power bi hope I make myself
clear with the agenda now with that
having said if you are an aspiring data
analyst looking out for the online
training and certification from the best
universities and Industry experts then
search no more simply learns
postgraduate program in data analytics
from the Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be the
right choice for more details on this
program use the link in the description
box below also let me tell you guys that
we have daily updates on multiple
Technologies if you're a tech geek in a
continuous hunt for latest technological
Trends then consider getting subscribed
to our YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to never miss an
update from Simply with that over to our
training experts
now why power bi so generally uh you
know visualization tools reporting tools
are required in order to create and
prepare and analyze meaningful data it
could be a data for an organization it
could be a social media platform data it
could be a data from iot devices but
something which needs to be analyzed and
some intelligent inferences and data
mining has to be done on top of it now
imagine there is today we are in a world
where terabytes of data and information
is getting generated on an instantaneous
basis on minute-by-minute basis so it
becomes very essential to churn out
something meaningful something
intelligent out of it in the market
there are a lot of other tools which are
available like clicks all tricks Tableau
and power bi so power bi is a Microsoft
product which is one of the most popular
products and it comes as a free to
download product Microsoft power bi
desktop which is available and I'll show
you a couple of ways how you can install
it on your machine but why power bi is
uh popular is because it provides a lot
of out of the box features drag and drop
features which we will talk about in our
subsequent sessions and you know classes
but today's session is primarily focused
on giving you guys an introduction on
what what is the purpose of power bi and
what all problems it solve uh in the in
the real world so power bi allows you to
view analyze and visualize huge
quantities of data and the data could be
in any format Excel CSV text or it could
be a direct connection to a database
like SQL MySQL Azure Oracle anyone IBM
db2 so it supports n number of uh you
know data types or data sets and it's
very powerful in terms of data
connectivity
so it uses powerful compression
algorithms to import and cache the data
within the dot pbix file
so it's as convenient as a simple
software if suppose you import a data
and then you prepare a report and then
you can easily share the reports with
your peers or someone who's
co-developing with you either through
Power bi cloud services or even you can
share the pbix file in an email
or through any other means and you can
share the data set with the concern and
they can then work on the report
independently so there are different
ways there is no uh kind of a limitation
for you know working on power bi there
are multiple ways and it is very fast it
is the most fast uh tool to work with
Excel because definitely Excel is also a
Microsoft Technology so it works very
fast on Excel based data and gives you
numbers and Reporting at a very high
speed
so now once you have imported the data
power bi allows you to model the data
allows you to work intelligently on the
data it allows you to model the data in
a way that if you are importing data
from multiple Excel sheets importing
data from multiple tables you can easily
create a relationship between those
tables or data sets in power bi and then
create visually appealing reports
meaningful reports as I've been
emphasizing and make sense out of that
data no data in silos is of any use data
in Silo means a single worksheet or a
single data set will not churn out any
meaningful information until unless you
basically join it clubbit merge it Union
it append it with some other data sets
because a single data set will never be
able to hold that much amount of
information which is generally required
for a you know important report
so it has easy drag and drop
functionality with features that allow
you to copy all formatting across
similar visualizations so just like in
Microsoft Excel we use format painter to
copy the format of one cell to another
similar features very very similar to
excel products or Microsoft product they
have provided that if you have applied
uh a particular thing on a report you
can easily replicate that on any other
report the font uh the header size the
background color you don't need to do it
again and again so there's a lot of
reusable features which are also
available
okay now as I said Excel is a Microsoft
product power bi is a Microsoft product
so they have intercompatibility you can
publish data from Excel to power bi now
with the latest developments and
enhancements
as of today pixel has also plugged in a
new feature called powerpivot which I'll
uh show you later down the line but that
also allows you to do a quick analysis
no you can't create of course complex
reports or uh fancy reports like power
bi but Power pivot allows you to create
you know quick measures quick functions
quick calculations on your data quickly
only in Excel so it's an Excel plugin
but whereas you know you can power bi is
also compatible with Excel so when you
create a report in power bi it gives you
inbuilt feature to export your power bi
report into Excel format directly you
don't need to do any programming for it
also
you can easily publish when you publish
your power bi reports it allows you to
give some inbuilt intelligence of
analyzing your reports in Excel and it
gives you all those of all those
features of exporting your power bi
reports into Excel which is not
available in any other tool or otherwise
those tools have to create plugins
create add-ins and probably they might
charge for it but Power bi comes with
lot of out of the box features which are
very very helpful for analyzing data in
Excel and vice versa
Azure Cloud now Azure itself again is a
Microsoft cloud Tech stack so using
power bi with Azure allows you to
analyze and share large volumes of data
so Azure basically Azure database or
Azure Cloud servers are meant to hold
huge amount of data and power bi allows
you to have seamless connection you can
easily connect to Azure data Lake
you can reduce the time it takes to get
insights and increase collaboration
between business analysts data engineers
and data scientists so azure
data Lake becomes the central focal
point where all your analysts Engineers
can keep working on on the centralized
piece of data and churn out their
reports data scientists primarily job is
to keep the data in a structured way
optimized way optimize the input output
operations disk operations and memory
utilization so that the reports also get
churned out in a faster manner so every
uh you know every person has their own
role in order to give a quick
refreshable report a quick rendered
report any report which is taking huge
amount of time to get rendered will not
eventually be used by the business users
because then it does not solve the
purpose the report should be fast report
should have uh you know appropriate
filters slices and dices you should be
able to you know create the reports or
dynamically or you should be able to
analyze visualize the data dynamically
so all those visualization features are
available in power bi and it works
seamlessly either it is small data or
huge data it allows that you to work on
those kind of data in a seamless fashion
right so this is just a very uh quick uh
example of how our typical dashboard
looks like dashboard is nothing but you
know you have clubbed couple of multiple
reports on a single page and you know if
you change a filter uh a single filter
on the page all the reports will honor
that filter and the numbers will change
accordingly so if you see the in this
example there is a filter or a drop down
or product ID product name employee name
or supervisor or a date range so
whatever date range or filter you will
apply all the reports on this dashboard
will get changed based on the filter you
have selected so power bi allows you to
get insights from data and turn insights
into action to take data driven business
decision and that is the ultimate goal
of any visualization tool that is the
purpose for which visualization tools
are bought
uh and purchased by the organizations
and data is fed into them
Now power bi fetches data from Factory
sensors social media sources to get
access to real-time Analytics so that
you are always ready to make timely
business decisions so so basically there
is a a feature of live connection or cut
off data connection so either you can
work on data which is deciding on a
machine and you can just work on the
cutoff data like for example it's
there's a data which is available for
sales 2017 2018 and you're just working
on a historical data it's a cut off data
or it could be possible that you want to
be connected live uh to a real-time iot
based sensor based data or social media
data like Twitter Facebook feeds or you
know you're connected to live Google
worksheets that is also possible you
just need to publish your Google sheet
for a public domain embed that you are
in into Power bi and then whoever
updates that Google sheet automatically
the power bi report will also start
honoring and consuming the new data
which is added in the Google sheet so
all those kind of real-time streaming
analytics is also possible and that is
one big feature and very important
feature of power bi which is widely used
and has a very huge uh you know Market
acceptance and Market utilization
now what is power bi
power bi is a business analytics service
provided by Microsoft that lets you
visualize your data and share insights
right so earlier
you know uh
Microsoft used to have a technology
called ssas now they have replaced
actually ssas and SSRS with power bi so
basically you can use power bi on the
data which is there in your Excel or any
other data source and the power bi
service or power bi desktop basically
creates a connection to those data sets
and import it cache it and give you a
handle to it in order to work with it so
you can create these fancy meaningful
visualizations like for example there is
a geographical map if you are importing
data for a country or a continent or a
region power bi will automatically
detect that it's a geographical
information and give you a map with
latitude longitude information and you
just need to plot
your uh your numbers on the map either
you can use bubbles or either you can
use triangles or whatever data structure
you want to use but all the mapping will
be available geographically then you can
create pie charts which is shown in this
visualization you can create tree maps
you can create cards where you know you
can highlight the most important numbers
like sales total sales of your company
across all the regions or the growth
chart or the month on month uh you know
sales of your organization or number of
total number of products or units sold
so whatever is important and to be
highlighted for the management to take
any meaningful decision or any insights
you want to share
power bi visualization tool the power bi
visualization uh
uh chart allows you to drag and drop and
create wonderful reports okay
so what are the features of power bi so
power bi desktop is something a
standalone tool which you need to
install on your machine it allows you to
build reports by accessing data easily
you do not need Advanced report
designing or query skills to build a
report though yes it is beneficial that
if you know some SQL programming
analytical programming or you are aware
of advanced features of any analytical
tool that might help you but that's not
a showstopper you can easily build
reports in quick turnaround time without
needing any technical background you
just need to have some analytical uh
mindset and you can create uh Savvy
visualization and you know analytical
reports
stream analytics as I mentioned you can
create a live connection uh with any
kind of data it could be iot it could be
media social media it could be Google
Docs it could be uh you know any other
kind of uh you know live connection it
could be a live database connection
itself so any insertions or updations or
deletions happening will automatically
reflect in your report
yes multiple data sources and that has
to be the primary criteria for any tool
to be popular if any visualization tool
is limited to certain data sets then you
know it will not be highly acceptable in
the market
and custom visualizations right so as I
showed you certain uh examples in the
past in the previous presentation uh
that feature is very important because
someone might want to look the kpis look
at the kpis from a different perspective
some management might want to look at
the kpis from a different perspective so
you need to you need to have that
capability to create different
visualization from the same data set now
let's take a look at how
to install power bi desktop on your
machine
so basically what you need to do is
you need to go to this URL
power bi dot microsoft.com en US desktop
okay
and you need to just
enter this
now you can download it for free so just
click over here
and
it will open Microsoft store so
basically now what Microsoft have done
in the latest operating systems is that
when you are trying to download you can
actually directly go to the Microsoft
store
and search for Power bi
so let's wait for a couple of seconds
right here so power bi desktop in
Microsoft store for me it's already
installed so it's asking me to open it
I'll open it in a while but for you for
anyone who is not installed he will see
the button of install over here and it
will automatically install in your
machine and then you can easily go and
open power bi desktop now if I click
open over here
now this is the
uh UI of the power bi desktop
I'm not going to go right now in
creating reports right away we will talk
about that in a subsequent session with
sample data sets and we will cover the
features of power bi desktop one by one
but this is what it is this is the whole
tool of power bi which is having the
visualization pane all the different
visualizations are you know can be
created from this pane then this is the
pane which allows you to select the data
data fields then there is a report view
data View and relationship view the data
model view where multiple relationships
you can create you can view the data in
the grid
of the tables which you will create and
the reports so you can create multiple
reports on multiple Pages you can keep
adding pages either you can drag create
multiple reports on a single page and it
will become a dashboard or you can
create separate independent reports on
the single page
and these are the menu options which we
will talk about how you can change color
scheming you can do data modeling you
can create new reports and you can also
transform data which is the biggest
feature extract transform and load the
data apply different logic changing data
types massaging the information creating
new joins appending the data you know
adding new columns etc etc uh we that is
what you can do in transform data so
this itself is a whole different world
it's a dedicated topic so we will talk
about that in our subsequent sessions
simply learns postgraduate program in
data analytics from the Peugeot
University in collaboration with IBM
should be the right choice for more
details on this program use the link in
the description box below now let's
understand what power bi dashboard is
power bi dashboard is a single page
visualization to tell a story here on
the screen you can see there's a
dashboard which has been published on
power bi service there are multiple
charts and graphs that you can see the
visualizations on a dashboard are
generated from reports and each report
is based on one data set a single page
dashboard is known as a canvas the
visualizations you see on the dashboard
are called tiles and each of these tiles
are pinned to the dashboard by report
designers today we'll be covering the
following dashboard that you see on the
screen it will be a three page report
where we will be analyzing the
superstore sample data as you can see
there are three tabs now let me move
over to our data set so our Superstore
sample data set is in the form of an
Excel file you can see there are
multiple columns you can see there's
order date shipment date the mode of
shipment customers first name and last
name the segment to which the customer
belong to country of the customer the
city state and if you go towards the end
you can see that the different product
names the sales quantity sold discount
and the profit so the report that you
see here and the one which we are going
to create might vary a little in terms
of the color the formatting and the
spacing so you need not worry about that
now let me go ahead and bring up a new
workspace so I'll go to file click on
new this will take some time to bring up
our new workspace now it will ask you
for trying the free version or if you
want you can go ahead and sign in I'll
just close this so here is our new
workspace before creating the dashboard
we need to make some changes to our
Superstore data set using the features
of power bi desktop first we'll extract
the year month and quarter values from
the order date column I'll go to get
data tab click on Excel as my source
I'll locate my file it's on desktop
click on open this might take some time
to load the data set I'll select the
orders sheet you can see the preview of
our data here I'll go ahead and click on
load this will take some time to load
the data set onto power bi desktop I
think we have successfully loaded our
data set you can check that by going to
the data tab so here is our data set
first let's make some changes in the
format of the order date and the
shipment date I'll click on the order
date under the modeling tab
we have this data type and the format
I'll click on the drill down option
and the date and time now let's choose
the first one which is in the format of
ddmm yyy
and click on ADD
as you can see our order date column has
been changed to that particular format
similarly I'll select the ship date
column
go to the format option under date and
time I click on the first one
here you can see even the ship date
column has been changed to that
particular format now let's extract the
month values from the order date column
to do that right click on the order date
column
select new column
so this will create a new column if you
go to the end so there's a new column
rename this column as month and since we
want the month value from the order date
column I'll search for order date
dot since I want the month I'll select
month if I hit enter
it will give me the month values from
the order date column
similarly if you want to get the quarter
values from the order date
right click select new column
rename the column as quarter
then choose the order date column
followed by the quarter name hit enter
so you can see you have a quarter column
and it has all the values of the quarter
to which the date belongs to now let me
go ahead and create one more column
this time we'll create a new column for
the order year this time we'll extract
the order year values so let me rename
it as year we'll continue with the same
procedure I look for the order date and
then select the year
hit enter
so it gives you only the ear values on
which the order was placed
now let's find which day of the week was
the order placed so we need to use the
weekday function and give the order
data's parameter followed by which day
you want the week to start with I'll
show you how to do that so I'll click on
order date
then select new column
let's rename this column as day of week
I'll use the weekday function of power
bi you can hit tab to finish I look for
my order date column
comma
I'll choose 2 here since I want my week
to start with Monday and end on a Sunday
hit enter
so you can see we have the day of the
week column
so the idea to create this day of V
column is to find out if the order was
placed on a weekday or a weekend now let
me go ahead and create one more new
column
let's name this column as
weekday
or a weekend
I'll use an if clause
and pass in my parameters for logical
test I'll use the day of the week column
so I'll search for audios
and then look for day of week if this
day of the week is equal to 6 which
means if it's a Saturday or I'm using
the or operator
if the day of week is a Sunday that is 7
then it's a weekend
else it's a weekday
close the bracket hit enter so you can
see we have our weekday and weekend
column so moving ahead another thing we
can do is we can find the total number
of days it took for the shipment of the
product this can be done using the
dative function of power bi so let me
show you how you can do that I'll click
on any column right click go to new
column let's rename the column as
these for shipment then I'll use the
date div function
I'll give my starting date which is the
order date so I'll search for
order date
followed by the second date will be our
shipment date which is ship date and the
day
I'll hit enter
so you can see here it gives us the
total number of days it took for the
shipment of the product now let's create
a full name column where we will
concatenate the first name and the last
name of the customer let me go ahead and
do that
I'll create a new column
let me rename the column as full name
then I'll take the first name
from the orders table use the Amber sent
followed by a space using inverted
commas followed by another Ampersand and
the last name
I hit enter
you can see we have a full name column
if you go back so there were two columns
in the name of first name and last name
now we have most both the columns into a
single column named full name and you
can see the first name space and the
last name now let me give the sales
column
a currency value so I'll select the
sales column
here
under General
if I go to currency I can see there are
multiple currency symbols
choose whatever you want for this video
I'll take dollar English United States
you can see our sales column is now
represented by a dollar value similarly
let me make some changes to the profit
column as you can see there are multiple
decimal values for each profit so let's
standardize it
so I'll select the profit column and
this is where you can standardize it now
it's Auto so let me make it two decimal
places
so our data is ready now let's go to the
report View and start building our
reports
before that
under the model view you can see the new
columns that we had created you can see
there's weekday weekend this year
this quarter column month column
the same you can see under the report
view as well
under fields you can see these are the
columns that we created days of shipment
day of week
quarter
month weekday or weekend and year now we
are under the report view first let me
go ahead and create a text box
so under the Home tab you have the text
box
I'll select that
let me stretch it a bit
we'll give a title
sales
dashboard I'll select this and increase
the size to
let's say 28 we make it bold
and Center align it also under the
visualizations tab under background
will add a background color to this text
box let me select this blue color and
let me make
the font as white
so now we have our title ready
so under General you can decrease the
height of the text box let me make it as
70
first let us create a new card from the
visualizations panel so under
visualizations there is an option to
create new card I'll click on it
let me resize
I'll move it to the top
we'll see the total amount of sales all
the total revenue that was generated
from the sales after selecting the card
I'll choose sales onto fields
so here you can see it gives you the
total sales that were made so which is
nearly 2.3 million dollars
if I go to the format tab under data
label
let me switch on the border under title
you can give a new title for example
total
Revenue hit enter
now you can
increase the text size to say 15 and
central line it you can also change the
color of the sales value so under data
label under colors you can choose
whichever color you want
similarly let's create one more card to
find the total number of units that were
sold I'll copy the same card
Ctrl C Ctrl V
I'll move it a little below
now I'll remove the sales column
from the fields and add the quantity
column onto fields
again
under title I'll edit this title as
total
quantity sold
let me create one more card
where we will see the total amount of
profit that were made I'll select this
I'll remove the quantity column
and add profit
under the format tab
under title
I'll make this as
total
profit
hit enter
stretch it a bit so that you can see the
total amount of profit that were made
now
let me add a slicer
wherein
will have the order date column
so I'll add the order date column onto
fields
so you can see here we have the order
date column and
under slicer header
let me increase the text size
to 15
and
let's switch on the border
you can also give a title to the slicer
so under the format tab to go to title
switch it on
and we'll give a title text as
slicer by
order date
scroll down I'll Center align it and
increase the text size to 15.
now if you want you can also change the
date colors to Blue so under date inputs
then go to font color and select any
blue color
now let's create a line and stacked
column chart to visualize sales and
profit by each year each month and each
quarter so from the visualizations tab
let me select line and stack column
chart
I'll resize this
after that let me add the order date
column onto the shared axis
we'll drag the sales onto column values
and underline values I'll take the
profit column
so here you can see we have the sales
and profit by each year
the bars represent the sales and this
line represents the profit it made for
each year let me go to the format tab
and
make some changes to the data colors let
the color of the profit remain the same
but the bars I'll choose a custom color
give a hexadecimal value like
196273
hit enter
so we have successfully changed the
color of the bars power bi has an
interesting feature where you can drill
down the seals by each year each month
each quarter or by days so let me show
you so on the top it shows you go to the
next level in the hierarchy so if I
click on this here you can see the sales
and the profit that were made for each
quarter in every year
quarter four for every year made the
highest amount of sales and the profit
similarly if I drill down further you
can see let me expand it you can see by
month this is for each month
over all the years how much sales were
made
you can check November month give us the
highest amount of sales and
December month gave us the highest
amount of profit
similarly you can still go to the next
hierarchy here you can see
the sales and the profit made for each
day over all the years so day 17 made
the highest amount of sales
and day 23 gave us the highest amount of
profit if you see the lowest sales and
the profit you can see order day 25 gave
us the lowest amount of profit
and similarly you can see day 29 gave us
the lowest amount of sales
now you can also go to the format tab
and switch on the data labels
so you can see here in 2014 we got
nearly 49.5 K profit and nearly 0.48
million dollar sales similarly in 2015
we had nearly 61.6 K profit and 0.47
million sales and so on
now let me go ahead to the format Tab
and
switch on the border let me now create a
clustered column chart for sales by year
and quarter so from the visualizations
let's select clustered column chart let
me resize this a bit
and under access
will add the year column
so I'll drag here on to access under
Legend I'll take the quarter column
and under values I'll choose sales
so you can see here the sales that were
made under each quarter for each year
this picture clearly says quarter 4 for
every year Meet the highest amount of
sales and quarter one
made the lowest
let me go to the format tab
and I'll go to the data colors let's
change the colors for each of these
quarters we'll be using hexadecimal
values so under custom colors for
quarter one
let me select hexadecimal value as
follows so for example PF D6 D9
similarly for Quarter Two
I'll select 6D 9 ba6
for quarter 3
and finally for quarter 4
I choose a little darker color
so here is how our clustered column
chart looks like and we can see the
sales by year and quarter
now let me go ahead and
let's add a border now
we'll analyze the seals by each state so
for that we will use field map so I'll
click on field map
let me resize it
now let me add the state column onto
location
and the tool tips I'll
add the sales column
let me expand it so you can see here we
have the map which shows the sales by
each state
now let's do some color formatting to
this
I'll go to the format tab click on ADD
colors
and blue is the default color there is
an additional option
where you can use conditional formatting
so I'll use that so it gives you the
option to choose your color between
maximum value and the minimum value you
can also choose this diverging option
where you get a center value or a mid
value as well now for the minimum value
I'll choose a color again I'll use a
custom color it will be similar to a
green color
correct okay then
let's use some orange color for the Mid
Valley range for example EB
and similarly for the maximum value
we'll use a little darker color which
looks similar to red
enter so now we have defined our color
scheme
let's click on OK
let's zoom out so you can see the states
which are in green color meet the lowest
amount of sales while those which are in
orange or in red meet the highest amount
of sales so in this example you can see
California had the highest amount of
sales similarly New York is next is just
below California with the amount of
sales followed by Texas we'll go back
let me also
add a border to this similarly you can
also select the profit column or the
unit sold column to see the units or the
profit that were sold by each state
so let me now go ahead and create a
donut chart in the donor chart we'll
analyze the sales and profit by each
segment
so under visualizations I click on donut
chart
so under Legend I'll add the segment
column
under values I'll take the sales column
and
we also want the profit so I'll take
The Profit column onto tooltips
so you can see we have our donut chart
prepared and you can see the sales and
profit by each segment
let me expand this the donut chart
indicates consumer segment made the
highest amount of sales and profit while
home office segment made the lowest
I'll go back
let me go to the format tab
and we'll make some formatting to our
data
let's change the color of all the
segments
choose custom color
let's give a color
coding as
1558c
similarly we change
the color for corporate segment as well
let's take a gray color
and finally we'll change the color for
home office as well
I'll also switch on the border
so we have our donor chart prepared now
let's move ahead and create a pie chart
to analyze the profit and sales by each
category of products so under
visualizations I'll select pie chart
I'll drag the category column onto
Legend
under values I'll take the profit column
and under tooltips I'll take the sales
column
so you can see we have a simple pie
chart that tells you the profit and the
sales that were made by each category
as it's evident category technology made
the highest amount of sales and profit
while Furniture category made the lowest
amount of profit and sales
I'll go back
under format I'll change the data Colors
Let's go ahead and do that
I'll use custom colors and give
a hexadecimal color value
similarly for office supplies I'll take
another hexadecimal value
and finally we'll change the color of
the furniture category
also
let's give a border
so we have a pie chart prepared that
tells you the profit and sales by each
category of products now we are done
with our first sales dashboard so I can
go ahead
and rename
this tab as
overall sales
next we are going to analyze the sales
profit quantity sold and all of these
by taking region and the state as
filters so we'll continue with the same
drill first I'll create a text box
so under home menu I'll go to text box
I'll stretch this
I'll give a title to this page for
example region
and
state
level analysis
let me make it bold
and
I'll increase the size to 28
make it Center aligned
we'll make the text
as white
and
the visualizations
let's give a background color
I choose this blue color
so let me go ahead and create three
slicers a region slicer a state slicer
and a ear slicer so under visualizations
I'll click on slicer
let me resize
move it on top
and
for region slicer I need to add region
onto fields
so you can see we have a region filter
now
let's do some formatting to this
under slicer header
let me make the font color
white and
let's give a background
let's say blue
and let me increase the text size to
say 15.
you can also choose a font family
let's go for calibri
and
you can increase the size
of the items let's increase the text
size
to
say 15.
and
let's give a border
so now you have the region slicer ready
let me copy paste this
next
we'll create the state slicer so I'll
remove region from here and add
State onto the field
you can see we have the state slicer
ready similarly
you can also go ahead
and create a ear slicer
but you can analyze the sales and profit
or quantity by year
I'll remove State from here
and
I'll drag the ear column onto field
you can see we have all the four years
from 2014 to 2017. so sometimes it might
be difficult for you to scroll through
all the values present in a slicer for
example in the state slicer
you can see there are multiple States
and if you want to filter your report by
a particular State you have to always
scroll down or scroll up and check
manually where the state is so power bi
gives you this feature where you can use
the search option so if I click on this
you can see there's a search option
select that so now
in the search bar you can search for any
state you are looking for for example if
you want to search for California state
you can just type on California so you
have just typed Cal and it shows me
California that's an important feature
that power bi gives you
so let me now go ahead and create a
simple table where we will see the
quantity and the profit made in each
City so under visualizations I'll select
tables
let me resize this
so under values first I'll add the city
column
followed by
the quantity column
and
The Profit column
let's do some formatting
so under column headers
let me change the font color to white
and let's add a background
let me increase the text size also
let's make it 15.
similarly if you scroll down under
values
let's increase the text size
to 15 as well
and
let's choose the font family let's take
consoles
so here
you can see all the cities
the quantity
sold in each City and the profit that
was made in each of these cities
let me add a border to this
so now you can filter each of these
cities by region or by state
for example if I choose Central
as my region
it will give you all the cities that lie
in the central region
similarly
you can also search for any state for
example
I am taking Minnesota
so under Minnesota
you can see all the cities and the
quantity as well as the profits made
let me now uncheck the filters now let
me go ahead and filter this table
in terms of profit so I'll sort by
profit
you can see
we have our cities sorted in terms of
profit
so New York City made the highest amount
of profit followed by Los Angeles and
Seattle below you can see the total
units that were sold and the total
profit that was made from all the cities
so you can also filter down the quantity
sold and the profit made by each year as
well as by region and State
so let's see suppose I am choosing
East as the region
so under East it tells you the states
that are present
let's
go for Delaware
and let's select 2016 as my year
so you can see
the cities that lie under delivery state
and the quantity as well as the profit
the made in 2016. similarly let's select
Massachusetts as the state and let's
go for another year for example 2017
you can see all the cities that are
present under Massachusetts the quantity
sold and the profit that was made below
you can see the total quantity and the
profit
let me uncheck all these
now moving ahead let's analyze the sales
by each state and the category of
product for this
will create a clustered bar chart so
under visualizations I'll select
clustered bar chart let me resize a bit
under access
I'll take the state column
I'll take category onto Legend
and and the values
I'll put the sales column
so you can see here
we have the seals for each category
under each state
for example California state made the
highest amount of sales under technology
category and it made the lowest amount
of sales under office supplies
by scroll down you can see all the
states
and the sales they made
for each category
I'll go back to the report
now let's use some filters
you can filter here for example if I
want to check
the sales by each state and category for
2015 I can just
click on 2015
and it will tell you the sales that were
made
now
let's do some formatting to this bar
chart
I'll change the colors for each of the
categories
similarly we change the color for office
supplies
and finally for the technology
so now we have our bar chart ready
moving on now let me add a border to
this bar chart
okay
so now that we have seen our sales by
state and category let's now check the
profit by year and category for that
we'll create an area chart
I'll resize this chart
now
under axis
I'll take the year column
under Legend
I'll take the category column
and
the values
I'll take profit
so we have our area chart that depicts
The Profit by each year and the category
to which the product belonged to
I'll go to the format Tab and under data
colors
I'll choose some colors
let's change Furniture to this blue
color
I'll take office supplies a red color
and Technology I'll use a green color
so now you can use the filters
for example you can check the profit
that was made by each year and category
under east region
so you can see here
in 2017 technology meet the highest
amount of profit while furniture at the
lowest
similarly
let's
check for South Region
so you can see in south region in 2016
technology meet the highest amount of
profit
and
furniture made the lowest in 2017 office
supplies made the highest amount of
profit and Furniture was the lowest
I'll uncheck this South Region filter
similarly you can also see the sales by
each state so under State slicer you can
choose whichever State you want and
check the profit it made by that year or
category
for example I'll choose Connecticut
so you can see the profit Connecticut
state made in each of these years
I'll uncheck it
let us move ahead and now let's see
profit that was made and the quantity
that was sold by each category and
subcategory of the product so for this
I'll choose the line and cluster column
chart so I'll select from the
visualizations now
under shared access
I'll select the category column under
column series I'll take the subcategory
column
under column values I'll choose profit
and
I'll choose quantity
under the tooltips
so now you can see
The Profit that was made under each
category and the subcategory
for technology category copiers
subcategory meet the highest amount of
profit the quantity sold was 234.
similarly
if you check for furniture category
we didn't make any profit for table
subcategory
and as well as for bookcases
under office supplies people subcategory
made the highest amount of profit
now let me go ahead and add a border to
this
fine
moving ahead now we will see the sales
by each segment for that let's create a
funnel so from visualizations I'll take
the
funnel and
I'll drag
segment onto group
and the sales column onto values
so you can see here
the sales that were made by each segment
this picture clearly depicts that
consumer segment with the highest amount
of sales next was corporate and then
home office
now
let's do some color formatting so the
default color is this blue
I'll click on so all
now we'll give individual colors to each
of the segments
using custom color
let's give a hexadecimal value
similarly we'll change the color for the
corporate segment
and finally for the home office segment
now let me go ahead and give a border to
it
so if you want to analyze the seals by
segment and for
a particular region or state or any
particular year you can do that so let's
select
for each region
and
let's take New Jersey as the state
for year 2014 suppose
so you can see here corporate segment
meet the highest amount of sales
followed by consumer and home office
let me uncheck
these filters
so our second report is ready where we
analyzed the sales quantity profit at
Region level state level and by year so
I can rename this
as
a region and State
next we will analyze the sales quantity
profit in terms of categories and
subcategory of products so let me first
copy this text box
and create a new tab
I'll paste that text box here and
change the title to
say
category
and
sub category level analysis
first
we'll create a
slicer
where we will take
the category as filter
so if I want I can directly copy it
from my previous tab
and change the fields so let me copy
this
and paste it here
I'll sync it
and let me remove the region field and
add
category onto the field
so you can see
we have the three categories here
let me copy paste this again and
let me take the sub category now
so I'll select this
and
I'll track subcategory onto the field so
here you can see we have all the
subcategories and above we have the
categories
let me resize this a bit
with that now let's analyze the sales
and profit by region and segment
to do this we'll use a tree map so let's
see how you can build a tree map under
visualizations I have tree map let me
select it
and move it to the top
and expand it a bit
now
under group
I'll select region column
under details I'll take
segment
I'll take the sales column under values
and let's take profit
on two tooltips
so if I expand this
you can see the sales and profit by each
region and segment for example in the
west region you have consumer corporate
and home office
as the segments and you can see consumer
segment meet the highest amount of sales
and profit while home office made the
lowest amount of sales and profit
similarly you can check for the other
regions as well
now
let's give a border to this tree map and
under data colors let me change the
color of the regions
scroll down
custom color let me choose my own color
let's take this as a gray color
and finally
for the best region
so now you can select individual
categories and sub categories to check
the sales and profit by region and
segment for example
if I select
Furniture as my category
you can see the changes that were made
to the tree map
you can also select office supplies and
see
how the sales and profit changes
similarly you can also go ahead and
select whatever subcategories you want
and then check the sales and profit by
region and segment with that let me now
create a pie chart
to see the quantity and the sales by
each segment
so I'll go and select a pie chart
let me resize this
if you want you can increase the size of
this tree map also
so let me go ahead
and select segment onto the legend
under values I'll take quantity
and
sales under tooltips
so this pie chart
depicts the quantity and the sales that
were made by each segment as you can see
consumer segment meet the highest amount
of sales and had the highest quantity
sold
while home office had the least number
of quantities sold and the least number
of sales
let's add a border
and
change the data colors
similarly I'll change the color for the
corporate segment let's make this
green
and home office
I'll take the following color
move this a little to the right
now let's build a scatter plot to
analyze the sales quantity and profit by
each subcategory
so under visualizations
I'll select scatter plot I'll resize
this
so I'll add
sub category onto Legend
then I'll add sales onto the x-axis
quantity sold onto the y-axis
and under size
will take the profit column
if I expand this
you can see the sales quantity and the
profit that was made for each
subcategory of products you can see here
subcategory phone has given us a
significant amount of sales with less
number of quantities sold and it has
given us a good amount of profit also
similarly subcategory shares has also
given us good amount of sales with close
to 2356 quantities sold and a good
amount of profit if you see this one
which is subcategory paper it gave us
less amount of sales with more
quantities sold while it gave us good
amount of profit though so you may
promote phones or for example chairs to
sell more since it gives you more amount
of profit with less quantity sold
let's add a border to this
you can use the category filter suppose
if I choose for furniture
and expand this
you can see
under Furniture subcategory Furnishings
give us the lowest amount of sales with
the highest number of quantities sold
but it gave us a decent amount of profit
subcategory tables give us a decent
amount of sales with lesser number of
quantities sold but didn't give us any
profit
subcategory chairs give us the highest
amount of sales and also the profit
I'll uncheck this
let's now create a line chart where we
can see the profit by each year and
quarter so under visualizations
I'll select line chart let me resize
this
so under access
I'll take year
and a legend
I'll take the quarter column
and under values
I'll take the profit column
so now you can see
The Profit that was made
each year and the lines depict each
quarter
so if you check for 2014 quarter four
meet the highest amount of profit while
quarter 2 made the lowest amount of
profit while quarter 1 made the lowest
amount of profit similarly if you see
for 2016 you can see
quarter four meet the highest amount of
profit
while quarter One Meet the lowest
if you check for 2017 you see a quarter
three and quarter four almost meet the
same amount of profit while
quarter 2 made the lowest amount of
profit
I go back
now you can filter these by categories
also suppose if I see for technology
you can check the amount of profit that
was made in each year and in each
quarter for technology category
let's add a border to this
likewise we'll now create another line
chart that will depict the sales by each
year and quarter
so let me copy paste this
I'll drag this to the right
now I'll remove
profit from values and add sales
let me uncheck this also
so here you can see we have the sales by
each year and quarter
now if you see for 2014 again quarter
four made the highest amount of sales
and quarter 1 in 2014 meter lowest
you see for 2016 you can see 2016 also
quarter four meter highest amount of
sales and quarter One Meet the lowest
go back
so our final report is ready where we
analyzed the sales quantity sold the
profit at category and subcategory level
I can go ahead and rename this as
category
and sub category
let me save this now if you want
you can also filter it by subcategories
for example if I select
chairs as my subcategory
so for chairs you can see the sales that
was made by each year and quarter
so in 2017 quarter four made the highest
amount of seals while quarter one made
the lowest amount of sales for cheers
similarly
you can select other subcategories also
for example
let me take
some other category like
machines
let's see the profit now
so for machine subcategory you can see
in 2014 quarter four meet the highest
amount of profit while
quarter 3
meet the lowest amount of profit
now if you check for 2015 you can see
quarter 3 made the highest amount of
profit in shares while quarter one made
the lowest amount of profit
let's uncheck this
so now we are almost done building our
report using the superstore sample data
set
so we have our three reports ready you
can see the first one was overall sales
the second report we created
by taking region State and the year as
filters so we had a region and state
level analysis and finally we analyzed
the sales quantity and the profit sold
by category and subcategory so I have
arranged all these graphs and charts so
that it looks little better now let me
go to this publish option on the top so
that we can publish this report onto the
power bi Dash code
so I'll click on publish
I'll save it
you can select the destination here I
have only one destination which is my
workspace so I'll choose it and select
so there you go publishing to power bi
it was successful
I'll close it
and let me move to my power bi service
I'll refresh it for once
so under my workspace
you can see we have the dashboard report
So Below you can see there are three
tabs that we created the first one is
overall sales
the second one is sales by region the
third one is by category and subcategory
now to put this reports onto the
dashboard I need to pin each one of
these visualizations
so let me pin one by one
so it asks where would you want to pin
it to I'll select the existing dashboard
or better let's create a new dashboard
let's say
power bi
Dash code
spin it
close this
similarly let's spin the remaining ones
I'll select power bi dashboard again pin
it
let's spin everything
so this slicer you can't pin it
let's do the remaining ones
same will do for the donor chart
as well as
for the pie chart
now
now if I go to
my dashboards
and select power bi dashboard
you can see
we have a one page
dashboard here
you can resize all the charts and graphs
let me resize it
and move it to the top
so we have our first canvas here which
tells you the overall sales the profit
and the units that were sold over
different states different segments
and by categories so one of the
important feature that power bi service
gives you is that you can ask questions
about your data and it will tell you
what the exact solution is for example
you can see here you have a field where
you can ask questions so for example if
I type
total sales
and hit enter
so it tells you the total amount of
sales that were made which is 2.3
million dollars similarly if I want to
find out the total
profit I can search for it here
hit enter it will give you the exact
amount of profit that was made let's do
something else for example if you want
total
profit
by
say here
I'll hit enter it gives you a nice line
chart where you can see the total profit
that was made over all the four years
next
suppose I searched for total
quantity
sold
by
segment
see it gives me a bar chart where you
can see the total quantity that was sold
and it gives you a list of options where
you can find out the total quantity that
was sold by city state order ID first
name last name and many others so
consumer segment had the highest
quantity sold
let's see for something else for example
if you want
the total
sales by
say subcategory
I'll choose the first one see you have
all the subcategories and the total
sales that they made so it's a very
interesting feature that power bi gives
you
go back
now if you want
you can go to the report menu
and if you want you can pin the other
visualizations as well
so another important feature about power
bi dashboard is that you can derive
insights from the visualization for
example
if I click on these dots there's an
option you find view insights I'll
select it
so on the right you can see Power bi has
itself given us some insights from the
data and the visualizations we have made
in C sales by year and quarter
the sales by D of week and quarter sales
by shipment mode where you can see the
standard classic Mode made the highest
amount of sales
you can also see the sales and count of
City by year
and many more
with that we have come to an end of this
session on what is data analytics and
how to build dashboards in power bi if
you have any queries regarding any of
the topics covered in the session or
should you feel that you need the
resources used in the session like the
data set PPT or anything like code
documentation Etc then do let us know in
the comment section Below on another
team of experts would be more than happy
to resolve all the queries and the
audience until next time thank you stay
