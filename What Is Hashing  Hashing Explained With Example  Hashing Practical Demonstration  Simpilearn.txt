hey everyone welcome to Simply on today
we will be learning hashing Concepts in
cyber security so let's try to
understand the concept with the help of
an example so this analogy will help
demonstrate how hashing Works in a more
intuitive way so imagine you're helping
to organize books in a book store there
are hundreds of books and you want a
system that allows you and customers to
find books quickly in this case the hash
function is a simple rule that
determines where each book should be
placed based on its genre so let's say
you have genres like fiction non-fiction
science history and romance so each gen
corresponds to a specific section of the
book store when a new book arrives you
look at its genre A Book Like Pride and
Prejudice falls under romance category
according to Hash function that is genre
to section mapping this goes in the
romance section and A Book Like A Brief
History of Time by Stephen Hawking is a
science book so it goes into the science
section so now we'll see how we can
handle collisions so there are
collisions in hashing we'll see what it
is and how does it occur so Collision
happens when two books belong to the
same genre and therefore are assigned to
the same section for example 1984 by
George Orwell and To Kill a Mocking Bird
by Harbor Lee are both fiction and we'll
share the fiction section since
collisions are expected that is many
books can share a genre you can further
organize each section by author's last
name or book title alphabetically so how
this example relates to hashing so first
we'll talk about hash function so this
method of determining the book's
placement based on JRE acts as a hash
function it takes an input that is JRE
and Maps it to an output that is
bookshelf section now we talk about
efficiency so this method allows you to
quickly sort and locate books similar to
how hashing in Computing enables fast
data retrieval and talking about
Collision handling so just like in
Computing where hash functions need
methods to handle collisions like
chaining or open addressing in the
bookstore you use alphabetical order
within each genre to handle multiple
books of the same genre and moving
forward we'll discuss about these
collisions so don't worry we'll discuss
about them and now talking about
scalability so as the collection grows
the basic hashing system that is jiner
based sections remains effective and
further subdivisions like alphabetical
sorting help maintain order and
efficiency so why we use this method so
the reasons are number one is quick
access customers and staffs can find
books quickly by heading straight to the
relevant JRE section number two is
organized space the book store is neatly
organized making it visually appealing
and functional then comes the scalable
system as more books are added they can
easily be incorporated into the existing
system without needing a complete
recognition craving a career upgrade

have understood hashing with the help of
an example now we'll have an
introduction to hashing with the
definition so hashing in simple terms is
it's a process used in Computing to
quickly locate and store data imagine
you have a huge library of books and you
want to find a particular book or put a
new book in the exactly right place
without searching through every shelf so
hashing is like creating a unique code
for each book based on its title that
tells you exactly where it should go in
the shelves so this code is generated by
what we call a hash function so let's
move to importance of hashing in
computer science and data processing so
hashing is essential because it allows
computers to manage and retrieve data
very effectively so now we'll discuss
some of the few reasons that's why
hashing is crucial number one is speed
so hashing significantly speeds of data
retrieval making it possible to access
information almost instantly which is
crucial for performance in software and
web applications then comes consistency
hashing ensures that data is always
stored and retrieved in the same way
which helps in maintaining order and
predictability in complex systems then
comes Security in security applications
hashing is used to encode sensitive
information like passwords once hashed
these passwords are not easy to reverse
which means even if someone gets access
to the hashed password they can't easily
decode it to find out the original
password so now see where hashed values
are stored so hashed values are
typically stored in a structure known as
a hash table so a hash table is an array
of buckets or slots where each bucket
can hold one or more records so when a
hash function processes an input like a
password or a database entry it produces
a hash code which then determines in
which specific bucket the record should
be placed this system of using hash
codes to quickly locate data slots makes
retrieving data much more
straightforward and faster now
continuing from our introduction to
hashing let's delve deeper into some
basic concepts that make hashing an
effective tool in Computing so now we'll
see the applications of hashing in real
life so hashing is a powerful tool used
in many real life applications to make
processes more efficient and secure here
are some key areas where hashing plays
an important role number one is data
retriever so hashing is widely used to
speed up the process of finding data
when you look something up in a
dictionary or a phone book you don't go
through every entry instead you jump
directly to the section you need so
hashing does something similar with
Digital Data example imagine a library
system where books are sorted not just
by titles but by unique codes generated
from the titles these codes help the
librarian quickly locate any book
without scanning through every shelf
number two is security hashing is
crucial for protecting sensitive
information such as passwords when you
create a password it's hashed and stored
not the actual password when you login
the system hashes the password you enter
and checks it against the stored hash
for example when you sign in to your
email the system doesn't compare your
password directly to what's stored
instead it hashes your entered password
and Compares this hash to the stored
hash so this way even if someone
accesses the store data they won't see
your actual password now coming to
number three that is digital signatures
and integrity checking hashing ensures
that the data has not been tempered with
during transmission digital signatures
use hashing to verify the integrity and
authenticity of a message or document
for example when you download a software
update the provider might give you hash
of the file after downloading you can
hash the file and compare it to the
given hash if they match you know the
file is intact and has not been
corrupted or altered now coming to
number four that is Hash tables in
programming so hash tables or hash maps
are a common data structure in
programming that uses hashing to quickly
store and retrieve values this is
essential for databases memory caching
and many algorithms for example suppose
you developing an application that needs
to manage a large set of users using a
hash table you can quickly look up user
details by hashing their user idid to
find the corresponding data in memory
instead of searching through the entire
list of users now coming to the next
that is blockchain and cryptocurrencies
so hashing is fundamental to the
functioning of blockchain technology
which underpins cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin it ensures the Integrity of
transactions and blogs making the
blockchain secure and temper proof for
example in Bitcoin each block of
transaction is hashed and this hash is
included in the next block this chaining
of hashes ensures that altering any
block would require changing all
subsequent blocks which is
computationally in Practical now moving
to the basic concepts of hashing and
let's see what is a hash function so a
hash function is a special formula used
in Computing to quickly turn any kind of
data like a name a file or a password
into a small fixed size hash code this
hash code acts like a shortcut so a hash
function is a special formula used in
Computing to quickly turn any kind of
data like a name a file or a password
into small sized hash code this hash
code acts like a shortcut that helps the
computer quickly find out where this
data is stored in its memory or check if
two pieces of data are the same without
having to compare them directly so now
we'll see the properties of a good hash
function so a good hash function has
several important properties that ensure
it works well and securely number one is
determinism this means that no matter
how many times you use the hash function
on a particular piece of data it will
always give you the same hash code for
example every time you hash the name
allies you should always get the same
result then comes the next function that
is uniform distribution a hash function
should spread all the data evenly across
all the available hash codes this avoids
clustering of data in certain parts of
the memory which can slow down the
system it's like making sure no single
shelf in a library gets overcrowded with
books now coming to the next property
that is non invertibility that is oneway
function a hash function should be
difficult to reverse that means if you
have the hash code it should be really
hard to figure out what the original
data was this is especially important
for securing sensitive information like
passwords so now we have understood the
properties of a good hash function now
we'll move to the hash collisions so
what are collisions and why do they
occur so Collision in hashing happens
when two different pieces of data
produce the same hash value imagine you
have two different people with different
names but their names end up being
stored in the same spot because the hash
function give them the same hash code
this happens because the hash function
can only create a limited number of
codes so sometimes different data can
end up with the same code now we'll see
how we can handle these Collision
so the number one method to handle these
collisions is chaining so chaining is a
way to handle collisions by storing
multiple pieces of data in the same
sport so let's see how it works so if we
have two different names that end up
with the same hash code both names are
stored in a list at that spot for
example think of a mailbox where you can
put multiple letters if two letters are
supposed to go to the same mailbox you
just put both of them inside the same
box now coming to the second method that
is open addressing so open addressing
handles collisions by finding another
empty spot in the hash table so let's
see how it works so when a sport is
already taken the hash function looks
for the next available sport to store
the data example imagine a parking lot
where each car is assigned a sport if a
spot is already taken you find the next
free sport and park them if sport five
is taken you try to take the sport six
and so on until you find an m 1 so these
were the methods with that you can
handle collisions so salt and peppering
are methods used to make hashing more
secure especially for passwords so the
number one method that is salting so
this method what it does is it adds a
random value that is sold to the data
before hashing it this makes it harder
for attackers to guess the original data
for example if your password is my
password the system adds a random string
like 1 2 3 4 before hashing it so it
hashes my password 1 2 3 4 instead of
just my password so now coming to the
next method that is peppering so adding
a secret value that is pepper to the
hash which is kept secret and not stored
with the password for example it's like
adding a secret ingredient to a recipe
the pepper is a value known only to the
system making it even harder for
attackers to crack the hash data now
that we have covered the basics of
hashing and how to handle collisions
let's look at some of the most popular
hash functions used in the world of
computing so the most popular hash
functions are number one is md5 that is
message digest algorithm 5 md5 is one of
the oldest and most widely known hash
functions md5 takes an input that is
message and returns a fixed size string
of 128 bits that is usually represented
as a 32 character hexadecimal number so
its typical use is it was commonly used
to check the Integrity of files and to
ensure data that hasn't been corrupted
during transmission for example when you
download software the website might
provide you an md5 hash so you can
verify that the file you received is
exactly the same as the one on the
server so due to vulnerabilities found
in md5 such as the ability to produce
the same hash value for different inputs
that is there occurred collisions it is
no longer considered secure for
cryptographic purposes then comes
another method or another hash function
that is sh1 that is secure hash
algorithm 1 and it's the another older
hash function that was widely used for
many years so sh1 produces a 160 bit
hash value typically represented as a 40
character hexadecimal number so it's
typical use was sh1 was used in security
applications and protocols including TLs
and SSL for securing data transmission
or the internet so like md5 sh1 has been
found to have significant
vulnerabilities and it is no longer
recommended for security sensitive
applications it has been replaced by
more secure versions of the Sha family
that is sha 256 now we'll see this
application that is secure hash
algorithm 256bit so it is a part of the
sh2 family and it is widely used today
due to its strong security features so
s256 generates a hash value of 256 bits
represented as a 64 character
hexadecimal number it is is designed to
the much more secure than md5 and sh1 so
its typical uses sha 256 is used in
various security applications and
protocols including SSL TLS for secure
internet connections Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies for securing
transactions and in digital signatures
to verify the authenticity of documents
and sha 256 is considered highly secure
and is recommended for using situations
where data integrity and security are
Paramount now if we do a simple
comparison of hash functions so to help
you understand these hash functions
betters so md5 that creates a 128bit
hash good for checking data Integrity
but not secure for cryptographic uses
sh1 that creates a 160 bit hash more
secure than the md5 but still vulnerable
to attack then comes the sh 256 that
creates a 256bit hash very secure and
widely used in modern applications for
ensuring data integrity and security so
this was all about hash functions now
moving to hashing in artificial
intelligence so hashing is not only
essential in data storage and security
but also plays a crucial role in the
field of artificial intelligence so
let's see how it makes AI or uses AI to
make processes more efficient and
manageable number one is feature hashing
for dimensionally reduction so in AI
particularly in machine learning models
that often need to process large amounts
of data with many features or at
attributes sometimes the number of
features can be so large that it makes
the model slow and difficult to manage
so feature hashing also known as the
hashing trick helps solve this problem
by reducing the number of features so
feature hashing transforms the feature
into a fix size array or vector of a
specified length regardless of the
original number of features it uses a
hash function to map each feature into
one of the positions in this areay for
example imagine you have a data set with
thousands of unique words instead of
creating a spreadsheet column for each
word which would be anonymous you use
feature hashing to map these words into
a smaller fixed number of columns and
each word gets HED into one of these
columns effectively reducing the number
of dimensions and the benefits are this
reduces the memory required and speeds
of the computation making the model more
efficient without losing too much
information then comes reducing data
complexity and enhancing scalability
hashing also helps in reducing the
complexity of data which is crucial for
making algorithms faster and more
scalable so how does this do it so
number one is simplifying data so by
converting complex data into simple hash
codes hashing makes it easier for AI
algorithms to process and analyze the
data quickly this is particularly useful
in task like image recognition where
large and complex data sets are common
then comes scalability hashing allows AI
systems to handle large volumes of data
efficiently for example in large scale
recommendation systems used by companies
like Netflix or Amazon hashing helps
manage and retrieve user data swiftly to
provide real-time recommendations then
comes speeding up search and retrieval
hash functions allows AI systems to
quickly find and access data for example
in natural language processing NLP
hashing can be used to index and
retrieve text Data swiftly improving the
performance of search engines and chat
boards now we'll see the Practical
demonstration to understand how hashing
Works in practice so we'll look at a
simple coding example in Python and
we'll create a hash table and use a hash
function to store and retrieve data so
let's see that so moving to visual
studio code I have the function here so
you could see that we have written a
code here and we have provided a hash
function to calculate the hash value of
a given key and we have created a hash
table that will represent as a list of
list to handle collisions using chaining
so what we are doing is defining a
simple hash function here so this
function calculates the hash value for a
G given key and table size so this is
the function header defining the hash
function it takes key and table size as
parameters then we have hash value that
is this line converts the key to an
integer by summing the ski values of its
characters then we are returning it that
is this line Returns the hash value
modulo the table size ensuring the
result fits within the bounce of the
hash table now what we are doing is
defining the hash table size that is
this line sets the size of the hash
table to 10 now we'll create an empty
hash table that we have created and now
we will insert the function that is this
function inserts a key value pair into
the hash table and now we'll Define the
retrieving function that is this
function retrieves the value associated
with the given key from the hash table
that is this is the header and then we
have the index so this line calculates
the hash value for the given key and
this Loop P rates or the key value pairs
in the list at the calculated index and
if KV that is this condition checks if
the current key matches the given key
and if a match is found this line
returns Associated value and if no match
is found this line returns none and now
we'll insert some data into the hash
table so these lines insert three key
value pairs into the hash table that is
Apple that have one banana 2 and Cherry
3 so now we'll retrieve the data from
the hash table so we are printing the
values that is for apple banana cherry
and grape so in summary you can see I
will run the code for you guys as you
have declared the key value pairs for
apple banana and Cherry and there was no
for grape you could see that it has
returned Apple 1 banana 2 Cherry 3 and
grape none so this code example
demonstrates how to create a hash table
insert data into it and retrieve data
from it using a simple hash function so
the has function ensures that each key
is mapped to a specific index in the
hash table making data retrieval
efficient so with that guys we have come
