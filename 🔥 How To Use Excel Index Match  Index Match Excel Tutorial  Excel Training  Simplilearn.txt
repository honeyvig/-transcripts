or simply click on the link in the
description box below now without
further delay let's get started with a
onepoint agenda that is index match
function in Excel so what exactly is
index match function in Excel so index
match function is one of the excel's
most powerful features the older brother
of match used V lookup and X lookup
function and index match allows you to
look up values in table based on the
rows and columns and like we lookup it
can be used on rows and columns both at
the same time so if you have already
used V lookup or hookup you know that we
look up functions from left to right not
from right to left and there are some
drawbacks in both V lookup and HED
lookup and we also have got X lookup to
overcome those but U one other healthy
alternative to X lookup is index matage
so that's exactly what we are going to
discuss today so let's get back to the
Practical mode so now we are on the
Practical mode so for the demo here we
have employee ID name and designation
Department salary employee date of birth
and date of Journey so we will use index
match function in Excel to EXT ract the
salary of an employee based on the
employee ID given here so first we have
to use the index function so index
function is like your coordinates right
so you have to know where your result is
so since we are looking for salary it's
in the E column give the column number e
now it needs it has the location where
your answer is but it needs the exact
coordinate where is that particular you
know that row and column intersection
point and from that particular cell it
will extract the required result so to
give that you can give it manually so
here you have the row number and column
number so let's say we wanted the salary
of uh employee number
one23 so we will be giving the row
number as 13 right so this is possible
because we have a small data set but
what if we had a bigger data set which
had thousands or lcks of rows so you
needed some automated method to give you
the row number based on the match right
so that's where exactly the match
function comes into picture now we will
give the match function and now the look
up value so where do you want to look up
right so this is where we have the
employee ID which is
J1 right this is the cell where we will
be writing the uh employee ID and the
index function will look for the match
and match function will look up the the
lookup value in this particular location
that's the lookup value and now the
lookup array now the employee IDs are
present in the First Column which is a
column right so this is the lookup array
you will give so this will be the lookup
array that you will be giving select
that and comma you will be providing the
exact match bracket close another
bracket close enter now enter the now
enter the employee ID
so select any of the employee IDs and
there you go you have the salary details
over here this is fine but what if let's
say I have given the employee numbers
here and uh I wanted their other details
let's say I wanted to know their name BR
and now I wanted to know their
designation seeum I wanted to know their
salary I want to know their Department I
wanted to know their date of birth and
date of joint
okay so here you might want to change
the data type here so it it is currently
General if you change it to date and
time you will be getting the exact
result right so what if you wanted to do
that is it possible yes it is possible
it is again comes back to the same index
match but you need to pass another extra
match parameter here so how to do that
let's do it so here everything will be
same equals to index and now we will be
giving the employee ID right so it's
based on employee ID first so um now
close that we will be calling the match
function and now the match function will
also look for the employee ID this is
fine and now the lookup array so the
lookup array for the employee numbers is
again a this is fine now the exact match
select zero
and close the function now comes the
critical part another match function
right so it wants the match based on the
lookup value present over here right so
select that and what all the other
column names you have which are these
right so give all the column names comma
again you want an exact
match close another close bracket
enter yeah we made a small mistake so
when you see at Index right we knew that
the answer what was supposed to be
coming was only employee ID but here we
I mean the answer what we are expecting
can be anywhere right it can be an
employee ID it can be an employee name
right if we provide employee name the
answer from should be coming from column
B right so we have to change the index
from a to entire G now we have the full
scale data set entered into the formula
if you press enter now you have the
answer now let's say I'm changing the
employee ID to
116 and now I want employee designation
there you go right if you go to 116 you
have Mara and the designation is
contract based and if you want to know
which department Mara is working with
then you have the department as
analytics which is right over here so
that's how the index match function
works for more details or any other help
