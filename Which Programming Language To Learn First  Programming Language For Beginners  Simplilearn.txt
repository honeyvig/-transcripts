today computers are an integral part of
our everyday life
they are being used in every industry
around the world from laptops to
smartphones smart variable devices and
many such other devices
everything you can think of is done
using the website or an application from
watching movies to ordering food or a
cab
as you might already know people write
software or applications to optimize the
use of these computers with all this
popularity comes a massive demand for
the people who can write or code these
applications that can run on these
computers
this has created an opportunity for
everyone to learn to program and use
that skill in almost every industry that
they work in
hey everyone welcome to another yet
exciting video from simply learn
in this session we will be discussing
which programming language you should
learn first
however before we begin with this
session let's take a look at the agenda
for today's discussion first we will
begin with learning the role of
programming then i will walk you through
our next topic to understand which
programming language you should learn
first after that we will move into
learning jobs to be expected
then we will dive deep into learning the
top and trending programming languages
at present finally we will wind up by
discussing the benefits of learning
programming
before we begin with the session make
sure that you have subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to
click that bell icon to never miss an
update from simply learn
so without any further ado let's get
started with our first topic on the
session
what is the rule of programming
programming language is an artificial
language used to control a machine's
behavior particularly a computer
programming languages are used to
facilitate communication between
organizing and manipulating information
to express algorithms precisely
programmers usually code and work on the
programs to communicate easily with the
computer
programming also involves maintaining
debugging troubleshooting and many
software related issues
now let's have a look at which
programming language you should learn
first
the first step to learning programming
is to identify the programming language
you would want them to learn
focus on courses that start from the
basics of programming language because
at the end concepts should be clear so
you can grasp any language you want to
learn and gain proficiency in that
language
it is also quite easy to understand the
concepts when you move
further
most of the programming languages are
related to one another most of the
concepts are always covered in other
languages as well
if you are a beginner to programming and
looking forward to learning programming
then c programming language is the best
programming language to start with
c programming language covers all the
basics which can make it easy to learn
other programming languages a general
purpose programming language supporting
structured programming lexical variable
scope and recursion with a static type
system
in simple terms we can say c programming
language is a computer programming
language developed to do system
programming for the operating system
unix and is an imperative programming
language
it was initially developed at bell labs
by dennis ricci between 1992 and 1993.
it was designed to provide low level
access to memory and language constructs
that map efficiently to machine
instructions all with minimal runtime
support
let's have a look at some of the top
topics covered in c programming language
data types storage classes input and
output control statements operators
functions pointers memory management and
file handling let us have a look at a
simple program in c programming language
here is the code of how we can develop a
program in the c language
this is a basic program in c language
you can see that on my screen we are
trying to print a simple message using c
programming language that is hello world
now moving ahead let's talk about some
major benefits of learning c programming
language
once you have a good command over c
programming language you might want to
go to an advanced level of programming
by learning new programming languages
and become a software developer or in
case if you are not interested in
programming and you're good at numbers
then you might want to become a data
scientist or a data analyst and there
are a wide spectrum of jobs available in
the id industry based on programming
now let us have a look at the jobs to be
expected in the iit industry once you're
comfortable with a programming language
there are many types of jobs to be
expected after learning programming but
let us see at the top trending jobs in
the iit industry which give a heavy and
handsome salary
the first and top one of those is the
data scientists
a data scientist is a professional who
gathers and analyzes large sets of data
data scientists also possess and help in
solving complex problems
the skills that a data scientist should
possess r to be good at mathematics
statistics and analytics and also some
good programming languages like python r
and sql
followed by that we have big data
engineer
big data has been a revolution in every
business sector
a big data developer is responsible for
storing processing and analyzing the
data they design and develop significant
data architecture
they should have some skills like hadoop
apache spark java and sql
next we have software developer so this
kind of job role is especially for those
people who are really interested in
coding and programming software
developers majorly analyze design and
develop software to make the ends meet
they maintain the design and software
system at times they also oversee the
work of computer technologists
programmers and technicians
they should have skills like
mathematical aptitude problem solving
skills programming languages excellent
organizational and time management
skills accuracy and attention to detail
next we have web developers web
developers try to develop the software
applications and integrate user facing
elements into applications they also
help and instruct the organizations with
logical frameworks
they should have some good skills with
web development and web development
programming languages like python php
and much more and also they should be
comfortable with web development
frameworks
so now that we have discussed the jobs
to be expected after having some
fundamental understanding with
programming let us see how the jobs are
categorized in it industry
majorly their jobs are categorized into
two segments software development and
web development and on the other hand we
have data science and data analytics so
if you're a hardcore programmer then you
can choose software development and web
development if you're good with number
statistics and like to make predictions
using the data then data analytics is
the good job role for you and if you are
interested in developing machine
learning algorithms and try to interact
with artificial intelligence then data
science would be the right job role for
you
now let us understand the top trending
programming languages for either of the
job roles
for being a software developer and a web
developer the major programming
languages that you need to concentrate
on are python java and javascript
so the major skills that you need to
require to become a software developer
or a web developer are to have a good
command over coding proficiency in data
structures and algorithms having a good
knowledge of database software testing
javascript html and css seo that is
search engine optimization and lastly
front-end and back-end application
development
so the major skills required by a data
scientist and a data analyst are having
good understanding of sql microsoft
excel our programming language python
programming language machine learning
skills presentation skills data
visualization and critical analytical
thinking
now let's have a look at the top and
trending programming languages and the
first one in the list is python
python is the most preferred programming
language because of the syntax of python
programming language can be very easy to
understand for all the readers
and python programming language is also
loaded with libraries that help in
implementing scientific computing
working and deployment in python are
supportive and easy in any environment
so these are the some of the top most
topics covered in python which includes
strings lists and tuples dictionaries
and sets conditional execution analogues
comprehensions functions modules scopes
and namespaces file handling writing
library object oriented programming this
is the most important concept then we
have iterator generator decorators
regular expressions building framework
exception handling and context manager
meta classes introspection
multi-threading and multi-processing
now let us also understand some of the
important reasons to learn python
programming language
python provides clean syntax that is
easy to understand and learn for
beginners
by learning python we can expect better
jobs with high paying salaries
one of the major benefits of python is
it provides open source and development
these are few reasons why to choose
python and the next one is java
in this modern time java is the best
language to choose nearly thousands of
applications software and development
tools are built using java programming
language this technology is mainly used
in creating websites such as youtube
google amazon and much more
some of the important topics to be
covered in java are object oriented
programming concepts
basic java constructs like loops and
data types
string handling
collection framework multi-threading
exception handling generics
synchronization serialization and dc
realization concurrent collection swing
graphical user interface and access
modifiers in java
now let us also learn some of the
important reasons to choose java
programming language there is a lot of
demand for java developers in the
software industry for its benefits
java also provides open source library
support which is a major benefit in the
development of applications
java also offers a wide range of
development tools which help develop the
applications in a better way
these are a few reasons why to choose
java and the next one is our programming
language our language is very scalable
and makes it easy to build aesthetic web
applications this language is mainly
developed using statistics and data
science knowledge
r acts as a cross platform because of
the ability to run on any operating
system
so some of the important topics to be
learnt are how to manage csv files excel
files binary files xml files json files
web data how to connect to a database
and then the data visualization tools
which include learning how to create pie
charts bar charts etc then how to
calculate mean median and mode linear
regression logistic regression normal
distribution binomial distribution
poisson regression non-linear least
square
decision tree random forest etc
so all these things come under
statistics
now let us also look at some of the
important reasons to choose our
programming language r is machine
independent it supports cross platform
operation thus it is usable on many
different operating systems r is an open
source programming language due to this
r has a huge community that contributes
to its environment
r helps in development of interactive
web applications
so these are the few reasons why to
learn our programming language and the
most important and final one is the
javascript
javascript is responsible for fast and
secure development the main advantage
and perspective are to provide more
interactivity with the users and coders
it also helps in expanding innovative
technologies which involve animation
gaming and rendering
some of the important concepts to be
learnt in javascript are objects classes
functions properties methods accessors
constructors prototypes iterables sets
maps html dom asynchronous browser
object material web apis json and jquery
now let us understand some of the
reasons why to choose javascript
javascript is the most popular language
which is a reason for increasing the
development and speed of applications
javascript is easy to learn and
understand which is a major benefit for
learning javascript
javascript also provides the ability to
support all browsers which can be more
beneficial to choose javascript
so these are the few reasons why to
choose javascript finally let's have a
look at the benefits of learning
programming
programming helps in building
self-confidence in a person while
dealing with projects
they also hold a critical role in career
development
programming also helps in improving
creativity while dealing with the
applications and projects they use much
creativity to develop those
they require a lot of creative knowledge
and also it helps in starting your own
business
programming also helps in situations
like problem solving using these it is
easy to find solutions to complex
problems perfectly and also it helps in
development of creative and innovative
technology
