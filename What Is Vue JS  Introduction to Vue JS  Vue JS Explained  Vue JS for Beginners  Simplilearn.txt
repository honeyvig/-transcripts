hello everyone and welcome back to
another video by simply learn this is
anubhav and in this video we will be
learning about vuojs but before we begin
if you haven't subscribed to our channel
already make sure to hit the subscribe
button and press the bell icon so you'll
never miss any update from simply learn
so without further ado let's begin and
see what's in it for you
first we will see the introduction to
ujs
after that
we'll see what is a javascript front-end
framework moving ahead we'll see what is
view js after that what is progressive
framework and then we will see the
features of ujs
so let's begin
before we start using vue.js you must
have intermediate level knowledge of
html css and javascript it might not be
a good idea to start with the framework
if you are completely new to the
front-end programming a modern framework
for creating user interface is called
view it is in progressive framework and
an open source
view gs is used to create dynamic web
interfaces
one of the well-known frameworks for
streamlining web development is this one
the view layer is where vue.js focuses
it may be seamlessly integrated into a
large front-end development projects
view js installation is pretty simple to
begin with integrative web frameworks
are simple to understand and quick to
construct with any developer formal
google employee even you is the creator
of vue.js
viewdis initial version was released in
february 2014 and it is currently rated
as 64 000 plus stars on github
a progressive javascript framework
called vue.js is utilized to create
interactive web interfaces the front end
or the view portion is given
considerable attention
the integration with other projects in
library is fairly simple vue.js is
relatively easy to install and beginners
can quickly grasp its concepts and begin
creating their own user interfaces
the javascript framework for creating
user interfaces called vue.js which is
also the easiest understand focuses
mostly on the view part
view 2.0 will be the version we utilize
throughout this course in future videos
we will deal with a lot of html
javascript and css file because u is
primarily designed for front-end
development
now let's move on to what is a
javascript front-end framework
view is the ideal introduction to the
javascript framework if you are not
familiar with them modern applications
are made possible by the javascript
framework they are frequently utilized
on the web modern javascript
applications also serve many desktop and
mobile application a javascript
front-end framework is a group of
javascript code libraries that help
programmers in performing common tasks
and functionalities in order to make the
app easier to develop it also provides
reusable code components a universal
development environment compilers tool
sets code libraries apis etc
now
let's move on to what is vue.js
a javascript front-end framework called
vue.js used to create user interface
it provides a declarative and component
based programming approach that enables
you to quickly create user interface no
matter how straightforward or complex
they may be it works on a top of the
industry standard html css and
javascript when using vue.js you can add
directives which are html attributes
html app can function thanks to vujs
directive built-in and user-defined
directives are also available in vue.js
you don't need prior knowledge of
webpack people ntm or anything else to
start with view but view makes it simple
for you to rely on them when you are
ready
vue.js is referred as a progressive
framework because changes and
improvements are made on a regular basis
because it makes it easier for us to
construct single page application and a
dynamic user interface
vue.js works on top of industry
standards like html css and javascript
now let's see what is a progressive
framework
first what is the meaning of progressive
this means the framework is used in
addition to html markup in short it is a
data model that is connected to a
template model a progressive is a
framework that is progressive just to
the complexity of a project as it is the
changes and the improvements are made on
a regular basis on vue.js
viewjs makes it easier for us to
construct single page application and
dynamic user interface
now let's move on to the features of ujs
the first feature of ujs is virtual dom
the virtual representation of a dom is
called virtual law
a javascript object that is identical to
the real dom is constructed using
virtual dom every time a modification to
a dom is required a new javascript
object is formed and the modifications
are made later the final changes are
updated in the actual dom after a
comparison of the two javascript objects
the second one is data binding with the
help of binding directives called b bind
which comes with vue.js the data binding
functionalities escitates in
manipulating or assigning values to html
attributes changing the styles and
assigning class
the next one is components one of the
vue.js key features components enable
the creation of the unique elements that
can be reused throughout html now let's
move on to the next one
which is event handling
in order to listen the events in vue.js
the dom elements have the property
called v on which helps them to handle
the program
the next one is the transition
or you can say animations
when html elements are added changed or
removed from the dom view ds offers a
variety of techniques to apply
transition
for the transition effects an element
must be wrapped in a built-in transition
components of vue.js the interface can
be made more interactive in third-party
animation library are also simple to add
now
the next feature of view js is computing
properties one of the vue.js key
characteristics is computing properties
it is beneficial to pay attention to the
ui element changes and makes the
appropriate calculations
no further coding is required for this
the next one is
the templates
it provides html based template that
connect the data from the vue.js
instance to the dom the templates are
converted into simulated dom render
functions
the templates for render functions can
be used by web developers who can then
swap out the template for the render
function the next one is directives
the built in directives in vue.js can be
used to carry out a variety of front-end
tasks including vf vls vshow v on v-bind
and v-model
the next one is routing view routing is
used to navigate between pages and with
this
we have reached the end of this video in
the next video on view js we will see
how to install vue.js and we will create
and learn new things about vue.js so
