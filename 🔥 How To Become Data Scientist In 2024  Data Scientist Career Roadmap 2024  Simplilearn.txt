simply learn but before we begin if you
enjoy watching these videos and find
them interesting subscribe to our
Channel as we bring you the best videos
daily also hit the Bell icon to never
miss any updates from Simply donear now
let's get started companies worldwide
have continuously gathered and analyzed
customer data to Prov provide better
service and improve their bottom lines
in today's Digital World We Gather
tremendous amounts of data which
requires non-traditional data processing
methods and software data science helps
businesses understand and utilize data
effectively it uses maths statistics Ai
and computer engineering techniques to
analyze large data sets by doing this
data scientists can discover insights
about past events their causes future
Trends and how to apply the information
having said that if you want to become a
data science expert and gain handsome
packages look at the wide range of data
science programs offered by simply learn
in collaboration with top universities
across the globe by enrolling in any of
these certification programs you gain
expertise in skills like statistics
Python Programming data analysis using
SQL machine learning deep learning
natural language processing and much
more covering a wide range of tools
including python libraries like napai
pandas and pyit lar as well as data
visualization tools like mat blot lip
and tblo you will cast the eye of the
top recruiters so what are you waiting
for hurry up and enroll now a minimum
experience of one year is preferred to
enroll in these courses find the course
links in the description box below so
without further delay let's get started
what is data science data science is a
multi-disciplinary field that uses
scientific methods algorithms processes
and systems to extract knowledge and
insights from structured and
unstructured data it combines computer
science statistics domain knowledge and
computer data visualization expertise to
solve complex problems make datadriven
decisions and predict future outcomes
what does a data scientist a data
scientist extracts analyzes and
interprets data to uncover valuable
insights and inform strategic decisions
they collect and clean data from various
sources and analyze exploratory data to
identify patterns roles and
responsibilities of a data scientist
firstly data collection and cleaning
data scientists are responsible for
acquiring collecting and cleaning data
sets this involves sourcing data from
various databases apis or other sources
and ensuring its quality by handling
missling values outliners and
inconsistencies next is exploratory data
analysis data scientists perform edas
are also known as exploratory data
analysis to gain a deep understanding of
data they use statistical and
visualization techniques to identify
patterns correlations and outliners
which inform subsequent analysis
followed by that we have model
development developing predictive models
is a core responsibility data scientists
build machine learning models to solve
specific businesses or research problems
selecting appropriate algorithms and
fine-tuning them for Optimal Performance
moving ahead we have data visualization
data scientists create informative
visualizations and reports to
communicate findings and insights to
non-technical stakeholders effective
visualization is crucial for making
datadriven decisions followed by that we
have feature engineering feature
engineering involves selecting creating
or transforming relevant variables to
improve model accuracy data scientists
are skilled in identifying the most
informative features for a given problem
moving ahead we have skills required to
become a data scientist here are the six
essential skills that a data scientist
should possess first programming
Proficiency in programming languages
like python or R is fundamental for data
scientists they use these languages to
manipulate data and build machine
learning models and also develop data
analysis scripts moving ahead we have
statistics and Mathematics strong
foundation in statistics and Mathematics
is essential for understanding the
underlying principles of data analysis
hypothesis testing and machine learning
algorithms next machine learning data
scientists should have expertise in
machine learning techniques including
supervised and unsupervised learnings
deep learnings and reinforcement
learning they need to choose train and
evaluate models effectively next in the
list is data manipulation skills in data
processing cleaning and transformation
are crucial data scientists work with
messy and complex data sets so the
ability to prepare data for analysis is
the key skill followed by that we have
data visualization proficient data
visualization skills help data
scientists communicate their findings
effectively to both Technical and
non-technical stakeholders tools like
matplot lib cbon or tblo are commonly
used moving ahead we will discuss the
salary of a data scientist there is a
possibility that the salary will vary
depending on the company you're working
with as well as the level of knowledge
and experience that you bring with you
top companies like Google Snapchat open
eii and many more are hiring data
scientist in US according to glass store
the average salary of a data scientist
ranges between
$150,000 to
$160,000 per anom coming to a salary in
India the demand for data scientist in
India has caught the attention of major
industry players with renowned companies
such as Deo Phillips slice and other
actively seeking to add these
professionals into their teams according
to glastar the national average salary
of a data scientist is 15 lakhs per
random annually in India in conclusion
embracing data science isn't just a
choice it's a strategic decision that
can reshape how your organization
approaches data science with that we
