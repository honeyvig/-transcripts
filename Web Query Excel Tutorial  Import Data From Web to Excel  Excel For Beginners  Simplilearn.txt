let's get started with our one point
agenda that is
web query in excel
now you might be wondering what exactly
is web query so you all know that excel
is a brilliant data analytics and
business intelligence tool right so it
requires some data to be stored or some
data to be analyzed right that creates
as an opportunity for the sources so
don't think that excel is something
where you just you know copy paste the
data and that's how it stores or you
need to manually enter the data no
it can get connected to a various and
wide variety of data sources
ranging from a simple file database csv
and microsoft access data analysis
services and many more and including web
right now there might be a case where
you are
you know interested in getting the data
from a direct web page which is dynamic
for example you might be interested in
stock market right and you wanted to you
know take the data which is dynamic
directly from the stock market
right so is it possible for excel to
take and store the dynamic data
yes you can do it so now here we are on
the stock market india website and let's
get into the most active stocks table
click on that
and you are navigated to the most active
shares in india currently now select the
url of this particular web page get back
to your
get back to your excel and here on the
data button in the toolbar you can see
from text csv from web right so let's uh
select the get data option from other
sources from web you can either choose
this or feel free to choose this as well
over here
so let's go to
web
and here you might want to place your
url paste the url and press ok
and you will have
some time connecting to the server
give it some time
now while we are at it let me tell you
guys that we have daily updates on
microsoft excel and also a lot more
technologies in the current id industry
so if you want to get updated on all the
technologies in the current it market
then make sure that you subscribe to our
channel and don't forget to hit that
bell icon to never miss an update from
simply learn
now you can see that we are successfully
connected to the data and you can see
various data tables over here so for
example let's select on the table zero
so all this data is the current active
and dynamic data from the website we
selected so let's just press on load to
load just one table as of now and see
how it works
so the data is loading again we might
have to give a little time to for the
data to load onto the excel spreadsheet
now you can see the data has been
successfully loaded and all the details
that is the company name
highest price lowest price last price
change percentage and the value and
cross everything has been updated
including the 5 day performance right
now you can you know hide this because
it's a lot of information to grasp
altogether now here you can see all the
data has been currently stored onto the
excel spreadsheet now you might be
wondering if this particular data as
valid or if this particular data is
really dynamic or not right so to answer
that question
let's see that the data option again
and here you can see the refresh button
so click on refresh all and you can see
there is a query running in the
background from the web right so here
you can see running background query so
this will run a query and the numbers
will be updated
so let's remember any one of the numbers
maybe they might be so i'll take a quick
glance here and try to remember the
numbers we can take a screenshot and
after the query has successfully run you
can see some changes in the numbers
right
so maybe some numbers are changed here
since we have finished our query
so that's how the
web query in excel works with the
dynamic data
