1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,679
hello there t back with another watch

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,839
kid tutorial well not another one this

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,160
is my first watch kit tutorial for

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,400
YouTube now basically uh this is a watch

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,200
uh an Apple Watch app and what this does

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,320
is it's a guessing game um so basically

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,119
it generates a random number and then

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,800
you have to guess that random

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,199
number and it counts how many tries you

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,519
take so it's both for the iPhone um and

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,160
the Apple watch so first I'll start off

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,800
by showing you the um uh iPhone Edition

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,079
and then I'll show you the Apple watch

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,480
Edition so if I uh try to make a number

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,640
bigger here I make my guess bigger on

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,160
the iPhone and I click submit eight is

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,600
too small and also it generates numbers

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,520
between 1 and 30 so 8's too small

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,480
meaning it's between 8 and

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,199
30 if I increase it so now it's in

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,840
between 13 and 30

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,559
18 and

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,960
30 okay I just got it

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,759
correct so that's basically how it works

25
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,479
and I got it corrected in for tries and

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,960
then I can also ask for a new number

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,759
that resets it and makes a new number

28
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,920
and then I can also use the Apple watch

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,560
Edition to do stuff and then okay five

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,079
is two

31
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,240
small let's try

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,920
10 two big

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,560
baby

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,200
eight um oh sorry smaller correct so

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,320
yeah so that's basically how it works

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,280
and now I'll show you the code and yeah

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,920
the full source code for this tutorial

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,320
will be available in the description

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,880
from GitHub and uh

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,000
yeah so let's uh

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,600
start basically this is the iPhone code

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,560
and then I'll introduce you to the watch

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,399
code

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,240
so first of all in the storyboard we

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,920
have two labels guest label here and

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,720
output label here and then we have four

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,280
buttons uh smaller bigger new number and

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,920
submit okay so now we have two IB

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,640
outlets for the guest label and the

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,440
output label we have three variables in

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,519
a constant so the three variables are

52
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,440
the guest number which is the number

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,360
we've currently guessed uh the other

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,120
variable is the number of guesses you've

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,840
done till now uh the other um variable

56
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,720
is the random number that the computer

57
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,800
is comparing your guess

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,959
against now this is the constant and

59
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,360
this is the number to randomize till so

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,879
if this is let's say 300 it's going to

61
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,239
make a random number between 1 and 300

62
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,159
however if I make this 30 it's going to

63
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,840
make a random number each time between 1

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,400
and

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,400
30 so B basically um I have a new number

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,239
function in the viewed appear uh uh

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,000
function from the UI view controller

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,120
class and that's why we're doing

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,519
override and I couldn't put it in viewed

70
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,760
load since uh these IB Outlets wouldn't

71
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,519
be loaded uh in the viewed load function

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
since viewed load happens before the

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,000
view actually

74
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,959
appears okay and so next we have two um

75
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,080
functions that I created the big clicked

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,439
and small clicked functions now what

77
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,239
these functions handle is when you have

78
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,640
clicked on the button bigger or smaller

79
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,680
respectively so basically what we're

80
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,480
doing in the big clicked

81
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,400
function is we are making

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,360
sure that first of all you do not go

83
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,959
over 30 and in the small click to making

84
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,000
sure you don't go over I mean under

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,360
zero uh and then so basically in the big

86
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,720
click we're increasing your guest number

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
and we're setting the guest labels text

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,000
to that guess number uh we're doing the

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,439
exact opposite in small click we are

90
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,959
decreasing your guess number and we are

91
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,959
also uh setting the guess labels text to

92
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
it next what we're actually uh here what

93
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
we can do just to decrease the amount of

94
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,840
work if we change the um number to

95
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,120
randomize we can set this to num to

96
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,080
randomize so basically they'll just make

97
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,240
sure you don't go over this a number

98
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,039
instead of you having to type it in two

99
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,479
places okay so in the submit

100
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,840
function as you can see it's doing quite

101
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,080
a lot of work we're checking if your

102
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,280
guest number is greater than what the

103
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,199
computer has generated then we're

104
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
increasing the number of guesses and if

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,560
the number of guesses is not equal to

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,120
one then we're saying your guess is too

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,440
big and then these number of guesses

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,479
tries however if it is one then too big

109
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,199
number of guesses TR try since we don't

110
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,440
want one try we want one try two tries

111
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,240
three tries and then we're and then we

112
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,320
are setting the guest labels text to uh

113
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,600
your guest number is greater than

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,560
whatever the computer is generated just

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,880
a little symbol to um make more visual

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,960
appeal and then we're doing the exact

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,919
opposite here uh if your number is less

118
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,440
than the random number that the computer

119
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,280
has generated we're increasing the

120
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,199
number of guesses doing the exact same

121
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,720
thing here except we're saying it's to

122
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,800
small and then uh here we are telling

123
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,720
them that their number is smaller than

124
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,080
what we had what the computer as

125
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,600
generator and then else if all these

126
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,319
conditions fail meaning the only thing

127
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,280
left is equals uh it will it will uh

128
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,199
increase the number of guesses um and

129
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,479
then it's going to check if it's not one

130
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,440
uh if it's not one correct in number of

131
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,240
guesses tries else uh correct in this

132
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,919
try

133
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,840
and yeah those are the main functions

134
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
and then the new number function which

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,919
basically acts as a reset um function

136
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,479
basically creates a new random number

137
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,560
between 1 and 30 but since the arc for

138
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,440
random uniform function will uh generate

139
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,880
a random number from 0 to 29 I'm adding

140
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
one so if it's zero it'll become one if

141
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
it's 29 it'll become uh

142
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,000
30 so then here um we're setting guest

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,280
labels text to zero and output labels

144
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,720
text to nothing and we're setting the

145
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,000
number of guesses to zero and the guest

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,280
number to zero uh we're basically

147
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,960
resetting those

148
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,639
variables uh yeah so that's basically it

149
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,000
for the iPhone

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,560
end and since this isn't a from the

151
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,440
groundup uh just totally beginner

152
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,680
tutorial I'm not going to be showing you

153
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
exactly how I created this watch app

154
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,840
step by step however number one I will

155
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,240
be putting the source code in the

156
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,319
description if you want to download it

157
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,759
take a look at it uh modify it to be

158
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,199
your own you have uh permission to do

159
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,960
that and uh also uh this week or maybe

160
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
even next week I will release another

161
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,840
watch kit tutorial uh where I will

162
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,199
basically um teach you from the ground

163
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,520
up how to create a simple app uh I'm

164
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,400
still not exactly sure about that so

165
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,360
just uh keep looking at the channel if

166
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,000
you're really interested into that

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,720
okay so this is the watch storyboard as

168
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,479
you can see this is the Apple watch 38

169
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,039
mm storyboard and so we have the guest

170
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,599
label output label bigger smaller submit

171
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,759
new number functions I mean buttons and

172
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,960
so that's the storyboard and then the uh

173
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,039
actual code for it we're importing watch

174
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,319
kit instead of UI kit and then uh we

175
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,560
don't really need this uh import

176
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,440
Foundation a watch kit import Stu for us

177
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,639
so all the there's really no change in

178
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,319
the code um all we're doing is instead

179
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,560
of UI uh view controller we're doing WK

180
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,840
interface controller and then instead of

181
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,000
UI label we're doing we're using the WK

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,520
interface label uh both for the guest

183
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,199
label and the output

184
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,039
label uh the next change is that instead

185
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,840
of viewed load we have awake with

186
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,879
context in which way are putting our new

187
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,800
number

188
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,199
function and then we have two extra

189
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,519
default functions will activate and did

190
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,959
deactivate um and yeah that's really all

191
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,240
there is uh changed and instead of using

192
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,599
text as equal to for the labels we're

193
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,680
using the dot set text method to set the

194
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
text of this label to this

195
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,839
variable and so I can also change this

196
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,240
number to

197
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,120
randomize and yeah or actually what we

198
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,920
can do do if number of

199
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,680
guesses not equal to

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,760
one yeah so we need to make sure it does

201
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
either tries or try if they get it

202
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,720
correct in one

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,560
try then we just want to paste that

204
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,720
there and make that try yeah so that's

205
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
basically how the watch end works and uh
