1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,000
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,919
tutorial my name is tanya bakshi and

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,400
today

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,920
we're going to be going over the fourth

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,440
episode in the learn

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
deep learning from scratch series now

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,759
today is a continuation

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,519
of the previous episode right showing

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,040
you the number in the gator today

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,880
we're going to be talking about what i

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
like to call dimensionality reduction or

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,320
really this is a generic term really in

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,199
the industry

14
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,800
um but what we're going to be doing is

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
we're actually going to be exploring

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
dimensionality reduction

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
through what's known as gradient descent

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,199
now you've already seen an example of

19
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,880
gradient descent in action with a number

20
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,519
the gator

21
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,960
and today we're going to be taking a

22
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,480
look at how you can actually repurpose

23
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:34,960
that

24
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
in order to reduce the number of

25
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
dimensions in your data again

26
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,000
don't worry about what that means just

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
yet i'll be showing that to you in just

28
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
a moment so let's go ahead and dive

29
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
right into the example

30
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,719
all right now what you're seeing on

31
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,960
screen is a two-dimensional graph it's

32
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,480
kind of similar to the one that i had

33
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,160
shown you last time

34
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
except i just sort of expanded the graph

35
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,199
a little bit

36
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
now let's just say i would give you a

37
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,600
pretty challenging task

38
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
we've got the following three

39
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
dimensional coordinates

40
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,159
a b c and d right these are four

41
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,040
different points

42
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,439
in three dimensional space and i want

43
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
you to plot them

44
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
on this two dimensional graph how would

45
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,560
you do it

46
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
well you can't they're three dimensional

47
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,200
points

48
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,840
you fundamentally cannot just represent

49
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,439
three dimensions in two-dimensional

50
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
space it doesn't really make sense

51
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,119
now there are some ways you could do it

52
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,720
right like you could you know cast a

53
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,560
shadow of a three-dimensional object on

54
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
the two-dimensional space

55
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,680
there are different things you could do

56
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
um however being able to sort of

57
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
represent the same

58
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,119
structure of points from

59
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,320
three-dimensional space in the

60
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
two-dimensional space

61
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,600
is what's known as dimensionality

62
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,560
reduction

63
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
removing an entire dimension from a

64
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,479
certain sequence of points or some sort

65
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,320
of data that you have

66
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,560
now this might not seem extremely useful

67
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,799
immediately but think about it like this

68
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
let's just say you're dealing with

69
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,159
images of you know cats and dogs

70
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,159
and you use a neural network to bring

71
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,920
down uh the number of

72
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
aim it or the number of numbers that you

73
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
need to work with which you know

74
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,879
for a 4k image could be you know

75
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,959
thousands of different um numbers

76
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,319
let's just say you use a neural network

77
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,560
to bring that down to just 512 which is

78
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,239
totally reasonable

79
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,920
now the thing is we live in a universe

80
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
with just three spatial dimensions

81
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,480
and we physically cannot perceive what

82
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,200
512 spatial dimensions would be like

83
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
and therefore those values aren't very

84
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,480
important to you you can't really make

85
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,440
sense of them

86
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,560
so you've got to do what's known as

87
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
dimensionality reduction to bring them

88
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,040
down to

89
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,959
you know what we as mere mortals can

90
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,160
actually comprehend

91
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,239
which is just three or fewer spatial

92
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,280
dimensions

93
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,480
in this case though i've given you

94
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,640
something a little bit simpler which is

95
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
we go from three dimensions to two

96
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,879
dimensions so we can plot it more easily

97
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,959
on this graph

98
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,480
now there's a couple of ways we could go

99
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
about doing this and here's the way that

100
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
i've decided we'll do it

101
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,879
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

102
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,040
take each pair of points so

103
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,480
for example a b a c a d then

104
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,360
b c and c d and so on and i'm going to

105
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,879
take all these different um

106
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
coordinate pairs and we're going to find

107
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,159
the distance of

108
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,280
every point to every other point then

109
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
we're going to try and map those

110
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,959
distances to a bunch of

111
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,200
2d coordinates where the distances are

112
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
preserved as much

113
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,040
as possible but how do we find

114
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
2d coordinates where the distances

115
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
between all of them

116
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,680
match the distances between a b c and d

117
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,000
well let's figure it out now of course

118
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,879
just with like

119
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,640
a lot of things in life we're gonna

120
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
start off with a pretty random

121
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,760
initialization so let's just say we've

122
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,360
got these four points

123
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,560
and we want these to now represent a b

124
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,000
c and d now these are starting off at

125
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,519
completely random locations right it

126
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,640
doesn't matter

127
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
where they are right now but what i'm

128
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,799
going to do is i'm going to somehow

129
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,439
move these dots to where i know they

130
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,680
represent a similar structure to what a

131
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:55,920
b

132
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,640
c and d do in three-dimensional space

133
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,239
the way i'm going to do this

134
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,120
is by drawing a line between all of them

135
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,760
right so

136
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
there's lines going between all the

137
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,360
different dots now and what i'm going to

138
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,200
do is i'm also going to plot out on the

139
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
bottom right corner for you

140
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,200
a little bit of a legend all right now

141
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,439
each line is color coded

142
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,840
and for every line you can see two

143
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,600
values in the bottom ray

144
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
one is y and one is y hat

145
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,800
now the y which is the one on the right

146
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
is the actual

147
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,880
distance between those two points in

148
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,479
three dimensional space

149
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,680
so this is the actual like label for

150
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
how far away we know these points are

151
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,120
supposed to be

152
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
so for example you know red 7.3

153
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
we know that whatever two points red is

154
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,919
connecting

155
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,440
their actual distance in

156
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
three-dimensional space is seven point

157
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,320
three units

158
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
and this is euclidean straight line

159
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,680
distance

160
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
however y hat is what we

161
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,639
believe their distance is is what we

162
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,120
have sort of set their distance to be

163
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
in two-dimensional space so if you were

164
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
to take the actual dots

165
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
on the graph right now if you were if

166
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
you were to calculate their

167
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
uh their distance you would get 5.7 now

168
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,240
here's what we want to do

169
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,400
we want to move all these dots across

170
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,280
this space

171
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,400
such that y hat matches y as much as

172
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,039
possible

173
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,120
meaning where those dots are their

174
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
distances to each other

175
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
match the distances uh between all of

176
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
the three dimensional dots as well

177
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
and we're going to do this with the

178
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
power of gradient descent

179
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
we're going to use an extremely similar

180
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,639
algorithm to what i've already

181
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,360
shown you uh with the with a number

182
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,080
indicator

183
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,360
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

184
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,720
calculate all the different distance

185
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,440
values which

186
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
in this case there are six of them right

187
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
so i'm going to take all six distance

188
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,759
values

189
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,880
and i'm going to find the mean

190
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,479
squared error of the predicted

191
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,919
distance values against what we know the

192
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,600
distance value should be

193
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
all right now what is mean squared error

194
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
i just pulled that uh pull that

195
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
explanation out of nowhere

196
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,000
and what does that mean well if we go

197
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,240
back to our code for just a moment

198
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
you can actually see that over here what

199
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,720
i'm doing

200
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,880
is i'm technically getting an error all

201
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
right which is

202
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the distance between the output that we

203
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
expected and the actual prediction from

204
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,960
the perceptron

205
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
so i'm getting the error and then i'm

206
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
squaring it so we can

207
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,199
call this sort of function here the

208
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,600
squared error function

209
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
however remember though that when we're

210
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
dealing with this more complex

211
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,039
graph environment we don't just have one

212
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:35,520
error

213
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,039
right it's not just we're dealing with

214
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,479
five point seven versus seven point

215
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:38,960
three

216
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
we're dealing with five point seven

217
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
seven point three and three point two

218
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,199
four point nine

219
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,880
and two point eight five point two and

220
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,039
so on and so forth we have six

221
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,280
different error values to deal with six

222
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
different squared errors

223
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,720
so what i'm going to do is to find the

224
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,479
final squared error i'm going to take

225
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,560
all the individual squared errors which

226
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,080
is just you know y hat

227
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,440
minus y squared we can take all of them

228
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,599
and get the average value so the mean

229
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,560
value

230
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,840
uh which is basically just gonna be

231
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
summing up all the square errors and

232
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,199
dividing by six because that's how many

233
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,639
errors there are

234
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,880
then when i do that that sort of adds up

235
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
to be a single function

236
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,240
that i can then sort of find a

237
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,880
derivative through with respect to

238
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,960
the coordinate values that are on screen

239
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
right now and i can

240
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,880
optimize those coordinate values to make

241
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
it so the squared and mean squared error

242
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,479
is lower meaning y hat matches y

243
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,840
better so let's actually take a look at

244
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,680
that in action i'm going to do this

245
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
iteration by iteration

246
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,400
when i go ahead and calculate the

247
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,560
gradient for the first time the movement

248
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,919
looks a little bit like

249
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,960
this so in this case what i did was i

250
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,000
went ahead and found that mean

251
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,039
squared error i found the gradient and i

252
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
found it with respect to all of the

253
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,960
different dots on screen

254
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,080
and i moved those dots uh to reduce

255
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,759
the value of the mean squared error

256
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,840
function again to make it so y hat

257
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,879
matches y

258
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,599
as best as possible as you can see there

259
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,879
are a couple of things that have started

260
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,759
to match up

261
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,240
uh the yellow line for example uh 5 is

262
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,479
pretty close to 5.2

263
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,639
the blue line is pretty much exactly

264
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,039
there it's 4.1 to 4.1

265
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,080
um the green line at the very end is 1.9

266
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
to 1.7

267
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,199
so it's starting to get close but

268
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
there's still a lot of error so for

269
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,440
example red

270
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,879
is 9.5 to 7.3 um and so

271
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,720
there is still a lot of error that means

272
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
we need to run more iterations of

273
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
gradient descent to move the value of

274
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
the function lower and lower

275
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,120
so let's just say we run another

276
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
iteration so we kind of went back

277
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
more closely to what the initial

278
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,719
starting point was

279
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,320
but as you can see we're starting to get

280
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
y hat to be closer to what y

281
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,360
is we move out again and we do more and

282
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,760
more

283
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
iterations until finally gradient the

284
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,519
sense says

285
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,240
that well it's a low enough value now

286
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,880
technically

287
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
gradient descent is never the one saying

288
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
you know we should stop now

289
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
as long as you keep you know querying

290
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
the gradient function it'll keep giving

291
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,680
you a value

292
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
you just want to stop optimizing when

293
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
you believe you know what we're good

294
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
enough now

295
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,519
uh to have a satisfactory answer

296
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
in this case we ended up getting the

297
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
following distances

298
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
um so we got seven point six to seven

299
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,279
point three four point seven four point

300
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,480
nine so as you can see they're all

301
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
pretty close

302
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,880
um there's some that are pretty much

303
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,440
exact so for example a white line 5.1

304
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,200
you know it's pretty much there green

305
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,560
1.8 1.7

306
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,480
pretty much there and then there are

307
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,760
some that are a little bit more off

308
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
things like the yellow line at 4.9 to

309
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
5.2

310
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
and you're probably wondering well why

311
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
are they still so off if we just did

312
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
that whole optimization procedure

313
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,200
and well the answer is pretty simple

314
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
it's because we're trying to

315
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,399
fundamentally represent

316
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,440
more information in a space where we can

317
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
only represent

318
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,839
a lot less information now we can never

319
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,320
really

320
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
or not never i'm going to catch myself

321
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
there it's not never

322
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,040
but there are a lot of cases where

323
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,399
three-dimensional space or the

324
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,839
structures that we create in

325
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,959
three-dimensional space

326
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,440
cannot be perfectly represented in

327
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
two-dimensional space

328
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
and the reason for that is because

329
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
fundamentally we are chopping off a

330
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
whole dimension we are

331
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,440
losing a lot of space in which to in

332
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,680
which to store information

333
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,000
and therefore we can always get close

334
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,519
when we reduce the number of dimensions

335
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,320
in something

336
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
but we can almost never really get

337
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
exactly there now if you were to run

338
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
that optimized

339
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
optimization procedure for you know

340
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
hundreds more iterations

341
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,079
or if you were to use a slightly better

342
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,320
procedure which we'll talk about later

343
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
then you might be able to get this even

344
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,320
closer but generally the dots that

345
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,760
you're seeing on screen right now

346
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
are a good representation of

347
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
that 3d structure in 2d space

348
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,279
so while it might not be perfect it's

349
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,480
really close

350
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,120
and so if you're trying to you know for

351
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,680
example

352
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
take these three-dimensional dots and

353
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,680
you don't have a plotting library that

354
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
can deal with three-dimensional

355
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
graphs and you want to reduce them two

356
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,800
dimensions but still keep the general

357
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,480
theme of the dots

358
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,000
then you know this is this is a good

359
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
solution to to go about doing that

360
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,680
now of course this is um invariant to

361
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,920
where the dots actually are on the grid

362
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,320
um

363
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
you know it really just matters about

364
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,279
the distances between the individual

365
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,120
dots themselves

366
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
and so you don't need to worry about you

367
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,800
know that specific detail

368
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,360
but really what this means is that this

369
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,760
technique that i'm showing you over here

370
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,399
is going to help you reduce the number

371
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,320
of dimensions in your data and we do

372
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
that by using the power of rating

373
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
descent

374
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,399
once again let me make this completely

375
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000
clear if we take a look at the graph for

376
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
a moment once more

377
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,160
the general idea of what we're doing is

378
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,880
we're taking

379
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,200
all of the coordinates we're finding

380
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
their distances

381
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,040
to each other then we're finding the

382
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
distances between all the actual

383
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
coordinates in 3d space

384
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
right so that's y hat and y respectively

385
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,000
y hat being our dots and y being the

386
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
actual dots in 3d space

387
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,880
we are finding the mean squared error

388
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,920
between those two

389
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,560
sets of distances and then we're finding

390
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
the derivative of that whole error

391
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,639
function

392
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,800
with respect to the actual coordinates

393
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,000
in 2d space

394
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and by finding that gradient we can

395
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,839
optimize those coordinates

396
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,519
to put them in places where the

397
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,360
distances match up

398
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,880
best and so that is dimensionality

399
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,800
reduction

400
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,519
and of course though today is all about

401
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,079
code

402
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
so i'm going to show you how you can

403
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
actually implement this technique as

404
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,000
well

405
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,720
using google colab let's take a look

406
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,880
this one is a little bit more code heavy

407
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,160
but it's not that

408
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,880
bad and i'll show you what i mean now to

409
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,480
start off of course we're doing a couple

410
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:42,720
of

411
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,959
pretty standard imports um and so i'm

412
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,800
just importing the matplotlib library so

413
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,240
we can actually plot out

414
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,480
the data that we end up getting i'm

415
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,320
importing tensorflow which is you know

416
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,720
that

417
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
that new library that we're using um and

418
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
i'm also importing a

419
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
framework called sk learn or scikit

420
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,839
learn

421
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,360
uh specifically i'm gonna be using their

422
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,200
data sets module because

423
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,680
using the data sets module i can load in

424
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
a data set known as the iris data set

425
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
the iris data set is incredibly popular

426
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,120
um it's a data set that contains 150

427
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,320
attributes uh or not 150 attributes um

428
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,839
150 instances of flowers

429
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,560
and each instance contains four

430
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,360
measurements

431
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,680
of the flowers themselves right so

432
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,040
things like the petal

433
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
um things like petal length and and

434
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,720
width uh same thing for the

435
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,079
uh sepal and what the what the data set

436
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,680
it really aims to do

437
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,399
is it aims to sort of provide

438
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,480
researchers with this data set

439
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,959
um where they can build algorithms that

440
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,000
take those four

441
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,959
attributes and try to predict is this

442
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,000
flower

443
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
or or which one of the three species

444
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,000
does this flower come from right so

445
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,040
each individual sample represents

446
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
one species of a flower there are three

447
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
different species in the data set 50

448
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,160
samples for each 150 samples total

449
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,639
uh and so basically the idea is can we

450
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,160
build some kind of machine learning

451
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,720
model

452
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
to take those four attributes in and

453
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,079
spit out a prediction of

454
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,480
which species the flowers the flower in

455
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,120
this case

456
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,399
belongs to now it's a little bit more

457
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
difficult than you might initially think

458
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,839
um because it's very easy to tell one of

459
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,680
the species against two of the others

460
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,279
but then those other two species are

461
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,040
really difficult to

462
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,279
tell between each other and i'll be

463
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,760
showing you what i mean by that today

464
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
and then in the next episode we'll take

465
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
a look at how we can fix that issue

466
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
but for now let's actually take a look

467
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,120
at working with the iris data set

468
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
now the first thing that i go ahead and

469
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,079
do uh is i go ahead and load in what's

470
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,680
known as the iris dataset so we've

471
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,279
already talked about what iris is

472
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,680
and i load that into a variable called

473
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,639
iris

474
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,519
um then what i do is i take the data

475
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,120
element of the iris dataset so the

476
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,399
actual like you know

477
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,839
150 instances of four features each

478
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,240
and load them into a variable called x

479
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,079
and i convert that to a list

480
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
um now we're doing something called a

481
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
target as well but don't worry about

482
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,800
that just yet

483
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,839
we'll come back to that code eventually

484
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,760
for now all you need to care about is x

485
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,079
now just to sort of give you an idea of

486
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,199
what the state is like

487
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,600
the shape of the x array is currently

488
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,880
154

489
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,240
that means that we have 150 arrays

490
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,120
where each array is another or is

491
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
actually another array

492
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,680
of four values each um and so

493
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,720
again 150 instances of different flowers

494
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,759
and for each instance there are

495
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,120
four different four different attributes

496
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
now here's the thing about this data set

497
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,800
it's really pushing

498
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,279
us as humans to the limits of what we

499
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,040
can physically perceive

500
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
as i mentioned we live in three spatial

501
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,639
dimensions not four

502
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,639
and so we can never really just plot out

503
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,399
this iris data set because it doesn't

504
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,839
make sense to

505
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,519
um instead what we have to do is we have

506
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,600
to run the same dimensionality reduction

507
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
technique that i talked about in order

508
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,959
to reduce those dimensions down to two

509
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,680
or three

510
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
but in this case we're doing two and the

511
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,600
way i do that is i start off by defining

512
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
something called a batching function

513
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,199
what i do in the batching function is

514
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,759
pretty simple i create three new lists a

515
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,000
b

516
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
and c then what i do is 64

517
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,839
times i actually choose two completely

518
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,199
random elements

519
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,800
from the actual data sets of two

520
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,360
different flowers at complete random

521
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,399
then i take the first flower put it in a

522
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,199
i take the second flower i put it in b

523
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,160
and then i take the

524
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,399
euclidean distance between the two

525
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,480
flowers and put it in c

526
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,279
and so this euclidean distance is found

527
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,120
by getting the square root

528
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,880
of the sum of the squared differences

529
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
in the actual coordinate values so each

530
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,839
coordinate value you get the difference

531
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,680
you square those differences you get the

532
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,959
sum of those whole differences and get

533
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,639
the square root of that sum

534
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,160
and then you've got straight line

535
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
distance then what i do

536
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,079
is i go ahead and take each one of those

537
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
arrays a b and c

538
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,400
convert them all to tensorflow tensors

539
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,480
and then return those three values from

540
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
the batch function

541
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
then what i do is i create something

542
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,559
called a weight now this weight

543
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,439
is just a tensor filled with random

544
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,319
values

545
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,360
the shape of this tensor is four comma

546
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,720
two now why exactly do we have this well

547
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,919
it's because we're going to be running

548
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,720
what's known as a matrix multiplication

549
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
of the actual input iris data set

550
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
against this weight in order to get the

551
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,720
dimension reduced

552
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,360
output uh in order to get the um the

553
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,799
versions of those coordinates in

554
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,160
two-dimensional space instead of

555
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
four-dimensional space

556
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,799
so the input it's four the output is two

557
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,640
that's a very simplified representation

558
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,919
of a weight um

559
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,240
and so in case you do not know how

560
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
matrix multiplication works there will

561
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
be a website linked in the description

562
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,000
below

563
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,039
describing um through an animation

564
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,080
how exactly matrix multiplication works

565
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
but for now all you need to know is that

566
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
weight is what we multiply the iris

567
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,520
flower by

568
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
in order to get its two-dimensional

569
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,960
representation

570
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,120
and if we get a better version of this

571
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
weight then we get a better

572
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,480
two-dimensional representation of the

573
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,240
four-dimensional input

574
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,840
then what i do is actually pretty

575
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
similar to the number negator

576
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,840
watch what i do is i go ahead and take

577
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,400
the two

578
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
inputs which would be you know first set

579
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,360
of coordinates and second set of

580
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,080
coordinates

581
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
as well as the distances between them

582
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
from the batch function

583
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,200
earlier then i create a gradient tape

584
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
and i tell the tape to watch

585
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,000
the weight then what i do is i go ahead

586
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,840
and run the matrix multiplication of the

587
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,039
first set of coordinates against the

588
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,440
weight

589
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
and the second set of coordinates

590
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
against the weight then what i do

591
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,280
is i use tensorflow functions in order

592
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
to find the euclidean distances

593
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,320
of all of those different um of all

594
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,120
those different

595
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,320
um individual coordinate pairs and again

596
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
i do this by getting the difference

597
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,039
i do it by squaring it then getting the

598
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,320
sum and then finally by square rooting

599
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
all right now the reason i found in a

600
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
one here was in order to get the sum

601
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,679
along the axis of the actual coordinates

602
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,679
and not just the sum of the whole array

603
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,200
including you know across the different

604
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,960
coordinate pairs

605
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,280
uh now then what i do is i go ahead and

606
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,080
take the

607
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,919
distance that we calculated and of

608
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,360
course the actual distance that we

609
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
expected from the batch

610
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,039
i go ahead and get the difference square

611
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,880
it and get the mean so this is the

612
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
mean squared error

613
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,919
like so all right then i find the

614
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,679
gradient of that loss with respect to

615
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,400
the weight

616
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
i modify the weight just so that it you

617
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
know moves in the better direction

618
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
so that we can actually map that

619
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
four-dimensional coordinate to a

620
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,480
two-dimensional coordinate

621
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,960
better and then i print out the loss

622
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,840
just so i know

623
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,320
how well my little uh little weight is

624
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,039
doing

625
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,559
now i'm going to go ahead and actually

626
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,000
run this code for you so let's just say

627
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,400
i

628
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
go ahead and run this code from the very

629
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,520
beginning it's going to go ahead and

630
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,720
connect to a brand new collab

631
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
environment

632
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,559
i'm going to go ahead and initialize my

633
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,080
weight run this

634
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,440
and as you can see slowly but surely our

635
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
loss value continues to decrease if i

636
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,679
scroll all the way up in the output here

637
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,760
you can see the loss actually starts off

638
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,440
at a pretty high value it starts off you

639
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,080
know in the

640
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
0.8 and the ones but then slowly the

641
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
loss value gets lower and lower and

642
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,600
lower

643
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
meaning the weight is better and better

644
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,720
meaning

645
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,640
the individual distances between points

646
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,919
in two-dimensional space

647
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,760
is closer to the distances between the

648
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
points in four-dimensional space

649
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,559
and guess what what i can do is actually

650
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:36,960
run

651
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,760
a little bit of matplotlib code and i

652
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,400
can actually

653
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,120
plot out that two-dimensional data that

654
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,919
we just

655
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
created with the help of matplotlib

656
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,679
all i've got to do is take all of the

657
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,919
input data convert it to a tensorflow

658
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:52,720
tensor

659
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
and then multiply or do a matrix

660
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,039
multiplication of the all that input

661
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,720
data against the weight to convert it

662
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,559
from four dimensions to two

663
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
and then i convert that to a numpy array

664
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
use a little bit of logic to actually go

665
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,840
ahead and have

666
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,799
matplotlib plot out in a scatter plot

667
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,000
those two dimensions

668
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,960
and then show the plot now what i also

669
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
did is i made it set for every dot that

670
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,159
represents

671
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,880
species one two or three i would have it

672
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,679
put that dot

673
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,400
in red green or blue color respectively

674
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,919
and you can actually see through this

675
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,280
plot that as you can see

676
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,679
the red one is very easy to distinguish

677
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,320
between the other two it's very far away

678
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,799
um but then you've got green and blue

679
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,520
that sort of

680
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,120
touch each other there's certain points

681
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
that are in this ambiguous area where

682
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
you don't really know if they're green

683
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,679
or if they're blue

684
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,840
um and that's a bit of an issue for

685
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
neural networks to deal with but we'll

686
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,640
be fixing it

687
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
in the next episode of learn deep

688
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,679
learning from scratch

689
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,760
now i know that this was a lot to digest

690
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,799
all of the code will be in the

691
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,000
description and of course if there are

692
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
any questions please do feel free to ask

693
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,400
me

694
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,039
and i may go ahead and also clarify

695
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,480
these examples a little bit more go into

696
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
a little bit more detail in the

697
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,000
beginning

698
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,720
of the next video as well but overall

699
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
though i do hope you enjoyed thank you

700
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
very much for joining in today

701
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
uh once again if you do enjoy this kind

702
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,799

and also make sure to like the video if

706
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
you did enjoy it once again would love
