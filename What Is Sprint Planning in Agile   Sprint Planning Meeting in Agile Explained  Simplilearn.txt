Sprint planning
Sprint planning in agile is a meeting
where a team of individuals decide what
work they will focus on during the
upcoming time frame called a Sprint the
team discusses the tasks they can
realistically complete within the
Sprint's duration usually two or four
weeks

and past performance to create a clear
plan for achieving their goals it helps
the team stay organized and on track to

this print but why is Sprint planning so
crucial

together to define the Sprint cool this

in the same direction with the laser
focus the team can deliver meaningful
results every step of the way the second
is prioritization agile teams have a
never-ending list of tasks in the
product backlog Sprint planning is where
they cherry pick the most valuable ones

considers their capacity the amount of
work they can realistically handle in
the Sprint this ensures they don't

let's briefly walk through the typical
Sprint planning process the first step
is pre-planning during pre-planning the
product owner prioritizes the items in
the product backlog they also ensures
that the user stores or tasks are well
defined and contain enough information
for the team to work on the second step
is Sprint planning meeting next comes
the actual Sprint plan meeting it's time
boxed usually lasting one to two hours
per week of this print in this meeting
the product owners presents the
prioritized items and the team discusses
them seeking clarification where needed
the third step is estimation and
commitment once the team understands the
requirements they estimate how much work
they can complete based on their
velocity this process helps them commit
to a realistic amount of work they can
achieve during the Sprint the last step
is breaking down tasks with the
commitments in place the team further
breaks down the user stories or tasks
into smaller actionable tasks this makes
it easier to track progress during the
Sprint
before we wrap up let's share some best
practices and tips for successful Sprint
planning tip one is regular meetings

consistently at the beginning of each
Sprint this ensures a predictable
schedule and keeps the team on track the
