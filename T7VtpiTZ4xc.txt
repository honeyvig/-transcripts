[Music]

2
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,000
so hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,720
tutorial my name is Tammy bakshi and

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
this time we're going to be going over

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
how you can use IBM iot IBM Watson

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,880
conversation and node red to control a

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,599
drone more specifically the parrot AR

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,720
drone

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,760
2.0 all right let's begin so now

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,120
essentially uh what I've developed is a

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,760
phone interface so you can uh text

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,440
message a twillo phone number uh with

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,440
your command for example take off land

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,199
or even like what's the battery

15
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,399
percentage for example uh and it will be

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,440
able to reply to you using no red Watson

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,120
conversation IBM iot and all the other

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,079
really fun stuff uh now what I'd like to

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,000
say first of all uh is actually quick

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,760
quick fun fact I named the Drone tandro

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,799
tan maze drone so yeah uh now also

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,119
really quickly uh this is in fact the

23
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
world's first to the extent of my

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,400
research at least drone to be powered by

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
IBM iot IBM Watson conversation and of

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,799
course no dread all right let's begin

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,320
shall we so essentially as I said we

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,920
have a phone here uh that's able to send

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,439
commands uh so we have a

30
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,200
phone uh and our our eventual goal is to

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,320
have a drone here sorry we have a drone

32
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,240
here uh and so essentially our eventual

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,840
goal is to be able to communicate

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,920
between the phone and the Drone all

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,240
right uh but we can't do that directly

36
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,799
that's impossible or at least almost

37
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
impossible unless you install the AR

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,799
free flight app and that other stuff but

39
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,240
that's too simple let's create let's say

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,960
we wanted to create our own little AP

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,560
die for this so how would we do that so

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,079
now let me show you uh so now

43
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,320
essentially what we do is we have a node

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,239
red here so we have

45
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,239
node

46
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,400
red all right this is one of our little

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,840
building blocks here we also have

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,120
twilio because I mean a phone's best

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,879
friend in the terms of API uh is twio uh

50
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,879
and of course we have Watson

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,360
and of course uh there's IBM

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
iot

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,760
sorry so we have IBM iot along with this

54
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,159
uh so now we have a few uh quite a few

55
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,920
building blocks here but now the

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,319
question is how do we connect these

57
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,239
building blocks to work together to

58
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,720
create what we eventually need now

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,680
essentially first of all what I did is I

60
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,280
set up the connection between the Drone

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
uh and IBM iot that's one of the most

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,680
essential Parts which is to ensure that

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,760
the Drone can commun communicate with

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,920
IBM iot on Blu miix uh so that we can

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,879
actually transfer data uh now uh that

66
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,879
that being said this is technically

67
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,159
through uh node.js uh so in between here

68
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,640
I guess you could say there is some

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,519
nodejs code

70
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,159
no JS code here uh which is essentially

71
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,920
allowing this communication between the

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,480
Drone and IBM

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,159
iot all right so now of course uh we

74
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,560
also have the phone okay so once this uh

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,879
connection is established uh essentially

76
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,360
we have the phone that connects to twio

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
so now essentially we've sent a text

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,360
message to twilio uh and so from twio

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,720
this will actually go to nothing other

80
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,400
than node red now once this goes to node

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,360
red node red can now hand

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,040
everything uh and then send us back uh a

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
text message so to begin we have Watson

84
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,959
Watson conversation uh and so

85
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,760
essentially node red sends the message

86
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,879
to Watson so now this is the first step

87
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,360
this is the second step this is the

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,239
third

89
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,320
one sorry this is the third step so now

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,720
uh essentially what's happening is no

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,759
Dre has sent this to Waton conversation

92
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
and Watson now understands the intent

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
behind what you wanted to say for

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,759
example if you asked it how much

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,720
batteries left in my drone it knows that

96
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,560
your intent is to find out the battery

97
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,680
remaining in the Drone if you asked it

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,120
to fire up the engines it knows that you

99
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,360
want to take off and if you asked it to

100
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,680
land it knows that you want to land your

101
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,440
drone so now once Watson knows this

102
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,960
intent it's going to return uh a

103
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,360
response to no dread now in this case

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
now just before I continue if you

105
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,240
haven't already please do check out my

106
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,880
Watson conversation YouTube video uh

107
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,400
that essentially teaches you how you can

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,840
use Watson conversation in depth

109
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
continuing though by the way link will

110
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,800
be in the description all right so now

111
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,720
essentially uh I the Watson conversation

112
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
service will give us a response but in

113
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,320
this case I programmed it to not give me

114
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,039
a simple response but an advanced

115
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,039
response and this Advanced response will

116
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,960
give me two responses instead of just

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,840
one now why would we need two responses

118
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,520
well let's say that this node.js code

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,199
hasn't executed or the Drone we weren't

120
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,240
able to get uh any battery percentages

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,880
from the Drone or the Drone has been

122
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,880
disconnected any one of those issues in

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,280
that case we don't know how much battery

124
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,800
there is in the Drone so what do we do

125
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,880
well Watson returns two as I said uh

126
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,520
texts uh and so the first one assumes

127
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,039
that yes we do have a battery percentage

128
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,280
value and the second one assumes that no

129
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,440
we do not have a battery percentage

130
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,039
value then what node red is going to do

131
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,000
is it's going to check its Global

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,759
variable or its Global context and check

133
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,960
whether or not uh that the that the

134
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,479
Watson conversation uh or the sorry the

135
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,280
battery percentage currently exists

136
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,000
inside of its Global context meaning did

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,240
the Drone actually send us a battery

138
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,880
percentage uh and if it did what it's

139
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,080
going to do is it's going to choose the

140
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,479
first one the battery percentage uh the

141
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,840
battery percentage uh uh of course um

142
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,800
message because of course if we do have

143
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,319
it available we want to send it to the

144
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,840
user and if it's not available then

145
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,000
we'll say sorry the Drone has not yet

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,919
provided me with this information all

147
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,319
right so now uh now once Watson has

148
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,759
given the result back to node red node

149
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,720
red will send a uh message back down

150
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,000
here to twio this is of course the

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,720
fourth step uh and then twio will most

152
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,160
certainly send it back to your phone

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,759
which is the fifth

154
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,759
step but then how do we control the

155
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,680
Drone well pretty simply uh once node

156
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,080
red knows the tent uh whether it is to

157
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,479
take off or to land it will send that

158
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,080
tent uh to technically not the Drone uh

159
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,199
well essentially what's going to happen

160
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,199
uh is it's going to send this

161
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,240
um request I guess you could say uh to

162
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,840
well IBM iot so it's going to send it

163
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,720
down here to IBM iot which is the sixth

164
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,280
step uh and then IBM iot will you know

165
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,560
send it up through nodejs code to the

166
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,599
Drone and the Drone will you know reply

167
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,840
back with what it's currently doing uh

168
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,160
and once we have this entire thing

169
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
working here uh it becomes a really neat

170
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
system which allows me to control a

171
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,720
drone using my phone all right so now

172
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,520
let's actually message Tandra and see uh

173
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,280
what we can achieve here uh so now as

174
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,440
you can see I have my phone uh and I'm

175
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,800
writing a text message to Chandra all

176
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,720
right now as you can see what I'm going

177
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,479
to say is I'm going to say something

178
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,599
like hey

179
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,080
how much battery is left in my drone

180
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
question

181
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
mark all right now if I send this quite

182
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,639
simply it

183
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,879
says the battery percentage of your

184
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,800
drone is currently

185
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,000
63% pretty nice uh should be good enough

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,759
for a take off maybe a little flight uh

187
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,479
and so what we can do is I can say fire

188
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,039
up the engines exclamation

189
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,479
mark all right so now uh let's actually

190
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,199
look at the Drone for a sec uh now I'm

191
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,640
going to send the message and look at

192
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,760
the

193
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,240
Drone all right it has now taken off and

194
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,719
as you can see the Drone is taken off

195
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,560
and now uh we can let it fly but let's

196
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,920
say we want it to land right all I need

197
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,959
to

198
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,240
say land the Drone all right I'm going

199
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
to send this text message and now watch

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,800
the

201
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,120
Drone as you can see the Drone has

202
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,920
landed and as I said fire up the engines

203
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,279
it said all right up we go which is one

204
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,959
of the options that I gave Watson

205
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,480
conversation and once I said land the

206
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,959
Drone it said all right Landing the

207
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,079
Drone the battery percentage is now

208
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:18,279
57% and that was how you can control a

209
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,120
drone if actually you know what uh let's

210
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
just do a second or you know what never

211
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,279
mind let's uh not do that but that was

212
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,360
how you can control a parrot AR drone to

213
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,640
2.0 with of course Watson conversation

214
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,480
and IMM iot and just before I end off

215
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,519
today I'd like to say that last night I

216
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,519
was with Marcus van kempen in the IBM uh

217
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,279
BL office in downtown Toronto you know

218
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,079
we were throwing around some ideas U

219
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,320
mixing up some ideas uh and we got the

220
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,399
idea uh and of course uh I was able to

221
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,360
develop uh using node red and iBot this

222
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,880
project uh and of course I actually do

223
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,240
have a lot more stuff coming up with him

224
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,000
uh in fact yesterday we didn't have

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,560
enough time to record uh but I do have

226
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
some more features that I will be adding

227
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,399
in with him uh and then of course we

228
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,360
will create a collaboration video but I

229
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,200
want to keep the features a surprise for

230
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,959
now but that's going to be it for this

231
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,200
tutorial and just before I end off I'd

232
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,880
like to say that in case you don't know

233
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,600
who Marcus van kmit is well essentially

234
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,560
he's my mentor from IBM uh and of course

235
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,240
I do lots of collaborations with him in

236
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,240
fact uh one of my earlier iot videos uh

237
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,000
my iot part 2 uh for beginners uh which

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,320
will be in the description uh was a

239
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,720
collaboration with Marcus uh and so yeah

240
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,839
