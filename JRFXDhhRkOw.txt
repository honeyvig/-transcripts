00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,120
hello there and um welcome to part two

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
of my videos for

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,840
probability um this time I'm going to be

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,799
covering uh an eqo question mainly for

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,760
the grade sixes this is from the EQ 2013

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,119
book for math grade

7
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,880
sixes and so the question consider the

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,920
two spinners below spinner A is divided

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,640
into 10 equal sections spinner B is

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,640
divided into five equal

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,800
sections which colors of the same

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,960
probability of being spun on spinner A

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,160
as they do on spinner B justify your

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,879
answers now we see that the question

15
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:51,760
gives us the ratio 10 to 5 for A to

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,719
B let's simplify that and make it two to

17
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,800
one and also just to um make it one more

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,960
four to

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,560
two so now let's make a little chart

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,320
here one

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,600
line one

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,280
line

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,920
so number one what we want to do is we

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,119
want

25
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,840
to split this up a to

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,720
B so

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,720
yellow green

28
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,079
red um

29
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,000
blue

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,240
p i mean

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,000
pink and yeah so let's

32
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,880
just make little sections for them

33
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,840
all okay so

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,799
you know what let's make this the green

35
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,360
section so it's a little

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,920
bigger um now for yellow A to B um let's

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,200
go back to the question there are two

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,840
yellows in spinner A to the one yellow

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,519
in spinner

40
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,040
B so go back and we have a two to

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,680
one that is a good

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
ratio let's go to

43
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,159
Red Now red has

44
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,800
four Reds in spinner A and two in

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,760
spinner B let's go back to our writing

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
board and write down that ratio 4 to two

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,599
that is also a good um uh uh

48
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,760
probability so now let's do blue

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,080
so there's one blue in spinner A and

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,879
there's uh one blue in spinner B let's

51
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,400
go back here and one to one does not

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,120
seem very good so it's a bad ratio won't

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
be

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,959
accepted what about pink one to one

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,760
again one to one so this will not be

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,280
going in the list of save probability

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,120
for um spinner A and Spinner

58
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,680
B now let's do green okay two and a

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
that's a good sign till now but B

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,000
there's absolutely no green let's go

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,439
back and write two to zero so this won't

62
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,840
be going in and finally I come with the

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,280
conclusion

64
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,879
that

65
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,720
yellow and red

66
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,640
follow the ratio A to B

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,480
SL 2 to

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,120
one so why uh yellow and red have the

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,759
same probability from spinner

70
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,639
A and Spinner

71
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,720
B thank you and goodbye
