Friday scenario an efficient Incident

to Incident Management process imagine
you are working on a crucial project for
your company's biggest client you have
got a presentation in an hour and
suddenly your laptop screen goes black
well this is where Incident Management
comes to the rescue let's see how
incident login you can quickly grab your
phone and log this incident through your
company's it portal you type laptop
screen went blank presentation in an
hour along with your name and the time
it happened this is the first critical
step every detail matters because it
helps the IT team understand the urgency
and
impact categorization your incident
lands in the IT service desk queue the
technician reads your report and
categorizes it under hardware and
subcategory display issues why is this
important well if 10 more people report
similar issues next week the it team can
quickly spot this trend and investigate
if there's a widespread Hardware
problem
prioritization now the technician has to
decide how urgent your issue is here or
she sees that you have got a big
presentation that's urgent for you but
they also know that the sales team crn
system is down affecting 50 people so
they Mark your laptop as priority three
it's urgent but not impacting the whole
business like the CRM system which is
Priority One initial diagnosis and
escalation
the IT team remotely accesses your
laptop and tries a few quick fixes
restarting and checking display settings
no luck they can't fix it remotely so
they log all required findings and
escalate it to the hardware
investigation and diagnosis now the
other member from Hardware takes over he
reviews the notes and dicks deeper after
some tests he finds that it's not a
hardware failure it's a driver issue
your graphics driver crashed after
recent update resolution and Recovery
after rolling back the driver to a
stable version and testing it your
screen is back the technician then
carefully updates the newest stable
driver this duration is called the
recovery time now closure with your
laptop fixed the IT team calls you to
confirm whether everything's working
perfectly or not just in time for your
presentation and then closes the
incident in their system marking it as
resolved see how each step played a
crucial role from your detail logging to
a thorough diagnosis to the final
confirmation each stage ensured that
