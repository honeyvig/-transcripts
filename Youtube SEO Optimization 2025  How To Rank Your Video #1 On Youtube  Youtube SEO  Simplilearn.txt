engagement effective YouTube SE is all
about crafting strategic audience Focus
content that keeps viewers coming back
for more so let's dive into our first
super important method which is on how
you can rank your video on YouTube using
keyword research technique keyword
research is essential for making your
content discoverable on YouTube keywords
help the algorithm understand what your
video is about and ensure it reaches the
Right audience to get the most out of
your keyword strategy you can use tools
like YouTube's auto complete Google
Trends and Google Keyword Planner let me
show you how you can use all of these
tools so first we will start by
generating ideas using YouTube's
autocomplete feature let me show you how
you can just simply search in the search
bar any keywords uh like suppose I'll
search uh artificial intelligence so as
you can see these are the YouTube
suggestions it's giving so these topics
are basically based on what people are
actively searching for giving you real
time insights into the trending topics
you can type any keyword you want to and
you can take suggestions from here and
search it because these will give you
the top videos I mean what the users are
usually searching for at this moment
next we will talk about Google Trends so
just simply search in the Google um
search bar Google Trends and just click
here now why did we select Google Trends
because Google Trends helps us to
validate the popularity of the keywords
Google Trend shows us how often a term
is searched over time allowing you to
identify seasonal Trends on growing
topics for example you can just um
simply click on the explore option from
here and um so these are the topics it's
showing right now which are trending and
it's also showing the interest by the
sub region okay so what are the popular
topics uh trending at this moment for
example we'll just select Here YouTube
search as we want our YouTube search
results and then we will select 30
minute
workout and just click enter so as you
can see it's giving us the statistics
and the data of the interest over time
on all the dates so this was on October
14 and this was for at 8:18 p.m. okay so
I've selected here the past that's why
it's showing this you can also select
for the past 90 days or the past 12
months also it will give you the graph
something like this and okay so these
are the related topics and the related
queries as you can see from here so yeah
you can just simply search your keyword
here and just look at the popular
keywords and what people are actually
searching on the YouTube now we also
have a second feature which is the
compare option now if you want to
compare any keyword with this keyword
for example uh
lose weight suppose I want to search and
just simply click on enter so as you can
see it will give you the comparison of
the past 12 months between these two
keywords on YouTube okay and from here
you can just look at the data and also
the interest for example in Goa people
are searching for 30 minutes workout
routine I mean not 30 minutes workout
routine they're searching more for
losing weight so as as you can see we
have the keyword for lose weight more
okay and also we can look into the
popular topics and the trending topics
for this how to lose weight as a
teenager so if you want to create videos
you can use keywords from here it's
really helpful next on the list is the
Google Keyword Planner so just simply
search
Google Keyword Planner from here and
click enter you can sign in with your
Google account and uh I'm just directly
visiting on the Keyword Planner so we're
using Google Keyword Planner because
this is a free tool which can help you
search all the trending keywords that
people are searching on the Google it
basically provides data to access
competition and it also gives us monthly
search volume it shows how often people
search for your keywords and how
competitive they are so from here you
can just simply click on either discover
new keywords or get search volumes and
forus so I'll be going on discovering
new keywords and just select suppose I'm
selecting generative AI select enter you
can uh list up to three to four or 10
keywords to get results based on your
keyword okay the next keyword can be
something uh J
ai
ai artificial
intelligence machine
learning okay so I've have searched for
the keywords over here and I'll just
simply click on get results you'll see a
list of keywords related to what you
have entered now it will give you the
monthly average searches as well so as
we can see that generative V has got
monthly average searches for 10K to
100K AI artificial intelligence machine
learning you have the keyword ideas also
AI chatboard mid Journey mid Journey AI
so you can just see from here you can
also edit your list with filters and
categories to help you find those that
make the most sense for your SEO
strategy now Google Keyword Planner is a
helpful tool for SEO research but no
single option is going to be all the end
for Content planning you want to
supplement your efforts with other
research tool that capture additional
data so now that we have discussed how
to use uh Google Keyword Planner also we
have discussed how to use Google Trends
and then talking about the auto complete
feature from YouTube by combining all
these tools together you can build a
solid keyword strategy to enhance your
video so next let's talk about how to
optimize video titles and tags for
YouTube SEO your video title and tags
are the first thing YouTube's algorithm
and viewers see making them crucial for
Success a well optimized title attracts
clicks and signals to YouTube and what
your video is about while tags help
categorize your content better so as you
can see this is the title of of the
video we have put and if you want to
check out the tags the tags are
mentioned at the last of the description
here these are the tags we have used I'm
just showing you an example on how we
edit the description and how to insert
the YouTube title and the tags so if you
want to craft your title you should aim
for clarity engagement and keyword
richness you should Place primary
keywords early to boost searchability
for example if you're searching for a
generic title for example you're
searching for making tips for perfect

titles people are using here beaking
tips for beginners beaking tips tricks
and tips and tricks tips to make a
perfect cap so these are how people are
using their uh titles and you know
optimizing it so that the video is
ranking above now let's talk about
increasing click-through rates your
click-through rates CTR is a key metric
for YouTube SEO a high CTR means more
viewers are clicking on your video in
search results or recommendations
signaling to YouTube that your content
is relevant and interesting so what
should you do in order to boost your CTR
well you have to create an engaging
thumbnail that are eye-catching with
bright colors clear images and minimal
bold text so as you can see if you want
to search any topic for example if I'm
searching for

searching for AI
generated art so let's see the top
ranking videos okay so as you can see
these are the top ranking videos and how
they have you know optimized their uh
YouTube title and what thumbnails they
are using so that the video is ranking
here so you can just compare the
thumbnails from here and what type of
titles they using it so with this you
will understand how your video title
also plays a crucial role how to craft
compelling titles that speak curiosity
and offer clear value that spark

let's talk about leveraging taxs and
metadata for YouTube SEO tags are no

once were they still help YouTube
understand your video's content and
context taxs function like keywords
providing additional information about
the topic covered and aing the algorithm
in categorizing your content which can
increase its chances of appearing in
