oltp stands for online transaction
processing it's a type of database
architecture that is designed to handle
a massive amount of data insertions
updates and delete operations basically
it's a system that can process hundreds
or thousands of transactions per second
which makes it ideal for applications
that need to process a high volume of
transactions such as banking e-commerce
and mobile apps sounds impressive right
you might be surprised to learn that
oltp is used in ATMs financial
transaction systems online bookings
ticketing and over a dozen major
applications so if you want to make
yourself familiar with oltp systems and
learn more about this amazing technology
stay tuned with us until the end of this
session if you're an aspiring data
analyst looking for online training and
certifications from prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts then search no more
simply lens postgraduate program and
data analyst from Purdue University in
collaboration with IBM should be your
right choice for more details use the
link mentioned in the description box
below with that in mind go to our
training experts hey everyone on let's
get started first we shall discuss the
agenda for today's session first we will
understand what exactly is oltp followed
by that we will understand the
characteristics of ovaltp then moving
ahead we will learn what are the types
of queries that an old TP platform can
actually process then we will dive into
the architecture of ovaltp and lastly we
will understand the advantages of using
an oltp platform I hope I made myself
clear with the agenda now proceeding
ahead the first one is what is an old TP
platform the answer for this question is
oltp stands for online transaction
processing it is a type of computing
that involves managing and processing
many transactions in real time over the
Internet or a network
oltp systems are designed to handle a
day-to-day business operations where
numerous concurrent users can access and
modify data simultaneously now that we
have understood the technical definition
of oltp let's proceed ahead and
understand what are the characteristics
of Google TP platform the main
characteristics of oltp platform include
the following
the first one asset properties
oltp systems must record the entire
transaction correctly a transaction is
usually an execution of a program that
may require the execution of multiple
steps or operations it may be complete
when all the parties acknowledge the
transaction when the product or service
is delivered or a certain number of
updates are made to the specific tables
in a database a transaction is recorded
correctly only if all the steps involved
are executed and recorded if there is
any error in any steps the entire
transaction must be aborted and all the
steps must be deleted from the system
thus oltp systems must comply with
atomic consistent isolated and durable
properties which is also known as asset
properties to ensure the accuracy of the
data in the system now moving ahead the
next characteristic is the concurrency
oltp systems can have enormously large
use of populations with many users
trying to access the same data
simultaneously
system must ensure that all these users
are trying to read or write into the
system can do so concurrently
concurrency controls guarantee that two
users accessing the same data in the
database system simultaneously will not
be able to change the data or that one
user has to wait until the other user
has finished processing before changing
that single piece of data now moving
ahead the next characteristic is scale
oltp systems must be able to scale up
and scale down instantaneously to manage
the transaction volume in real time and
execute transactions concurrently
irrespective of the number of users
trying to access the system moving ahead
the next one is availability
an oltp system must always be available
and ready to accept transactions loss of
a transaction can lead to a loss of
Revenue or may have illegal implications
because transactions are being executed
from anywhere in the world and anytime
the system must be available 24 7. next
is high throughput and short response
time oltp systems require nanosecond or
even shorter response times to keep
Enterprise users productive and meet the
growing expectations of the customers
moving ahead we have reliability oltp
systems typically read and manipulate
highly selective small amounts of data
it is Paramount that at any given time
the data in the database is reliable and
trustworthy for the users and
applications accessing the data
next is security
because these systems store highly
sensitive customer transaction data data
security is critical any breach can be
very costly for the company
and lastly the recoverability oltp
systems must be able to recover in case
of any hardware or software failure now
that we have finished the characteristic
support TV platform now we will
understand the types of queries that an
oltp system can process
so online transaction processing or oltp
systems can perform several types of
queries to handle day-to-day business
operations effectively some of the
common types of queries include insert
queries update queries delete queries
select queries search queries filter
queries join queries aggregate queries
sorting queries group queries
transaction queries and constrained
queries let's understand them in a bit
more detail firstly insert queries
insert queries are used to add new data
records rows or columns to the database
Now update queries modify existing data
records or rows in database to reflect
changes or updates the delete query
removes the records or rows from the
database when they are no longer needed
next is Select queries retrieve specific
data records or rules from the database
on specified criteria fifth one is
search queries they are used to find
specific data elements or patterns
within the database filter query Supply
filters to query results to retrieve
only the relevant data join queries
combine data from multiple tables based
on specific conditions to create more
comprehensive result eighth one is
aggregate queries which perform
calculations on data such as Computing
sums average current or other aggregate
functions sorting queries arrange query
results in a specific order such as
ascending or descending based on a
particular column now the tenth one is
grouping queries which group data based
on specific columns to analyze category
information and transaction queries are
the queries that are related to
initiation management and completion of
transactions ensuring the asset
properties are maintained and lastly the
constrained queries they validate and
enforce various constraints example
unique Keys foreign keys on the data to
ensure data Integrity oltp systems are
primarily designed for handling these
short and straightforward queries in
real time allowing business to process
and manage many concurrent transactions
efficiently now moving ahead we will
understand the architecture of old TPU
platforms
now the following picture represents the
architecture of over AP and oltp
platforms now let's understand them in a
bit more detail business strategy
business strategy deals with the issues
that affect the organization and oltp it
is typically developed at high level
within the firm by board of directors or
the top management
business process oltp business process
is a set of activities and tasks that
once completed will accomplish an
organizational goal next is customers
orders and products oltp database stores
information about products orders that
is transactions customers which are
buyers suppliers who are the sellers and
employees next is the ETL process it
separates the data from various rdbms
Source systems then transforms the data
like applying concatenations
calculations Etc and loads the process
data into the data warehouse system next
is data Mart and data warehouse a data
Mart is a structure or access pattern
specific to a data warehouse environment
data mining analytics and decision
making is the next one data stored in
data Mart and Warehouse can be used for
data mining analytics and decision
making this data helps you discover
patterns analyze raw data and make more
analytical decisions for your
organization's growth now with that
let's proceed to the next section of
today's session that is based on oltp
advantages
there are many advantages of using an
oltp platform we will discuss the top 5
ones so the first one amongst the top 5
advantages for ltp platforms are
real-time data access oltp systems
provide immediate access to up-to-date
data enabling users to make timely and
informed decisions based on the latest
information next is concurrent user
support oltp systems can handle multiple
users simultaneously ensuring smooth
operation during peak times third one is
data Integrity oltp systems maintain
data Integrity by enforcing asset
properties ensuring that transactions
are processed reliably and accurately
next has efficient transaction
processing oltp systems efficiently
processed small frequent transactions
making them ideal for day-to-day
business operations and lastly enhanced
business productivity oltp systems boost
overall business productivity and
responsiveness by streamlining
transactional process and provide adding
quick access to critical data we have
