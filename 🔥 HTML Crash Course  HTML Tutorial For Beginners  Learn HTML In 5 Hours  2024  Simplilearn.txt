now what exactly is the basic web
architecture now web architecture is
made up of three Essential Elements
that's the website that is the front end
of a web application that is visible to
the user then there is the server which
constitutes the back end of a web
application and holds and manages all
the data and finally there's the IP
address that is the address assigned to
a website in order to be accessible on
the internet
first up let's have a look at what
website is so your browser starts by
loading the main HTML file and then the
CSS and JavaScript the user interacts
with the website and is not concerned
with the back end of an application now
secondly we have the server once you've
developed your website you'll have to
host it on your server to make it
accessible on the internet server along
with the database contains all the data
of a website and facilitates user
interaction
ction lastly there's IP address which is
the third element of the web
architecture now website is hosted on an
IP address we put a domain name over
that IP address the same way we put
names over people's phone numbers when
you type a domain name in the browser it
will give you the server call the server
will then send over the website to
you next what is HTML HTML is the most
widely used markup language for
developing and structuring web pages on
the internet it defines the structure of
websites and formats these web
pages so what exactly is CSS then now
CSS is a simple design language used for
making web pages look more beautiful and
presentable it can be attached to any
HTML element to style it or even
position it according to the developer's
choice
then you must be wondering what exactly
is Javascript now JavaScript is a
powerful interpreted language targeted
for web development it is used for
making web pages interactive and
bringing the web pages to life so now
let's create your first
website now HTML short for hypertext
markup language is the coding standard
for documents designed for web browsers
consisting of a series of elements or
tags and which can be used to structure
a web page right so these elements can
include headings paragraphs uh div
containers tables and more HTML tags are
nested meaning there are opening and
closing tags with the content in between
those
tags so now let's write a simple HTML
code that will help you understand the
basics of the language so for this I'm
using the text editor that is Visual
Studio code you can go ahead and
download this text editor from their
official website so so here I've created
a simple HTML file in my vs code and
I've added the initial HTML files now
let me explain to you uh one by one now
Doc type is not so much of a tag but it
is more of an instruction now this
indicates the browser that the document
type to be served to the user is in fact
an HTML document now this doc type
instruction should always be included at
the very top of your HTML page next up
you have the HTML tag that is used to
contain all the web pages HTML code
right so it contains an opening and
closing tag with contents in between
them the HTML tag can also have
attributes now for example there's the
Lang attribute allowing you to specify
the spoken language of the contents of
the page followed by the HTML tag
there's the head tag now this is the
first section of the code that contains
all of the information about the web
Page's properties links and more it
could have PES title description
additional meta tags and CSS code so
here I've used the title tag and let's
give a title say
HTML in 10
minutes all right you can also add CSS
to the Head tag by using the style tag
and change the display styles of HTML
elements that are being used the next
section is the body tag now the body tag
contains all the displayable contents of
your web page including headings
paragraphs div containers tables and
more now the HTML header tags are used
to add headings to a web page there are
several types of headings available for
developers to add to a web page right so
first off let's have a look at them I'm
going to create a simple H1 heading tag
and the message I'm displaying is this
is the first
heading all
right after this I'm going to add a
paragraph tag which creates padding in
the top and bottom of the element to
help separate the text between each
paragraph right so I'm going to add a P
tag and
save this is the paragraph
[Music]
tag after this let me add a simple h2
tag which
is another heading tag and say this is
the second
heading now you can also add line braks
which are helpful from time to time if
you want to provide a single line break
in your content you can do so by adding
the BR tag so here let me just add one
for better understanding now the HTML
div tag defines a division or a section
in an HTML document that is used as a
container for other HTML elements now
these ele Ms can include content areas
sidebars page bars page headers Footers
Etc this tag is used to apply styles to
HTML elements that cannot be added
otherwise we can also make use of the
HTML image tag to add images to a web
page now these images in a web page are
a very common site and they can make the
website look more attractive so for that
we can use the image tag so let's say
IMG within which I mention the source
[Music]
I'm adding the HTML logo so let me just
mention that
here and then I'm going to provide width
for it and then a specific
height all right so when you save the
file and when you look at the
browser you can see that uh the first
heading is displayed then your paragraph
tag is displayed follow by the second
heading and then the image now uh let me
show you how you can add styles for some
of these uh headings and paragraph tags
so here in back in my first heading tag
let me just say
Styles and let me change the font of the
content that is being displayed and I'm
going to change it to Career
new and for my paragraph tag let me
display the content in italics so I'll
say
font style and make it
italics so let me save this and when I
look at the
browser you can see that the font has
changed and so has the font style here
before we go through the different tags
present in HTML let's discuss what a tag
is a tag refers to a special word
wrapped in angular brackets which are
used to define a particular type of
content on a web page after using a tag
in an HTML file the browser decides how
to render or display the content on the
screen the list of tags present in HTML
is pretty huge we'll go through some
basic tags in today's video and we'll go
through the remaining tags while working
with them so let's start with the most
basic tag we have in HTML you can see
here we have a basic program written
over here all the tags mentioned over
here are mandatory for all HTML programs
the first thing we have here is the doc
type as HTML you can see it over here we
we have written doc type HTML so this is
not an HTML tag but an instruction for
the system about the type of document
basically we are telling the system that
this is going to be an HTML document so
that all the browsers can know that this
particular document is an HTML document
and work
accordingly the next tag we have here is
the HTML tag you can see the HTML tag
starts from here and goes till end right
we have ended this HTML tag at the end
of a HTML
document now this tag is necessary for
all HTML documents if you are working on
an HTML document then this tag is what
we are going to need the HTML tag
represents the root and the end of the
whole document this is a container tag
that contains all the other tags within
it so this tag is pretty mandatory in
all HTML document now the next tag we
have here is the head tag you can see
the head tag over here and the ending of
this head tag is present over here we
have certain tags present inside this
particular tag now you can see that this
head tag contains meta tags and the
title tag right you can see the meta tag
over here we have three meta tags and
then we have a title tag as well now the
meta tags doesn't appear on the page
itself but only in the pages Source
schol meta tags are essentially little
content descriptors that help search
engines what a web page is all about now
the next tag we have here is the title
tag the title tag is used to define the
title of a web page basically we write
the name of a web page inside this tag
for example if we see here the title of
a web page is document for now if we
change the title of this HTML document
and write here something
like first document fine now save the
program open it with live server now you
can see it over here that the window
window name is changed to first document
there's no change in the web page itself
so what we are going to do is we are
going to reduce the size of a vs code
and the browser we are going to keep
them side by side here so that any
changes we made in this HTML document
are reflected in the web browser other
tags we can use inside the head tag are
the style tag the script tag and the
link tag now the link tag is used to
link any external CSS file to a HTML
page we have to provide the source of
that file and then any styling changes
we make in that particular file will get
reflected in the web page for that so
let's create a CSS file first what we
are going to do is we are going to
create another file over here let's name
it as style. CSS now this particular
file has CSS as extension this will tell
the browser that this particular file is
a CSS file and we are going to use it
for styling purposes fine so we have
this style. CSS over here now we are
going to link this with our HTML
document for that what we have to do is
we have to write here link so this is
the tag now we have to write here re and
we have to write
here
stylesheet fine now the next thing we
have to do is to provide the source code
of this particular file so for that we
are going to use href href is going to
be style. CSS now close this link tag
now this ra tag over here specify the
relationship between the current
document and the link document now you
can see it over here we have this Rel as
stylesheet this means that this
particular file is a stylesheet and we
are going to use this for styling
purposes another important tag we have
inside the head section is the script
tag this tag is used to declare or use
any script within the HTML document
basically used for JavaScript so it's
not necessary to use this tag within the
head section only we can use it anywhere
but for so now we are going to use it
inside the head tag the syntax is also
easy we have to write it like script SRC
now SRC is going to be the file name so
let's add another file over here we'll
write
first. JS so this will tell the browser
that this particular file is a
Javascript file so we are going to write
here inside this now we are going to
write first dot yes now we have to
define the type as well so type is going
to be text and the file is a Javascript
file
so we'll write here JavaScript fine now
close this tag and the script tag will
closes automatically you can see it over
here fine the script tag is
closed keep one thing in mind that we
have to close the script tag every time
but the link tag is not necessary to
close the next tag we are going to
discuss is the body
tag the body tag defines the document's
body now you can see it over here if we
go back to HTML page you can see the
body tag over here now the body element
contains all the content of an HTML
document such as headings paragraphs
images hyperlinks tables lists Etc there
can only be one body element in an HTML
document any tag we are going to use
within the body tag is going to define
the structure of a web page now the next
tag we are going to use is the heading
tag there are six different types of
heading tags starting from H1 and goes
to H6 H1 refers to the most important
heading and H6 refers to the least
important the font size of H1 is the
largest and the font size of H6 is the
smallest among all so let's use them all
here what we'll do is we'll write here
H1 now inside this H1 we'll write this
is heading one save the program and you
can see it over here we have a heading
in our web page which says this is
heading one similarly we have the H2 TP
as well so if we write here H2 and
inside this if we write this is heading
two save the program you can see the
change in the font size you can see the
difference over here the font for H1 is
greater and the font for H2 is a bit
smaller than H1 similarly we have
H3 and for H3 we are going to write here
this
is heading c three fine then we have H4
as well so we are going to write here h
4 and inside this we are going to write
this is
heading 4 fine similarly we have H5 and
H6 as well so we are going to mention
them first here so we'll write here this
is heading five and finally we have
H6 which is used for heading six so we
are going to write here this is
heading six fine save the program and
you can can see the difference in all
the headings over here the size for H1
is the largest and the size for heading
six is the smallest we can use any of
these headings according to
alls similarly we have the paragraph tag
as well in HTML it is used to write a
paragraph or any content within the web
page the syntax is simple we have to use
the ptag for that so if we write here p
and now inside this paragraph tag
whatever thing we'll write so let's say
we are writing here this is a first
HTML document fine now save this program
and you can see it over here we have
some text present in the web browser
right so these are the most basic HTML
tags we discussed in today's video as we
said the list of tags is large and we'll
discuss them while working with them a
simple definition of tags states that a
tag refers to a special word wrapped in
angular brackets which are used to
define a particular type of content on a
web page after using a tag in an HTML
file the browser decides how to render
or display the content on the screen
right now keeping this definition in
mind the definition of an element in
HTML states that an HTML element is the
collection of a start Tech its
attributes an end teag and everything in
between the T tags right so an HTML
element is basically a collection let's
understand this with the help of an
example what we'll do is we'll write
over here inside the body of this HTML
document we'll
write B fine now this paragraph tag over
here is an example of a tag it has
opening tag and a closing tag so this
whole thing is a tag this paragraph is a
tag over
here now if you we add an attribute to
this tag like an ID or a class so what
we'll do for that we'll write here let's
say ID is equals
to par one fine this tag now has an
attribute within it ID makes this whole
tag unique we can access the content of
this tag with the help of ID attribute
we'll discuss attributes in detail in
the upcoming video for now let's add
some content inside this tab so what
we'll do is we'll write inside this St
we'll write over here let's
say this is
a paragraph fine so we'll write here
paragraph So This is the content of a
paragraph tag now we have four different
parts present over here we have the
starting tag over here so this is the
starting tag this whole thing over here
is the starting tag then we have
attribute so ID here is the attribute
then we have content of this tag so this
is the content present inside whole tag
and then we have the end part of a
paragraph Tex so this represents the end
part right so the combination of these
four things is known as the HTML
element now let's talk about the case
sensitivity of HTML tags so HTML tags
are not case sensitive so you can see we
have paragraph tag over here with small
P present inside angular bracket
what we can do is we can write here
capital P as well so these two things
are pretty same so let's write something
inside this as well so let's say we are
writing here this
is paragraph 2 fine so this is the
content present inside this paragraph
tag with capital P inside angular
brackets now save the program and you
can see we have two paragraphs over here
the first one says this is a paragraph
and the second one says this is a
paragraph two so what we have to do is
we have to remove a from here save it
now and now it says this is paragraph
two fine so I hope you guys got that
HTML tags are not case
sensitive fine now let's move ahead and
we'll now discuss empty elements in
HTML most HTML elements have a start tag
and an end tag that indicate where the
element begins and where it ends for
example we we have this paragraph tag
over here this is the start of this
paragraph tag and this is the end part
right so this indicates that this
paragraph tag ends over
here now there is a group of elements
that are exceptions to this rule so
these elements are called empty or void
and only have a start tag since they
have no content present inside the tag
so they must not have an end tag in HTML
example of empty elements are like The
Brak tag we have we have image link and
many more such tags the list is quite
long so what we'll do is We'll add an
image using the image tag so image tag
is basically an empty element so we'll
use that particular element and you guys
will understand what empty elements are
so as mentioned earlier that empty
elements do not require any closing Tex
so what we'll do is we'll write here
inside angular brackets IMG is the tag
name then we'll write here SRC so SRC
over here is attri we'll discuss
attributes in upcoming videos so inside
this we'll provide the path of our image
so let's say we
have this image present
inside images folder which is a folder
present in a system so where we are
saving all our HTML programs so the next
thing we'll write here is alt alt stand
for alternate so if the image is not
shown over the browser then the
alternate text will be shown so let's
say we are writing here image one now
now we'll close this image tag so that's
all we don't have to close this
particular image tag we don't have to
write here like this so you can see we
don't have to write here like this
anything so if we not write it over here
that's fine because image element is an
empty element so let's save the program
and you can see we have an image over
here in the browser so the image size is
quite large what we'll do is we'll
reduce the side so we'll write
here this for now
we'll discuss all these things in the
upcoming video so don't worry about it
for now you can see that we have an
image over here so this is our image
this particular image is what we have
added using the image tag so this is
done now the last thing we'll discuss in
this video is the nesting of elements
nesting means we can use the tag or
element within another element for
example you can see we have a paragraph
over here so this is a paragraph which
says this is paragraph 2 let's add some
more things over here so let's say we
are writing over
here HTML stands
for
hypertext workup
language
fine and save the program so this is the
paragraph over here you can see let me
increase the size of a browser a bit so
now I think you guys can see it much
better now what we'll do is we'll use a
particular element or tag within this
paragraph tag so let's say we want this
HTML to be cursive and bold in nature so
what we'll do over here is we'll use the
B tag over here so b stands for Bol so
what we'll do next is we'll cut HTML
from here and we'll paste it inside this
bag now save the program and you can see
HTML is bold in nature right similarly
what we can do is we can Nest one more
tag inside this B old tag so what we can
do is we'll write here I now we have to
put this HTML inside both these texts
save this program and you can see the
HTML is cursive in nature now so you can
see we have three different texts or we
can say we have two different tags
inside a particular tag this is known as
nesting of elements so we can do it with
HTML as I hope you guys must have got an
idea about what HTML elements are and
how elements are different from tags in
HTML now that we already have an idea
about elements let's discuss what
attributes let me write the basic syntax
of an HTML element over here first so
what we'll do is we'll write over here
let's use the paragraph Tex so we are
writing over here this is
a basic
example of elements in HTM fine I hope
you guys must have got an idea about
what this is this is actually a basic
HTML element we have nothing else over
here just a simple example of HTML
element an element consist of start tag
an ending tag and the content within the
tag right so this particular thing is an
element now attributes in HTML refer to
the additional Properties or
characteristics of an element for
example if we write here let's suppose
we are writing over here let's say we
are writing over here IDs
say par one fine now save this program
and you can see over here that we have a
paragraph which says this is a basic
example of elements in HTML now we have
this whole element with ID as par or we
can give any ID of our choice now this
ID is unique for this particular element
for now you don't have to worry much
about this ID or any other attribute
just focus on what attributes are we are
going through the working of attributes
basically so we we can use the ID of
this attribute to style this particular
element so basically this ID attribute
defines what this HTML element is we
have to use the style tag element or we
can say we have to use the style element
for styling this particular paragraph
you will understand it once we go
through the tag so let's do it over here
what we'll do is we'll use the style tag
over here so we'll write Here style you
can see this is a style element
basically it has start tag it has ending
tag now we'll write some content inside
this particular so let's say we are
writing over here
hash par one now inside this what we'll
do is we'll Define some styling
properties so let's say we are writing
over here background color as red and
we'll write here color so this color
here refers to the font color basically
so we'll write here blue now save this
program and you can see the paragraph in
a browser is changed so what we did here
is inside this style element we access
this particular ID so ID is unique for
each element we'll discuss it later on
so basically this particular paragraph
tag has an ID named par so we are using
that particular ID then we have some CSS
properties so these properties are used
to style a particular element so we have
used it over here you can see it over
here if I zoom out a bit in the browser
you can see the background color of this
whole paragraph is red and the font
color is blue fine what we want to say
here is this ID over here is basically
an attribute it is used to identify or
change a particular element we have many
attributes present in HTML so we'll go
through some of them let's say we are
adding an image over here so let's add
an image and you guys will understand
about HTML attributes here as well so
we'll write here IMG so this is
basically an empty element we have
discussed it in the previous part
wherein we went through HTML elements
now what we'll do is we'll write here
SRC now SRC is also an attribute this
attribute is used to provide the system
with the source of a image so if we go
back to this particular HTML folder so
here we have a HTML folder you can see
we have a folder here named as images
and we have an image present inside this
particular folder right so what we have
to do is we have to provide this path
inside a HTML file so what we are going
to do here is we are going to get back
to vs code and inside here we'll write
image so this is our folder name and we
have a file name html.png present inside
that particular folder so SRC is the
attribute and this particular thing is
the value of our attribute right now the
next thing we are going to do here is we
are going to write here alt now inside
this alt let's say we are writing HTML
over here now this alt attribute is used
when we add an image on so basically
what happens is when we add an image to
a web browser sometimes what happens is
the image is not shown over the browser
so in that case the alternate text will
be shown so if this particular image is
not shown in the browser then this
particular text will be shown so let's
save this program we'll open a web
browser here side by side as well you
can see that this particular image is
present over here in our web browser the
size of this image is quite large we can
change the size in two different ways we
can either use the ID attribute here as
well and then use that particular
attribute in the sty in tag or css file
to change the size of this image or we
can simply use the height and width
attribute in the image tag over so
that's the simple one so what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here height height is an attribute we
have to define the height in pixels so
we have written over here 300 pixels
save the program and you can see the
height of this image is 300 pixels same
thing goes for width as well if we write
here width and if we Define the width as
300 300 pixels as well save the program
and you can see now the height and width
of this particular image is 300 pixels
right so guys this is all about the
basics of attributes in HTML I hope you
guys understood this today we'll be
taking a look at formatting in HTML
we'll go through some basic HTML
elements used for formatting an HTML
document before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our YouTube channel
already make sure to subscribe to our
Channel and press that Bell icon to
never miss any updates on programming
videos so without any further delay
let's get started before we move on and
discuss the different formatting tags in
HTML let's understand what formatting is
formatting refers to the process of
making the text present on a web page
more appealing to the user for example
let's say we want to add a heading in
our HTML document and for that we want a
specific font size let's say we want to
add a heading with a bigger font size
for this purpose we have the heading tag
present in HTML which provides us with
six different font sizes with H1 being
the tag with the greatest font size and
H6 with the smallest font we have
already discussed in in the previous
videos as well now we need to make sure
which font size we want and we can use
the heading tag accordingly let's
understand this with the help of an
example let's suppose we are working on
a web page wherein we want a heading so
let's say the heading is what is HTML we
want the font size to be bigger so
simply we'll write here H1 we have
already mentioned it that H1 has the
biggest font size of all the six heading
tags right so inside this we'll write
what is HTML so let's suppose this is
the heading now on saving the program
you can see here on the browser that we
have a heading with larger font size
so what we can do for now is we'll
remove this heading from here now save
it and you can see we have only one
heading as of now we have the heading as
what is HTML we can also write a
paragraph after this heading tag that
will explain what HTML is using the
paragraph so let's do it over here as
well and you guys will understand it
much better so here we are going to use
the break element so this is basically
an empty element used in HTML for line
break so what we are going to do is we
are going to put it over here so this is
the tag BR tag or Break Tag we can see
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write here inside the paragraph
tag HTML stands
for let's write it in capitals we'll
write here hyper
text
markup language
fine so here we have paragraph that says
HTML stands for hypertext text markup
language now what we want to do is we
want to add another heading to this web
page which will Define the uses of HTML
so basically what we are doing is we are
going through the sizes of heading text
so we want another heading let's say
over here now the main heading of our
web page was what is HTML and we want it
to stand out among all the headings
present in our web page that's why we
use the H1 tag for that heading now for
the next heading or for the new heading
we'll have a little bit smaller size
than the main so what we are going to do
is we are going to use the h2 tag or the
H3 tag for that so let's use the H3 tag
for now we'll write over here
H3 so basically we are going to write it
after a br tag so we are going to use
the BR tag over here or the Break Tag we
can say now we are going to write here
uses of HTML fine now save the program
and you guys can clearly see the
difference in font size of both the
headings let me zoom in a bit here in
the browser so now you guys can see it
much better the there's a difference in
the size of heading one and heading
three right so this difference is what
we are talking about there are six
different sizes for a heading tag in
HTML we can use any of these heading
tags according to our need figure out
which one of these six tags is best
suitable for your web page and use them
simple and easy let's move ahead and
we'll now discuss some more formatting
tags present in HTM let's move ahead and
we'll now discuss some more formatting
tags present in HTML the next tag we are
going to discuss is the Bold tag this
tag is used to make the text bold or
strong so there are two different tags
for the same task for making the text
bold we can either use the Bold tag or
simple B tag we can say the other tag we
can use is the strong tag the
functionality of both tags is similar so
we'll use them side by side so that you
guys can see the difference or they are
basically same so what we are going to
do is we are going to write here after
this BR T we are going to write here B
so b stand for bold Tech now we are
going to write something in here so
let's say we are writing over here
HTML now again after BR tag we are going
to use the strong tag fine we'll write
same thing here the content will remain
the same so we are going to write HTML
over
here now here we used both tags with
similar content present inside the save
the program and you can see we have two
similar outputs here on our web page the
outputs are exactly similar the working
of both the tags is the same right now
let's recall the nesting of elements in
HTML from the previous video we have
said earlier that we can use an element
within another element in HTML we are
going to Nest this bold tag inside a
first paragraph tag it means that we are
going to Nest this bold tag over here so
what we are going to do is we are going
to use bold tag inside the full form or
we are going to put the full form of
HTML inside the Bold tag fine so save it
and you can see we have hyper text
markup language written over here in the
browser in bold right it looks better
than the previous one just like the Bold
tag we have two more text present in
HTML to make the text on scen look more
up feeling to the user the italic tag
and the underlined tag now you guys must
be thinking that these three formatting
techniques are also present in Microsoft
Word you are right these three tags are
present in both msword and htl the
working is also same so let's use these
tags here once what we are going to do
is we are going to use this tags over
here only so we are going to put this
hyper text markup language inside three
different tags so we are going to put
them inside italic we are going to to
put them inside bold and we are going to
put them inside underline as so we are
going to do this over
here now you can see the nesting of
elements over here if I zoom in a bit on
Visual Studio code you can see we have a
paragraph tag then we have three tags
present inside it so we have bold tag we
have italic and underline so this is
called nesting of elements now save this
program and you can see the text over
here we have hypertext markup language
in italics it is underlined and it is B
in nature right the next tag we are
going to use is the delete tag we have
two different tags present for this task
as well let's say we want to put a line
through the center of any text Crossing
it out basically let's say that this
text is not relevant fine so let's go
through an example first what we are
going to do is we are going to use the
break tag over here and now after this
Break Tag we are going to use use a
paragraph tag we are going to write a
paragraph
so let's say we'll write here I would
like to have a cup
of
okay cup
of coffee fine save it and you can see
we have this paragraph or sentence over
here on the browser now what we want is
we want to delete this particular word
or we can say we want to put a line
through it fine so what we are going to
do is we are going to write
here
strike fine we are going to put coffee
inside this strike tag because we want
this particular word to cut and then
let's say we are writing over here D
fine so save it now and you can see it
over here it says I would like to have a
cup of coffee has a line over it and
then we have written T so you guys can
understand the meaning of this sentence
by yourself I guess can use this tag
anywhere according to our needs we can
achieve this same thing with the help of
the delete tag as well what we have to
do is we have to write here in place of
strike what we are going to do is we are
going to copy this piece of code from
here we are going to paste it here now
instead of strike we are going to write
here delete so D this is the
tag and we are going to close this tag
as well now we are going to write coffee
inside it and save the program and you
can see we have the exact same output
with this tag as well fine another tag
we have in HTML for formatting is the
mark tag now the mark tag in HTML is
used to Mark any particular text the
text will be highlighted with yellow
color for example let's say we are
writing something over here or we can
just paste this again and we are going
to remove this part
now we want to Mark the word coffee
let's say so what we are going to do is
we are going to write here mark this is
the tag and inside this tag we are going
to write coffee let's say fine save the
program and you can see it over here we
have this sentence which says I would
like to have a cup of coffee and coffee
is highlighted over here right so this
is the mark tag and we can use this tag
for
formatting now the last tag we are going
to disc in today's video is the font tag
the font is an inline element used to
change font sizes font colors and font
styles of the text in a web page this
element has its own attributes so the
three attributes we can use are size
color and Fe fine size is used to change
the font size of the text we can write
values between 1 and seven with one
being the smallest and seven being the
largest font exactly opposite to The
Heading T so you can learn it that way
color refers to the font color we can
simply write the name of the color or we
can use the hexadecimal values for
colors the hexadecimal numbers are
specified according to the RGB value for
each
color the last thing we have is face
face refers to the font style the
default HTML font is Times New R we can
use any font style of our choice using
this attribute so let's use this tag
over here and you guys will understand
it much better I guess so what we'll do
is we'll write
here let's say we are using a paragraph
TCH so we'll write something over here
let's say I
prefer now we are going to use the font
tag over here so this is a tag you can
see it in red color now we have three
different attributes right so the first
attribute we have is five so we'll write
here inside size let's say the size of
this font is four then we have color so
color defines the font color so let's
say the font color we want is red and
then we have the pH so let's say we want
the font style to
be Wana and we'll
write something over here let's say we
are writing this over red fine now save
the program and you can see it over here
it says I prefer red fine so let's
complete this sentence
what we are going to do is we are going
to write something after this font tag
as well so let's say we are writing over
here red over blue save the program and
you can see it over here that we have
this particular sentence which says I
prefer red over so let me increase the
size of vs code so that you guys can see
it clearly so here you can see we have
this paragraph Tex then we have written
inside it I prefer and we have kept this
red word inside a particular element
font element basically this font element
has three different attributes size
color and phase now let's change the
size of this to six for
now and
we'll check the output save the program
and you can see red over here is quite
large in size right it looks different
so I hope you guys got this formatting
an HTML document is mostly done using
CSS but now HTML also allows us to
format our documents using different
tags basic formatting we can say so
formatting is making the web page more
appealing using these particular tags so
the list of formatting tags present in
HTML is quite long we can't discuss all
of them here but if you use any of those
tags in the upcoming videos then surely
we'll discuss them over there on now the
task for you guys is to use these
formatting tags and let us know if you
find any difficulty in using them we'll
be taking a look at phrase tags in HTML
we'll go through what phrase tags are
and the syntax of some basic phrase tags
present in HTML but before we begin if
you haven't subscribed to our YouTube
channel already make sure to subscribe
to our Channel and press that Bell icon
to never miss any updates on programming
videos so without any further delay
let's get started in HTML a phrase tag
is used to give structural meaning to a
block of text what does that mean let's
try to understand this with the help of
an example
we'll first take a paragraph for this
example a small one maybe so let's do it
here what we'll do is we'll write
here P so we are going to use the
paragraph T let's write something over
here so let's say we are writing over
here hello everyone then I'll write this
is Cal and let's suppose we are writing
over
here please subscribe to a
YouTube channel
fine save this and you can see here that
we have the same paragraph here on the
browser now what we said earlier about
the phrase tags is they are used to give
structural meaning to a block of text
right so here we have a paragraph and we
want to provide meaning to a block of
text let's say we want to put some
emphasis on the word YouTube over here
fine we want this word to stand out
differently from the rest of the
paragraph for this task we have the
emphasized tag in
HTML the Syntax for this tag goes like
this so what we'll do is we'll cut this
sentence into two different parts so
that it will be easy for you guys to
understand
now we have the emphasized tag in HTML
the syntax is pretty simple but we have
to do is we'll write over here so we are
going to make changes inside this
particular parag paragraph tag only so
we are going to use the emphasis tag
over here so what we have to do is we
have to cut the word YouTube from here
and we have to paste it here now the
syntax is so simple we have a two- word
tag so it says em it stands for emphasis
now save the program and you can see
here in the browser you can see the
difference basically the word YouTube
stands out from the rest of the words
present in the paragraph to lay some
more emphasis on the word YouTube we can
use the title attribute now title
attribute will be used inside the
emphasis tag so let's do it here once so
what we are going to do is we are going
to use the title attribute over here so
let's say the title says check
a
YouTube channel fine so let's break it a
little
more so here you can see we have these
three lines so inside this paragraph tag
what we are doing
is we are using the emphasis tag and
inside that emphasis tag we are using
the title attribute fine on saving the
program you can see nothing changes over
here on the browser to witness the
change here we have to take our mouse
cursor over YouTube and you can see we
have a small popup here that contains
the value of a title attribute let me
zoom in a bit here so here you can see
on taking the mouse cursor we have this
small popup with the value of a title
Atri right another thing we can do for
this task is we can add a link over here
on the word YouTube we'll discuss it in
the upcoming videos when we'll go
through text links in HTML so you guys
will understand it much better then now
you guys may have a question in your
mind that we can do this exact same
thing with formatting tags as well right
yes of course we can do that but
formatting refers to the process of
molding the text for a better look and
feel of the text while phrase tags are
used to provide meaning to a block of
text it's not necessary that if a tag
falls under the category of formatting
text then it can't be a phrase tag the
difference lies in the purpose of using
that particular tag I hope you guys are
getting
it the next tag we are going to discuss
is the mark tag we have already
discussed this tag in the formatting
tags as well so let's discuss it one
more time the mark tag in HTML is used
to Mark any particular text the text
will be highlighted with yellow color so
we have discussed it previously now what
we are going to do is we are going to
copy this piece of code so we are going
to copy the whole paragraph from here
and then we'll paste it here now instead
of using the emphasis tag we are going
to use the mark tag over here fine so we
are going to change the tag name from
emphasis to mark for the opening and
closing Tex save it now and you can see
we have another paragraph over here
which is almost the same or which is
exactly the same it says hello everyone
this is kosel please subscribe to our
YouTube channel now the thing to notice
here is the word YouTube it is
highlighted in yellow color right so the
title attribute will work same over here
as well if you put a mouse cursor over
the word YouTube you can see we have
this popup with the same title value
right so one thing to notice here is the
title attribute is basically the
differentiator between the formatting
tags and the phrase tags it means that
the tag Remains the Same but the way of
using it defines the purpose so let's
move ahead and we'll now discuss the
abbreviation tag in HTML the word
abbreviation in general terms refers to
the short form of a word that's it we
have the answer here if you're using any
abbrevation for any word we want the
user to know that this particular word
has a special meaning then we can use
the abbreviation T so the syntax goes
like this what we will do is we'll again
use the same
paragraph and
we'll paste it over here
again so what we are going to do
is we are going to remove this empty
space from here so that you guys will be
able to see the whole code or as much
code as possible so what we are going to
do now is we are going to use the
abbreviation tag fine so we'll remove
this piece of code from here we have to
put this over over the word YouTube so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here abbreviation and inside
there we are going to write YT so this
is the short form of YouTube
basically now save the program and you
can see that we have another paragraph
but there's no difference over here as
of now the word is simple there's it's
not standing out basically right so this
is because while using the abbrevation
tag we must necessarily use the title
attribute along with this t so let's do
it here we have to write here title and
we have to write Here YouTube because YT
stands for YouTube so we are going to
write Here
YouTube now save the program and you can
see here that the abbrevation YT is now
underlined with a dotted line fine this
indicates that the word YT is used as an
abbreviation here and the user will know
that something is different over here on
taking the mouse cursor over it you can
see we have the value of a title
attribute you can see it says YouTube so
this is basically the short form of
YouTube YT over here now the next tag we
are going to discuss is the address tag
this tag is used to display the address
in the web browser the content is
written within the opening and closing
address tag is considered as an address
in HTM so this is the address we
generally use fine not an IP address or
nothing else the general address we use
for a location or for a address so let's
use this this tag over here we'll write
here address and this is the tag now
inside this tag we are going to
write YouTube office let's
say then we
have one
123 street so this is going to be the
street name for our address then we have
let's say sector so let's say the sector
is
456 and then we have
the place name is NOA and the country
name is India
fine so this is an address and let's
save the program you can see here the
difference in the browser the address
tag over here has a different font this
tag is used to indicate that this
particular block of text is an address
so you can see it over here this is a
address now if you want see it clearly
let me remove these three paragraphs
from here save the program now and you
can see we have address over here so if
you want to write it in different lines
so what we can do is we can use the
break tag over here then over here again
save the program and you can see we have
the address over here the font is
different that's the only difference
between address tag and other
tags the next tag we are going to
discuss is the short quotation tag this
tag is used to add double quotes within
a sentence the syntax is simple so what
we do is we'll write something over here
let's say we are writing over here
paragraph We are writing over here let's
say again
please subscribe to a now we want the
word YouTube inside double quotes right
so for that we are going to use the
quotation tag this is the syntax we have
to write simple CU and we have to put
the word YouTube inside it fine then
we'll write here
here Channel and we have to put a space
over here save the program and you can
see it says please subscribe to our
YouTube channel with YouTube present
inside double codes
fine so the last tag we are going to
discuss in today's tutorial is the code
tag in HTML this tag is used to
represent programming code in HTML the
text will look like we have any code
from a programming language for example
we'll write here code this is the tag
now inside there we'll write let's say
we are using a for Loop in JavaScript so
we'll write here for I is equals to
0 then we
have I Less Than 3 so let's give some
spaces over here and then we have
i++ fine then after this we have inside
here
console.log and we are are going to
print high fine so if you are new to
this language just ignore it it's just a
simple piece of code from JavaScript so
save it now and you can see we have this
code over here now what we are going to
do next is we are going to use Break Tag
over here first then
we'll understand it fine so we are going
to use the BR tag here again and here
again fine save it now and you can see
the code now you can see we have the
same output on the browser as the text
present in vs code the font is exactly
the same so this represents a piece of
code in HTML we can use the code tag for
that so Guys these are some of the basic
phrase tags we discussed in today's
video as we mentioned earlier that the
list is quite long for all these Texs
we'll discuss them in future whenever we
use them I hope you guys got it so
that's all for this video guys see you
in the next one where we'll go through
metat tags in HTML till now we we came
across certain types of tags in HTM we
have a good idea of how and when to use
any particular tag while working with
HTML now let's imagine a situation where
we are working on the front end of any
web page which contains more than a,
lines of code we are almost finished
with the front end but suddenly we
realize that we made an error somewhere
previously or we want to change a
particular piece of code let's say in
that case we can't go back checking each
line to find that particular piece of
code right that's where comments can
help us and save our time a comment is
common for almost all programming
languages the syntax May differ in
different languages but the usage
Remains the Same it is a line in
programming that does not affect the
output of the program it stays there in
the code but does not affect the output
by any means in HTML the way of writing
a comment is quite simple we have been
working with text for some time now the
syntax for comments also remains similar
to them all we have to do is we have to
write here like we want to add a comment
here let's say so what we have to do is
we have to put an exclamation mark and
then we have to put this now this is the
Syntax for comments in HTML now whatever
thing we'll write inside it will be
treated as a comment fine so one thing
to notice here is that there is an
exclamation mark at the start of every
comment we use but not at the end fine
just keep this thing in mind and we are
good to go with comments in htl let's
save our program and you can see there
is no change in the browser so for your
convenience what we are going to do is
we are going to add a paragraph over
here so let's say we are writing over
here we are going through commments in
HTML let's save the program and you can
see that particular paragraph in the
browser so the comment won't affect the
outcome of any program by by any means
fine another use of comments is they can
be used to hide content now hiding
content means we can temporarily hide
any Tex from the HTML document according
to our needs so let's say we have an
image over here and we want to see if
the web page will look good with the
image or without it so let's add an
image first what we'll do is we'll write
after this paragraph
tag IMG let's say the source is
inside images we have html.png this is
the image then we'll write here
alternate alternate will be let's say
HTML now save the program and you can
see the image over here but it's quite
large so let's fix this first we are
going to write here height and width so
we are using attributes basically so
we'll write your width width is going to
be 250 pixels again save the program and
here you can see we have a image
fine now to remove this image
temporarily what we have to do is we
have to put this whole image tag inside
the Comm what we'll do is we'll write
over here the Syntax for commit now this
is the commit what we'll do is we'll
copy this image TCH we'll cut it from
here and we'll paste it
inside this comment
fine now save the
program and the image is temporarily
removed from the browser right simple
and easy now a comment can be a single
line comment or a multi-line comment no
change in the Syntax for that anything
we put inside these tags will be taken
as a comment by the browser so what we
are trying to say here is comments are
very useful in programming it's just a
note for the programmer to remember what
they did at that particular part of the
program or we can simply say with
comments we can place notifications and
reminders in a HTML code if you guys
remember when we came came across empty
elements in HTML there we saw the Syntax
for image tag in HTML actually the image
tag falls under the category of empty
elements in HTML that's why we saw it
there as well it means that this
particular tag in HTML does not require
any closing tag to work it has
attributes we'll go through them in a
moment before that let me clear this one
thing to you guys any image we see on a
web page is not inserted into that page
instead it is linked to a web page what
the image tag does it holds a space for
the referenced image you will understand
it much better in a while so let's go
through the syntax of adding an image or
attaching an image we can say to a web
page using the image tag is not at all a
task for the user it's the easiest thing
to do in HTML we can say that so what
we'll do is we'll write here inside the
body tag what we are going to do is we
are going to right here IMG so this is
the tag and we already know that this is
an empty element so it does not require
any closing
tag now inside the image tag we have to
add attributes so we'll write here SRC
so let's discuss some important things
before we move ahead you can see over
here that we have used the SRC attribute
inside the image tag this is a necessary
attribute while using the image tag in
HTML why
this attribute specifies the path to the
image any image we want to attach to our
web page needs to be stored somewhere
either in the system or it can be
anywhere on the internet as well so
let's move back to the main folder so
what we are going to do is we are going
to move back to our main HTML folder so
here we are inside the HTML folder now
what we are going to do is we are going
to make large icons over here so here we
are in the HTML folder you can see we
have all the HTML files over here right
here we have an image named python so if
we double click on it you can see this
is an image and the name of this image
is python right so what we are going to
do is we are going to click on it right
click basically go to properties and
here you can see we have the name of a
file and then we have the type type here
is PNG PNG means portable Network
Graphics it is basically a extension for
images and pictures so HTML do support
other extensions like jpeg GF SVG and
many more other extensions so we can use
any of those files with those extensions
now to attach this image to a web page
we need to provide the path to the
system through which the system can
understand that this particular image is
stored in this part of the system or the
drive fine so the path you can check
here is at the top of this window click
on it and you can see the path over here
so this is the path so this python file
is present inside the C drive users then
we have a name this folder name as Cal B
then we have desktop and HTML fine so
this is the path of a image let's move
back to vs code and we don't need the
whole path as of now because the current
HTML file we are in right now is present
inside the HTML folder so we don't need
to specify the whole path as of
now all we have to do is we have to
write the file name here inside the SRC
attribute what we'll do is we'll write
here the file name so our file name is
python. PNG fine so this is a file name
save the program and you can see we have
an image over here on the browser the
size is quite large as of now we'll see
how to manage this thing after some time
for now let's reduce the size of the
whole web page what we are going to do
is we are going to reduce the size and
you can see the whole image over here
fine another possibility is we can store
all the images inside a single folder so
here if we go back to a HTML folder here
you can see we have a folder named
images Right double click on it and you
can see we have different images present
over here we have three different images
basically HTML CSS and JavaScript we can
use any of these images so let's get
back to vs code again and the next thing
we are going to do is we going to access
any image from that particular folder
fine so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here after this IMG
then SRC now inside SRC we have to write
the folder name first fine so we'll
write here images then we'll use slash
and then we'll write the file name so we
have three different files over here
this is the benefit of using vs code we
have all the three files we can use over
here so let's use css.png as of now
close the image tag save the program and
you can see the image over here so let's
do one thing we are going to
use the BR te use it now save the
program and let's use it once again so
that it will be easy for us to
understand so here we have two different
images the python one and the CSS one so
basically with we have to do is we have
to give the correct path of that
particular image fine so the next
attribute we'll discuss is the alt
attribute or we can say the alternate
attribute let's write it over here first
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here alt press enter and write
something over here let's see we are
writing over here CSS so this alt
attribute we have here provides an
alternate text for an image if the user
for some reason cannot view it so
basically can happen because of slow
connection and error in the source code
or in the source we can say or if the
user is using a screen reader so it can
be any of these reasons but if the user
is not able to see that picture then an
alternate text will come at Place fine
so the value of the alter attribute
should always describe the image so
that's why we have written over here CSS
so that the user can understand that
this particular image over here is a CSS
image or
it can be basically anything that
describes the image fine so let's do one
thing here what we'll do is we'll make
an error over here in the SRC attribute
let's change the file name over here
let's say this is the file name that's a
simple error right nothing major over
here let's save the program and you can
see the image is not here anymore
fine so I believe you guys might not be
able to see because I have to increase
the size for
that so
you can see here now there's no image
present at this particular part of a web
page because the source is wrong so the
file name is wrong basically instead of
that we have text present over here
which says CSS fine so this is how the
alt attribute works in the image tag
further and talking about the actual
size of these images over here we can
change the size of these images in two
different ways so let's start with the
easier one first what we'll do is we'll
use the height and the width attribute
just like the source and Alternate
attributes we have these attributes are
also used within the image tag all we
have to do is we have to write
here height height is let's say 250
pixels and then we have width as well so
width again is let's say 250 pixels save
the program and you can see the image
height and width is now 250 pixels we
can do the same thing for this file as
so what we'll do is we'll write here
width as let's say 100 pixels
and height as again 100 pixels save the
program and you can see the size of this
image is 100 pixels in width and height
now fine another way of using these
attributes is to use them within the
style tag we can use this tag anywhere
in the program although this tag is
related to CSS and we can also Define
these things in CSS file
but as of now we are not talking about
that concept so we'll stick to HTML only
so what we'll do is we'll write here to
use the style tag what we have to do is
we have to write
Here style now what we want to do is we
want to access the image tag so we have
to write here IMG curly braces now we
have to define the properties inside
here fine so what we'll do is we'll
Define the width over here as 500
pixels and the height height as well
fine height is again going to be 500
pixels now one thing to notice here is
this image tag or these properties will
be applied on both the tags because we
are using tag over here fine so we are
changing the properties of a tag so both
the image tag will be affected save the
program and you can see the image size
are now changed both are 500 pixels so
let's do one
thing let's remove it from here and this
as well now change the size to let's
say 200 pixels and 200 pixels save the
program and you can see we have both the
images over here both are 200 pixels in
width and height so this tag is also
working
fine what we summarize from this is we
can use these attributes within the
image tag itself or we can use the style
tag to change the style of the image so
these are some of the basic attributes
we can use within the image H tag in
HTML I hope you guys got it try it by
yourself and let us know if you face any
problem a table is a set of data
elements that allows us to store or
represent data into rows and columns
just like we create tables in normal
life for representing the data the same
table we create in HTML as well a table
consists of rows and columns we can
arrange any kind of data like text
images links other table Etc into rows
and Columns of sends fine the table tag
in HTML is used to create a table so
let's do it here side by side and you
guys will get a better idea of what we
are talking about here so let's create a
simple table first we'll discuss each
step here so what we'll do is we'll
write here inside the body tag we'll
create a new tag so this table tag this
is a table tag whatever data we want to
put in the table will go inside this
table tag on
now save the program and you can see we
are not able to see any table here so
we'll see it in a while now let's add
some data here first we know that a
table consists of rows and columns right
the table row tag defines any Row in
HTML or in a table we can say the Syntax
for it goes like this what we'll do is
we'll write over here inside the table
tag only we'll write TR now this TR
represents table room fine one thing to
notice here is we are nesting one tag
inside another tag the table tag is
responsible for creating a space for the
table the table row tag is used to add a
row to that particular table now the
next step is to add columns inside the
table each row can contain one or more
than one column the table data tag is
used to add data in columns so it might
sound a bit confusing at the moment but
but let's do it over here and you guys
will know how easy it is to add data in
column what we have to do is we have to
write here simply TD TD stands for table
data and we have to put the data inside
this TD tag TD means table data tag and
this tag represent a column in a table
fine so let's write it over here
R1 comma C
fine let's give some space over here as
well then again we are going to use the
TD
tag so we'll write here R1
comma
fine now here we are we have added two
columns inside the first row so let's
check the output now save it and you can
see we have the data over here this is
basically the table data R1 means Row
one C1 means column one and similar R1
means Row one C2 means column so this is
a single row with two different columns
fine now we are not able to see the
structure of the table right in order to
get the structure of the table we have
to include an attribute inside the table
tag what we have to do is we have to
write here inside the table
tag we have to write here border and
inside border we have to mention the
Border width so which is basically 1
pixel right now save the program and you
can see this border attribute will show
the Border all around the table and the
S
fine we can change the width of this
border by changing the value of Border
over here so for example if we write
here 10 pixels and now if you save the
program you can see the Border
changing so this looks nice right so for
now we'll write here one pixel only so
this is the table border moving ahead
let's add another row over here first
what we'll do do is we'll use the table
row tag again and the rest HTML will
take care of we can add a row in a table
anywhere in the HTM keep this thing in
mind until the table row tag is nested
inside the table tag HTML will manage to
add the row in the table fine what we'll
do is we'll write here after this table
row T we are going to add another row so
we are going to write here TR now inside
this we have to write some data or we
can say we have to include some columns
so this is going to be the row two so we
are going to write here R2 C1 for column
1 and then we'll write here TD
again we'll write here R2 then we have C
fine now save the program and you can
see we have another row over here which
says R2 and C2 and R1 and C1 obviously
so adding rows and columns seems an easy
task ask now right I hope you guys got
it moving further we'll now discuss the
table heading time so every time we
arrange some data in the table we need
some reference to that data right let's
say we are creating a bill for a
restaurant what we need in that bill are
the name of the product and the price
fine so we need to mention it at the top
of each column to do so we need to use
the table heading tag the syntax for
this tag is pretty easy what we have to
do is we have to write here after the
first table rag the Syntax for this tag
is pretty easy what we have to do is we
have to write here before the first
table rag so we have to write here only
because this is going to be the heading
so it has to be present at the top of
the table before any row and column we
have to add another row over here now
inside this row we have to mention
headings fine so we have to use the
table heading Tex so the syntax is this
now we have to write here the first
heading so let's say first heading is
item and then we have the second heading
as price fine save the program and you
can see we have two headings over here
now let's change the tables data first
and we'll create a bill for some
restaurant let's say so what we are
going to do is we are going to add
another column over here here in each
row so we are going to add a column
let's say
it's Sr number so it's going to be the
serial number then we have to change the
data here only fine so we'll remove the
data from
here from each row basically so we'll
remove this as
well and we'll remove this as well fine
now this is going to be the first row
after let save the program once and you
can see over here we have empty cells
present over here we have three headings
serial number item and price let's work
on the first R now we need
another table data tag so the serial
number is going to be one for first row
let's say the item name is p then we
have the price so let's say the price is
going to be rupees 20 save the program
and we have our first r over here now
for the second row we have to put the
serial number as two then we
have coffee or let's
say black coffee then we have to use
another table data tag now we have to
mention the price the price is let's say
34 black
coffee and we are good to go with this
as well we are going to copy this whole
row from here we to paste it here the
serial number is going to be three the
item name is let's say capuccino so
we'll write
here
capucino and the price is going to be a
little higher than black C let's say 60
for
capuccino and then we are going to add
another item over here fine so the
serial number is going to be four
instead of capuccino let's write here
espresso then let's change the price to
90 save the program and you can see the
table over here it looks nice
right now we have three columns the
procedure is the same and you just saw
it right just like we added the table
heading here in this table similarly we
can give a caption to the table as well
like here we can write the restaurant's
names or we can write the bill or
anything we want so that particular
caption will be present at the top of
the table so what we have to do is we
have to write here at the top before
this table row tag before the first row
we have to write here caption caption is
another tag now we have to write here
let's say the restaurant name is XY Z
Resturant save the program and you can
see the caption over here as XY Z
restorant fine now the next thing we are
going to discuss in this video is the
row span and the call span attributes
suppose we want to merge two cells and
create a single merging two cells means
let's say we want to merge these two
cells fine this one and this one so for
that we can use the column span
attribute or the row span attribute
fine so for example let's suppose we
want to print the grand total of all the
items for that we we don't need the
serial number so what we can do is we
can merge the first two columns of this
row with the help of call spin so we are
going to create another row over here
and we are going to merge these two
columns fine in the new row so what we
have to do here
is we have to write here after this row
we are going to add another row so for
that we have to write here table row tag
now inside this table row tag we have to
mention the table data tag and then
we'll write here calls Spen calls Spen
is going to be two because we want to
merge two cells fine now what we'll do
is we'll write
here grand total and we are going to add
another cell so we are going to write
here TD again so let's add it and the
total price is I guess 200 so we'll
write here 200 save the program and you
can see we have two columns merged over
here
fine similarly we can also use the rose
pan attribute whenever we want to merge
two rules one thing to keep in mind is
we can use these attributes within the
table data tag only not in any other TCH
for
example if we want to merge two rows
fine so what we can do is we can write
here Rose pen and we are going to write
here to save the program and you can see
these two rows are now merged
fine so let's remove it for now and save
the program again so this table looks
nice
now the next attribute we have in tables
is the background color attribute we can
use this attribute to change the
background color of the whole table or
of any particular row or column fine we
just have to use the BG color attribute
as per our requirement for example if we
want to change the background color of
the first r which contains all the
headings what we have to do is we have
to write here inside this first table
row T we have to write here BG color and
this is an attribute now let's say we
want to color it as red fine save the
program and you can see the out the
whole row is red in color now fine
similarly we can change the Border color
of the whole table with the help of
Border color attribute we have to write
here inside the table tag so this is the
main tag and we have to write
here border color is equals
to let's
say yellow fine save the program and you
can see the border is now yellow in
color one thing I want to tell here is
we can change the background color of
any particular set fine so let's say we
want to change the background color of
espresso fine let's do it let's change
this background color to Brown fine so
here we have espresso inside this table
data Ty what we have to do is we have to
write here BG color and we have to
mention here Brown save the program and
you can see it's brown in color fine so
guys this is basically how we can create
an add data in a table in HTML before
discussing text links in HTML let's
understand what a link is any website we
go through in today's world must contain
a link a link in HTML is an object that
allows us to a new location when we
click on it provides a simple way of
navigation between different pages
present on the web these links in HTML
are known as hyperlinks and hyperlinks
allows us to navigate between websites
by clicking on Words emails and images
thus we can create hyperlinks using text
or images available on a web page so
let's go through an example of what
links are and how they make it easier
for the user to navigate within web
pages here we have a sample web page we
created it when we went through jQuery
on this website you can see we have
words present over here like home about
categories top rated and content fine if
we click on any of these word it takes
us to that particular section of the web
page what actually happens is when we
mention these words on the HT ml file we
provided them with specific links so
that it will be easier for the viewer to
get to any particular part of the
website without much hassle I hope you
guys now have got an idea of what links
are let's see how these links are added
to a web page now in this particular
video we'll go through text links in
HTML we'll cover image links and email
links in the upcoming videos so don't
worry about them now in HTML the anchor
tag is used to specify a link anything
present between the opening and closing
anchor tag becomes the part of a link
and we can click that part to reach to
the linked web page or document so the
Syntax for the anchor tag goes like this
inside the body tag we have to write
here a so this is a anchor tag and
anything goes in between there will be
considered as a part of the link
fine now the next thing we'll do is will
add the link to a website here to
specify a link in HTML the HF attribute
is used this attribute specifies the URL
of the web page or website or document
the link goes to so HF is basically a
attribute fine so what we have to do is
we have to write here inside the anchor
tag we have to mention the HF attribute
and now we have to write the URL of
website over here fine so let's say the
URL of a website is is
www.g
google.com fine and the text will be
let's say Google
fine now save the program and you can
see here we have Google written over
here on the web page in blue color it is
purple for now you will get to know
about it later on in this video
only so the URL we mentioned over here
inside the anchor tag will take us to
the homepage of Google Search engine
click on it and you can see here we are
on Google's homepage right so moving
ahead let's discuss the two different
types of URLs we have in HTML the two
types of URLs are absolute URL and
relative
Ur the URL we used here in this example
which navigates the user to Google's
homepage is an example of an absolute Ur
basically when a full web address is
mentioned in the HF attribute it refers
refers to an absolute URL on the other
hand the relative URL refers to a local
link a link to a page within the same
website or without the https and www
part fine the Syntax for this is also a
bit different so let's go through it
what we'll do is we'll first create
another web page for this so let's
create one here we have to name it so
let's say we are writing over here
about.
HTML
so let's write some code over
here let's say we are writing over here
this is the about section of our website
so we'll write here
H2 and about
us and let's write a paragraph here as
well we'll write here
welcome to
a YouTube channel fine so we are done
with it let's save this and let's open
it with live server once and you you can
see it's working totally fine this is
let's say the about a section of a
website now what we'll do is we'll move
back to a original file so we have this
original file over here and we'll create
a link over here fine basically what we
are doing is we are linking these two
HTML files fine now in here what we'll
do is we'll create another link which
will redirect us to that about us page
so for that we have to write here a hre
and and we have to close the anchor tag
fine so in here we have to write the
file name so we'll write here about.
HTML and we'll write here about us
fine save the program now and you can
see we have the word about us present
over here click on it and it will take
us to the About Us section of our
website or to the about us page of our
website you can see it over here now the
reference to adding a local page is the
same as attaching an image to a web page
we can provide the path of that
particular page inside the href
attribute moving ahead let's discuss the
target attribute in Anchor tag whenever
we click on a link it opens a web page
in the same window by replacing the
current web page this happens by default
in HTML fine we can change this to
either within the same window or in a
new window the target attribute can have
four different values the four values
can can be self blank parent and top so
self is used to open the related
document within the same window for
example if we use this particular
attribute over here inside this anchor
tag we'll write here Target then we'll
write here underscore s and save this
program and we'll refresh this page once
again one thing to keep in mind is we
have to write the value like this only
with the underscore present before the
value fine fine now save the program and
now if we click on the link over here
the about us link the new document will
be open in the same window only this is
the default value as well in any web
page so if we want to change the
document to open in a new window we have
to write
here instead of self so let's do it for
this link now what we'll do is we'll
write Target over here Target will be
set to blank with an School save the
program move back to the web page and
click on Google over here you can see
this link is opening in a new window now
fine similarly we have the top end
parent values as the parent value opens
the document in the parent frame and the
top will open it in full body of the
window we'll discuss them later when we
go through HTML frames in the upcoming
videos one more thing we can do with
links is to change the color of a link
for that we have three different
attributes a link V Link and
Link a link refers to an active link We
link on the other hand refers to a
visited Link and Link refers to the
color of the normal link we can mention
these three attributes inside the body
tag only if we want to make similar
changes to all the links present on the
website if you want to do it for one
single link what we have to do is we
have to make mention these three
attributes inside the anchor tag of that
particular link only fine the syntax
goes like this for now we'll mention
them inside the body tag so we'll write
here link link is going to be yellow in
color then we have a link so a link is
going to be let's say brown and then we
have we link fine so we link is going to
be let's say green fine save the program
and you can see Google and about us are
now green in color because they are
already visited links so what we'll do
is We'll add another link over here
we'll write a hre so let's use
any HTML file from here so let's use the
meta HTML one so we'll write here metah
do
HTML Target will set to let's
say blank fine we are going to open it
in a new window so let's say we are
writing over here meta save the program
and you can see Meta over here which is
also in green color because these all
these three links are visited click on
it and you can see the color changing to
Brown fine because it states that these
links are active as well
fine now let's talk about the default
color of an HTML link as well so an
unvisited link Link in HTML is
underlined and blue in color a visited
link is underlined and purple in color
that's why this particular Link at this
start was in purple color and active
link is underline and red in color so
this is the task for you guys you have
to use these attributes to change the
color of a link present on a web page so
I hope you guys must have got an idea by
now about the anchor tag in HTML try
doing it by yourself and let us know
what you learned now that we know enough
about link in HTML and we saw previously
how to use it with a specific word or
phrases in HTML we'll do the same thing
but this time we are going to do it with
images only now a link in HTML is an
object that allows us to a new location
when we click on it it provides a simple
way of navigation between different
pages present on the web just a quick
revision of what links are in HTML so we
already know how to attach an image to a
web page in HTML the image tag is used
for it now to add a link within an image
we have to Nest one tag inside the other
it's not as hard as it sounds so let's
do it here and you will understand it
much better we'll use the image tag
within the anchor tag first of all we'll
write here inside the body tag of a HTML
document we'll write a then this is the
anchor tag we have to write here hre hre
is an attribute we came across the in
the previous video so now what we'll do
is we'll write inside here the reference
to a web page so we'll let's say write
here
https then we have to write here
this let's say we are writing here
www.google.com fine now the anchor tag
is ready let's recall what we did with
text in the last part we simply wrote
the text between the anchor Tex and the
browser treated that text as a link fine
now what we have to do is to add an
image in place of that text so we'll
simply Nest the image tag here what
we'll do is we'll write here inside the
anchor tag inside the body of anchor tag
basically so we'll write here image so
this is our tag now we have to add an
image over here fine so let's say we are
writing over here SRC now we have this
image present inside the image folder so
let's use one image from this and we
have to write here alt alt is going to
be HTML for this that's it we have used
the image over here save the program and
you can see we have an image over here
on the browser the size is quite large
right so let's fix it first so what
we'll do is we'll use the height and the
width attribute within the image T so
we'll write here height height is going
to be 200 pixel
then we have the width as well width is
again going to be 200 pixel save the
program and here you can see the image
size is fine now if we click anywhere on
the image then the homepage of chrome
will open because the image is attached
to that link only we have written over
here
www.google.com fine so it will take us
to the homepage of Google search engine
click on the image and you can see it
takes us to the homepage of Google so
attaching a link to an image is shortly
one of the easiest task to perform in
HTML we have used an absolute URL over
here in this particular image we can
also use a relative reference the syntax
will remain the same so let's do that as
well what we'll do is we'll write over
here inside the body tag again we'll use
another image so let's use the break tag
over here then we'll write here a href
href is is going to be a relative
reference so let's say we have this
about. HTML file in a system so let's
use it for now so we'll write here
about.
HTML then we'll Nest the image tag
inside here so we'll write here
IMG now we have to close this tag we'll
write here SRC SRC is going to be inside
the images folder again we are going to
use css.png
we'll write here alt alt is going to be
CSS then we
have height height is going to be 200
pixel and width width is again going to
be 200 Pi the same thing we did with
this image as well save the program and
you can see we have another image over
here which ISS CSS 3 and we have used a
relative reference or we can say a
relative URL over here for this image so
this image will take us to about. HTML
we can do many such tasks using images
in HTML so let's click on the image
first you can see the image over here
click on it and you can see we are in
the about us page right it says Welcome
to our YouTube channel so this is how we
can use images within anchor tag in HTML
the attributes for both the tags Remains
the Same we can still use the target
attribute within the anchor tag for the
new web page to open either in the same
window or in a new one so I hope you
guys must have understood by now adding
an image and attaching a link to it is
quite easy I want you guys to give it a
try and learn something new out of it
what is an HTML class an HTML class
attribute is used to specify a single or
multiple class names for an HTML element
the class name can be used by CSS and
JavaScript to do some tasks for HTML
elements you can also use this class in
the CSS with a specific class with a
priod character followed by the name of
the class for selecting
elements so let's jump onto to the demo
to understand the classes and ID better
so we are on our Sublime Text trator
let's add the standard boiler plate of
HTML we'll give the title as
classes and ID in
HTML let's start with a basic
example we'll see how to define an HTML
class so inside the body tag we'll add
one
H1 and we'll give this a class name
of head
one we'll add some text here this is the
heading
one
now you can copy this part because we'll
need it in our F the
lines so for the
H2 this will be the heading
two for
H3 this will be heading
three and let's add one more
H4 this is the heading
four so as you can see we have used the
same class name in all our H1 H2 H3 and
H4 so if you save the file and go to the
page and
refresh you'll see the headings are
there on the page this is the heading
one heading two heading three and
heading
four now let's learn how we can use this
class name for our styling
purpose so we'll open the style tag
here and you will mention the class Name
by period followed by the class name so
head
one open the
parenthesis and let's set the color
to
lightan and we'll set the font family to
set to it
cursive keep the background color to
Black
okay so you can see we have mentioned
the class name do head head one for our
styling purposes and we have given the
color font family and background color
for it so just save the file and go
back
refresh now you can see we have designed
this H1 H2 H3 and H4 using a class
tag now let's use another example with a
different class name
so here only we'll make the changes
let's name this class as H2 this H3 and
let it be
H4
now you can style them separately for
the head
to we can set the
color to say light pink and we can set
the font background color
to Red okay
now similarly for the
H3
dot head three uh set the color
[Music]
to I don't know what color this is let's
say
Pisa and set the background color to
let's say
blue okay save the file and go back to
the
page
now you can see we have designed our H1
H2 H3 and H4 using the different class
name this is the example of using the
multiple classes on the same
code one thing you should note that
these class name must be separated by
the
space there are a few points you should
know while working with the class so the
first one will the class attribute can
be used on any HTML element like any
HTML element can have a class name the
second point will be the class name is a
case sensitive head
one and if we change here to
say we'll keep this H as cap capital so
this will be wrong the style won't be
implemented on the page now if you
refresh you can see the style is not
implemented so the class names are case
sensitive let's change this
back
refresh and now you can see our design
is
back so this was all about HTML classes
now let's move on to the ID
attribute so the HTML ID attribute is
used to specify the unique ID for an
element of the HTML
document it allocates the unique
identifier which is used by the CSS and
the JavaScript for performing certain
tasks in cascading stylesheet that is
CSS we mention an element with a
specific ID by using the hash symbol
followed by the ID so let's work on an
example to understand this
better so we'll use the same previous
example we'll mention the H1 and this
time we'll use the ID so ID and we'll
name it as head one
this is the first
heading for H2 also we'll mention the ID
name as head one
only head
one this is
the second
heading now to style The Heading we'll
go back here we'll open the style
tag and we'll use the hash symbol to
mention the ID so
hash head one open the
parenthesis we'll set the color
to light green we'll set the font family
to
cursive and we'll set the background
color to
Black okay now save the file and go back
and refresh
so you can see this works in a similar
manner to the class apart from it that
we use the hash symbol to mention the ID
name so now let's change the example and
use the different ID names for different
H funds so this can be H1 this can be
H2 let's add one more uh we'll name it
as
ID head
three okay so we'll style the head
two we'll set the color to
Red for head
three
we'll set the color to
Yellow let's use green yellow okay save
the file go back and
refresh now you can see we have the
different style for different IDs so in
this way you can use the different IDs

areas of Interest CSS stands for
cascading stylesheet it is a rule based
language used to describe the formatting
and looks of a web page CSS stands one
among the top three basic languages
required for frontend web development
there are three languages which are HTML
CSS and JavaScript HTML as we all know
is used to create the layout or
structure of a web page while CSS is
used to format that web page it means to
make changes in the style of elements of
a web page JavaScript on the other hand
is used to make a web page more
responsive to a user all three languages
together are used for basic frontend web
development let's not go deep into that
and we'll now go through the different
ways of adding a CSS file to a web page
we can use CSS in three ways in a HT ml
document external stylesheet define
stylesheet rule in a separate CSS file
the CSS files extension is going to be
CSS and then we can include that file in
a HTML document using the link tag
another method we have is the internal
stylesheet Define stylesheet rules in
the header section of the HTML document
using style tag another one we have is
inline style sheet in this method we
redefine style sheet rule directly along
with the HTML elements using the style
attribute remember the difference in
internal stylesheet we use style tag and
in inline stylesheet we use style as an
attribute so let's go through each of
them practically you guys will
understand it much
better we'll use an external CSS file
first we'll attach it to a HTML document
for that let's write something over here
on the web page first so that we can
then style that particular element so
what we'll do is we'll move to the body
of a HTML document and we'll use a div
tag over here so we'll write here div
and inside this let's write something
over here so let's say we are writing
over
here styling
using external CSS file or we can say
styling using external
stylesheet so this is a basic example of
creating a division save the program and
you can see here we have some text
present over here right the next thing
we'll do is we'll attach a CSS file to
this HTML document using a link tag then
we'll style this div tag in that file on
so let's do one thing first we'll create
a CSS file first so we'll go to this
section We'll add a file and let's name
it as style. CSS CSS is the extension
for external CSS files remember this
guys press enter and you can see we have
another stylesheet present over here so
this is empty for now we just created
this style sheet now let's move back to
the HTML file for now now what we'll do
is we'll link this stylesheet to a HTML
document for that the task is simple we
use the link tag so we'll move to the
Head section of a HTML document and
we'll write here link fine so after link
what we'll do is we'll write here Rel
and Rel is going to be stylesheet then
we
have type so this defines the type of a
document so we'll write here text SL CSS
and then we finally write here hre and a
sheet name is style. CSS fine so we'll
write here style. CSS close it now the
real attribute here signifies the
relationship between these two documents
which means the HTML document and the
CSS document
fine the type is CSS and the HF refers
to the source of a CSS file save the
program and you can see nothing happened
over here on the browser now what we'll
do is we'll style this D tag in the
external CSS file we just created so
let's move on to the CSS file and what
we'll do here is we'll write over here
so we are going to style a div tag fine
so for now we'll write over here dip
this is the Syntax for styling any HTML
element fine so let's style it so let's
say we are writing over here background
color as blue fine save it now and you
can see the background color is change
to
Blue next thing let's change the font
color as well so let's say we are
writing over
here antique white as font color save it
now you can see the font color is also
Chang
let's add some more CSS properties so
let's say we are writing over here font
weight so font weight is going to be
bolder then we have let's say font style
so font style we are going to write here
italic fine save the program and you can
see the text is bolder and italic in
nature fine next thing let's add a
border as well so we'll write your
border border is also a CSS property so
we'll write over over here 3 pixel this
is the thickness of a bot then we'll
write here solid this is the nature of a
bot and let's say we are writing over
here the color name so silver is going
to be the color name save it now and you
can see this div tag or division we can
say now has a silver border with some
background color and font color as well
the last thing we are going to write
here is text align we are going to align
this text at the center of a division
save it now and you can see the text
present at the center of word division
fine you can see the change over here on
the browser we created the layout here
with HTML and then we styled our div tag
using CSS we can style any HTML tag here
either with the help of tag name or the
ID and class attribute fine the second
way of styling an HTML tag is with the
help of inline CSS this method is used
to apply a unique style to a single HTML
element
for inline CSS what we need to do is we
need to move to the HTML file first and
here what we are going to do is we are
going to create another division now
fine we don't need any special tag or
external CSS file for inline CSS or we
can say inline style sheet so what we'll
do is we'll write over here let's use
The Brak tag first to make it look more
tidy so we'll use Break Tag twice and
then we'll write here div fine so this
is going to be another Division and we
are going to write here P so let's write
here
styling a
document
using inline CSS fine save it now and
you can see this division has the same
styling as the previous one this is
because we have used the tag name over
here inside this style. CSS and both the
tag name names are same both have div
tags right so what we'll do is we'll
remove this line for now now save it and
you can see both of them don't have any
style right now fine so what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here again now we are going to style it
with the help of inline CSS for that we
need the style attribute so we'll write
Here style then we are going to define
the background color as let's say Aqua
then we have so let's make it tidy so
we'll apply the font color as well so
let's say the font color is going to be
black for this one then we
have let's say font style font style is
going to be
italic and then we have font weight font
weight is again going to be bolder we
have discussed all these properties in
the external CSS part as well so let's
mention all of them here so we are going
to use the B as 3 pixel again let's say
dashed for now so we'll write here
dashed and then we'll write
here the color name so let's say the
color name is
gold and we have the Border as well so
at the end we'll write here text align
at the
center fine so the style attribute plays
a significant role in this type of
styling and you can see it over here on
the browser the moment we save we have
another division over here so you can
see it over here this division has Dash
border which is also three pixel thing
and it looks different from the previous
one right so let's mention the link over
here as well again so we'll write here
link re is going to
be
stylesheet type is going to be
text/css and then we have href href is
going to be style. CSS and close it save
it now and you can see the difference
between both the divisions right the
first one uses the external CSS file and
the second one uses the inline style
sheet okay the output is almost the same
as the previous one apart from the
colors and all so inline CSS is easy to
use but it can make an HTML document
look more confusing and we need to style
each element separately if we use this
method to apply a style to an HTML
document it doesn't matter if we want to
apply similar styling to more than one
element inline CSS can be tricky and
lengthy in such task moving ahead let's
talk about the last method we are left
with for the HTML stylesheet the
internal method so it uses a style tag
inside the head section of a HTML
document so for that what we are going
to do is we are going to remove both
these divisions save it now and we are
going to remove this link as well we are
going to remove the link for a external
stylesheet as well save it now now and
you can see we have nothing over here on
the browser so what we are going to do
is we are going to create another
division now inside this we are going to
use a paragraph so let's say we are
writing over here styling a
document
using
internal fine save it now and you can
see we have a paragraph over here
nothing else now this method is used to
Style Elements of a single web page we
can apply the same styling to a bunch of
elements simultaneously with the help of
internal CSS the task is simple so let's
do one thing let's create another
division over here so we are going to
create it after the Break Tag
and let's paste it here and let's write
something over here as well so let's add
Here style sheet two and you can see we
have two paragraphs now these two are in
different divisions so what we are going
to do is we are going to style both the
divisions at the same time or
simultaneously we can say so for that
what we are going to do is we are going
to move to the Head section of our HTML
document and we are going to use the
style tag so style can be used as a tag
or as an attribute as well if we are
using inline CSS then we are going to
use style as an attribute and if we are
going to use internal CSS then we are
going to use style as a tag fine so
let's write it over here so we have a
div tag now what we'll do is we'll style
both of them so we are going to write a
background color
as let's say red for both of them then
we have color which refers to the font
color so let's say we have the font
color as black again then we have font
weight font weight is going to be bolder
then we have font style font style is
going to be italic save it now and you
can see the difference in the browser
both the div tags have same styling as
of now now the next thing we are going
to write here is border fine so we are
going to write your border let's make it
five pixels this time we are going to
write your solid again and let's change
the Border color
to let's say we have yellow fine so
we'll write here yellow save it now and
you can see the Border color is yellow
now so the last property we are left it
is text align we are going to align it
at the center save it now and you can
see the difference on increasing the
browser size you can see the difference
the text is aligned at the center of
both the divisions
fine this method is also good to use if
you want to style any particular web
page only I hope you guys must have
understood all the three methods of
using CSS by now the question that
arises now is which method we should use
to keep the whole document need neat and
clean the answer to this question is
external CSS this is because external
CSS allows us to style multiple document
at once it keeps our HTML document clean
and less prone to error as well so I
want you guys to use all the methods and
then let us know in the comments which
method you like the most or which method
you are more comfortable working with
JavaScript is a lightweight scripting
language used to make a web page more
interactive and livelier to the the user
it is one of the most popular scripting
languages present in world today it's
almost impossible to cover the whole of
JavaScript in one small video because
JavaScript in itself is an interesting
topic in this video we'll go through the
ways to attach JavaScript with HTML and
some basic examples of what this
language can do so to include JavaScript
in an HTML document we can either keep
the JavaScript code in a separate file
and then include it wherever ever it's
needed or we can just Define functions
inside the HTML document itself using
the script tag let's go through both the
cases one by one firstly we'll create an
external Javascript file the benefit of
using an external Javascript file is if
we are going to define a functionality
which will be used in various HTML
documents then it's better to keep that
functionality in a separate Javascript
file and then include that file in your
HTML doc documents it will help us keep
the HTML document neat and organized as
well so a Javascript file always has ajs
extension and the script tag is used to
attach a Javascript file to an HTML
document let's move on to the
programming part directly and then we'll
see what we can do with JavaScript let's
create a Javascript file first so we'll
go here and we'll click on create a file
now we'll create a file let's say the
file name is going to be be new.
jsjs is the extension here and we have
the JavaScript file
now now it's time to attach the
Javascript file to our HTML document
we'll use the script tag after the body
so what we'll do is we'll move here and
we'll write
here script now inside the script tag we
need two attributes first one is going
to be SRC SRC is going to be new. JS as
this file is saved in that same folder
the next attribute we need is type so
we'll write here type type is going to
be text SL
JavaScript fine so SRC here defines the
part where a file is actually saved and
type defines the type of file that is
Javascript in this case so we are done
with attaching the file now let's move
on and make a web page a bit interactive
to the user fine we can write small fun
functions known as event handlers and
then trigger them using HTML only adding
responsiveness to a web page means
defining an event that will tell the
system to perform a specific action upon
calling sounds a bit confusing right so
let's understand it with the help of an
example we are all aware of adding
buttons to a web page right so if the
user clicks on a button then what should
happen we can either create a popup
alert on the button click or we can do
whatever we want
so let's create a button here first and
we'll then add functionality to it fine
so here we are in a HTML document we'll
create a button over here so we'll write
over here button and let's say the
button name is going to be external for
external F save it now and you can see
we have a button over here on the
browser fine now click on it and you can
see nothing is happening as of now so
let's add some functionality to this
button now now for that what we'll do is
we'll write here inside the button tag
we'll Define an event first so let's say
we are writing over here on click and
we'll call a function on button click
fine so let's say a function name is
going to
be
message and save it now fine what we are
doing here is we are asking the system
to call the message function on clicking
this particular button let's define this
message function in a JavaScript file
now so here we are in a JavaScript file
now we need to create a function named
message fine so we'll write here
function message and this is the Syntax
for creating a function in JavaScript
now we'll write over here alert inside
alert we'll write
button click fine so here we have this
message over here now this alert is a
method present in JavaScript for
creating popups save the program and now
click on the button over here you can
see we have a popup here which says
button click you can see the message
right over here now the number of such
things we can do with JavaScript is
uncountable let's move ahead and we'll
see another method of using JavaScript
with HTML the internal script method we
can use for this this method is useful
if we want to use JavaScript for a
particular file or a particular tag we
can write a script code directly into a
HTML document usually we keep the script
code in the header section of the
document using the script tag otherwise
there's no such restriction and we can
put a source code anywhere in the
document but inside the script tag so
we'll move back to our HTML file and
we'll create another button over here
this time we'll use the internal script
tag to add functionality to it fine so
we'll move to the body section and here
we are going to create a button so we'll
use the break tag
first again A Break Tag now we are going
to create a
button then the button name is going to
be internal save it and you can see we
have this internal button over here as
well click on external and you can see
we are getting a message click on
internal you can see nothing is
happening as of now now to add
functionality to this button we need to
add an event first so we move inside the
button tag and we'll write here on let's
say mouse over so this is another event
we have in JavaScript we'll see what
this event can do in a while so we'll
write over here the function name so
let's say the function name is going to
be internal for this particular button
save it now and now what we are going to
do is we are going to define the
JavaScript part fine we'll move to the
Head section of HTM L document and we'll
write here script the script tag will
remain the same in both the cases here
you can see we have defined the SRC and
type but here what we are doing is we
are using it internally so we'll create
the function over here only so we'll
write over here
function internal and this is going to
be the body of this function and we'll
write something over here inside the
alert box so let's say we are writing
over
here enter internal script tag
fine save this program and move back to
the browser now you can see the moment
we take a mouse cursor over this
internal button a popup will appear with
the message internal script tag you can
see the message over here fine this is
because of the on Mouse over event we
used so guys we went through both the
methods of adding JavaScript to an HTML
document I hope you guys got it although
JavaScript is a very long topic to
discuss it is a language and if you want
to learn it then you can go through our
Channel and find the JavaScript playlist
here before we move on and start
creating the layout of any web page
let's discuss what a layout is a layout
refers to the arrangement of things in
HTML a layout refers to the arrangement
of elements in a way to make the web
page look more neat and clean to the
user creating a layout also allows us to
manage the content present on our web
page more effectively and efficiently
you can think of it right a well planned
website is easier to manage and edit if
we have an idea about all the sections
present on a web page we have used the
header and footer tags before along with
some more tags like nav and section to
create the layout of a web page this
time we are going to use the table tag
to create a layout and then we'll use
the div and span tags as well for the
same so we are going to use two
different methods for creating the
layout of a web page we'll use a bit of
CSS as well to differentiate between the
different sections of the web page so
let's move on to the programming part
directly and we'll create a first layout
a question May pop up in your mind why
are we using tables for creating the
layout it is because tables are already
arranged in columns and rows so we can
utilize these rows and columns in in
whatever way we like so let's understand
it with the help of an example now if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know
more so what we'll do is we'll move to
the body tag of a HTML document directly
we'll remove this H1 tag from here and
now we'll write here table so we are
going to use the table tag first now
let's style this table a bit we'll write
over here width width is going to be
let's say
100 and then will Define the Border as
zero fine so we have used these two CSS
properties for this table tag here now
close the table tag and you can see we
have the whole table element here now
inside table tag we need the table row
fine TR tag we can say so we'll write
here TR now inside TR we need the table
data tag to mention the data inside the
table so what we'll do here is we'll
again style this table data column or we
can set table data tag so we'll write
call span call span is going to be two
and then we'll write style fine we are
going to style the background color over
here so let's say the background color
for this is going to
be green fine so let's use green yellow
instead of green
and now inside the table data we need to
mention a heading so we'll write over
here
H1 and inside this we'll
write this is
the title of
a
web page fine now save this and you can
see over here we have this division or
we can say block with the heading this
is the title of a web page so if I
increase the size of a browser you can
see this is the title of a web page we
have this over here
fine now what we are going to do is we
are going to come out of this table data
and table row tag because we are going
to use another table row tag for another
section of the web page so we are going
to write here
TR now now close this TR tag let's style
this as well so we'll write here V
align and we are going to align it to
the top fine save it now now we have
another table row so we'll write over
here table data again so we'll write
here table
data now inside table data we need to
style this table data tag so we'll write
over here
style and
we'll write width again so width is
going to be 100% for this and then we'll
write over here background color so
background color
is going to
be let's say Aqua let's change this
background color a bit from here you
know we can do it in visual code so
let's change it to this the RGB value
will change for this background color
now we have to close the table data tag
as well so the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to put the content
inside this so we'll write over here
inside
the Bol Tech so we'll mention B over
here let's say this is going to be the
main
menu so we have this bold over here now
we are going to use the break tag again
so we'll write over here this save it
now and you can see we have this main
menu present over here fine so you can
see now let's do one thing what we are
going to do is we are going to mention
here 100% the width and save it now
let's see if this makes a change and you
can see now both the divisions have full
width of the web page fine so the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to do
HTML and then of course we are going to
put a break over
here then we'll write here CSS again a
break we
need then we'll write
here python let's write each of them in
capital letters so BR again for this as
well then we'll write
here
JavaScript BR again so this is basically
the content of a web page save it now
and you can see we have this main menu
present over here fine now we are done
with this table data tag as well so
let's move on and we'll create another
table data tag inside this same table
row so what we are going to do is we are
going to cut this section in two
different parts the left part is for the
main menu and the right part is for the
other things fine so let's Zoom it out
again and we are going to use the table
data tag here here
again
so we have this stable data tag and now
what we are going to do is we are going
to style it we are going to write here
inside the style so let's say background
color we are going to mention so let's
mention any color over here we'll write
here purple and then we'll change the
color from here let's make it light
purple and save it you can see nothing
is happening over here on the Brower or
you can see this purple color over here
it's smaller in size as of now right so
let's do one thing mention the height
and width as well for this particular
block so we are going to write here
after
this width is going to
be 100
pixels and then we'll write
here height as well height is again
going to be let's say 200 pixels fine
for this box and we are done with it so
let's mention over here something so
let's say we are writing over
here
tutorials present in the website fine
all these thing refers to the content we
have in our website so save it now so
you can see we have two sections present
over here in a website for this
particular section we have the main menu
section and then we have the tutorial
section as well so now let's do one
thing let's move back here again and now
what we are going to do is we are going
to add another table Row for the footer
section for the bottommost section of a
web page so we are going to write here
DD again then we need call span call
span is going to be two again then we'll
write here Style Style we'll mention the
background color background color is is
going to be let's say red this time
let's change the color a bit because we
want light colors so let's use this
color over here and you can see it over
here it's not completely visible but it
is here so let's do one thing let's
mention something inside this box as
well now what we are going to do is we
are going to write
here this and now inside this table data
we are going to use a paragraph tag so
inside the paragraph tag let's write
something so let's write copyright
because this is always mentioned over
here so let's say we are writing over
copyright a b c d save it now and here
you can see we have copyright written
over here let's put it in the center for
that we need to move back to this style
attribute and we have to write
here text align at this Center save it
now and you can see the text is aligned
at at the center now you can see the
layout of this web page we designed this
layout using the table tag and we have
all the T tags present within the table
tag we have the table row table data tag
and we have the table tag as well so
this is the complete layout of a web
page fine let's move ahead and we'll
create another layout this time we'll
use the div and span tag for creating
the layout we'll create a new file for
that layout we'll create a file so we'll
move here and we'll write here out to.
HTML save it now and you can see we have
another file over here fine
let's do this and we have the HTML code
over here the basic HTML code now we'll
move to the body section
directly and what we'll do is we are
going to use the div tag and the span
tag for creating a layout F so let's
open it with live server once and here
you can see we have this document so
let's write the code now so we'll use
the div tag for creating divisions so
we'll write here div style is going to
be the width width is going to be 100%
fine so let's write over here 100% now
this is the main division fine so we are
going to create the layout inside this
particular division only so we'll use
another div tag inside this particular
div tag we'll write here
div Style style is going to
be the background color we have to set
so we'll write here
background color so background color is
going to
be let's a blue violet let's change the
color from
here save it now and you can see nothing
is happening as of
now so the next thing we are going to do
is we are going to mention the width
over here as well it will take the 100%
width of
whole div tag so we'll write here
100% and we'll close this div tag fine
so we have this D tag now we have to
mention our content inside this div tag
so we'll use the H1 tag again and we'll
write here this is
the title of
a web page
fine so we have this save it now and you
can see we have this division present
over here it says this is the title of
our web page and you can see we have
this
whole section present over here which
basically refers to the navigation bar
of any website so this is the layout
first now what we need to do is we are
going to create the whole layout so we
need different sections right so we are
going to use the div tag again for
creating another section present in a
web page so we'll write here div now
inside this div what we are going to do
is we are going to to use style first so
we need to mention the background color
again so the background color is let's
say this this is the gray color and then
we'll write here height of
this section so height is we are going
to write here
200 pixels then we have width as well so
we'll write here width width is going to
be 100 pixels
fine
and we'll write here float as well float
is going to be
left now let's mention the data inside
this so that you guys will be able to
see it now what we'll do is we'll create
another division inside this
Division and we'll write here
in block letters or we can say Bard
letters
main menu fine we did the same thing in
the previous layout as well now after
this we'll write here all the languages
we have so we'll write here
HTML then we'll put a Break Tag over
here then we have
CSS then we'll put a Break Tag again
here then we have python so we'll write
here break again and then we
have JavaScript
fine so we have this div tag over here
it's almost done now save the program
and you can see float left means the
whole division will float at the left
side of the whole web page so it's
basically we are taking the division and
we are putting it in the left hand side
of a web page if we write your float as
right the whole division will move to
the right hand side of the web page you
can see it over here it's on the left
hand side we can also put it at the
right hand side as well
so let's create another section now so
for that what we are going to do is we
are going to use another div tag so
we'll write
here div now we need background color
height width and Float properties again
fine so basically what we are going to
do is we are going to copy it from
here we are going to paste it here close
the div tag and that's it fine now what
we are going to do is we are going to
mention something inside here so let's
take the text from the first layout we
have so let's write tutorials present in
the website here copy it from here paste
it
here and that's it fine let's put it
inside the paragraph TCH so that it's
not confusing for you
guys save it now and here you can see we
have tutorials present in the website
present over here fine so before we move
ahead let's change the style of this
particular section so for that what we
are going to do is we are going to
change the height and width so height
will remain 200 pixel but the width we
are going to change let's keep it 350
pixels save it now and you can see it
over here
fine so you can see we have this whole
section present over here so we have put
a main menu at the left hand side then
we have tutorials at the center and then
we can keep something at the right hand
site as well so let's do one thing let's
move here and we will create another
section now so what we are going to do
is we are going to copy this div tag
from here we are going to paste it
here again now we are going to change
some style so this time we are going to
write your float
as
right
fine then we'll change the width and
height as well width is going to be 100
pixel and height is is going to be 200
pixels save it now and let's see the
change over here you can see we have
this layout or we can see say this
section present over
here and I guess it looks fine now at
175% we can also use this space as well
fine so let's do one
thing let's create the bottom side of
this layout first and then we'll discuss
what we can do fine so here we are we
need another div tag now for the bottom
side or we can say for the fooo section
so we'll write here div Style style is
going to be again the background color
we are going to mention so we'll write
here background
[Music]
color background color is going to be
let's
say blue blue is good and then we'll
write here clear clear is going to be
both and then we'll write here textt
align text align at the center for
aligning the text to the center of a
division now inside this we are going to
use the paragraph tag again and we are
going to write
here copyright a b c d save it now and
move back to the browser you can see
it's present over
here now you can see many things are
wrong in this particular layout so how
we can correct them what we can do is we
we can increase the size according to
our needs so let's increase the size of
these sections a bit and we'll see if it
works or not so let's change the color
for this section first let's make it red
and now we are going to change the width
of this
particular section save it
now and you can see it's greater and
width so it went down now what we need
to do is we need to remove the width by
bit so let's write here 350
pixels save it now let's see and it's a
bit
more again and now we'll write here 300
let's see if it's working and you can
see it works fine now it looks fine now
right so what we can do is we can change
the width of each section according to
our needs that's how we can create the
layout of a web page so guys here we
have seen two different methods of doing
the same thing we created two layouts
one with the table tag and the other
with the div and span tag in my opinion
the letter method we went through is a
bit simpler because the only thing we
need to keep in mind while working with
the div and span tag is the area fine we
need to keep the width and height of any
division in mind if we are clear with
that then we can create the layout very
easily so that's why we prefer the
letter a method to create layouts for a
web page responsiveness of a web page
May refer to different scenarios let's
go through the meaning of responsiveness
first in web designing adding
responsiveness has two different
meanings one is done with the help of
JavaScript whenever we go through a
website and we see something happens on
a button click it refers to
responsiveness as well we use events for
it right let's suppose we go through an
e-commerce website and try to purchase a
product whenever we click on the buy now
button something happens right it either
takes us to a different web page or
opens any kind of popup regarding the
scene this phenomena is called the
responsiveness of a web page and we use
JavaScript for that this was for your
reference that if someone says
responsiveness then you should not get
confused we are not going to discuss it
in today's video responsiveness in HTML
means creating a layout in such a way
way that it will be adjusted
automatically to different screen sizes
and view ports let's take an example
here to make it easier for you guys
let's say we have a website opened on a
desktop what we want to do is we want to
open the same website on a mobile device
as well but at the same time we want all
the content to adjust automatically
according to the Mobile screen in that
case we need to design a website in such
a way that it automatically adjusts
itself to such devices we can achieve
this task using two different methods we
can use CSS media queries or we can do
it with the help of HTML and basic CSS
as well we'll be discussing the later
method in this video which is the HTML
method and in the upcoming video we'll
discuss media queries as well so don't
worry about it guys let's move on and
start using HTML to make the content of
a web page responsive to different
device screens if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scaleup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more for reference
let's add an image to our browser first
so what we'll do is we'll move to the
body section of a HTML document and
we'll write here IMG so we are going to
add an image over here so let's write
here Source the image is present inside
the images folder and let say we are
using space.png now we need the alt
attribute as well so let's say we are
writing over here alt and space fine now
save the program and you can see here
that we have an image present on the
browser the image size is larger here
right let me zoom in a bit for you so
you can see this is a image so you can
see the size is quite big according to a
brows now we want this image to adjust
itself accordingly if we reduce use the
size of a window for this we need to
make some changes to this picture so
what we'll do is We'll add a class here
first so let's say we are using class
as responsive fine so here we have our
class now we'll make certain style
changes in this image so we'll use the
style tag now inside it we are going to
access our image so we have a class as
responsive and inside here we'll
write width width is going to be
100% and let's say the height height is
going to be Auto fine save the program
and you can see here the image adjusts
itself according to a window size so if
we increase the size of our browser you
can see this whole image over here the
width of this image is 100% of the
screen and the height is automatic fine
now the moment we decrease the size of
this window or or we can say if we
increase the size the image is adjusting
itself accordingly right on increasing
or decreasing the size of a window the
image is adjusting fine we don't need
anything else to make it look more
responsive fine another thing we can do
here is we can use the max width and
minwidth properties to make an image
responsive to the window so what we can
do here is we can write here inside
this m width M width we are going to
write here as 500
pixels and we are going to Define Max
width here as well Max width is going to
be let's say 1,000 pixel save the
program now and you can see the image
size is 1,000 pixel over here go to
inspect element and here you can see if
you take your cursor over here on the
image source button you can see the
rendered size is 1,000 into 469 pixels
now try decreasing the size of this
image so you can see it over here we
have this size of our window now take
your cursor over here you can see the
rendered size is 719 pixels now decrease
the size completely now you can see the
rendered size is 500 pixels the image is
not going below 500 pixels in this case
fine it means that the image will adjust
itself down to 500 pixels only fine now
let's write here 400 pixels for your eff
save the program now decrease the size
of this window so it's at the lowest and
take your cursor over here you can see
the rendered size is 423 pixels it can't
go below that because this is the
maximum size we can go with a browser
window fine so this is how we can make
an image responsive to the Windows
screen using HTML and basic CSS we are
not using any advanced CSS for making an
image responsive as of now I hope you
guys got it so in this video we are
going to create something like this this
is the content box with the icon and the
description of the content
box icons here used is from the font
awesome CDN so let's start
creating so I have my two files open
which is HTML and CSS let's add the
standard boiler
plate We'll add the
content
boxes in
HTML as the
title let's link our CSS
file now inside the body let's add a div
class
container inside the dis class container
I'll create another div
box I will require three such boxes so
we'll copy paste this three
times on the style sheet
let's set the margin to zero and padding
also to
zero we'll set the font
family
to S
SF now for the container
class we'll set the position to
relative and we'll set the width to 1200
pixels which is the whole width of the
content box
we'll set the height to 300
pixels and we'll set the
margin to 240 pixels and
Auto for the boxes inside the
container we'll add the
position
relative and we'll set the width to
let me explain you what this
is this CSS C function is used to
perform a calculation to be used as the
property
value this is specifically used for the
width of the div
classes it requires a mathematical
expression the result will be used as a
value
so we'll be using lot of this Cal
function here in this
code we'll set the height
to 300 pixels minus 30
pixels one property of C function is
that it takes single expression as its
parameter the expression can be any
simple expression combining the
following operators plus sub that is
addition minus that is subtraction
multiplication and division
we'll set the background to Hash
0000 we'll set it to float
left and we'll specify the margin to 15
pixels uh we'll set the Box sizing to
border
box overflow will be
hidden and Border
radius let's set it to 10 pixels say
just save the file and let's go back to
the page to see how it currently
looks so you can see our boxes are in
the proper places we have the background
black with the proper margin between
them okay so we have the structure let's
code
more now we need the icon for that we'll
require icon from the font awesome CDM
so we'll add the font awesome CDM to our
page so we'll search font aome CDN
4.7.0 we are using the older version
because it is more
stable so go to this font awesome
libraries here select the version and
copy the link
tag go back to the page and add it here
delete this Integrity
part now here inside this class
box add one div which will be named
class
icon and inside here we'll add the link
of the icon so search
here font or some icon 4.
7 go to the first
one here you can search the any icon you
want uh let me search
for
say information so I'll go to the
information and I'll copy
this go back to the code and add it
here
now inside this I'll create another div
which will be for used for Content so
we'll name it class
content and inside this I'll add one
H3
info and inside it I'll add some
text uh copy this much from
here to
here now delete this whole
part and put it
inside P tag so inside the P
tag add them
yeah so let's go back to the file and
see how it looks right now
okay so you cannot see the icon here
because it is black let's try to change
the color here so that you can see the
icon so let's set it to
ff0 okay so you can see I have the icon
in place this is and this is the text
that we have added to this content box
now let's style this content box
first set it back to 0
now container
dobox do
icon we'll set the position to
Absolute we'll set the top to
Z left to
zero and we'll set the width to
100% we'll set the height also to
100% background will be HH
f00 and we'll set the
transition to 0.5
seconds and we'll keep the Z index as
one so that the icon will be
visible
okay
refresh yeah you can see the icon
here
okay now let's add the H effect on that
so container
dot box do
over
icon we'll set the top to 20
pixels we calculate the left
[Music]
to 50% minus 40
pixels withd 80
pixels height keep it to 80 pixels as
well and let's set the Border
radius
250% okay so now that we have repeat so
now that we have added the H effect
let's save and go back to the page now
let's design the icon so container
dot box do
icon
fa
also we set the position to
Absolute top will be
50% left
50% transform let's translate it
to minus
50%
-
50% and keep the font size
to 80
pixels
transition 5
seconds and we'll set the color
to save the file and let's go back to
the
page yeah so you can see our icon has
now bigger size and with the H effect it
shrinks for text to be visible
okay now we need to add the H effect to
the icon so that the font size
increases for that we'll add
container
box.
we'll keep the font size
to
4S
okay now it's time to design the content
inside the container box so we'll set
container do box
box do
content all the positions are
absolute we'll set the top to
100% so that when the icon shrinks the
whole text Will visible to the text box
we'll set the
height to we calculate
it
100%
- 100
pixels text align
Center uh keep the padding to 20 pixels
for proper
spacing box sizing as border
box transition to 0.5
seconds and we'll keep the opacity to
zero
okay save the file and let's go
back yeah now you can see the icons are
in the center of the shrinking
circle now let's add the H
effect
now when you set the opacity to one now
the
text okay we have not designed yet S3
and P so let's start designing it so
container do box
content
H3 and pixels keep the padding to
zero
color and let's keep the font size to 24
pixels now you'll see the text Will
visible inside the box so
refresh yeah
you can see this is the heading of our
this content box in four now similarly
let's style the paragraph tag so
container
dobox do
content
P margin will be
zero padding will be also
zero and color will be ffff as
usual
save yep we are almost there now we will
Design these two boxes with some spacing
and effects over
here now uh inside
this
delete them we'll copy paste the above
code
here
yeah so copy from here D CL
container
we'll change the icon classes here so
for this let's keep search s a r c h
instead of copying the class by going
back to the font CD you can directly add
the class search here if you know the
name of the
class and here we can
add
location so the class name for location
is map marker
save the file and let's go
back yeah now you can
see these things are here with the good
content box when you hold over this box
the this whole thing shrinks and you can
see the text
visible now add We'll add some Styles
we'll change the color and we'll add one
background here so that when this
shrinks the background color of the
black
changes okay so we'll go back to our
code
so to change the color of the box box
we'll add here do
container dot
box and we'll use the nth child property
so nth
child one go the first box do
icon so we'll keep it background
to
Pink okay and do container
box and
child one its color will be when it
shrinks let's keep it to
Orange
yeah so save the
file go back and
refresh okay so you can see we have the
icons in places and when you go click on
here so the H effect shrinks this and
this is the pink in color we have the
background orange with some text here
you can see smooth
transitions so this is all for the
content boxes in HTML you can use
different icons here using this font as
awesome icon uh there are several icons
here you can use any of them uh just
make sure that the padding and the text
are aligned in the proper places our IM
this L will look something like this we
have the back image and this images that
I have taken for example purpose we have
this radio buttons and we click on the
radio buttons we can go through our
images one by one also the images will
change automatically after some times as
you can see so let's see how we can
create this inage
Ider so here in the desktop I created an
well I have the required
images and HTML and CSS
file so first in the HTML style let's
add our radio
buttons so we'll create one
div and name d CL
slider inside this I'll create another
D which will be named as D class slid
inside this D flashl We'll add the radio
buttons so input the input type will be
radio and let's give this name radio
button and we'll tag them with ID radio
one
so as you can
see we'll need four buttons here so
we'll add four radio buttons
here so just copy paste this four
times here here is the ID to Radio 2
radio 3 and Radio 4 so we can disting
between the four radio
buttons so after the creating of R
butons we'll add our required images so
we'll create another div and name it
class slide
first inside this D I'll create an image
tag and specify the part of the
image in a similar manner we'll create a
four D tags for four
Images so just we'll do it swiftly
another D with class
name
slide inside this
image to. jpg
room
so just save the file and let's reck our
code we have the radio buttons we have
the images so let's just go back to our
file and see how it looks
so if we
refresh we'll see we have the four radio
buttons here and some disorted
images so let's just fix this images in
the
CSS so inside of CSS
file We'll add the body and we set the
margin to 0
[Music]
pixels p to
Z we'll set the height to say 100
vertical
height we'll set the display to
flex uh we'll justify the content to
Center we'll set the Align items to
Center and we'll set the background to
Black so
just refresh this
file so we still need to fix this
images so
just set the slider withd
to 800
pixels okay there's an error we'll set
this B not Windows
we set the height to 500
pixels we set the Border
radius 2 10
pixels and overflow will keep as
hidden
for the slce
part we'll set the width to
500% height to 500
pixels and display to
PL so let's save the file and see how it
looks on the
page
so yeah you can see the imag is now in a
proper size we have to cix this radio
button we have the background
black so let's fix this
in so for the slid
input okay before styling this let's add
some more HTML content
here
so after adding up the image we have to
create the automatic navigation button
and the manual navigation
button so after this
d add another
day the class
name navigation
Auto let's
see and inside this navigation Auto
we'll add
Dev
Class Auto button
one we need the four button so we'll
copy it four
times and this will be my button
two this will be button three and this
will be button
p
outside this D we'll create another D we
go for the manual navigation button so
we'll name
this
navigation make sure you spell it right
navigation
manual
and inside
this B we'll add our radio buttons which
manual
we'll name it class manual button m
m we need the four button so we'll copy
it four
times we change the label to radio to
radio three and radio
four so I I think this will work enough
so here we have the
navigation okay we have a spelling
mistake
here class and navigation a class
here so let's recheck our code
it's a good practice to reck your code
so that you don't encounter any error so
okay we have a d class slider
here and inside class sler we have the
four radio button Radio 1 2 3 4 we have
added our
images inside the div tags with the name
slide okay we have created a navigation
Auto the four buttons and navigation
manual are the four buttons okay so
let's save the file and go back and
refresh it and you see how it
looks okay we have to add some CSS
here so inside the
slides input we take the display to
none
the do slide will take
the BD to
20% and we set the transition to 2
seconds now
we'll add the for
image we set the WID to 800
pixels and we'll set the height to St
500
pixels okay so let's save the file and
let's go back to see how it looks right
now okay so you can see the images are
properly aligned here we have to style
our radio buttons for here so let's go
back to our
CSS now the code we going to write here
we for the manual slide navigation so
just add here comment manual slide
navigation so then repeat so that we
will remember the
code
so we'll add the
first class navigation
manual we'll set the position to
Absolute then set the withd to 800
pixels
we not have the height here we'll set
the margin so the margin top will beus
40 and display will keep it as
F and the justify
content will be
Center
so let's just here and go back to the
page you see how it looks right
now okay the images are in the center
you can see now you cannot see a radio
buttons just as now we have to add some
color to it so that the radio buttons
will be visible so go back to the
CSS
we'll add the manual
button we'll set the
border to say three
pixels solid and red you can take any
color you want we'll set the padding to
five
pixels uh we'll set the Border radius to
say 9
pixels we set the cursor to point
pointer so that when hold buttons the
cursor will look as a pointer and we'll
set the transition to 1
seconds
save go back and
refresh so now you can see the buttons
are here not properly spaced but yeah
they're here so let's add the spacing
and everything
else so we'll set the manual
button we set the
margin right to 40
pixels now it's time to add the hor
effect so for the
manual
button
the H will be um sa
background the
color
blue so just save the file and go back
and
refresh yeah so you can see our manual
buttons are in place when over over it
you can see the blue effect and when you
click nothing happens right now because
we don't have any JavaScript to response
to this dat button We'll add them in the
end first let's design these buttons so
this are for the manual
button now we'll add one code which will
be used when you want to select the
radio button by default so let's
understand how this videoo buttons work
in this file so the radi is a used where
two or more options are identified which
are mutually exclusive and the user has
to CH exactly one choice in other words
Tak on a non selected radio button will
erase any of the button that was
selected on the list
previously radio buttons include lower
cognitive load as they permanently keep
all the options visible such that users
can easily analyze them radi buttons are
also simpler to use for users who have
difficulty in making effective Mouse
movements so we'll add hash radio
check so the sign that we have added
here is no sing
combinator it combines two sequence of
simple selectors having the same parent
and the second must come immediately
after the
first so we'll add DOT first
and for this we set the margin
left to
zero okay so this will be Radio
One the label that we added in our
manual
buttons we'll need four
such buttons so we'll copy this four
times one 2 three and four
this will be my for radio button
two and we'll set the margin left here
to minus 20
pixels for radio button three we set it
to
say minus 40
pixels forget to
add and for the last button we'll set it
to minus 16
pixels so all this code was for the
manual navigation button now let's
design for automatic navigation
button so we'll open do
navigation we'll set the position to
Absolute we'll set the display to
Fat we'll set the width to 800
pixels let's just defy the content to
Center and set the margin
top to set
460s set
460
now so I add the sty to navigation Auto
D so navigation
Auto de
then set the
Border do same B that we have used
here sh solid
red make sure you keep this three pixel
solid R in same in both the navigation
Auto and navigation manual because if
you change the color here you will see
the two manual buttons there so for this
example let's change this to
Green so when you save and go back and
refresh
yeah you can see the two buttons here
this is green and this is red so if
there are two colors the both the
buttons will will not look good so we'll
just keep it here
red we'll set the pad in five
pixels we'll set the Border radius to 9
pixels and we'll set the transition to 1
seconds
now same code AS here which I added for
checking of the radio buttons so we'll
just copy this whole
code
and paste it here I'll have to TW some
things
here so the class was navigation. Auto
so we add
here navigation
Auto do Buton
one
we set here some
background so we'll delete this
code
um background let's
say any color
pink
copy this code contr
C delete this whole thing contr V and
just change the radio button there this
will be radio button
two this will be
three and tell be
four now we have all the designing in
place now we have all the designing in
place let's go back to the code and
refresh so now you'll see everything is
in place the background is black the
images is perfectly aligned we have this
button so let's
click so when you click you see the
images slides this is the fourth image
third second
and first so your beautiful image slider
is ready all that now is left is to add
the JavaScript code put this image SL to
function in automatic manner so now
we'll go back to this HTML
file and below this div
tag we'll open one script
tag and inside this scrip
tag we'll create
one variable named
counter let set it to
one open we create one function set
interval
for
so what this part specifically does is
we have created one variable named
counter and it will check against the ID
that we have created at Radio then the
radio button is checked and it
encounters the counter will be Plus+
that counter will increase by one so
after the counter has reached to
four so it will get back to the starting
point that is one so the whole point of
this code is to make the images slide in
in a loop so just
save and go back now when you
refresh you see the images will move
after
sometimes 2
seconds now when the images reach the
last page it go back to the
first you can also change it by clicking
here manually whenever we go through a
website or fill out a form we see that
there are certain ways of filling a form
right sometimes we use radio buttons to
select one option from a group of
options we use pass passwords emails
checkboxes and many more such things
while going through a form the input
element in HTML is responsible for
adding different input types to a web
page the type attribute within the input
element determines what the user will
input in that particular input area so
let's go through the syntax of input
element first and then we'll go through
the different input types we can get
from a user now the input element in
HTML specifies an input field for the
user user to enter data so let's say if
we want the user to enter his username
in that case we'll need an input field
right so what we'll do is we'll write
here inside the form tag we have the
form tag already present here so we'll
write here first let's say first name
fine now we are going to use the input
element the input element in HTML is an
empty element so we don't need any
closing tag for that save the program
and here you can see on the browser that
we have this input field present we can
write anything over here inside this
input field so you can see we are able
to write anything over
here now let's create a small form and
you guys will be able to understand the
concept of type attribute in the input
element we'll create a form wherein
we'll include different types of input
areas for the user so first of all we'll
write
here first name and input so we already
have this written on a program we use
the label here as first name however we
use the label tag for this task but
right now I don't want you guys to get
confused so we'll keep it like this only
here we have used the label name as
first name so the type attribute will
hold the value as text over here anytime
we want the user to input values like
name or any sort of text value we use
the type attributes as text so what
we'll do is we'll move to our input
element and we'll write over here type
type is going to be text first fine save
the program and you'll see nothing
happening over here as of now you won't
find any difference and this is the
default value of the type attribute as
well so we can write anything over here
like we can write any text value or we
can write numbers here as well so it's
making no difference over here on the
browser now the difference we'll see
when we'll go through other input types
so let's move ahead and we'll now go
through the button type first or we can
say the submit button first so what
we'll do is we'll create a submit button
first fine so we'll write over here we
are going to use the break tag for two
times and we are going to write here
input type is going to be submit for a
submit button and we'll write over here
value
as submit fine now save the program and
you can see the submit button present
over here on the browser so this submit
button generally submits the form like
if we are writing anything over here
like we are writing any first name
submit it and you can see the page gets
refreshed and there's no other value now
because the submit button is on work and
it submits the form fine now similar to
a submit button there's one more input
type that also creates a button but the
task is a bit different the value of the
type attribute as reset will do some
important things for us for example if
we write here the same thing so we are
going to use the input tag again and
here we'll write type as reset and let's
give the value
as reset once again fine close the input
element and save the program so here you
can see we have this reset button
present over here now write something
over here like any value or any name
click on reset and you can see the value
of that particular field gets reset fine
are done with the buttons now the next
input type we are going to see is the
password so passwords are confidential
right so we need something which can
hide the user's password
HTML has an input type as password so
let's go through it what we'll do is
we'll add a label over here like we'll
write your password first to let the
user know what he or she needs to do so
then we'll write here input type as
password fine now save the program and
here you can see we have another input
box over here so let's do one thing
let's use the break tag here to keep the
form NE and ke so here you can see we
have password over here if we try to
write anything over here you can see
that particular text or number whatever
we are using in password is encoded so
we can write any name here and here we
have the password click on submit and
here you can see it says check your
password so there's an error over here
so you can see the password Here is
encoded and HTML provides us with this
feature moving ahead the email input
type this type of input is used for
emails it validates the email address
whenever the user clicks on the submit
button for example we'll write here
email so we are going to create another
input field we'll use the input tag or
input element we'll write here type as
email fine save the program and here you
can see we have another input box over
here we'll copy these break texts from
here and we'll paste them save it and
here you can see it looks fine now now
write an email over here or just try to
write a single word so let's say we are
writing over here R will provide the
first name as well so we'll write here
Ram then we'll write here any password
let's say fine so click on submit and
here you can see it says please include
an at theate sign in the email address
Ram is missing an at theate so we'll
include at theate over here click on
submit again and here you can see please
enter a part following at theate so it
will not allow the user to move ahead
until the user enters a correct email ID
so let's say we are writing over here at
the
gmail.com submitted and here you can see
the form gets
submitted fine we have been through some
important inputs till now all of them we
discuss till now are commonly used in
every form we create now we'll discuss
radio buttons so radio buttons allow the
user to choose a single option from a
number of options available for example
what we'll do is we'll go through the
example directly so we'll write over
here let's
say
input type is equals to radio and then
we'll write over
here value fine value is going to be
let's say HTML and here we'll write
HTM okay so here we are we have a first
radio button so we'll write here once
again input type is equal
to radio so we have done a mistake over
here we'll write over here value again
value is going to be CSS and we'll write
CSS here as well now save it and here
you can see we have two options HTML and
CSS let's do one thing let's include one
more over here so we'll write here input
type is equals to radi fine then we'll
write here value and let say value is
going to be
JavaScript and save it and here you can
see we have three radio buttons present
over here we are going to use The Brak
tag here as well and here you can see we
have three radio buttons HTML CSS and
JavaScript now if you guys remember we
already said that we can choose any one
option out of all the available options
right so we are not able to do it here
because of the name attribute so for
that we have to include the name
attribute here so let's say we are
writing over here name as
language
for each of them so let's write here
name
as language save it now and now try to
click on these radio buttons and you can
see we are able to select only one out
of all the available options we have
fine so the name attribute plays a vital
role while using radio buttons in an
HTML form checkboxes also do similar
tasks but we can select more than one
option at a time with checkboxes so what
we'll do is we'll use checkboxes as well
so let's say we are using the label tag
over here we'll write here label and
let's say we are writing over here
choose
your week fine now we'll move ahead and
we'll write over here we'll use The Brak
tag first and we'll write over here
let's
say input type is equal to checkbox and
then we have to write here name name is
let's say vehicle
one and that's it so let's use the value
attribute as well so value are going to
write here bike fine so we'll write bike
over here then we'll use input type is
equals to checkbox then
we'll again
mention name here so we'll write your
name
as vehicle so let's do one thing we'll
write your vehicle again and we'll write
your
value car and we have to mention car
here as
well do it one more time we'll write
here type
type is going to be checkbox again and
name is going to
be vehicle and value is going to be
let's say scooter fine so we'll write
scooter over here and save it now so
here you can see we have three different
options for checkboxes what we'll do
is we'll put the Break Tag over here
save it now and here you can see now we
have bike car and scooter although the
name attribute
in this case holds the same value for
all the three checkboxes it has vehicle
for all of them so but still we can
choose you can see more than one option
at a time so this is the difference
between checkboxes and radio buttons in
HTML the next input type we are going to
use is the date type this type is mainly
used for date of birth but you can use
it for other specific dates as well it
allows the user to select a specific
date along with the month and
so what we have to do is we have to
write
here let's write it over here let's
create an input box for date of birth
for of the user so we'll write over here
input type as date fine save it and here
you can see we have this data of birth
input box present over here we can
choose date from this calendar so we can
use any month or we can say any year as
well so let let say the date is 17
February 2016 we can choose the date
from this calendar over here so HTML
gives us
this feature of choosing date and if you
want to select time as well so then we
have to write here date time local fine
save it and here you can see now we are
able to select date along with the time
so you can see we can choose time as
well along with the date so here you can
see the date is 57 2022 which is 5th
July 2022 and the time is 10:43 so it
follows 24hour format in case of time
now the next type we are going to
discuss is numbers this input type
describes a numeric input for the user
it does not allow the user to input any
value other than numbers so what we'll
do is we'll go through the syntax
directly we'll write it over here after
the break tag let's say we are writing
phone number
and for this we are writing input type
is equals to number and that's it save
it and here you can see we have this
option of one number so let's make it a
bit cleaner and now we'll try to write
any text over here so you can see we are
not able to write any text now we'll try
to write numbers and here you can see it
allows us to put numbers inside this
particular input box we are not able to
print text over here so so this is why
the input type as number is used for in
HTML the last input type we'll discuss
is the file type sometimes we need to
upload a file while filling out a form
like a CV or something in HTML we can
use the input type as file for this task
so what we'll do is we'll take you
through the Syntax for this as well so
we'll write over here
selector file and we'll
write input type is equals to file fine
save the program and here you can see we
have this choose file option present
here on the browser we can use it to
choose a file from a system so this is
how the file attribute or you can say
file input type Works in HTML now apart
from all these input types we have
discussed we have some more input types
present in HTML like range week month
and many more we can't discuss all of
them in a single video but whenever
we'll go through any of them we'll
definitely take a look at each of the
input types we use so HTML is not only
used for creating the structure of a web
page anymore but it also provides
interactivity to a web page up to some
extent so I hope you guys will learn
something from this HTML tutorial back
friends so just like my previous example
this time I would like to also introduce
you the another very interesting
application which is called navigation
look when we talk about adment based
development so in HTML based development
navigation is very important where you
have a called multiple Pages attached to
so that when you click on this page or
click on any hyperlink it will take you
to the new page now so that you can move
back and forth so this navigation is
very essential part of any web
development so that you can offer the
navigation so this simple application of
HTML we would like to start from scratch
so let's go and create a new folder now
and give the name called
navigation
and inside this navigation we want to
create some new pages
so here I'm going to create
index.
HTML the CSS name will be app. CSS and
along with this we would like to also
create some new folder inside this I'll
keep all the navigation files inside
this so I can sa Pages inside this Pages
let me have total number of three pages
is with me when is called
above
HTML then we

contact
HTML then we create one more that is
called services.
HTML do htl so these three links we will
create it one by one but first let's
start with the index. htl so what's
there in my index. HTML file so first
thing I would like to start with with my
same HTML syntax
here well this is my basic construct so
I will start with my link Ariel from
here so that I can have my style shap
with me link Aral to Styles shet hfal to
app do CSS though I have not written
anything but I just left it as a blank
in my body tag I would start with the
navigation so HTML file
brought you some new tags known as
called a nav tag which is once
again won't change anything drastically
in your browser however they are called
semantics which will help you for the
SEO that stand for search engine
optimization so I'll start with my nav
inside my nav I will start with my
div div I'll say navigation bar so but
before that I say class equal to
heading this is my div tag and inside my
div tag I want to ping my heading so I
say
H4 and I
say navigation R and after the div tag I
will start with my Ur tag which is the
unordered list inside my unorder list I
can say Li that stand for list items and
I can offer lot many links in that is so
you will I just offer the class equal
to nav
hyphen links and inside this my all tag
I say a which is the anchor
tag
so a link HF equal
to now here I offer the name I say
index HTML and uh that's it and this
will be by default active so we say
class equal
to
active a class equal to active and H
equal to index.html file and here we
offer
home for homepage I'll copy this
line and paste it for other three
URLs so here
the active won't be there instead we say
HF equal to the location called
Pages under this Pages we say
about about. HTML and here we say
about okay copy
this paste it and a part of this about
we always say services. HTML and here we
say
Services insert
this
contact
contact okay and once the nav tag is
over I will offer the
div div
plus equal to just give the name body
hyphen
text I just say H1 tag insert this and
this is the
homepage that's it so that's my homepage
which is ready with me and along with
this whichever the other pages are also
available those pages I also want to use
so first of all let me check how this
page looks like
it
well it looks like a pretty basic page
so once this page is ready what I will
do is here I copy the
content and pasted it here and above and
let's see what's there in my above see
few things will change number one
here this app.
CSS
now here we have to just
use dot dot there's an app. CSS for me
so we have to offer some title to so out
this link are here you
offer title this title I can
say
about okay so rest everything is fine
so H4 navigation bar nav links here I
have to offer the links for my base HTML
page so when I talk about index htl
file okay it won't come
so index HTM file so I won't say it is
in active anymore I just remove this
line class equal to active it's just an
normal HF but about would be active in
this case so
a class equal
to active h this Services
contact is as usual same but I would not
be having any Pages
anymore because we are in the same
location that's why and here I say this
is is
a about this is about
page about page so that's it I'll go
back and check it all fine home is
active right now about you can see it is
an about page right now about page is
just appear as it is say contents are
more or less looks like and same that is
why you are able to see now just like
that all we just go back and copy the
others now here have CSS navigation bar
active it is in contact so it make
contact as an
active soex file remain same this
is contact page
so that's how it is and uh it will say
about my other properties which is my
services my copy
sorry copy this
contact and
here I'll be activating
my service in this case
so class equal to active I remove it
from
here make it available here this
is service page navigation index pages
about active yeah all looks good heading
about okay here I
change
service I change
to cont so looks fine let's see
okay service contact
about so for about we need to check
where we need to
go so we have got Pages about. HTML
pages also there
so all there so we would like to see how
how the about page will be activated
here index.html file also contains an
about so
here when
I
refresh
[Music]
well call index. HTM
page talk about called
about well is an about page now
services so like this it is happening
for
you okay so that's how exactly my thing
is so we're all good and
uh Services contact home all good well
my page is now ready and going forward
we would like to beautify my pages by
offering the CSS well let's get started
with our CSS file so in my CSS file I
will start with my common
properties which is
margin I'm saying 0
pixel followed by
padding I'm making it a0 pixel
again again we want box
sizing this I say
border hyphen
box okay well when going forward this is
my standard settings for all different
type of properties now I want the other
properties to be get introduced that is
called box body text
Dot body
hyphen
text inside this body text I said
display
Flex now when I see where the body text
is available go to my text. HTML
file
body text is available here div class so
here in my CSS file I can say body text
display Flex I say font
family font family I can give
anything just G called mod sh
it
s these two we are offering it later on
align
items NL item
Center followed by justify
content we making a
center then margin
top 250
pixels these are the properties are
there followed by okay first let's check
what is an
effect here here see it looks better now
now we would like to go ahead with the
nav I already have this nav with me n
display Flex then justify
content space
around followed by align
item align items I want to mix
Center and then we want to say Min
height so we say Min
Hy okay so Min height we are giving 8
VH followed by background
color just say te same color and uh same
font pample I just copy this font ply
and uh make it a over here well let's
check there we go the Navar looks
awesome but I still feel the links needs
to be justified we want to make it even
more better but before that I offer the
nav links so here I
say nav links so do
nav hyphen
links
this nav Lings will have
display
Flex
display flex and then justify
content that I want to make it space
around
again followed by
width
[Music]
so width so width would be
30% perfect and now n link Li dot nav
links
Li
this list
style
none let's see how it is
changing there we go that it looks
really nice so nav links are ready and
uh I want to make it a heading heading I
want to make it more organized so let's
see about a heading so here I say
dot heading and uh inside this heading I
say
color which is
white followed by text
transform text X transform
uppercase followed by letter
spacing this letter spacing will be 5
pixels and followed by L font size and
this font size is just 20
pixel that's it and let's see what is
difference here here awesome so this
navigation bar is now looking great and
uh it is giving me all the basic
operation whichever we have expected now
this nav links whichever we have created
okay they are working fine but I just
want to make it even more beautiful and
how I can make it more beautiful to make
it I would like to go ahead with the nav
links
again
dot nav Links of type anchor tag now I
would like to activate my anchor tag by
making it
color
white okay followed by text
decoration text decoration
none and uh followed by letter
spacing letter spacing 3 pixels
and then font
fit font fit
bold and uh font
size 14
pixels and
padding 14
pixels and 16
pixels both
options that's it and uh followed by we
want to use the nav links when I will
hover it so the color should change so
we are saying dot nav links and here
with li followed by a
do active when the anchor tag is active
then in that case I want to change the
background
color to Lights light C green I can
say
lights
so we have this option called light C
green this one light C green that looks
beautiful and followed by same I copy
this and this active so nav links la.
active background color we are using but
if it is not active then in that case
what you will use so so I can just
change a small thing here I've changed
this
color uh now let me try to copy this
first I tell you not what I want to copy
this and I paste it as usual here what I
see is when it is an active Okay when it
is an active I will change the color
to I think the spelling is wrong active
it should
be active background color I want to
change it to Green so for that we just
using the color
hash this is a green color when it is an
active and when this is not active so we
can just say a colon active which you
used now now Li colon active or we can
say a colon H
equ
over
a colon over and here we say colon not
DOT active that's it let's see how it
works awesome this looks beautiful home
home is active right now you say it is
on a home page I can see it is an about
page it is service page it is a contact
now you can see it looks even more
awesome in the most basic definition a
form is something we use to take the
users's data for example if the user
wants to register on a website then they
have to give us their names email and
some more info about them a form takes
input from the user and then posts it
into the backend application for further
processing and other stuff like
validation and all the HTML form tag is
used to create a form it's quite simple
to create a form in HTM we'll move to
the programming part directly and create
a simple form to start with so the first
and foremost part is that we need to use
the form tag to create a form so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body of
our program and we'll write here form so
this is the form tag in HTML save the
program and you can see here nothing
happened on the browser so this form tag
created an area for a form it basically
worked like the div tag we used in the
previous videos now to include data in a
form we need text areas or we can say
input boxes in our form there are
various form elements available like
text field text area Fields drop down
menus radio buttons checkboxes Etc so
let's start using them in the form here
first of all we'll create a text box for
the user need for that what we have to
do is we have to write here inside the
form tag so we'll write here first name
and then we have to write here input so
input is another tag so we have to write
here
input and then we have to use the type
attribute so the type is going to be
text for this text box and we'll write
here name name is going to
be first name
fine now save this and you can see here
we have an input box for the first name
the same code we can use for the last
name as well what we have to do is we
have to copy it from
here we have to paste it here so we'll
use the BR tag before using it again now
we have to change first here with last
we'll write here last and in name as
well we'll
write last fine so we have this last
name over here save it and you can see
we have first name and last name we have
two different text boxes present over
here we'll use the BR tag one more time
save it now and you can see it clearly
now right so here we are done with the
first text box of us now this input tag
over here is used to create these text
boxes and the name refers to the text
Box's name fine another thing we can do
here is we can write
here placeholder and inside placeholder
we can write something let's say we are
writing over here first name and you can
see first name over here it's permanent
until we write something inside the Box
the placeholder value will appear on the
text box same thing we can do here as
well we have to write here
placeholder so we have placeholder for
last name as well save it now and you
can see the value of placeholder over
here the moment we start writing
something over here you can see the
placeholder value is not here anymore
fine if getting your learning started is
half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know
more now there are different types of
form controls that we can use to collect
data using HTML form they are text input
controls we can use checkboxes radio
buttons we can use select box controls
and we can also use file select boxes so
we can use radio buttons in our form for
that what we need to do is we need to
change the type in our form so that's
the only thing that will change no
matter what controls we are using so
what we have to do is we have to write
here let's say we are using Break Tag
first so we'll use two break tags over
here in order to make the whole web page
clear and easily understandable for you
guys so next thing we'll do is we'll
write
here gender so let's write here gender
then we'll use Break Tag again and after
this we'll
write input type is equals to radio and
we can write here name name is going to
be let's see mail and the value for this
is going to be M again fine we can use
the value attribute here as well so
we'll use it later now the next thing
we'll do is we'll write
here input again we'll add another
gender so let's say we have type here
as radio again and then we have name
as female and we'll write
here so save it now and you can see two
radio buttons over here we can check
them in and you can see we have radio
buttons working totally fine we can use
these values later on as well similarly
we can use checkboxes as well in our
form we'll see how in the upcoming video
where we'll create something like a
login or a sign up form using HTML only
so there are three different different
types of text inputs used on forms we
can use single line text input controls
so this control is used for items that
require only one line of user input such
as search boxes or names they are
created in HTML using the input tag we
discuss them till now so these all are
the example of single line text input
controls which we discussed till now the
next are password input control this is
also a single line text input but it
masks the character as soon as a user
enters it they are also created using
the HTML input tag so the syntax goes
like this we have to write here after
this so we'll use the BR tag again over
here and now we'll write
here input so before that let's
write password so this password is going
to be the users password for a website
for login or maybe for sign in so this
is the password so we'll write here
input type is equals to password and
then we'll write here name
as password fine save it now and you can
see password written over here with a
text box fine right inside here will get
masked so if we write anything over here
you can see it in the form of password
it will get masked as soon as we enter
it so this is done to make the password
a secret now we can also set the maximum
length of a password using the max
length attribute so what we have to do
is we have to write here max
length and max length is going to be
let's say 8 fine save the program and
now if we write something over here you
can
see and now we are not able to use more
than eight characters inside this
particular text box right because we
have defined the max length as eight and
it will allow only eight characters
inside the text box fine the last one we
have our multi-line text input controls
this is used when the user is required
to give details that may be longer than
a single sentence so multi-line input
controls are created using html text
area tag the Syntax for a multi-line
input is simple we have to write here
after this so we'll use the
brte again for two times and then we'll
write here let's say description fine so
after description we'll use the BR tag
to make it more clear and then we'll
write
here text area so this is the tag and
then we have to Define rows and columns
here so rows are going to be five and
we'll write here calls so these two are
the attributes we'll write here 50 this
basically we are defining the area
acquired by this text area fine then
we'll write your
name and we'll write here
description then we'll write something
over here so let's say we'll write over
here
enter description
here and that's it save the program and
you can see we have a text area present
over here it's bigger in size than the
normal text boxes we had earlier so what
we can do is we can remove it from here
and we can use the place fer attribute
inside the text area tag to write such
thing
fine the last important thing in a form
is the submit button so this button is
used to submit the form data we can
either use the input tag or the button
tag for a submit button fine so let's
use the input tag for creating a button
first what we'll do is we'll write here
after
this we'll write here the Break Tag and
then we'll
write input type is equals to button and
then we have value is equals to submit
fine save the program and you can see
the button over here on the browser so
here's the
button we can further make this button
work with the help of JavaScript but we
are creating the layout only for now so
let it be this way only the next method
we can use for creating a button is by
using the button tag so what we have to
do is we have to write here just use the
BR tag ones and write here button so
this is the tag and write here the name
of button fine so we'll write here
submit save the program and you can see
here another button fine so here's the
button you can see both the buttons are
exactly same no difference between the
buttons just a quick info for you if you

whenever we go through the login or sign
up portal of any website we see that on
the login page we use credentials like
ID and password name signup page on the
other hand refers to the form we need to
fill in order to be a part of that
particular website so what we'll do is
we'll create a login page and a sign up
page in today's video and we'll see what
we can learn from this video so without
wasting any more time let's move on to
the programming part directly we'll
start with the login page first so first
of all here we are in the HTML file
we'll start using the form tag but
before that we are going to provide a
heading for this login page so what
we'll do is we'll move to the body tag
and we'll write here H1 so H1 stands for
heading one I hope you guys already know
this particular element so what we'll do
is we'll write here login form fine so
we have written login form over here
save it and you can see we have login
form written on the browser the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to style it a bit using the style
attribute we have been through it
already so we'll write Here style now
inside style what we'll do is we'll
align this text at the center of our web
page so we'll write here text align and
we'll text align it to the center fine
so here we are we are done with text
aligning save it now and you can see it
moving in the browser so it's in the
middle of the web page now you you can
see it over here clearly the login form
is present at the center of our whole
web page fine now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to use the
form tag over here fine so we'll write
here form and this is a form tag so we
are going to create the form inside this
particular tag only now let's style this
as so what we'll do is we'll write here
Style again the style attribute comes
into play so we are going to use the
Border attribute now we are going to
keep the Border three pixel thick solid
in nature and let's use this particular
color so we'll write here F1 fub1 F1 so
this is white color basically so here
you can see it's not completely white
off white or a bit grayish we can say so
here you can see the form body so I hope
this is visible for you guys so the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to use a container now so what we'll do
for that we'll use the div tag we'll
style it and then we'll move on further
so we'll write here div now inside div
we are going to use the style attribute
again obviously so we are going to
provide padding over here now we'll
write here 25 pixels so what is pedding
you guys repeat so what is padding you
guys might be wondering about it padding
provides the space between the border
and the content of an element fine so
the space between the border of that
element and the content is known as
pedding so padding is going to be 25
pixel for all the sites so pedding is
basically four S from top right bottom
and left fine so we can provide all the
values or we can provide a single value
for all fine so here padding is 25 pixel
now we are going to set background color
for this and the background color is
going to be let's say light fine save it
now and here you can see we have a
container which has a border of gray
color and the background color
is sky blue or we can say light blue
fine now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to start creating
a form so here we are inside the div tag
so you can see we have the form tag
first and inside the form we have a
particular division fine so what we'll
do now is we are going to create a login
form so we'll use the label tag so label
tag stands for the label of any form so
you will see it over here so we'll write
here
username and we'll
put colon over save it now and here you
can see we have username present inside
the container or we can say inside the
form fine so let's put a space over here
save it now and now I guess it looks
fine the next thing we are going to do
is we are going to create a text box now
so for that we are going to use the in
put text so we'll write here
input type is equals to text for this
username and then we'll write here
placeholder placeholder we'll write
enter username fine now after this we
are going to write here name name is
going to be let's
say username again and then we'll write
here let's say required so so required
is another attribute we have so what
will happen now is if we leave this box
empty and if we don't write anything
over here and if we try to submit a
login form then a popup will appear
which says credentials required or
something like that only so HTML
provides us with this feature so save it
now and here you can see we have a label
username and a text box which says enter
username fine similarly we'll create a
label for password and text box for
password fine so we'll write here label
again and we'll write here
password save it now and here you can
see we have a label for password as well
now what we'll do is we'll write
here again we are going to use the input
tag so we'll write here input type is
equals to password you guys are already
aware of this type and and then we'll
write your placeholder and we'll write
here
enter password fine so we'll write here
enter password then we have the name for
password we'll write here name is
equals to password and then we'll write
here a required again fine save it now
and here you can see we have another
text
box now so let me make it a
little more here for you guys so here we
are done with the username and the
password the next thing we need is the
submit button now fine so we'll write
your button type is going to
be submit or we can use the input tag as
well as we did in the last video so
we'll write
here login fine so this is the button
name save it now and here you can see we
have the login Button as well now what
we are going to do is we are going to
create a checkbox or we can say a
remember me function fine so for that
what we'll do
is we are again going to use the input
tag for that so we'll write here input
then we'll write here type type is
equals to
checkbox and then we'll write here after
this checked checked is a property again
so we'll write
here checked as checked so
then we'll write
here remember me fine save it now and
here you can see we have a checkbox and
a remember me option fine the next thing
we are going to do is we are going to
create another button the cancel button
fine so we'll write here button button
and type is going to be button again
then we'll write
here id id is going going to be let's
say cancel button why we are using this
ID because we need this ID in the CSS
part we'll see it later then we'll write
here the name of button is cancel
fine save it now and here you can see we
have a cancel button as well now the
next thing we are going to do is we are
going to put some links over here so for
that we are going to use the anchor tag
again we'll write here a hre href is
going to be let's say h
because we are going to write here
forgot password so we'll write
here forgot
password or we can write here forget
password
fine save it now and here you can see we
have a link present over here now what
we are going to do is we are going to
use a break over here and then we'll add
another link for the sign up page fine
so we'll write here a h ref again ref
refence is going to be sign in. HTML so
this is going to be the signin file or
the HTML file for the signup page then
we'll write
here register fine save it now and here
you can see register written over here
on the browser so we are already done
with the login form the next thing we
are going to do is we are going to use
CSS for that so we are almost done with
the HTML part for this login page
all of you guys are well aware of the
style attribute till now right this
attribute is used to change the style of
any particular element let me tell you
guys another way of using this style
attribute in HTM we can use all these
styling properties inside the style tag
as well for that what we need to do is
we need to move to the Head section of a
HTML file and we have to write Here
style fine so here we are we are here
here with the style tag so what we are
going to do is we are going to style a
HTML document inside this style tag
only fine what we'll do here is we'll
write
here body first fine so what we are
doing here is we are styling the body
tag the whole body tag now fine so what
we'll do is we'll use the font family
first so we'll change the font family
we'll write
here
okay we are going to use Gil sense we
are going to use this then we'll write
here the background color so we'll
change the background color of this
pitch we'll write here RGB the RGB
values
are we have to write it in small letters
the RGB values are 13 4 comma 132 comma
133 fine we are done with it save it and
here you can see the change so the the
RGB values are not working because we
have written RBG over here instead of
RGB save it now and here you can see the
background color is gray now fine so it
looks nice now the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to style the
button so the button tag we have used
here you can see it over here we have
used the button tag for cancel button
and for submit button fine or we can say
for login button so we are going to
style both of them at once so we'll
write here button we'll write here the
tag name basically so button is the tag
name now we'll change the background
color of this button which is going to
be let's say
hh150 5 FM so guys I'm already aware of
these colors and you can do what we did
in the background color video or you can
change the background color according to
you you can use the color name you can
use the Hax values or the RGB values the
next thing we are going to do is we we
are going to provide here the width
width is going to be 100% of the whole T
fine then we'll write here color color
is going to change the font color of
this button so we'll write here RGB
again and we are going to write here 2
248 comma 248 comma 248 fine let's see
what it is so here you can see the login
and cancel button are changed now so the
font color is white the button color is
blue and next thing we are going to do
is we are going to write here padding
padding again is going to be 15 pixels
for all the sides then we'll write here
margin fine so we'll write your margin
margin is going to be 10 pixel
and 0 pixel fine so what is margin guys
margin provides the space between the
border and the outer El
there's a difference between padding and
margin padding provides the space
between the border and the content of
element so here in this case this is the
content and this is
the pading fine margin on the other hand
refers to this space between this
element and the next element fine so
margin as 10 and 0 pixel means 10 pixel
from top and bottom and zero pixel from
left and right fine
the next thing we are going to do here
is we are going to write here border
fine so border will Define as
none save it and you can see the buttons
here now the next thing or the last
thing we are going to write here is we
are going to change the cursor to
pointer on taking over these buttons you
can see the cursor change now
fine the next thing we are going to do
is we are going to style the
input tags so we'll write here in
input and we are going to style them so
we'll write here type is equals to we
have used a lot
of input tags right so we'll write it
type is equals to text and then again we
are going to write here
input then we'll write here type is
equals
to password fine so we have two input
tags for username and for password so we
are going to style them at once side by
side we are going to style them so the
next thing we are going to write here is
we are going to set the width as
100% And then we'll write here margin
again so we'll write here margin as 8
pixels and 0 pixels fine save it now and
here you can see the login form is
looking more and here you can see the
login form looks much better now
the next thing we are going to do here
is we are going to define the padding as
well pedding is going to be 12 pixel and
20 pixel
fine then we'll write your display
display
as inline block and we have border over
here border is going to be 2
pixel solid in nature and we are going
to define the RGB value again so RGB is
going to be
109 for green we
have 8 and for blue we
have and for blue here we have let's say
240 and save it now and here you can see
the borders over here now what we are
going to do is we are going to remove
pixel from here and here you can see we
have the input box is or we can say the
text boxes working totally fine now what
we are going to do last is we are going
to write
here box sizing you can see these boxes
going out of area so we'll write here
box sizing
as border box save it now and here you
can see the login form is almost done
fine so let me close it
once now the next thing we are going to
style is the button tag again so we'll
write here button
and then we'll write here a property it
totally depends upon us if we are going
to use these properties or not so we
have to remove from here we have to
write your hover and on hovering the
opacity will change so the opacity will
change to 0.7 now look it carefully and
here you can see when we take our mouse
cursor over any button there's no change
right now save the program try to take
the mouse cursor again you can see it's
still not working as of
now have to remove this and here you can
see now it's working totally fine on
taking the mouse cursor over any button
it hovers now the opacity will change
fine the last thing we have to do is we
have to style the cancel button so we
are going to use the ID over here so
here you can see in the HTML part of
cancel button so we have used the ID as
cancel button over here so we are going
to use this ID to style this particular
button
fine we'll write here inside this cancel
button width width is going to be Auto
then we have padding padding is going to
be 10 pixel and 18 pixel for top bottom
and for left right fine then we have the
margin as well and margin is going to be
10 pixel for top bottom and 5 pixel for
Left Right save it now and here you can
see the login form is completely done
fine now that we are done with the
styling part let's check the final
output save the program and you can see
here so here you can see on the browser
we have this basic login form it looks
fine right we can make it more
attractive but we need CSS for that with
HTML we can do this only so let's move
ahead and we'll now create the
registration form or the signup page so
let's move ahead to another HTML file so
here we are in the HTML file so this
file is for sign up page here you can
see the title for sign up so we'll
remove this form tag from here it's a
mistake save it now and now what we are
going to do is we are going to open it
with live server again so here you can
see this HTML file has no output as all
so let's create the sign up form now if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learning
learn click on the link in the
description to know more so what we'll
do first is we are going to write here
the style tag and we'll finish it later
on now moving to the body part what
we'll do is we'll style the body first
so we'll use the style attribute now we
are going to define the font family here
font family is going to be this one
again let's say we have used this in the
sign up form or we can say the login
form as well so the next thing we are
going to do is we are going to change
the background color for this whole body
now what we are doing here is we'll
write here
RGB then we'll Define the values as 134
comma 132 comma 133 the same one from
the previous login form save it now and
here you can see the change in the
background color of the whole body tag
fine next up what we'll do here is we
are going to use the H1 tag
again we'll style it as well so we'll
write a style we are going to align it
to the center we'll write a text
align and we'll write here text align at
the center fine so here we are then
we'll write
here registration
form save it now and here you can see we
have registration form written at the
center of a web page fine next thing we
have to include a lot of text boxes and
a lot of labels in this particular
registration form because for login form
we need only two text boxes or two
labels right the username and the
password but the sign up form is
different we need a lot of information
about the user so for that we are going
to use a lot of input tags first thing
we are going to do is we are going to
use a break over here then we'll use the
form
tag and that's it inside the form tag we
are going to change the style over here
only so we'll write Here style and we
are going to use the border border is
going to be 3 pixel solid in color and
or you can say solid in nature and
off-white or gray in color fine so here
you can see the border on the
browser now what we are going to do next
is we are going to use the div tag
again so we'll write here div
here we have the div tag so let's style
this div tag over here only we are going
to use the style attribute for that we
are going to define the padding padding
is going to be 25 pixel for this as well
background color we are going to use
light blue again save it now and here
you can see the container on the browser
so it's similar to the login one now
what we are going to do is we are going
to use label first so we'll write here
label then we have the label
as first
name and save it you can see we have our
first lbel over over
here the next thing we need is the input
area or the text box for this first name
so we'll write here
input type is equals to text then we
have name name is going to
be first name then we have sites or we
can say the length so we'll write
here max length max length let's define
it as
15 and we are done with the first text
box use the break tag again over here
and that's it so we are done with first
name similarly we have to mention the
middle name last name as well so let's
define them here so we'll write here
label
again this time we have the label
for mdle
name and that's it save it and here you
can see we have middle name written over
here we'll copy this piece of code or we
can say the input tag from here we'll
change the name to last name and save it
here you can see we have another text
box present over here fine so one thing
we forgot to mention here is the
placeholder so we can write here
placeholder
enter first name fine save it now and
here you can see the placeholder on the
browser so we'll copy it from here we'll
paste it here we'll mention for last
name or for middle name as well save it
now and here you can see something is
wrong save it
again and there's something wrong
fine okay so there's a problem with the
live server so what we'll do is we'll
open it again with live server and here
you can see it's not working as of
now okay the Break Tag we have
something wrong over here let me check
guys okay we forgot to
mention this over here save it now and
it's still not
working with live server again and it's
working now
fine so it's working as of now we'll do
the same thing
for last name as well so we'll copy this
piece of code from here we'll paste it
here we'll change middle to last
everywhere so we'll write enter last
name over here then we have name as last
name and we have to write here
enter last name or we can say last name
over here save it now and here you can
see we have another text box and another
label present over here for last name as
well now what we are going to do is we
are going to select or we can say we are
going to use options or we have to
mention them over here so for that we'll
write
here label so we are going to mention
course over here and for course we are
going to provide drop- down menus so for
that what we need to do is we need to
use the select tag in HTM so inside the
select tag we have to provide options
options let's say the value of option is
first value is going to be course and
then we have to write here course
it is going to be a drop- down list so
we have to mention a lot of options over
here so we'll write your option
again and then we'll write
here value value is going to be
VCA then we have to write here BCA save
it now and here you can see we have
course over here so here you can see
till now it has two values let's add
some more values over here for options
or we can say let's add some more
options over here we'll add let's say
three four more options we'll write here
BBA instead of BCA for this then we have
let's
say
btech and we'll change the value over
here as well we'll write here bch then
we
have MBA as well let's say so we'll
write here
MBA then finally we have let's say mtech
as well so we'll write here
mtech save it now and here you can see
if you click on this code you can see we
have different options available we have
BCA BBA B Tech MBA and mtech so the
select tag or we can say the option tag
and select tag both are used for drop
down men so here is a drop down menu so
we have to put a colum over here save it
now and I guess it looks fine
now so the next thing we need to do is
we need to use the radio buttons for
gender fine so what we are going to do
is we are going to
use the break
tag and then we'll write
here gender so gender is going to be the
label so we have to put it inside label
tag so we'll write here
label and we have to put gender inside
it fine save it now and here you can see
we have gender present over
here now what we are going to do is we
are going to put a break again over here
and then we have to use the input tag so
we'll write input type is equals
to radio for radio buttons when then we
have to write your name name is going to
be male and the first value is going to
be M fine then we have to put the BR tag

have three radio buttons over here for
gender we have male female and other
fine now next thing we have to include
is we have to include the phone number
for phone number we need two input boxes
one for the country code and another one
for phone number fine so we need to
write here and we'll put another break
over here then after this break we need
the label for phone fine so we'll write
your
phone and after phone we have to write
here
input type is equals to text for phone
number then we'll write here name name

value as well value is going to be plus
91 this is the country code of India
then we'll write
here max length max length is going to
be three so that the user cannot write
anything inside here fine save it now
and here you can see we have phone as
label and we have a text box if we try
to write anything you can see we are not
able to write so what we'll do next is
we'll add another input box or we can
say the text box for phone number so
we'll copy it from
here we'll paste it again we are going
to use the name as phone for phone
number the value is going to
be none so we'll remove value from here
and then what we'll do is we'll change
the max length to 10 digits fine save it
now and here you can see we have another
text box over here so what we'll do is
we'll change the type here so you can

write characters here as well what we'll
do is we'll change the type as number
fine save it now and now you'll be able
to see that we are not able to write any
character over here but we are able to
write a number

is the text box for phone number fine so
we are going to use the break tag again
so we'll write here
break let's use it twice and after this
Break Tag what we need is the address so
we'll write
here label label is going to be
address so we have to write here address
we have to put a column over here and
after this address we have to put the
The Break Tag and a text area so we are
not going to use this text box for this
now we are going to use the text area
attribute so we'll write here text area
text area columns are going to be 80 for
this area and row is five
fine value is going to
be let's say address over
here and we are almost done so save it
now and here you can see on the browser
we have a text area for address fine so
what we need to do next is we need email
we need password and retype password we
need three more options right so let's
start with email so what we are going to
do is we are going to use break over
here twice so that it will be clear for
you guys to see now what we'll do is
we'll write here

password save it now and here you can
see we have label as password now we'll
write here input type is going to be
password then we have ID is equals to
pass in case we need them in the CSS
part that's why we are using the it
attribute here name is going to be pass
again and that's fine so we have text
box for password now what we are going
to do next is we are going to use the
break tag
again next up we need to retype password
because this is a registration form the
user needs to retype the password he
choose fine so we'll write here label
label is going to be
re-enter
password and that's it we need an input
box for this as well so we are going to
use this one only so we'll copy it from
here we'll paste it here and we are
going to use the brte again
fine save it now and here you can see we
have another text box for a re-enter
password

submit button the last thing so we we'll
write here
input type is going to be button then we
have value value is going to be
submit so save it now and we are done
with the registration form as well so
here you can see we have everything we
need in a registration form so here we
are done with the HTML part only let's
style this page a bit now we'll move on
to the Head section again and we'll
write here inside the style attribute or
we can say the style tag basically so
we'll write
here we are going to
use
input input for type
as text so basically we can do one thing
we can remove it we can go back to HTML
and and we have this input one over here
we'll copy it from here we'll come back
to sign up page and we'll save it so
here you can see it looks fine so some
of them are not working obviously
because here for email we have used the
input as email so for that to work what
we need to do is we need to write here
again after a comma we need to write
here input then inside these brackets we
need to write here type is equals to
email and for one more we need to write
here
input type is equals to number fine save
it now and here you can see these two
are also working the text area we can
also use over here so what we can do is
we can write here text area only and it
will work as well so we need to change
the Box sizing for this add address
attribute or we can say for the text
area attribute so one thing we are going
to do here is we are going to write
here text area as
well let's see if it works you can see
we have written text area over here and
it works completely fine now fine so
here you can see we have both the pages
now if we move back to a login form you
can see this is a login form and this is
a registration form so it looks nice so
what we can do is we can go over here
login form and we can click on register
and it will take us to a registration
form because these two pages are linked
together fine so this is how we can
create a HTML login or sign up page
