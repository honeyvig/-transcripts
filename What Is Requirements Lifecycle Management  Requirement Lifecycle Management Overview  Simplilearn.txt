Ado let's get started we will get
started by understanding what exactly is
requirements lifecycle management and
followed by that we will go through the
different stages of requirement
lifecycle management and then we will
understand each and every stage in a bit
more detail that is by understanding
Trace requirements then maintain
requirements followed by that
prioritized requirements and next assess
requirements changes and lastly approved
requirements I hope I made myself clear
with the agenda now let's get started
with the first topic what is
requirements life cycle management the
answer for this question is the process
of monitoring planning analyzing
managing and communicating
organizational requirements is called
requirements life cycle management it's
clear that managing the life cycle of
requirements can have a deciding impact
on the outcome of the project managing
requirements lifecycle requires a
business analyst to manage and maintain
requirements while identifying
relationships with designs assessing
changes and helping reach consensus on
those changes now let's proceed with the
stages of requirements life cycle
management
so requirements lifecycle management has
five different stages first you will get
to trace the requirements then you
maintain the requirements proceeding
ahead you have the prioritization of
requirements next you have assessing of
requirements and the changes required
and lastly approve the changes now let's
understand each one of them in detail
firstly Trace requirements
tracing requirements involves analysis
and maintaining relationships between
requirements designs and solutions which
should provide the basis for impact
analysis allocation and coverage the
life cycle of every requirement needs to
be identified and recorded in a way that
ensures backward and forward
stressability through traceability the
business analyst can ensure that the
solution is aligned to the requirement
and manage the scope timeline risks and
potential costs it's also helpful for
discovering requirement inconsistencies
and flaws and provide a better
understanding of the change tracing
enables the analysts to assess at any
given moment if certain requirements
have been addressed or not the elements
of requirements tracing are level of
formality relationships traceability
repository the main guidelines and tools
used for tracing the requirements are
domain knowledge information management
approach legal or regulatory information
and requirements management tools or
repositories the techniques that the
business analyst will most likely use
are business rules analysis functional
decomposition process modeling and scope
modeling for this let's proceed to the
next stage which is about maintaining
requirements maintaining requirements is
necessary for keeping the requirements
and Designs accurate and current
throughout the cycle it also enables
their reuse if needed maintenance of
requirements is crucial for preserving
their validity through a process
especially since it represents a certain
organizational need to maximize the
benefits from maintaining environments
the business analyst must make sure that
the requirements are consistently
represented approved and reviewed using
standard procedures and easy to access
to understand now the main elements of
requirements maintenance are maintaining
requirements maintaining attributes
reusing requirements now while
maintaining requirements the business
analysts commonly use information
management approach as a useful
guideline or tool besides this there are
several helpful business analysts
techniques business rule analysis data
flow diagrams data modeling document
analysis functional decomposition
process modeling use cases and scenarios
and user stories now proceeding ahead we
have prioritized requirements
prioritizing requirements or ranking
them in order of importance helps
business analysts access the value risk
and urgency related to the certain
requirement and Designs this ensures
that the most important requirements and
Designs are always at the top of the
queue for analysis the relevance of the
requirements to their stakeholders plays
the most important part of the ranking
and according to this the requirement
can be prioritized to a greater or
lesser extent the task of prioritizing
requirements has three key elements
which are basis of prioritization
challenges of prioritization and
Continuum prioritization there are also
some useful business analysis techniques
for this process such as backlog
management business cases decision
analysis estimation Finance financial
analysis interviews item tracking
prioritization risk analysis and
management workshops Etc now proceeding
further we will understand the next
stage that is SS requirements when
assessing requirements change the
business analysts evaluate every
existing and potential new stakeholder
requirement and design so they can make
an informed decision whenever an action
on those requirements is required every
change to the requirements and Designs
has its implications and analysts assess
those changes to estimate the impact of
those changes on the project this task
need to be performed every time a new
need arises or the possible solution is
proposed now there are three main
elements of task of assessing
requirements changes are assessment
formality impact analysis impact
resolution also there are some key
business techniques used for this
particular step which are business cases
business rules analysis decision
analysis requirement analysis estimation
financial analysis interface analysis
interviews item tracking risk analysis
and management and lastly workshops
proceeding further the last stage which
is approved requirements during the
approving of the requirements the
business analysts work closely with the
stakeholders with the role in the
garnish process to approve and agree on
certain requirements and Designs
reaching the agreement and obtaining
approval is crucial for the continuation
of the business analysis process the key
elements of the requirements approval
tasks Landing stakeholders rules
conflict and issue management gaining
consensus and lastly tracking and
communicating the approval some business
analysis techniques that will be most
likely used in this particular segment
are acceptance and evaluation criteria
decision analysis item tracking reviews
and workshops and with that we have
reached to the Love Stage of requirement
