hi everyone this is dr. Madhuri today
we'll discuss about few important viral
infections like herpangina hand foot
mouth disease measles German measles
mumps and acute limb for nordella
pharyngitis if you go into the first
infection with herpangina this
herpangina will present with the most
important manifestation means it is also
called as an abscess pharyngitis or a
vesicular pharyngitis so this is caused
by a Coxsackie group of viruses like
types one two six eight ten or twenty
two and this is number is very important
and other eco viruses like nine sixteen
and seventeen can cause happen china and
india virus number 71 is also a
theological factor for the head Pangea
the transmission of this herpangina
maybe because of ingestion or a direct
contact or a droplet spread and it is
mostly a summer disease and mostly
occurs in many children clinical
features include it mostly incubation
period is of two to ten days this mostly
starts or begins with a sore throat
cough rhinorrhea there is be a low-grade
fever and headache and then afterwards
there is a formation of small vesicles
which ruptures and forms analysis and
these ulcers show a grey base and a
inflamed periphery on the anterior
portion pillars so you can see in the
picture here showing the Passaic I mean
ulcers on the on anterior for shield
penis and even it can involve zero
fanning soft palate and uvula so these
ulcers are not extremely painful but the
patient may complains of dysphasia and
they can be healed within a period of
seven to ten days treatments is mostly
with their corticosteroids in the low
doses it reduces the inflammation and
pain another six for three to six days
to reduce the pain and there will be of
use of antiseptic mouthwashes and you
have to remember that patient is advised
to take a soft food then the second
infection is a hand foot and mouth
disease the theology of viruses may be
Coxsackie a virus number 16 less
frequently with a 5 9 and 10 eco virus
number 11 and enterovirus number 71
these are the theological factors were
hand foot and mouth disease and this
virus infection is also most commonly in
children you can see a maculopapular
rash and which then there will be
formation of vesicular lesions on the
skin and mostly involves in the hand
feet legs and arms and the patient may
exhibit all prodromal symptoms oral
manifestations it will be of sore mother
we can see the sole mouth and because of
there will be of small multiple and
vesicular and serrated lesions in the
oral cavity the common sites for this
oral manifestations are hard palate
tongue and buccal mucosa and even in
this condition you can see the tongue
will become very red and edematous
so in laboratory findings you can see
the intracytoplasmic viral inclusions
and this viral isolates can be obtained
whether from a rectal or a throat sprats
which show for the vesicular fluid and
there will be of arise in acute or
convalescent serum antibody titer to
Coggs a key a 16 treatment you have to
give that symptomatic treatment here
because the patient will have a senior
pain that affected pay a patient should
stay in the bed for a 3 to 4 days and
there is no specific antiviral therapy
but the thing is you have to give a
supportive care like nutrient
supplements along with the hydration
therapy
antipyretics for a subsiding of fever
and this disease is self-limiting that
means it will subside within a period of
one week to 14 days then coming to acute
limb for Nordahl or pharyngitis here the
etiology for this thing is
coxsackievirus 8
incubation is of two to ten days and it
most commonly seen in children and in
adults and here their elevation of
temperature will be of very more where
you'll see a hundred degree foreign heat
or not fire degree foreign aid fever you
can be see here and the symptomatic
course of that means that symptoms may
be last for four to fourteen days under
this local oral lesions will heal in the
period of six to ten days
but even that Edyta mccann be seen for
the seven several days these are the
oral manifestations where you can see
end rays to discrete and whitish solid
papules surrounded by the erythema and
usually lesions are not vesicular here
and so they do not ulcer it and mostly
the lesions occur on uvula soft palate
anterior pillars and posterior
oropharynx in histopathological features
you can see a papal certain audience
which can say consists of a hyperplastic
lymphoid aggregates and intranuclear
inclusion bodies and treatment and there
is no treatment required here because
this disease is mostly a self-limiting
descent disease coming to the next
infection mazes it is also called as a
ruby olla this is very important name
you make you should not confuse with the
german measles or a rubella and here
this is also a acute and contagious
infection etiology is with the
paramyxovirus this is a RNA virus
incubation is of a two to one days
transmission is mostly through
respiratory secretions or in direct
contact of droplets in the clinical
features there will be of mostly they
arise during the spring seasons and
individuals will be of infectious from
two days before becoming the symptomatic
until four days and there will be of
associated with the rash and this virus
is mostly associated with
lymphoid hyperplasia so then as lymphoid
tissue is involved so in all sides are
like tonsils and adenoids and you can
see the Giants and in
generation in various tissues along with
vasculitis so these two are responsible
for the characteristic rash there are of
three strains of infection here which
each stays last for about three days so
there will be a fail it designates that
the measles will last about for a period
of nine days and first three days are
dominated by three C's that means you'll
have a chorus ah that is runny nose
cough and conductivities and fever will
be accompanied with these symptoms and
during the initial stage you will see a
important characteristic feature is
complex pots and this complex on spots
there are multiple areas of mucosal
edema which can be seen on buccal and
labial mucosa and even this in this
thing you'll see a small number of small
blue white modules in the second stage
even the fever continues but this
complex pots get faded away and a
maculopapular and erythematous rash
begins so phase is involved first here
that is in the second stage within which
eventual downfall kind extremities and
here you can see a diffuse maculopapular
eruption and they will tend to blanch on
pressure third stage fever ends and even
that maculopapular rash begins to fade
away and they there will be of that with
the rash is replaced by a brown pigment
restaining and common complications in
children there will be of a otitis media
or a pneumonia or a persistent
bronchitis and diarrhea if there is
delayed complication term there will be
of a subacute sclerosing parents of
lightness which arises a day late Loven
years after the initial infection this
is very important
so this degenerative disorder of CNS
will cause personality changes ceases
coma death if you go into the
histological features there will
initially complex spots are of areas of
focal hyper para keratosis and number of
nuclei within the Zayn's
ranges from three to more than 25 which
our callers worked in fine kill a giant
cells this is very important and if you
go into the close examination of
epithelial cells it caused it we can see
a pink staining inclusions in the
nuclear are a less common in the
cytoplasm so mostly intron site of
intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion
bodies can be seen treatment is mostly
by fluids and non-aspirin antipyretics
as they cause race syndrome and other
any me know compromised patients we can
use rebuffering immunoglobin interferon
and vitamin a and even a vaccine is
there to prevent this viral infection
so next infection is rubella or German
measles and this is a mild viral illness
with a it produced by a virus which
belongs to toca virus and genus is Ruby
virus and here this will I mean this is
very important because this infection
have a capacity to induce birth develop
birth defects in the developing fetus an
incubation period may be of 14 to 21
days and it is contagious from one week
before the exam time and after the
develop and five days after the
development of rush and this line finds
with congenital infection may releases
the virus even for up to a period of one
year clinical features mostly they are
asymptomatic and frequency of the
symptoms will be of greater than a doll
essence so prodromal symptoms can be
seen here before example and along with
lymph adenopathy of sub-recipient if not
supposed to articular a cervical chains
and the first sign of infection is a
eggs and tomatoes rash here it mostly
begins on the face and neck
where it spreads entire body within it
readings and even it exhibits a facial
clearing before the rash spreads and
this rash will be resolved in three days
so the classic tired of congenital
rubella syndrome is deafness heart
disease and cataracts it is very
important
oral manifestations this characteristic
thing is like for Seamus sign they are
nothing but small discreet or a dark red
pebbles which mostly present on the soft
palate and then here this example rash
usually become evident in a boat of six
hours of time after the first symptom
treatment is off with where it is not
needed necessary but you can use non
aspirin antibiotics and antipyretic
medications and the passive immunity can
be given with the human rebel Lima no no
villain there will be of a to scare to
those vaccinations can deal with this
MMR vaccine and it should be recommended
then if you go into the mums this is
also called as an epidemic parotitis
mostly with the acute contagious viral
infection and you'll see a bilateral
swelling of the parotid gland and even
it may involve the meninges pancreas and
go nuts and the childhood is of four to
six years whereas in incubation period
two to three weeks the transmission is
mostly with the respiratory route
pathogens is because once it is
transmitted to droplet nuclear saliva it
will starts replicating in the
respiratory epithelium then it's blood
spreads to the local lymph nodes and if
you see the affected area there is a
very vascular and interstitial mono
nuclear cell infiltrates and even there
will be of necrosis of asana and
Athenian duct cells even seen in the
saliva glands so this occurs mostly in
the children between the ages of four to
six years and there will be of
enlargement of the salivary gland with
preauricular pain fever malaise headache
and myalgia mostly in 10% of cases only
in one the submandibular glands and
there will there is the enlargement and
is sadder and there is a painful thing
on palpation and that swelling may be of
robbery or a elastic and it will elevate
them here which lasts for about one week
I neither
pain and um darkness is seen during the
rapid phase of the parotid enlargement
and here there will be offered in
celebrate that are an inflammation but
without a purulent discharge and once
the gland may occur it may become
symptomatic within a period of 24 to 48
hours and usually bilateral swelling can
be seen which is approximately lasts for
seven days and you can you can see a
priest terminal and him also
complications are like mild meningitis
encephalitis deafness myocarditis
thyroiditis pancreatitis and you for
itis and even the males can experience
epididymitis orchitis so there will be
of errors resulting in a testicular
atrophy and infertility so these are the
main complications regarding this mums
treatment is with palliative in nature
that is supportive care and hydration
therapy non-aspirin analysis and - we
have to give a bed rest
and to minimize the orchitis you have to
avoid sore foods and drinks which will
decrease the salivary gland discomfort
and proper vaccination is there for this
so thereby preventing the infection
