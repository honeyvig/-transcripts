but don't just believe us listen to what
our Learners have to say about our
courses
during my graduation we were taught
traditional advertising but the industry
demanded digital skills so finding a job
in the digital marketing domain was a
challenge for me I thought a
certification in digital marketing would
help me get a job and it did after the
course I was hired by pantalo as a
digital media specialist with a 20
salary hike and now I'm finally doing
what I like
hey I'm Isaiah Moore I live in Arizona
and the United States I did my
graduation in 2020 in strategic
Communications from Northern Arizona
University in 2020 I joined Nova Home
Loans as a trailing documents
coordinator and worked there for almost
a year in fact I worked at various
places as a student but after graduation
I couldn't find a job in my field of
study or anything that aligned with my
interests I gave tens of interviews but
without any luck the reason
I lacked practical skills on top of that
I had no certification in digital
marketing in particular
so last year I decided to upskill myself
with a professional certificate program
in digital marketing offered by simply
learn in collaboration with Purdue
University I think it was a very good
decision I really liked the curriculum
it helped me enhance my Knowledge and
Skills last year itself after the course
I was hired by pantalope as a digital
media specialist with a 20 salary height
and this year I was promoted to digital
marketing account making
I finally found my footing in the
digital marketing domain and I think the
certification had a huge role to play
the certification helped me pursue my
desired career path I can use my skills
and experience to become a freelance
digital marketer one day upskilling has
helped me turn my dream into a reality
