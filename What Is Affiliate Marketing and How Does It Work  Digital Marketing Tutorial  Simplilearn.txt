how do you plan on generating traffic so
let's just click on YouTube first all

product now let's talk about about the
platforms to promote affiliate links so
the platforms where you can effectively
promote your affiliate products social
media platforms like Instagram Facebook
and Twitter are great for reaching a
broad audience additionally content
platforms such as YouTube and blogging
sites allow you to create valuable
content and drive traffic to your
affiliate links don't forget about
forums like Cura where you can engage
with potential customers and provide
helpful recommendations so now let's
navigate to Google and let's type
Q now we'll click on
this all right continue with
Google all right so here it is
CA so here you can also promote the
affiliate links because there's a
traffic over here as well so all you
have to do is to just select the
category which you want toe let just say
let's just say we are promoting a v
protein brand you are promoting a v
protein brand so we'll click on this and
we can also type here best W routine
Etc and you'll get the questions
similarly like what is the best W
protein brands in India what is the best
W protein brand for building muscles etc
etc so you can answer these questions by
clicking on this and by answering these
questions you can also attach a link and
make sure that the information you share
in Cur will be like proper information
and you have used that product
personally then only you can recommend
because then only you'll be your
audience will be attached with you
because it's a relationship that you
will build then only they'll trust you
so you can do that like that like
multiple questions are there you can
answer each and every questions and
attach the affiliate link of that
particular product this is also a way as
you can see if you click on questions
and these are the questions some people
have used as well I think and they have
mentioned
so this is a great way for promoting or
doing the affiliate marketing you can do
like this as well a lot of people do
like this another way is through YouTube
whether you're building a website
YouTube channel or any other platform
it's crucial to acknowledge that you
must reveal the use of affiliate links
the Federal Trade Commission that is FTC
mandates transparency when earning
income through endorsements emphasizing
the importance of openly disclosing such
affiliations so as I said YouTube is a
great way of promoting or doing
affiliate marketing so let's take the
same example again best way protein
we'll be taking this example only so as
you can see there are multiple
influencers out there and let's just
select this video so you can promote or
like do affiliate marketing in videos in
your own videos because a lot of traffic
after Google comes to YouTube and the
traffic you can navigate that
traffic
yeah so you can navigate that traffic to
your affiliate link so as we can see
this guy has attached an affiliate link
and also get up to 40% on this protein
powder so you can click on this and he
can get a commission out of it
and make sure that the product you are
promoting or doing the affiliate
marketing is the right product and then
only you can build a relationship with
your audiences so as as you can see this
guy has done that so you can do that and
this guy has like 340,000 views and
let's say if he's getting 2,000 or 3,000
clicks on this protein by suggesting
them so he'll get the commission a lot
of commission from that so this is a
nice way of promoting or doing the
affiliate marketing and this is how this
is a great way in fact this is the best
way I would say to do the affiliate
marketing because it is quite easy so
he's basically navigating that views or
that traffic to the affiliate link so
this is the another best way to promote
your or do the affiliate marketing
