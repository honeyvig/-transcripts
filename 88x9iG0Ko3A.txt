I'll be forced to tell you that all of

14
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:29,560
this will just happen in the order that

start

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,600
now this is

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,320
tyan he's asked me to create a video on

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,480
pars of how to create a chatting app so

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,719
I've decided to help him here's the

22
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,360
video answering his question I hope you

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,760
enjoy so hello there and welcome to

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,960
another tutorial my name is AI and this

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,719
time we're going to be going over the

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,519
tat app that I've created in Swift using

27
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,199
pars now what is the T chat app exactly

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,760
well simply put this is a chatting

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,439
application that I've created and it

30
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,439
doesn't use any normal database as a

31
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,479
back end it uses parse as a backend so

32
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,000
now I'm going to be teaching you exactly

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,720
how I did it it also includes a little

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,439
private chat mode and also a global chat

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,080
mode in case you were uh thinking about

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,680
chatting with hundreds of people or just

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,759
someone you know uh and you wanted to

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,320
discuss something with them like when

39
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,960
you're going on a trip or when you're

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,840
going on dinner or something like that

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,960
anyway continuing so now I'm going to be

42
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,240
telling you exactly what par even is uh

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,799
and then I'm going to explain a little

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,000
bit more in depth of how it's different

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,799
to the other swi dat basis parts that

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,479
I've done uh and then we will get into

47
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,439
the code after a little demonstration um

48
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,320
and also in case I haven't mentioned

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,320
this is Swift databases part five uh

50
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,280
Again part five I've done quite a few of

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,200
these uh um Swift databases Parts but

52
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
this is a very interesting tutorial uh

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,360
they seem uh to be very interesting to

54
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,439
you guys as well and there pretty fun

55
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,439
for me to make as well anyway continuing

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,759
let's get into it but what is Parts

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,119
exactly well simply put let's just say

58
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,120
this before I had to create my own

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,879
little custom database connect to it

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,879
using custom methods in Swift and that

61
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,640
was pretty nice but it was very memory

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,239
intensive and it was just very uh

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,680
extensive to build if you wanted to

64
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,760
start creating an application first you

65
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,640
had to plan it all out uh what HP files

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,280
would be there what databases would be

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,680
there how am I going to connect them

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,560
using Swift what am I going to do etc

69
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,599
etc uh but with parse it basically

70
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,720
solves all of that you can connect to a

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,879
parse database natively in Swift using

72
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,080
the parse API uh you don't need to have

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
any PHP uh in the uh in the background

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,959
uh doing stuff um uh and so now I'm just

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
going to explain how parse is different

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
from the others as switch databases

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,800
parts that I've done uh now simply put

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,239
quickly

79
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,440
though parse doesn't require a PHP

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,200
backend to help communicate with swift

81
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,640
so this is what would happen before in

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,440
older Swift

83
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,440
databases uh we would have Swift over

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,080
here and this is uh where you're trying

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,319
to get all your information or where

86
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,440
you're trying to upload from we'd have

87
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,280
PHP over

88
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,200
here and we also have our my

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,120
ql database over

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,319
here now what would happen is I would

91
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,080
Bridge Swift to PHP PHP would bridge

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,879
over to

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,760
mySQL uh so this is what would happen

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,400
then MySQL would give information to PHP

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
and then PHP would give it back to Swift

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,920
but then if I were to try to upload what

97
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,799
would

98
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,040
happen Swift would uh talk to

99
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,040
PHP oh sorry mixed the H and the

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,840
P so would talk to PHP then uh the PHP

101
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,040
would upload into MySQL which was also

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,360
sometimes a bit glitchy sometimes it

103
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,639
wouldn't upload uh and stuff like that

104
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,320
so that was just uh in general a really

105
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,280
workaround sort of way to do this I mean

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,080
this is the pretty much only way you can

107
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,360
do this if you don't want to use

108
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,560
something like parse or

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,720
something uh

110
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,800
but still if there's better ways you can

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,479
do it like this anyway continuing now

112
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,880
this is how we're going to do it with

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,680
parse just erase this and then I'll

114
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,000
explain what we're doing with

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
parse

116
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
okay uh so now oh yeah just by the way

117
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,440
quickly uh parse was actually created by

118
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,120
a developer actually a team uh but then

119
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,639
eventually it was bought out by Facebook

120
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,800
and now it's also open source uh so uh

121
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
just in case you wanted to know that you

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,280
can actually modify the pars apis and

123
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,960
stuff uh and so it's pretty interesting

124
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,240
like that but we're just going with a

125
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,240
native parse apis we don't need anything

126
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,360
else anyway continuing now this is what

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,880
we're doing with

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
parse you'll see what I wrote there in

129
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,000
just a

130
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
second

131
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,919
that's it we're taking a parse back end

132
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,199
that's what be stands for a parse back

133
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,520
end over

134
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,680
here adding this API to Swift now Swift

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,520
is capable of immediately interacting

136
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,360
with parse and

137
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,440
back so we don't need PHP or

138
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,080
anything we don't need a custom mySQL

139
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,440
database okay oh you don't need to have

140
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,919
your own

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,520
website and it's

142
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,039
100%

143
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,160
free at this time not sure about later

144
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,319
but for now it's free for all of you

145
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,879
that don't want to exactly pay for a

146
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,520
website it's free for now

147
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,639
and so as you can see the advantages are

148
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,160
literally just stacking up over here

149
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,759
compared to our older method of using

150
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,360
databases anyway so now how does this

151
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,680
chatting app work exactly well let's

152
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,160
just take this example or let me just

153
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,919
wipe this right

154
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,879
off so this chatting app does use a

155
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,800
parse database of course as I've said uh

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,479
it uses AB absolutely no PHP you do not

157
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,080
need a website in order to be able to do

158
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,639
this and you just need pure Swift

159
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,960
knowledge so let's get started let's

160
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,039
just say we have three clients over here

161
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,120
one iPhone another iPhone another iPhone

162
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,159
these all have my T chat app running on

163
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,759
them so this is uh client number one two

164
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,039
and

165
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,280
three so now this is our pars

166
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
database

167
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,879
now first of all we have a timer in this

168
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,039
app so for

169
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,440
Tat we have a

170
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,039
timer that updates every 1

171
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,560
second and so what this timer is

172
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,840
doing is every 1

173
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,000
second

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,680
these uh clients are going to the pars

175
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,080
database and then they're retrieving

176
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,959
every single message that's in the

177
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,200
database now we're not just playing

178
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,160
blank putting it on the screen because

179
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
we have to do a bit processing and

180
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,800
filtering

181
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,000
first now in parse we have a few

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,200
databases uh such as

183
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,399
user sorry forgot you and user

184
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,959
okay we have

185
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,279
users which we'll talk about later this

186
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,440
is just the uh users that are uh that uh

187
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
have been registered and can log in but

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,680
there's one more thing chat so now this

189
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,279
is one table sorry this is a table not a

190
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,880
database this is a table now this has uh

191
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,920
The Columns

192
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
username

193
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,120
message and

194
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,880
two now what's happening right as we

195
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,040
receive uh right as we download all this

196
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
chat information from our po database

197
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,680
what's happening

198
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,560
is we're

199
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,279
checking is the two field

200
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,320
blank if it's blank this is

201
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,519
Global if yes it's Global if no it's

202
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,600
private and so if it's private we want

203
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,240
to

204
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,200
check uh

205
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,839
chatting is this person currently

206
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,200
chatting with the person with this

207
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,079
username are we chatting with this this

208
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,200
username if

209
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
yes

210
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
display if

211
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,519
no then uh nothing do nothing with this

212
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,600
message and also if it's Global just

213
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,959
display it's that

214
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,639
simple and so effectively this creates

215
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,079
both a method to privately chat with

216
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,399
people and publicly chat with people

217
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,320
instantly so now what's next see when

218
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,399
you send a message what's happening well

219
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,399
what's happening just really simply

220
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,360
we're

221
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,360
checking

222
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,360
chatting if

223
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,240
yes then

224
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,760
who

225
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,320
and so then we upload with the

226
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,240
username

227
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,519
self or whatever that user's username is

228
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,639
the message as of course the

229
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,079
message and two as

230
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,240
who if we're not chatting

231
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,760
then we just uh write two as blank um

232
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,960
message as of course

233
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,839
[Music]

234
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,210
message and

235
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,560
[Music]

236
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,040
username as

237
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,399
username sorry that U and M are capital

238
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,160
so I'm just going to change

239
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
that

240
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,519
and that is quite

241
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,600
simple uh sorry I guess I can do this so

242
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,440
you understand this is just syntax not

243
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,440
the actual parameter

244
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,880
so

245
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,959
okay okay and so this is just a

246
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,680
really really just getting our toes wet

247
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,320
simple explanation of what's happening

248
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,639
when you see the code it's going to be a

249
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,120
bit complicated but I'm going to try my

250
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,720
best to make it as simple as possible

251
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,320
for you and of course the code will be

252
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,920
in the description so if you have any

253
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,000
questions uh or uh any concerns about

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,639
the code you can look at it in the

255
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,399
description and you will see uh the code

256
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,440
and you can modify T tier will uh and

257
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,399
you can just do whatever you want with

258
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,560
the code anyway so now that I'm done

259
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,279
explaining exactly how this app works I

260
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,920
can actually go to my Mac now and I'm

261
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,399
just going to show you a quick

262
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,639
demonstration of the app uh and so if

263
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,040
you like uh the demonstration you can

264
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,920
continue see the code uh and then we'll

265
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,040
be done and that's going to be it let's

266
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,920
go to the demonstration

267
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,279
now so now we're getting to the

268
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,000
demonstration of the app and as you can

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,759
see I have three devices open a

270
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,680
simulator my iPhone and one of my

271
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,480
friends iPhones so now we're all going

272
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,040
to register um and then we're going to

273
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,600
log in and actually start chatting as a

274
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,639
little demonstration of this app so my

275
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,800
friend over here is going to start

276
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,000

283
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,399
we're actually logging in and by default

284
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,839
it's Global if you want to private chat

285
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,880
there's an option to do that uh inside

286
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,320
of the app so as you can see my username

287
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,600
is going to be

288
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,600

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,199
the register button this will register

297
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:15,000
me and log me in now as you can see we

298

299
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,560
screen uh where we have a enter message

305
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,079

336
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,679
to sort of ruins the surprise you can

337
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,520
actually see him typing in the message

338
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,720
so you don't know what he's going to

339
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,520
send you so just ruins the suspense of

340
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,280
it okay so as you can see that pop up on

341
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,880
everybody's screen now I can

342
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,440
reply

343
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
uh it

344
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,400
was forgot

345
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
um it

346
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
was

347
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
anyway

348
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,280
sorry

349
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,799
Mars I'm purposely making it this long

350
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,480
so you can see how it wraps

351
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,320
text so I'm going to send and it pops up

352
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,760
on everybody's

353
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
device

354
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,760
anyway now we're going to continue

355
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,840
chatting we're just going to finish this

356
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
up then I'll show you that even the

357
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,520
simulator can

358
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,679
chat right after my friend's typing in

359
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,280
his message uh be able to

360
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,520
continue

361
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,520
so

362
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
my

363
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

364
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,120
so's see what he

365
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,960
wrote that's great so maybe we could go

366
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,880
up there etc etc now I'm just going to

367
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,679
scroll down on the simulator so now

368
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,440
okay so the

369
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,320
message okay so actually and this is

370
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
this is pretty much like a fact video

371
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,679
for you now but I'm just trying to

372
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,520
um finish up this message for some

373
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,280
reason it won't let me bring up the

374
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,400
keyboard it's actually Frozen Okay much

375
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,039
better so

376
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,039
now

377
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,120
actually

378
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,000
sometimes it freezes up a

379
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,360
bit so okay there we go much

380
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,630
better

381
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,720
[Music]

382
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,320
actually the

383
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,440
[Music]

384
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,159
soil

385
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,679
there is

386
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,840
toxic so no

387
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
potatoes

388
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,480
so as you can see it

389
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,559
sends then in a second I can also show

390
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,440
you but you can actually scroll

391
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
down

392
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:47,679
yeah and

393
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,720
so send my friend sends that but now the

394
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
simulator joins in and says hey they've

395
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,799
been talking about this this this Etc

396
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,520
ETA so basically

397
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,440
uh he can write a message saying uh well

398
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,320
maybe

399
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,240
oh hey

400
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,440
guys that

401
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,200
sounds cool any more

402
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,440
news and as you can see it pops up on

403
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,000
all of our

404
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,440
devices and so

405
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,039
I can just type

406
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,320
in really

407
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,320
quickly

408
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,080
sorry none

409
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,600
yet will keep

410
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,880
you informed

411
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,360
though there we

412
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,159
go uh and so that is a really simple

413
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,080
demonst rtion of how this Global chat

414
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,279
really works uh but then there's also

415
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,679
supposed to be private chat so let's say

416
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,640
only me and Thomas wanted to discuss uh

417
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,039
something like a Tripper going on so I'm

418
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,760
just going to type in uh into mine and I

419
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,200
don't want you to do it just yet but I'm

420
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,480
just going to type in

421
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,960
Thomas the

422
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,000
great 56 into my chat box and I'm going

423
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,640
to click on the chat button and it

424
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,880
clears out my table view well that's

425
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
actually supposed to

426
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,440
happen uh and you'll see why in just a

427
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,120
second

428
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,720
so next uh my friend Thomas over here

429
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,400
can click on the second text field

430
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,159
called users's

431
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,039
name over there and he can type in t

432
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,520
capital T May

433
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,679
bshi 3 three

434
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,000
three uh you put a two k

435
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,760
maybe you can fix

436
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,679
that wrong button okay good it's no

437
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,279
333 uh now click on the chat

438
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,960
button and we are in private chat mode

439
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,760
together so as you can see the simulator

440
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,240
still has all these messages but let's

441
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,440
just say I'm uh feeling in the mood for

442
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,360
hiking hiking hiking of course hiking uh

443
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,120
so

444
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,880
maybe something

445
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,720
like okay

446
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,279
so

447
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,720
what time are we

448
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,360
leaving for the

449
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,480
hiking now as you can

450
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,880
see uh Thomas has received my message

451
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,679
but the simulator can't see our messages

452
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,960
this is because it's in private chat

453
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,080
mode of

454
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,440
course now um my friend can reply here

455
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,320
uh he'll tell me what time we're

456
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
leaving

457
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,720
click on the send button not the chat

458
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
button

459
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,280
okay so now he says Saturday 6: a.m.

460
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,440
[Music]

461
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,440
sounds

462
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,240
good make sure not to forget

463
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,000
anything send and now as you can see

464
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
these three messages that we've sent

465
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,679
back and forth with each other uh uh

466
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,200
Thomas can see I can see but the

467
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,760
simulator cannot see because he's not

468
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,440
part of our private chat and it is that

469
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,000
simple to do a private chat in this app

470
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
anyway now we're going to go to the

471
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
coding part since we're done a

472
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,360
demonstration and I hope you all like

473
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,520
this app anyway now we're going to go to

474
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,039
the code part to explain how the code of

475
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,399
this app actually works so let's get

476
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:36,120
there around

477
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,840
now welcome back to the Mac part now as

478
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,039
you can see I have pars open up uh and

479
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,039
so this is the table we were putting all

480
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,159
of our chat messages into so we have

481
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,360
username meaning the username that sent

482
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,039
these messages the text or the text of

483
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,480
the message itself the two which is a

484
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,039
string which is who it was directed to

485
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,640
if if it was not directed to anyone it

486
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,399
was Global then it'll just be nothing uh

487
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:04,200
and that was actually quite

488
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,919
simple uh but anyway then we also have

489
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,159
the user uh table uh which has username

490
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
and password uh which is where we store

491
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,399
all our usernames and passwords uh so I

492
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,799
know this isn't the most secure way to

493
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,120
do this but uh this is just a simple

494
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,559
chatting app we're not really uh

495
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,880
encrypting or anything because we don't

496
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,720
need to this is just a simple barebones

497
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,120
thing if you want to make a real apps WP

498
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,559
out of this I mean you could do some

499
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,360
security uh with the passwords but I

500
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,440
don't need to right now anyway

501
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,720
continuing now that we know the parse

502
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,000
end let's look at the xcode end now

503
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,600
before I continue I have two storyboards

504
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,440
main. storyboard and Main iPhone 6.

505
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,640
storyboard the main. storyboard was

506
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,840
meant to work with iPhone 6 and 6 plus

507
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
the iPhone 6 storyboard was meant to

508
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
work with the iPhone 6 and the

509
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,159
6s or sorry

510
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,360
uh the main not storyboard was made to

511
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,799
work with the 6 Plus and

512
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,159
6s+ and the iPhone 6 was made for uh the

513
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,840
iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6s because those

514
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,159
have smaller screen sizes than the plus

515
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,720
versions and order to decide which

516
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,480
storyboard is uh opened on uh on launch

517
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,519
what we're doing is first of all in our

518
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,159
application did finish launching with

519
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,440
options we are checking if the UI

520
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,679
devices current device

521
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,159
is model name is equal to iPhone 6 or 6s

522
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:35,640
then switch over to the main iPhone 6.

523
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,960
storyboard so that uh it fits on the

524
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,200
screen uh and if you were wondering what

525
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,159
this line of code is doing it's

526
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,679
basically setting the parses application

527
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,279
ID to this and the client key to

528
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,880
this

529
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,679
continuing now the chat View and in case

530
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:56,320
you were wondering uh if you can

531
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,519
actually use this no I'm actually going

532
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,519
to be changing this so doesn't matter

533
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,480
even if you find out I don't need to

534
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,600
blur It Anyway

535
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,480
continuing next in our we have three

536
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,360
files chat cell which is a UI table view

537
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,279
cell login View and chat

538
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,200
view now the chat cell is our custom UI

539
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,960
table view cell which will allow us to

540
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,480
store a message on the screen now this

541
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,640
is a chat cell uh subass of UI table

542
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,080
view cell uh with an IB Outlet chat text

543
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,159
and IB Outlet chat

544
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:34,080
user chat text is the

545
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,159
actual uh message that the user sent and

546
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,200
the chat user is who sent this the chat

547
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,440
text is a UI text view in case it's long

548
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,120
and the chat user is just a label why

549
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,240
would you have a really long

550
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,200
name then the login view this is really

551
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,159
simple all we're doing is we are

552
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,240
creating an IB Outlet username and

553
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,320
password both UI text fields we have an

554
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,960
IB action called login which

555
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,559
basically uh

556
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,679
sorry yeah yeah uh just really quickly

557
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,519
uh this code over here uh this UI device

558
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,600
code that gets the model name uh is was

559
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,200
actually taken by I forgot his name I

560
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,399
will definitely put a link to his stack

561
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,760
Overflow uh Link in the description

562
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,399
below uh so you can check that out many

563
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,120
thanks to that person who made it

564
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,000
because he is allowing me to actually

565
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,720
see what type of device we're actually

566
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,120
running

567
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,519
or else I can't do this anyway

568
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,640
continuing now in the login view in our

569
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,840
ibaction function called login we are

570
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,519
collecting all logins as a PF query to

571
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,159
the class name called user to get all

572
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,679
the data from the user

573
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,960
table we are setting the objects to try

574
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,240
exclamation mark meaning Force try uh

575
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,639
this logins doind objects uh method then

576
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:58,559
We're looping through the object

577
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,559
we're saying current

578
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,720
username is equal to I doob for key

579
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,440
username as a string and then same thing

580
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,240
for

581
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,480
password then we're checking if the

582
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,279
current username that we're on in the

583
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
loop is equal to the username that you

584
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
entered and the password is equal to the

585
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,600
password you entered then set the

586
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,120
current session username to the current

587
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,399
uh username set the current session's

588
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,000
password to the current password perform

589
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,399
a SE to segue sorry to chat uh with a

590
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,320
sender self uh and then break this Loop

591
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,760
because why continue right then when we

592
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,240
register we do something uh quite

593
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,639
different

594
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:42,840
actually sorry we're still getting the

595
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,919
logins as a PF query to class user we're

596
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,159
still getting the objects we're still

597
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,760
looping through the objects but we're

598
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,000
only getting the username this

599
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,120
time if the username in the loop is

600
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,399
equal to the username entered then just

601
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:59,679
return because we do not want to create

602
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,600
a duplicate

603
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,159
username but if that doesn't happen it

604
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,200
won't return meaning we will create a

605
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,840
new query called of a PF object uh

606
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,080
called of class name user we're going to

607
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,720
set the value username in this query to

608
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,840
the usernames text username text field

609
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,399
then we're going to set the password

610
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:24,120
value of this query to password.

611
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,039
text we're going to try exclamation mark

612
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,720
meaning for try to save this query onto

613
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,080
the parse database then we're going to

614
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,399
just call the login function in the uh

615
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,919
for the username and password that was

616
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:38,919
entered uh because it's in the database

617
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,399
now it can automatically log Us in uh

618
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,679
because why should we have to relog in

619
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,760
if the register function can do it for

620
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,039
us finally the chat view then I'll

621
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,799
explain the UI in the chat view we have

622
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,080
a UI view controller uh uh sorry subass

623
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,440
of UI View controller UI table view

624
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,600
delegate UI table view data source and

625
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,840
UI text field

626
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,799
delegate and so we have three IB Outlets

627
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
table view message and chat with the

628
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,279
table view is subass of UI table view

629
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,600
the message is CL subass of UI text

630
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,080
field and chat with this subass of UI

631
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,919
text field again then we have a Boolean

632
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,960
called chatting with is equal to false

633
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,200
because of course uh this is just

634
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
storing if we're privately chatting with

635
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,080
someone and by default it's no we're in

636
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,760
global chat then we have the update

637
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,440
timer which is equal to a new NS timer

638
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,279
then the update delay which is 1.0

639
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,960
meaning every one second then we have

640
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,440
the current data which is an array of

641
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,639
dictionaries of string string type which

642
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:45,000
is blank by

643
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,200
default then what we're doing is we're

644
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,279
setting the update timer to a new NS

645
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,679
timer with a scheduled timer with time

646
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,880
interval the update delay meaning 1

647
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
second we're targeting ourself we're

648
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,360
calling the update function every 1

649
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,919
second we're giving it no user info and

650
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,639
we're telling it to repeat so every 1

651
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,039
second we are calling the update

652
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:07,000
function next we're saying in the text

653
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,599
field should return function we first of

654
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,119
all are returning true of course and

655
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,520
then we're just telling oursel self.

656
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,359
view. and editing true meaning force it

657
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,399
meaning always hide the keyboard like no

658
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,359
matter

659
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:23,639
what then the main juice of this class

660
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,240
the update function the update function

661
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,960
will take a query as a p F query to the

662
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,480
class name called chat in our pars

663
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,879
database it'll set the limit to a th

664
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,919
it'll find the objects by doing VAR

665
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:39,800
objects is equal to force TR query. find

666
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,280
objects it'll set the current data to a

667
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,399
blank array it'll Loop through the

668
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,960
objects it'll create a final dictionary

669
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,520
of string string

670
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,960
type it'll set the username of that

671
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,119
final dictionary to the username of the

672
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,879
current object that we're on as a string

673
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,680
same thing for the text of the actual uh

674
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,079
chat itself then we're checking if we're

675
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,040
chatting with someone then we want to

676
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,599
check if the username it was from is

677
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,359
equal to the person we're chatting with

678
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:16,720
and the person it's to is equal to

679
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:18,839
us

680
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,839
or the uh username that it was from is

681
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:25,000
equal to the current username and the

682
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
one that it's to is equal to the one

683
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,280
that we're chatting

684
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,079
with and so effectively all messages

685
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,920
from you to them and from them to you

686
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,040
are being displayed on

687
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,079
screen if this conditional were true

688
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,560
it'll append the final dictionary which

689
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,040
is the username and text into our

690
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,720
current data else it'll just check

691
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,119
meaning if we're not chatting with

692
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,319
someone if the two uh is equal to

693
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,920
nothing in that message meaning it

694
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,800
wasn't directed towards someone or else

695
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,240
we're looking at people's private

696
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,119
chats if that's true we set the current

697
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,520
data uh we append uh the final

698
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,160
dictionary to the current data then we

699
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,960
just reload our table view it's that

700
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,680
simple then our table view number of

701
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,079
rows in section function we just return

702
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,720
the current data as count and in our

703
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,200
self aroa index path function we're

704
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,920
creating a new cell which is a uh table

705
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,640
view. DQ reusable cell with identifier

706
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,480
custom chat cell as a new chat cell

707
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,000
we're setting the cells chat text text

708
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,319
to the current data's index path. row

709
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,480
text so that we're setting the the

710
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,200
actual message then we're setting the

711
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
username in the same

712
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,240
way then what we're doing finally is we

713
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,319
are actually returning this cell and so

714
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:53,200
this gets put onto our table

715
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,680
view next in our send IB action we're

716
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,079
creating an object or a PF object of

717
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:01,960
class name chat we're setting the object

718
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,880
username to the current session's

719
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,280
username we're setting the text to

720
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,960
message. text we're setting the object

721
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,760
to to first of all we're chatting

722
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,200
checking chatting with if we are

723
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,960
chatting with someone then set the chat

724
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,680
withs text meaning whoever we're

725
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,680
chatting with uh is the two value or

726
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,480
else just make it

727
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,560
blank then you have to try to you have

728
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,520
have to force try to save this object

729
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,800
onto the par

730
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,880
database then we're setting messages

731
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,480
text to nothing so once you send it

732
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
should clear out of your uh text field

733
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,240
or else it's an annoyance of you having

734
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,200
to actually um like erase it every time

735
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,480
and then we're just ending edited ending

736
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,359
editing uh uh force uh so that all the

737
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:52,200
keyboard just gets

738
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,640
hidden and then finally we have an

739
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,680
initiate private chat function uh which

740
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,599
will just start a private chat with

741
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,800
anybody you like so we're just setting

742
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,640
chatting with to not chatting with

743
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,880
meaning if it's true it'll become false

744
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,599
if it's false it'll become true so if

745
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,359
you were not chatting with somebody you

746
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:12,400
now are if you were chatting with

747
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,880
somebody now you're

748
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,240
not then we're setting chat with text to

749
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,599
we're checking if you're chatting with

750
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,560
someone if you're chatting with someone

751
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,440
keep it the same or else make it blank

752
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,920
again it is that simple and that is all

753
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,160
the code you need to create a working

754
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,400
chatting app in Swift now I'm just going

755
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,359
to go over to my iPhone really quick you

756
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:33,720
won't be able to see what I'm doing

757
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,040
right now uh but it'll be worth it

758
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,000
because what I'm going to

759
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,800
do is I'm going to

760
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,000
delete all of this data from

761
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,079
pars now if I go into this uh app I log

762
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,400
in really

763
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,440
quickly

764
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,520
okay log

765
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,680
again okay I've logged in now if I enter

766
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,000
a message here hi now if I reload my

767
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:20,240
parse as you can see it has actually

768
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,560
inserted this text into the database so

769
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,440
it's really interesting how that works

770
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,599
as well I can even Brute Force more

771
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,200
users in delete some users I can delete

772
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,240
some chats put some more chats in uh and

773
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,800
it's just really simple like that and

774
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,240
that's actually going to be all for this

775
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,440
