1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,840
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,279
tutorial my name is T bakshi and this

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,799
time we're going to be going over the

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,040
IBM Watson natural language classifier

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,000
in

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,559
bluex so you must be wondering and

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,280
actually before I get started this is a

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,720
part two to my retrieve and rank video

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,359
for IBM Watson and you can visit that by

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,160
the link in the description it'll

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,960
probably also be in the related video

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,039
section anyway getting straight to the

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,039
point what is the natural language

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,960
classifier well simply put let's say we

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,280
have two different categories male and

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,320
female

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,760
names and let's say we give Watson tons

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,000
of example of female names and tons of

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
examples of male names what'll happen is

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,440
if we give it a new name then after it's

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,320
done training a new name that it's never

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,520
even heard

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,960
before it'll estimate if this is

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,120
probably a male name or probably a

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,719
female name this is actually quite

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,320
interesting let me show you a quick demo

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,399
on the

28
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,439
Whiteboard okay so now let's get started

29
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,200
and let's create a little uh t-

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,600
chart here we're going to have girl

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,200
names and here we're going to have boy

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,680
names so now let's just start listing

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,159
off some girl and boy names uh like

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,600
Kathy there's John

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
right uh we have stuff like

36
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,050
Sarah we have

37
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,150
[Music]

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,000
Peter we have

39
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,799
Lisa we have um

40
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,840
Robert a few more Samantha

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,280
uh

42
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:17,200
Brandon we have um one more

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,920
Tracy

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,560
and one more

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,840
Anna uh for boys we can have uh uh

46
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,519
Frank and we can have

47
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,120
Mike let me just think of one more

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,280
name okay got it but I won't be putting

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,720
it in this okay so now we have tons of

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,080
girl names and tons of boy names now

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,720
let's just imagine I know these are just

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,920
like 1 2 3 4 5 six names for each but

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,599
let's just imagine that that there were

54
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,280
thousands of girl names and thousands of

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
boy names okay now let's imagine that

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,440
over here on the Whiteboard or actually

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,400
over here we have the

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,120
NLC

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,400
service now this is very interesting

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,560
this is one great service over here this

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,480
is one of the most advanced IBM Watson

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,239
Services I would say you even rank

63
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,879
sometimes uh would be more useful than

64
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,480
this but again that's an entirely

65
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,319
separate use case now natural language

66
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,720
classifier over here what you're going

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,280
to do you're going to give it all of

68
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,400
this information basically all of this

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,360
information we're going to give

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,760
it the first of all training

71
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,599
data as we did for the retrieving

72
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,280
rank then what we're going to do is

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
we're also going to give it uh something

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,680
to classify

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,159
or else there's really no point of the

76
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,879
service uh and so what's going to happen

77
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,280
is once we give it the training data

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,519
it's going to start grinding it up and

79
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,599
stuff and what's going to happen is it's

80
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,000
going to use machine learning

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,600
algorithms and what this will do is

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,919
let's say we have these names over here

83
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,440
if we can move over here to the

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,320
names this machine learning algorithm

85
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,440
will find literally any pattern among

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,960
these names it'll look for patterns in

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,400
between each letter of the names for

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,639
each name and the patterns that match

89
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,759
with each other among the entire data

90
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,720
set will be used as pattern matching to

91
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,600
see if something that you try to

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,560
classify should be girl or

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,360
boy again if I put this in a bit more

94
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,800
simple way uh what's going to happen is

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
it's going to

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,199
find uh it's going to make a set of

97
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,440
rules basically uh set of computer

98
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,600
rules uh so that it can determine later

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,080
whether something is a girl name or a

100
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,520
boy name because a a human it can't you

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,440
can't really start at a computer and say

102
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,720
you know what let's start writing so

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,319
many conditionals to see okay is this a

104
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,240
girl name okay it has to have these

105
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,840
these these these these letters in order

106
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,400
to have be a girl name these these these

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
these letters to be a boy name you can't

108
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,039
do that it's very very hard to make

109
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,479
conditionals manually so we just let the

110
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,319
computer do that work by making a

111
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,080
machine learning algorithm such as

112
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,000
natural language classifier does uh and

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,919
it finds patterns between the data by

114
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,160
itself and then creates a set of rules

115
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,520
so now we're going to give it a name

116
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,720
that it has not even heard before let's

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,360
give it something like uh Kelly for

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,400
example now again remember as with

119
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,360
everything it won't always get it right

120
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
sometimes times and this is very very

121
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,319
sometimes because I've mostly always had

122
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,800
success with the IBM Lots in natural

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,759
language classifier service just once in

124
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,680
a while that it just glitches out but uh

125
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,199
now we're going to come over

126
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,840
here now let's see what it outputs what

127
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,120
it's going to do is it's going to see hm

128
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,960
there're only girl and boy classes so

129
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,440
it's going to say I think it

130
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,639
is so and so let's just say for example

131
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,759
this isn't real data but let's just say

132
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,080
it's 90% sure that it's a girl

133
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,000
name and let's just say it's 15%

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,080
sure oh sorry anyway it's 15% shirt that

135
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,840
it's a boy

136
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,120
name so as you can see it says it's

137
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,720
Kelly is probably a girl name and so it

138
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,879
ranks that first and then we are able to

139
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,160
say you know what we're 90% sure that

140
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,319
this is a girl uh name now let's just uh

141
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,520
try changing Kelly to something like uh

142
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,639
I don't

143
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,400
know

144
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,919
um

145
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,759
bill now what's going to

146
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,400
happen

147
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,599
is the

148
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,639
service is going to again give us output

149
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
but let's just say this time it's

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,120
um 95% sure that it's a boy

151
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,280
name and pretty unsure like 5% sure

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,720
unsure uh 5% sure that it's a girl name

153
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,560
as you can see it's ranking boy above

154
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
girl because it thinks you know what

155
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,440
with the patterns that we have it's

156
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,879
probably a boy name uh and so as you can

157
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,800
see that's how it does that okay so that

158
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,879
was a quick example but you know this

159
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,599
is sort of boring I mean why would you

160
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,319
want to know why would you want a

161
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,360
computer program that can tell the

162
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
difference between a boy and a girl name

163
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
I mean sometimes it could be a bit

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,080
practical but not

165
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,319
fun so what I'm going to do in order to

166
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,120
solve that instead of creating a name

167
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,400
classifier we're going to create a movie

168
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
rating classifier so what we're going to

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,199
be doing is we're going to be

170
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,240
downloading around 15,000 movies from

171
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,159
IMDb yeah a lot but that's actually very

172
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,440
little compared to what we're actually

173
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,800
going to be doing we're going to be

174
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,640
downloading their ratings we're going to

175
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,959
round the ratings uh then in a CSV file

176
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,680
we're going to put the ratings I mean

177
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,719
the movie name and the rating uh then

178
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,600
we're going to feed that into Watson and

179
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,440
so when you enter new name that it

180
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,279
hasn't even heard before of a movie it

181
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,560
should be able to tell you it's around

182
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,240
uh this much perc sure that it is this

183
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,680
rating and it usually gets it quite

184
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,640
right uh it doesn't always get it spot

185
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
on of course because cuz it's rounded uh

186
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,320
but it will get it uh quite right not to

187
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,920
the decimal but to the uh proper number

188
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,760
uh place so anyway now let's get to the

189
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,560
Mac part so I can show you how to put

190
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,440
this into a Watson blue mix application

191
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,920
uh and so let's get to the Mac part now

192
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,800
so welcome back to the Mac part and now

193
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,079
I'm going to be showing you how you can

194
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,680
actually use the natural language

195
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,320
classifier so to get started let's go to

196
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,600
blo

197
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,600
miix uh and let's open up the

198
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,880
catalog see what's happening

199
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
there so seems like my Wi-Fi isn't too

200
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,200
good today anyway so now let's uh go to

201
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,040
Watson as you can see I'm just going to

202
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,480
click on this little Watson service over

203
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,880
here uh then o over here we see natural

204
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,399
language classifier okay so now let's

205
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,600
click on

206
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,680
this perfect and now let's create the

207
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,279
service just like we did for rri rank in

208
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,720
our last

209
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,560
video okay perfect now while that

210
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,519
happens let's go to Google and search up

211
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,360
the retrieve and rank documentation uh

212
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,040
and this is where we get or not retrieve

213
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,519
and rank sorry natural language

214
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,000
classifier uh and so this is where we

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,040
get uh there will be a link to this in

216
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
the description I yeah so there will be

217
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,600
a link to this in the description uh so

218
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
you don't need to search for it but once

219
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,519
you are done creating your service over

220
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,200
here in Blu miix all we're going to do

221
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,160
is is click on service credentials over

222
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,040
here and take your

223
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,000
password copy them and then I wonder

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,839
where Sublime Text goes when you need it

225
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,279
uh

226
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:45,839
okay new file okay perfect so paste in

227
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,959
the

228
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,800
username uh let's also paste in our

229
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,680
password perfect now let's start with

230
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,880
the quick start guide

231
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,399
so first thing we're going to do is

232
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,920
we're going to go to our

233
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,760
documentation we've already gotten our

234
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
service credentials so what we're going

235
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,360
to be doing is in stage two we're going

236
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,200
to be preparing our training data now

237
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,959
I've already prepared the training data

238
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,120
for you uh and so this is a gigantic

239
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,160
list of around

240
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,240
15,000 yeah

241
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,680
15,000 different

242
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,600
um uh movies and if I open this up with

243
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
Excel

244
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,600
so it's movies and their

245
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,040
ratings so over here as you can see got

246
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,240
that is a lot so now if I just scroll

247
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,480
down here a second yeah by the way these

248
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,360
um these uh movies are from IMDb in case

249
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
you were

250
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,120
wondering uh and so I had to extract

251
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,399
them from the very very difficult to use

252
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
and Par actually specifically um text

253
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,600
files so as you can see uh there are

254
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,079
exactly

255
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,160
14,99 of these movies and their ratings

256
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
so now what's going to happen is Watson

257
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,880
will be able to estimate another rating

258
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,120
um using these uh and pattern

259
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,360
matching yeah so oh yeah uh again you

260
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,279
can only have up to 15,000 records in

261
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
the examples and you cannot have more

262
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
than that I believe that's what I read

263
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
last in the

264
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,800
documentation okay so now

265
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,680
oh oh yeah and one more thing uh I only

266
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,199
have these from I think one yeah one to

267
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,959
C because I don't know how to randomly

268
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,519
choose movies from all the different

269
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,920
letters I just got from one to C but

270
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,560
still it doesn't really matter it

271
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,199
works okay so now uh let's go to the

272
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,720
next step since we already have our

273
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,160
training data uh and you can see this

274
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,120
little terminal command over here this

275
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,199
curl or as I just say curl command uh

276
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,160
copy it go over to Sublime Text paste it

277
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,040
in now actually there was a take of this

278
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,000
video before this one which you probably

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,279
won't see but uh in it I actually made a

280
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,320
slight

281
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,720
error uh basically you're supposed to

282
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
delete this part of the command and make

283
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,440
the path to your um uh training

284
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:31,120
data uh so if I do this

285
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,600
uh now the thing is what happened after

286
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,079
that I had to cut and then stuff because

287
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,560
there was an error and I just realized I

288
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,279
forgot to put this little at the right

289
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,560
thing there yeah so make sure you don't

290
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,279
forget to put that in so then I'm going

291
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,760
to copy my

292
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,360
username paste it in my password paste

293
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
it in

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,880
perfect so now that I have my username

295
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,360
password and everything filled out here

296
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,759
I'm just going to name this tutorial

297
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,880
classifier anyway just keep it the

298
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,560
default uh in while we're going to copy

299
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
this uh command again I would recommend

300
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
that you watch my retrieve and rank

301
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,759
tutorial before this one because then

302
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,360
you'll uh sort of know what the uh sort

303
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,759
of uh you know

304
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,160
um uh way we're do the format of this is

305
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,600
so right now what I'm doing is I'm

306
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,240
following the guide that IBM gives us in

307
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,320
general uh I'm also modifying the

308
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,759
commands so they actually fit our needs

309
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,399
okay so again here you need to put in

310
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,639
the path uh to your the training data

311
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,120
file uh you put your credentials over

312
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,320
here and then you're set so now in order

313
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
to execute the command we just paste it

314
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,160
into

315
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,360
terminal click the enter

316
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,360
button now theoretically what should

317
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,880
happen it should

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,199
say uh okay so that was not supposed to

319
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,000
happen if I just go to stack Overflow

320
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,720
really quick um

321
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,360
M

322
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,279
fed uh where is the little

323
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,959
command yeah thanks to

324
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:17,320
um planer I guess uh so for this command

325
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,720
so I'm just going to run this command on

326
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,560
the training data

327
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,920
itself um

328
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,079
training these you won't be to do this

329
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,319
it's just I that need to to do this I'm

330
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,959
going to move this

331
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,480
into okay

332
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,319
perfect so now what happened uh is uh in

333
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,959
my training data there was a malformed

334
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,880
utf8 sequence over here as you can see

335
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,480
uh and so what's going to happen is I'm

336
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,600
going to run a command that will remove

337
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,480
all those uh malformed UTF character

338
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,759
utfa characters uh and now I'm going to

339
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,519
just

340
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,880
uh I have already done it so now let's

341
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,319
run the Watson command with the new

342
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,720
training

343
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,800
data okay perfect it worked now the

344
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,519
classifier is in its training phase and

345
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,079
it's not yet ready to accept classifier

346
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,240
quests

347
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,040
so essentially what's happening now is

348
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,800
the Watson instance is training it's

349
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,079
taking those 15,000 movies and their

350
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:41,360
ratings and it's training itself to

351
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,480
recognize more movies and their ratings

352
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,759
it's finding patterns between the

353
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,319
ratings uh and the uh letters in between

354
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,040
uh the

355
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,319
um uh specific uh the names of the

356
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,519
movies and so it's just going to do tons

357
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,880
of pattern matching machine learning etc

358
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,360
etc uh and so essentially what what our

359
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,880
goal is is at the end of this when we're

360
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,400
done everything when it's done training

361
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
uh we should be able to enter in a movie

362
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,319
like hone 3 uh that it's never even

363
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
heard before as I said it's only from 1

364
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,600
to C 1abc hasn't even heard of Home

365
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,799
Alone before so if we enter in the name

366
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,240
of the movie it should be able to tell

367
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,640
us an estimated rank of what the movie

368
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,439
should be rated on

369
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,160
IMDb uh so that's going to great once

370
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,600
that's done but uh bad news but before

371
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,720
that we should just get on with this so

372
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,880
if I copy the next command in step

373
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,360
three uh into Sublime Text fill in the

374
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,039
username and

375
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,919
password uh then over here if you see in

376
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,440
terminal we have a classifier ID so if I

377
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,760
copy that and paste it over here in the

378
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,640
second command and remove that

379
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,200
then if I copy the second command from

380
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Sublime Text into

381
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,039
terminal yeah bad news this will take a

382
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,000
long long time to

383
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
train and by long time I mean I'm going

384
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
to have to keep this running overnight

385
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,080
and come back by tomorrow because this

386
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,120
thing will take hours upon hours to

387
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,480
train because it's a gigantic data set

388
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,919
anyway so now what I'm going to do is

389
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,919
I'm going to pause the recording uh I'm

390
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,120
going to wait uh overnight I'm just

391
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,880
going to sleep now I guess uh maybe

392
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
upload this video uh then tomorrow I'm

393
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,960
going to be back with part two uh in

394
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,559
which I will show you the trained

395
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,880
classifier then we're going to be

396
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,640
classifying some text uh and see how

397
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,919
that works okay so I hope you enjoyed if

398
