picture this you're trying to open a
door while carrying a bag of groceries
in one hand and your phone in the other
hand a familiar situation right well
human- centered design is all about
making life easier in moments like these
think of those automatic doors at the
supermarket that magically slide open as
you approach freeing up your hands to
handle your shopping that's the part of
Designing with keeping people in mind
human- centered design is like making
stuff that fits people perfectly you
figured out what they like and need
using things like interviews and
observations then you use that
information to make something that's
easy and enjoyable for them to use it's
all about putting the user first and
making sure what you create works great
for them so in this video from Simply
learn we will discuss about human Center
design process we will give you a
complete picture of all the aspects of
ET CD from how it evolved to its
principles phases and real life

Endless Possibilities in the realm of
uiux design so let's get started human
Center design process human Center
design focuses on Crafting solutions
that align with people's needs and
behaviors making their life simpler and
more enjoyable let's first look into the
history of human centered design human
centered design has come a long way
since its Beginnings in the 1960s when
it was all about making military
equipment safer and easier to use this
focus on understanding how people
interact with the environment soon
spread to Consumer products in the 1980s
Pioneers like Donell Norman emphasized
the need for designs that are intuitive
and user friendly which gave rise to
user Center design today ET CD Prin
principles are essential across various
Fields including technology Healthcare
consumer products public services and
education companies like Google and
apple prioritize user experience in
their products and sectors like
healthcare and urban planning use at CD
to create more accessible and inclusive
services this Evolution highlights ET
C's importance in crafting solutions
that are not only effective and
enjoyable but also sustainable by
keeping the needs and experiences of
users at the Forefront so what are some
some of the key principles to keep in
mind while implementing a human-
centered approach prioritize people
always focus on individuals who will be
using your product and consider their
unique needs and circumstances remember
your goal is to create something that
helps them achieve the objectives more
effectively identify the code problem
it's essential to pinpoint the
underlying issue rather than just
addressing its symptoms by tackling the
root cause you can prevent recurring
issues and create more impactful
solutions consider the whole system keep
the broader user journey in mind even
when working on specific aspects by
understanding how each part fits into
larger picture you can create more
cohesive and seamless experience start
small I trate often instead of diving
straight into complex Solutions start
with simple interventions and
continually refine them through
iterative testing and prototyping this
approach allows for gradual Improvement
and ensures that your Solutions truly
meet the needs of your users now there
are six phases in the proc es of it CD
which are as follows empathize this
phase is about understanding the people
you're designing for it involves
Gathering insights into their lives
needs and challenges you can interview
potential users to understand their
experiences and needs observe users in
the environment to see how they interact
with existing Solutions and uncover
unarticulated needs collect quantitative
data from a larger user base to identify
patterns and common issues Define in
this phase the insights gathered during
the first first phas a synthesize to
define the code problems and challenges
create detailed profiles of typical
users to represent different user types
map out the user's journey to identify
pain points and opportunities for
improvement develop a clear problem
statement that encapsulates the user
needs and challenges to be addressed
next id8 this phase involves generating
a wide range of ideas and potential
Solutions conduct sessions to generate a
large number of ideas draw simple
sketches to visualize ideas quickly use
maps to explore different aspects of the
problem and potential Solutions create
storyboards to illustrate how Solutions
might be used in real life scenarios
next we have prototype develop
representations of the ideas to explore
their viability create low Fidelity
prototypes which are simple and
inexpensive versions of the product like
paper sketches wireframes Etc you can
also create high fidil prototypes which
are more detailed and functional
prototypes that closely resemble the
final product build mockups like visual
models to test look and feel use tools
to build interactive versions of digal
products test evaluate the prototypes
with real users to gather feedback and
insights observe users interacting with
the prototypes to identify usability
issues compare different versions of the
prototype to see which performs better
and collect feedback through interviews
surveys and observation refine the
prototypes based on their feedback and
test again and the last we have
Implement bring the final solution to
life and ensure it meets user needs
translate the final prototype into a
finished fin product or service and
deploy the product or service to the
market then monitor user feedback and
performance metrics to ensure the
solution continues to meet user needs
and also make ongoing improvements based
on user feedback and evolving needs so
human centered design approach can
greatly improve our uiux by focusing on
the real needs and behaviors of the
users by understanding what users want
and how they interact with the product
through research and feedback designers
can create interfaces that are more
intuitive and enjoyable to use regular
testing and refining based on user input
also ensure that that the product
continually meets their needs
effectively so we hope by now you got a
Clarity on what a human- centered design
approach is and how the ways and
processes to achieve it now let's see
some real life examples of how Brands
applied atcd process to enhance their
uiux first let's see an example from
ideu which is a global design and
Innovation company so Ideo was asked by
a medical device company to design a
data entry tool for nurses during a
specific procedure so the client
envisioned a Sleek futuristic Gadget
similar to iPad that required two hands
to operate however when the Ideo team
observed the medical procedure they
noticed a critical detail patients were
anxious and scared as they were into
surgery and nurses would often hold
their hands to comfort them and an
essential human interaction the client
has overlooked realizing a two-handed
device wouldn't work IDU brainstormed
and developed a one-handed device with a
thumb scroll which looks like this this
allowing nurses to input data while
still holding the patient's hand
although it wasn't as cool as the
client's original idea it was far more
practical and empathetic so ide's
approach focused on understanding the
end users needs and using those insights
to guide their design resulting in a
solution that was unexpected But
ultimately created a more human and
effective experience for everyone
involved so now let's talk about the
role of hcd in digital products so human
Center design profoundly influences the
uiux of software and products by placing
the genuine needs and behaviors of users
at the Forefront of the design process
through comprehensive user research and
empathetic understanding designers gain
invaluable insights into users
preferences challenges and motivations
this deep understanding allows for the
creation of interfaces that are
intuitive user friendly and emotionally
resonant now let's see how hcd impacts
uiux of a digital product through an
example Uber uses human- centered design
to make sure the app meets users needs
they started researching what people
didn't like about traditional taxis such
as long weights and unclear pricing the
Uber app has a simple easy to ous
interface with clear visuals it allows
quick booking with one Tab and shows
where the driver is in real time users
can save favorite places and write
preferences for a personalized
experience also the app is accessible
with voice commands and adjustable text
sizes it provides Fair estimates and
real-time tracking to ensure
transparency so trust is built through
driver ratings and safety features like
an emergency button Uber continuously
improves the app based on user feedback
and tests new features before releasing
them widely it supports multiple payment
methods and also languages to be
inclusive for all users so these SD
principles make Uber a userfriendly
personalized and Safe Ride healing ha so
