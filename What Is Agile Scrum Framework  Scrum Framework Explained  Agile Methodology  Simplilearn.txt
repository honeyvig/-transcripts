hello everyone and welcome to today's
video on scrum framework at simply learn
in this video we will explore the
fundamentals of scrum framework for an
agile methodology which is widely used
in project management particularly in
software development scrum is all about
collaboration adaptability and
delivering value in short iterative
Cycles let's dive in and understand its
key Concepts roles ceremonies and
artifacts that make it so effective for
teams aiming to build up high quality
products efficiently but before you move
on I request you guys that do not forget

the Bell icon for further updates so
here's the agenda for our today's
session we going to start our session
with an introduction to what is Scrum
process then we will discuss about what
are scrum artifacts moving ahead we will
discuss about benefits of scrum
methodology then we will Deep dive into
scrum an agile relationship moving ahead
we will also learn about scrum
ceremonies or events then we will also
discuss scrum pillars and values and at
the end of the session we will discuss
three essential roles for scrum process
and scaling scrum to multiple teams so
guys let's try to understand what is
Scrum framework but before that there's
a small story so guys consider a big
company like Rockstar which is a gaming
company and they have got a Target
project to make a game like GTA 5 now in
order to complete the project they are
stuck in the Midway because they have to
update changes in the middle and which
kind of made their work kind of little
bit messy now a team member called Alex
comes up with an idea to implement scrum
framework so guys what's basically scrum
framework the scrum framework is an
agile project management methodology
which is primarily used in software
development but but it is applicable to
various Industries it operates on the
principle of iterative and incremental
progress aiming to deliver high value
products efficiently added score scrum
revolves around small self-organizing
teams working in short time frame called
Sprints typically lasting 2 to four
weeks so guys overall scrum framework
provides a structured yet flexible
approach to project management allowing
teams to respond to change and deliver
high quality products incrementally and
this is how the company made a very
fantastic game by implementing this
scrum
framework now let us try to understand
what are the events in scrum the first
one is daily scrum it refers to the
regular conduction of meetings the motor
of the daily scrum is to analyze the
progress of previous day work and
accommodate the backlog in a tight
schedule without causing the overburden
additionally the senior managers manage
the upcoming planned work accordingly
the meeting involves the participation
of developers product owners or scrum
Masters and last for maximum of 15
minutes now next one we have all over
here is Sprint Sprint is a short cycle
overlooking the development of a product
in a specified period it is referred to
as the head of scrum and comprises
planning daily scrum meeting progress
review and backlog next one we have is
Sprint planning meeting it involves the
participation of each individual in
scrum time the meeting can expect to run
for eight hours for a monthl long Sprint
while the time varies for different time
spans the main objective of the meeting
are to establish the Sprint goal and
Define the goal and process to achieve
the task third one we have all over here
is Sprint review now team members
practicing scrum framework meet with the
stakeholders for feedback the expected
time for Sprint review is for 4 hours
and 4 week Sprint however it also
changes based on the Sprint time frame
next one we have all over here is Sprint
retrospective again involving the
participation of each member the ideal
time is 3 hours it focused on
understanding weaknesses and strength of
the team and its Action Now moving ahead
let us discuss about what are scrum
artifacts so guys in scrum artifacts are
the tangible items or documents created
and maintained throughout the project to
provide provide transparency track
progress and support decision- making
these artifacts serves as valuable tools
for communication and collaboration
within scrum team and with stakeholders
the primary scrum artifacts include the
first one we have is product backlog
which is a prioritized list of all the
features enhancements bug fixes and
other work items that need to be
completed for the product it is managed
by the product owner and represents the
requirement and vision of the product
next one we have is a Sprint backlog it
is a subset of product backlog that
contains the list of users task stories
or backlog items that the development
team has committed to completing during
the specific Sprint it is owned by the
development team and guides their work
for the duration of the Sprint third one
we have all over here is increment the
sum of all the completed and potentially
shippable backlog items at the end of
each Sprint it represents the tangible
progress made by the development team
during the Sprint and serves as a
measure of products development status
these artifacts provide a clear
understanding of the work to be done
track progress towards the project goals
and ensure alignment with the team and
with the stakeholders throughout the
Project Life Cycle now finally we have
the burndown chart so guys the burndown
chart tells how we have progressed till
now and what are the obstacles we have
faced and how our product development
has been achieved or what is the status
so guys I hope so you would have got a
brief idea regarding scrum artifacts now
let us move forward and try to
understand scrum and agile basically
agile is a mindset or a philosophy that
emphasizes the iterative development
collaboration flexibility and customer
feedback it prioritizes delivering
valuable software frequently and
adapting to change rather than following
a rigid plan where on other hand we have
scrum which is a specific agile
framework for managing complex projects
commonly used in software development it
provides a structured approach to Agile
principles by defining roles events
artifacts and rules that team follow to
deliver increments of valuable product
now here are some of the key points
illustrating the relationship between
scrum and agile first one is framework
versus philosophy agile is a set of
guiding princip principles while scrum
is a concrete framework that
operationalizes those principles into
specific practices and roles second one
we have iterative and incremental
development both agile and scrum promote
iterative and incremental development
with a focus on delivering working
software in short Cycles third one we
have is customer collaboration both
agile and scrum emphasizes close
collaboration with stakeholders
including customers to G the the
feedback and adapt the product to
changing needs finally we have these
self-organizing teams both agile and
scrum advocate for self-organizing teams
that are empowered to make decisions and
adapt their process to maximize
productivity and value delivery I hope
so you would have got a brief idea
regarding scrum and agile
relationship so in summary scrum is a
specific implementation of agile
principles providing structured
framework for managing complex projects
particularly in the realm of software
development while agile sets guiding
philosophy scrum offers concrete
practices and roles to help team
effectively and apply agile principles
in their work now let us move on and
discuss some of the benefits of scrum
methodology the first one that we have
all over here is flexibility second one
we have is transparency third one we
have the risk mitigation and fourth one
we have improved collaboration fifth one
is there is a faster time to Market so
these are some of the benefits of scrum
methodology now let's move on and
discuss some of the pillars and values
for scrum so guys scrum as an agile
framework is built upon a set of values
and pillars that guides its
implementation these values and pillars
serves as the foundation for scrum teams
to collaborate effectively deliver high
quality products and adapt to change
let's explore each one of them one by
one
the first one that we have all over here
is commitment scrum teams are committed
to achieving their goals and delivering
value to the customer the commitment
involves dedicating themselves to the
work agreed upon in the Sprint and doing
their best to meet the Sprint goal
second one is focus scrum teams maintain
focus on the work at hand and strive to
avoid distraction by concentrating on
the most important tasks and priorities
teams can deliver valuable increments of
work consistently and the third one is
openness transparency and openness are
essential in scrum team members are
encouraged to share information
challenges and progress openly with each
other and with stakeholder this Fosters
trust collaboration and effective
problem solving now let us move on and
discuss some of the pillars for scrum
the first one that we have all over here
is transparency transparency is one of
the core pillars of scrum it involves
making all the OSP of work visible
including progress imped Ms and risk by
maintaining transparency scrum teams and
stakeholders can make informed decisions
and collaborate effectively next one is
inspection inspection refers to the
regular assessment and evaluation of the
product and processes scrum teams
inspect their work and progress
continuously looking for opportunities
to improve quality identify issues and
adapt to changing requirements third one
is adaptation adaptation is ability to
adjust course based on the insights
gained from inspection scrum teams
Embrace change and use feedback to make
informed decision about the product and
processes this flexibility enables them
to respond repeat this flexibility
enables them to respond quickly to new
information and deliver greater value by
adhering to these values and pillars
scrum teams create framework for
collaboration continuous Improvement and
successful delivery of products in
complex environments so guys that was
