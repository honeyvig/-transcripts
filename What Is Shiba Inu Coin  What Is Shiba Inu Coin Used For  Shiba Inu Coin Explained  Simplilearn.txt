a few days back we all witnessed a huge
downfall in the crypto market and due to
which many cryptos faced a lot of
backlash
yet there is one cryptocurrency who has
been gathering a lot of attention
towards itself and that is the shiba inu
coin
every day the hype surrounding this
crypto is increasing and everyone is
taking interest in knowing more and more
about this cryptocurrency
hey everyone i'm shamlee and i welcome
you all to this new video of simply
learn on what is shibainocoin
in this video we will explore about
shiva innocoin and we'll go through some
of really exciting concepts and
components revolving around it
first we will look into the origin of
shiba inu coins
then we will understand what is shibaino
coins
then we will explore how it is different
and unique from dogecoin
then we will figure out why is it so
popular
and at last we will explore what future
shiba inu coin holds for itself
so without wasting more time let's get
started with the video
so how did this shiva unicorn originate
the shiva in a coin was created in
august 2020 by an anonymous person
calling themselves ryoshi an indian
it was intended as an altcoin of
dogecoin which itself was created as an
altcoin of bitcoin and this meme coin
has been named after the japanese dog
breed shiva inu
it feels like the sheba in a coin was
built into existence and is now insanely
popular among major crypto exchanges
through the power of its following crowd
memes
and a very cute dog
now we know how it originated so let's
have a look at what is shiba in a coin
shiva inucoin is a decentralized
community building cryptocurrency or we
can say an experiment
developed within the shiva inno
ecosystem and built on top of the
ethereum blockchain network like many
other coins
it is a meme coin launched as a rival of
dogecoin a doge killer
both dogecoin and sheepcoin were made in
a humorous manner but sheepcoin has
already taken over some dogecoin markets
attracting a lot of attention and rising
as a popular choice among investors
especially after such market crash of
cryptos like bitcoin and ethereum
but what is the difference between sheba
and coin and dogecoin
although both shiva inucoin and dogecoin
are meme coins and share the same tree
of origin both of them differ a lot from
each other at the same time
and the very first difference between
them is the sheep coin is a token and
dogecoin is a currency
let's have a look at more of those major
differences like this
first is development
shiba inu coins or sheep coins are built
on and powered by the ethereum network
while dogecoin has been developed using
the same technology as bitcoin
then is use cases
sheepcoin is still working upon price
more due to its high popularity than
utility
but on the other hand dogecoin has
already established itself to some
extent as a medium of online payments
there is value according to my coin
market cap
the current value of sheep coin is 0.000
7378
and that of dogecoin is 0.2617
and at last availability the
availability of sheep cointel today is
394 million and for dogecoin it is 130
billion
now this definitely raises a question in
my mind why is she buying a coin so
popular
shimano coin
is majorly popular because of two
reasons
tesla founder elon musk has tweeted
recently expressing that he would like
to own a shiba pub that hyped the crypto
market and prices rose by 300 percent
on the other hand its prices fell by
around 40 percent after the founder of
ethereum blockchain network vitalik
buterin donated 50 trillion shebang
coins to indian government
for corporate relief fund of an indian
crypto entrepreneur sandeep naival
so now that we know about shiba in a
coin and its concepts
let's have a look at what is the future
of shiba inu coins
though sheba coin is only known as a
meme coin its increasing popularity and
people's interest and participating in
it is pointing towards a different but
bright future
according to investing cube.com the
sheba coin is predicted to rise again
although there isn't much movement among
this token and its value active buyers
could help its value rise
the value could rise to
zero 0.000 one zero four zero in a more
active buyers market
although it may not appear to be a
significant amount due to its popularity
in future it can have a significant
influence over large investors of the
crypto market
