is a free web platform provided by

manage your site search engine results
on Google search so what does it do for
you it provides extensive analytics
about how your site is performing on

issues and you can request manual
actions and spam reports from Google for
your site and file appeals when you
think Google has made a mistake so lots
that you can do with it but let's dig a
bit deeper let's start by looking how
you can register your website on Google
search console it's a fundamental step
in gaining access to the wealth of data
and insights that can Propel your s's
visibility in the Google search results
the process is straightforward it is
simple and by following a set of steps
you will be sure that your website is
accurately represented and monitored
within the Google search console
platform so let's go through those step
and let's go to the Google search
console
website so to initiate the registration
process navigate to search.
google.com/ console slab and if you
don't have a Google account the first
thing you need to do is to create one
and if you have already got an account
you can simply log on best way to get
into it is to click on the start now
yep so when you have started when you
start Google search console you get to
this screen which is your overview
dashboard now we're going to go into
this dashboard in a little while the
first thing I'm going to show you is how
to register your own website here you
see the different websites that I have
registered yeah for my own account but
I'm going to show you how to register
yours now obviously I can't register
your website because I don't have
ownership of your website but I'll show
you the
process so we'll click here on the
little arrow on the top left and we'll
click on ADD property now if you haven't
got a property installed it will
automatically take you to this screen
yeah it will select ask you to select a
property type for the domain or a URL
prev
yep so here you will have a URL across
all your subdomains or it could only be
for the URL under the entered address so
for you to decide how you want to do
this for now I will just go to click
learn more so it gives you all the
details you want to know of how to add a
website
property okay and the process is as
follows you enter your domain as we saw
here yeah then you click
continue and then the next step is that
Google will start verifying if you are
the owner of the domain and in order to
verify your website there are a few
things that you must do and there are
different roots that you can choose to
verify your domain now to find out about
how to verify your domain yeah here is
all the details about the different
website properties if you want to verify
you go down and then here you see you
will be asked to choose a verification
method so let me show you the
verification
methods yeah so it means providing to
search console that you own a specific
website and why is that so important
because you are the owner of the website
you don't want your competitor to get
access to your uh your your Google
search console data yeah so now the most
common method is to download an HTML
file and upload it to your website's
root directory on your uh your host uh
your hosting provider yep so it's a
little little bit technical but if you
are a web developer then you know
exactly what we're talking about but
fortunately there are lots of other
methods like adding a metat tech to your
SES HTML or even using Google analytics
and often that is one of the most simple
methods yeah so here are the different
methods there is the HTML file upload
like you download an HTML file provided
by the Google search console that you
upload that file to the root directory
of your website using an FTP client or
through your hostings provider file
manager you can also do an HTML tag yeah
so you can uh copy the tag that Google
will provide you and you can paste that
meta tag into the HTML code of your
website preferably in the header section
and again you can use um directly in the
HTML
you can also use Google tag manager for
that and how to do that you can see in
one of the other videos that I made for
simply learn about how to use the Google
tag manager now the easiest method and
that may be as may be enough for you is
to use the Google analytics tracking
code if you have set up your website for
Google
Analytics yeah then it is very simple
you start your Google um search console
you input your website and then when you
click the verification Google will
automatically connect with your Google
analytics check for the tracking code
and it is already done that is the
easiest way to set up your um your
Google uh your Google search console
verification we talked about the Google
tag manager yeah that you can use as
well for the HTML tag you can also go
for the method used by your platform for
instance if you have a WordPress website
then you can get plug-in for this where
you can easily connect your website to
the Google search console and there may
also be a process through your domain
name provider yeah so the only way to
verify is through your um domain name
profile
okay so if it's um if they're in the
verification wizard then that's a very
simple
approach okay and that is um that's it
so once you've verified your website you
can then access the Google search
console and then you can get access to
all the tools and all the
functionalities that you get with your
um with your uh with Google search
console now what you would usually do
after that process you would upload your
sitemap although it's not mandatory for
verification it is highly recommended
it's a file that lists all the pages on
your website helping search engines to
understand the structure and we'll come
back to the S map in a little bit and
I'll show you how to upload a um a
sitemap okay okay so again once you've
entered your website so let's say
uh let's do see if this
works you click
continue it verifies the
property and then here you see the
instructions if you want to do it
through your GoDaddy yep and U that is
where I have my uh my do domain hosted
my website hosted yeah then you press
the start the verification if it's
already verified yeah you just click
Start
verification it goes through the
process and then I need to sign in
through quand now I'm through my god
daddy account now I'm not going to do
this because I've already registered my
website on um on Google search
console so let's start our second demo
and in this demo we're going to go
through the Google search console
dashboard and its different components
so back to the console and here again
you see the Google search console with
the dashboard yeah here you see the
command center offering a very highlevel
summary of your critical elements after
logging in and selecting your property
yeah you navigate to the overview
section to access the snapshot of your
website performance it gives you total
clicks it gives you Impressions the
clickthrough rate average position like
key metrics that allow you to quickly
access the performance of your site's
visibility and the user engagement so
this dashboard is the starting point for
a deeper orientation on your
website yes so by regular checking this
section you can stay informed about
Trends about patterns enabling you to
make informed decisions about your
ongoing SEO
improvements so let's go to the heart of
this performance report which is the
performance yeah this report shows you
and it gives you detailed insights into
how you users interact with your site on
Google search it displays data on clicks
on Impressions on average clickthrough
rate and average
position yep and here you see that over
specific time
ranges yes so here you see the date for
the last three months and here you
search type it's on the web and here you
see the
statistics by day navigating through
this report it allows you to identify
the high performing Pages the impact of
changes that you make on your website
and then understand user Behavior Yeah
by analyzing this data you can make
informed
decisions that refi to refine your
content strategy focusing on what
resonates best with your uh your uh your
audience yeah again here you see the
queries that are being used here you see
the most popular Pages you see the
countries that are popular here you see
the devices that are being
used yeah so it gives you a full
snapshot of your um of your data and of
your performance of your website you can
see it by Pages you can see video pages
of if you have those so lots of data
that you can get now a very interesting
Port report is the queries so if you
click on the average
position column header you can sort
keywords by their average position from
high to low that helps you identify
which keywords are performing well and
which are not performing well which ones
may need improvements so you can learn a
lot from this data you can also filter
to refine your data for example you can
set date ranges you can compare
different metrics or you can uh focus on
particular uh keyword performance
sections okay so that's what you can do
with the filter
functionality and if we move on you can
also explore the pages section this
provides Insight how specific pages are
performing on your website including the
associated keywords that come with
them yeah so you can also export the
data yeah so that allows you to analyze
the information offline or share it with
other people so lots of data that you
get here as well
okay an important one that you want to
check as well is your the trends in your
position yeah what's the average
position of your keywords and how they
change over time because that can really
help you assessing the effects of your
SEO activity yeah and you may ident if y
areas for improvement so by following
these steps you can effectively check
and analyze keyword data in Google
search console yeah manage regularly
managing and regularly monitoring this
information helps you to refine your
content and your SEO strategy to better
align this with the user search intent
and improve your website's overall
importance so use that data that you get
in the performance report it's very
valuable and again it summarizes around
the keywords that are being used and the
pages they are the most effective and
the most powerful tools that you get in
this performance report yeah the next
Topic in your report is the URL
inspection tool which is a Precision
instrument for in understanding how the
Google Bots inter interprets specific
URLs on your website to use the tool
effectively enter a URL in the search
bar and then Google will provide you
insights into the indexing status the
mobile usability and any issues
affecting the url's appearance in the
search results so if I put in the URL
for the
website and see what it comes back
with enter
yep and you see that the URL is on
Google it can appear in the search
results if I want to see the crawled
page yeah does it uh page change request
indexing if I want to yeah so but the
page has been indexed it is usable on
mobile it is an
https version and there is a site links
search box yes so
this URL inspection has been positive I
can test a live URL and that shows me
that that takes me to the URL so this is
how I can inspect and if the different
URLs of my website are indeed indexed by
Google it's particularly valuable for
troubleshooting and optimizing
individual Pages by addressing any
concerns highlighted in the URL
inspection tool you can ensure that your
cont content is well represented in the
search results the next one is the
indexing
reports this indexing report is a
comprehensive guide to understand how
well Google has indexed your site yeah
we've seen it that it has indexed in the
URL inspection but in the indexing
section you can actually see how well
have they done
that it provides a list of all the Index
P PES but also highlights any issues
that may hinder a proper indexing so
here you see all the index pages and
here you see if there are pages that are
not indexed you may want to see say here
why Pages aren't indexed it allows you
to identify and rectify issues such as
crawl errors no index tags and any other
factors affecting your site's visibility
in the search
results regularly monitoring and
optimizing based on these reports gives
you a healthier and more search engine
friendly website yeah so use that you
can see that for your pages your video
pages and you can also see this for your
sit Maps now we talked about sit Maps
earlier they act as a navigational guide
for search engine Growers they provide
structured road map of your sit maps of
your site's content and in the section
on the Google search console you can
submit your sitemap you can test it and
optimize your sitap for efficient
Crawling by Google it's important that
you submit an accurate and upto-date
sitemap so you ensure that the search
engine can actually easily discover and
index all the essential pages on your
website it's foundational for a well
organized and search friendly website
structure now a quick guide on how to
create a sitap what you do you just go
to your CMS tool or use a tool yeah or
your website development platform like
WordPress or use a WordPress plug-in
yeah um to generate a sitemap
automatically you can also create a
simple XML file using a text editor
listing your URLs and additional
information about each
page you save it as an sitemap.xml and
then you upload it in the root directory
of your
website yeah and you use an FTP client
to upload it or or use your hosting
providers file manager yet Google needs
to find that sitemap in the root
directory of your website if you're
using Wordpress and use a WordPress
plugin for your sitemap it's all done
automatically yeah so it will create a
sitemap for you and it will upload it on
your uh in the root directory as well
and by doing this yeah you can then
upload your s map here in which is
basically a URL yep and then you can
submit your sitemap so if I go to my
other
website yeah no I haven't uploaded a um
a sitemap for these I should have done
that but um I'll do that that
later yeah so but once you've uploaded
your sitemap in the Google search
console then you've basically notified
Google that your sitemap is active and
you do that on other other search
engines as well of course make sure that
your sitemap is regularly updated if
there are changes on your
website right if we then go to the next
topic which are
removals removals refer to a set of
tools and features that allow web
Masters and site owners to request
removal of specific content from Google
search result either temporary or
permanently so these tools like removals
are designed to address situations where
you need to remove content from Google's
index for various reasons like outdated
content or sensitive
information the key components of this
removal
section yeah it could be for temporary
removals they allow you to take content
out of Google search results for a short
per period yeah yes so um it could be
for outdated content like request a
removal of outdated snippet of cached
pages is very useful when the search
results display information that is no
longer accurate or relevant due to
recent updates on your website it could
be clear cached URL removal of the
cached version of a specific page yeah
so to make sure that Google will fetch
and display the most recent version of a
page rather than showing a cached
version you can use it to clear outdated
content in to inform Google that a
content on a specific page has been
updated or removed and should no longer
be considered or you can also go for
permanent removals they're more robust
and are used when you want to request
the removal of content for an extended
or indefinite
periods now very important to know that
while these removal tools are effective
in controlling what appears in Google
search results they do not remove the
content from the internet entirely it
may still be accessible directly through
the website or other means or other
search engines so it also makes some
take some time to reflect in the Google
search results yes so it depends on
various factors including Google's
assessment of the request validity and
compl liance with their
policies so use this the URL
removal yeah use it carefully and be
aware of the implications as improper
use or abuse of these features can
really impact your website's search
visibility right so that's on the
indexing and the quality and the
completeness of the indexing of your
website look at the status help Google
Google by uploading a sitemap and make
sure that there is content maybe that
you want to remove a next important part
of Google search console is the user
experience of your website it's a core
component designed to provide web
Masters and site owners with insight
into various user experience aspects of
the website this part of a broader set
of tools focus on on enhancing the
overall performance the
accessibility yeah the accessibility and
usability of
websites in the eyes of both the users
and the search
engines now it looks at various things
and a very important part are what we
call the core web
vitals so it shows in the core web
vitals report how your page is performed
based on real world users data it's at
the core the core web vitals are the
heart of your experience section yeah
there are a set of specific metrics that
access the loading performance the
interactivity and the visual stability
of the web page there are essential
indicators of the overall user
experience reflecting how to quickly a
page load and how responsive is and how
visibly stable it remains during the
interactions there are other page uh
aspects of page experiences as well yeah
so it en encompasses a broader factors
that contribute to the overall page
experience it includes the mobile
friendliness and it includes the
security the
https security and the absence of
intrusive interstitials like popups for
instance that might hinder the um the
user experience so the mobile usability
report found in this experience section
identifies issues specific to mobile
devices that may impact the user
experience and therefore the search
performance by addressing those mobile
usability concerns
you enhance the overall accessibility of
your site yeah and you cater to the
increasing num of users who have access
to your website via their mobile devices
it improves the SEO but it also improves
to a positive user
experience yet part of your experience
is also the site links search
box they refer to the search bar that
sometimes appear Within
the site links for a specific website in
Google search results there are
additional links that appear beneath the
main search result snippet and provide
direct access to specific Pages within
the
website this inclusion of a search box
within these site links allows users to
perform a site specific search directly
from the search results page so there's
lots of benefits of having a s link
search
box it first of all facilitate
facilitates on-site search yeah so it
makes it more accessible it enables
users to search within your website
without navigating to the site
first it also helps with the providing a
better overall user experience by
offering a convenient and efficient way
for users to find specific content
within a
website now to have a citlink search box
featured
enabled yeah you need to implement
structured data markup on your site the
website should include the search action
structured data markup with the HTML
that structured data markup helps Google
understand the
relationship between the site and the
search functionality it provides
information such as the URL pattern for
on-site searches it's crucial for Google
to recognize and display the search box
in the S
links
good that is very important to keep in
mind that the availability and features
in the Google search console can change
over time yeah keep that in mind because
Google updates its algorithms and search
