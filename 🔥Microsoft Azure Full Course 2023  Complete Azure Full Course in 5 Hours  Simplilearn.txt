from Simply learn saira is a country
singer and recently she got sponsored by
North American Music company for her new
album she was really nervous and excited
about the performance once all songs
were recorded she was set to release the
album worldwide
so when she inquired about when it would
happen she realized she barely had one
week left
she panicked and ran to the manager of
that Music Company Mark to inquire how
everything like editing mixing
portfolios and promotions would be done
in just one week
that's when Mark answered don't you
worry our production is managed on
Microsoft azure Cyrus confused and asked
but isn't Azure a cloud service used to
store your data Mark smiled and answered
well it's true but Azure is not just
that but much more let me explain it to
you mark further explained that
Microsoft Azure is an open and flexible
Cloud platform for services such as
analytics virtual Computing storage
networking and more it offers a
constantly growing selection of products
and services designed to satisfy all of
your demands on a single practical
platform it enables its users to engage
in cloud computing and is designed to
manage tasks through Microsoft's data
centers a data center is a structure
with networked computers storage systems
and computational infrastructure that
organizations like us use to gather
process store and distribute massive
amounts of data
upon learning what Azure is used for she
was still unsure how it would help her
in the album release
Mark explained that in Azure every
production happens simultaneously every
day Azure builds Mission critical
solutions to analyze images comprehend
speech and make predictions using data
simultaneously hence multitasking he
further added that all the data of her
album for example footage and audio
travel securely to the cloud from even
the most remote locations all the data
is securely stored in the cloud which
can easily be accessed by the editors
and other production members immediately
on realizing every process would run in
parallel Cyrus was under the impression
that all this would be a tedious and
time-consuming job then Mark answered no
only the data relevant to their role
would be accessible to them same
platform same tools same workflow but
just more efficient and secure
Cyrus started wondering ask that it must
cost them a fortune to use such advanced
technology Mark further explained that
the costs are easily controllable so we
only pay for what we use and because our
album is stored in the cloud it's
accessible from every corner of the
world for example producers can review
approve and make changes in real time
and video indexing makes the album
searchable and understandable
Predictive Analytics makes the most of
marketing and distribution strategies
therefore no ad dollars are wasted or
seats are left empty
secure distribution means album releases
smoothly and on time as soon as the
audience starts watching and reacting to
every interaction Azure analyzes their
viewing habits to drive recommendations
advertising and personalization
this makes future production decisions
really easy
Zyra was relieved to understand this new
technology and how it would help her
build her future career
Azure is the best public cloud service
available today thanks to its speed
flexibility and affordability as well as
its features and pricing today some of
the biggest companies in the world like
eBay Boeing Samsung and BMW are now
using the Microsoft Azure infrastructure
and the support they require for their
better production and performance
when it comes to cloud service providers
Microsoft azure's adaptability is
proving to be a valuable quality that
makes it a good choice in the healthcare
manufacturing consumer Appliance travel
Aviation and entertainment sectors you

so now what is azure what's the big
cloud service provider all about so
Azure is a cloud computing platform
provided by Microsoft now it's basically
an online portal through which you can
access and manage resources and services
now resources and services are nothing
but you know you can store your data and
you can transform the data using
services that Microsoft provides again
all you need is the internet and being
able to connect to the Azure portal then
you get access to all of the resources
and their services in case you want to
know more about how it's different from
its rival which is AWS I suggest you
click on the top right corner and watch
the AWS versus SEO video so that you can
clearly tell how both these cloud
service providers are different from
each other now here are some things that
you need to know about Azure if it's
launched in February 1st 2010 which is
significantly later than when AWS was
launched it's free to start and has a
pay-per-use model which means like I
said before you need to pay for the
services you use through azure and one
of the most important selling points is
that 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies
use Azure Services which means that most
of the bigger companies of the world
actually recommend using Azure and then
Azure supports a wide variety of
programming languages the C sharp
node.js Java and so much more another
very important selling point of azure is
the amount of data centers it has across
the world now it's important for a cloud
service provider to have many data
centers around the world because it
means that they can provide their
services to a wider audience now Azure
has 42 which is more than any cloud
service provider has at the moment it
expects to have 12 more in a period of
time which brings its total number of
regions it covers to 54. now let's talk
about Azure Services now Azure Services
have 18 categories and more than 200
services so we clearly can't go through
all of them it has services that cover
compute air and machine learning
integration management tools identity T
devops web and so much more you're going
to have a hard time trying to find a
domain that Azure doesn't cover and if
it doesn't cover it now you can be
certain they're working on it as we
speak so first let's start with the
compute Services first virtual machine
with this service what you're getting to
do is to create a virtual machine of
Linux or Windows operating system it's
easily configurable you can add RAM you
can decrease RAM you can add storage
remove it all of it is possible in a
matter of seconds now let's talk about
the second service cloud service now
with this you can create a application
within the cloud and all of the work
after you deploy it deploying the
application that is is taken care of by
Azure which includes you know
provisioning the application load
balancing ensuring that the application
is in good health and all of the other
things are handled by Azure next up
let's talk about service fabric now with
service fabric the process of developing
a micro service is great quickly
simplify so you might be wondering what
exactly is a micro service now a micro
service is basically an application that
consists of smaller applications coupled
together next up functions now with
functions you can create applications in
any programming language that you want
another very important part is that you
don't have to worry about any hardware
components you don't have to worry what
Ram you require or how much storage you
require all of that is taken care of by
Azure all you need is to provide the
code to Azure and it will execute it and
you don't have to worry about anything
else now let's talk about some
networking Services first up we have
Azure CDN or the content delivery
Network now the Azure CDN service is
basically for delivering web content to
users now this content is of high
bandwidth and can be transferred or can
be delivered to any person across the
world now these are actually a network
of servers that are placed in strategic
positions across the world so that the
customers can obtain this data as fast
as possible next up we have expressr now
with this you can actually connect your
on-premise network onto the Microsoft
cloud or any of the services that you
want through a private connection so the
only communication that happens is
between your on-premise network and the
service that you want then you have
virtual Network now with virtual Network
you can have any of the Azure Services
communicate with each other in a secure
manner in a private manner next we have
Azure DNS so Azure DNS is a hosting
service which allows you to host their
DNS or domain name system domains in
Azure so you can host your application
using Azure DNS now for these storage
Services first up we have this storage
with this storage you are given a cost
effective option of choosing HDD or
solid state drives to go along with your
virtual machines based on your
requirements then you have blob storage
now this is actually optimized to ensure
that they can store massive amounts of
unstructured data which can include Text
data or even binary data next you have
file storage which is a manage file
storage and can be accessible via the
SMB protocol or the server message block
protocol and finally you have queue
storage now with Q storage you can
provide durable message queuing for an
extremely large workload and the most
important part is that this can be
accessed from anywhere in the world now
let's talk about how Azure can be used
firstly for application development it
could be any application mostly web
applications then you can test the
application see how well it works you
can host the application on the internet
you can create virtual machines like I
mentioned before with the service you
can create these virtual Machines of any
size or Ram that you want you can
integrate and Sync features you can
collect and store matrices for example
how the data Works how the current data
is how you can improve upon it all of
that is possible with these services and
your virtual hard drive switch is an
extension of the virtual machines where
these services are able to provide you a
large amount of storage where data can
be stored you can also check out Azure
Cloud architect course that will help
you master the Azure infrastructure by

so the wide variety of services
available in Azure includes artificial
intelligence plus machine learning plus
analytic services to get and or to give
us a good visual of how the data or how
the application is performing or the
type of the category of data stored and
to read from the logs and variety of
compute Services different VMS with
different size and different operating
systems different containers available
different type of databases available a
lot of developer tools that are
available for us and identity service to
manage our users in the Azure cloud and
those users can be integrated or
Federated with let's say Google Facebook
LinkedIn so they are some external
Federation Services they can be used to
integrate with our identity system iot's
iot Services iot tools and Technologies
available table and management tools to
manage the users you know creating
identities one and then managing them on
top of it is a totally different thing
and we have tools Technologies to manage
the users cool services for a data
migration data migration is now made
simple tools and Technologies available
for mobile application a development and
I can plan my own network in the cloud
with the networking Services I can
Implement my own security both Azure
provided and third-party Security
Services on Azure Cloud that's now
possible and a lot of storage options
available in the cloud so these are just
a glimpse of the big list of services
available in Azure Cloud so that was a
glimpse of what's available in the cloud
let's talk about the services in a
specific let's say compute for example
you know whenever we're building a new
new application or deploying existing
ones the Azure compute service provides
the infrastructure we need to run and
maintain our application we can easily
tap in the capacity that Azure cloud
service has and we can scale our compute
requirement on demand we can also
containerize our application we have the
option of choosing windows or Linux via
machine and take the advantage of the
flexible options Azure provides for us
to migrate our VMS to Azure and lot more
and these compute Services also include
a full-fledged identity solution meaning
integration with active directory in the
cloud or an on-premises and lot more
let's look at some of the services that
this compute domain provides some of the
services the compute domain provides are
virtual machines and this Azure virtual
machines gives us the ability to develop
and manage a virtual computer
environment or a virtualized environment
inside azure's Cloud environment that
too in a virtual private Network now we
will talk about virtual private Network
at a later point but as of now just know
that there are a lot of services
available in Azure compute service that
we can get benefited from we can always
choose from a very wide range of compute
options for example you know we have an
option to choose the operating system we
have the option to choose whether the
system should be in on premises or in
the cloud or do we want to maintain the
environment both in on-premises and in
the cloud we have the option of choosing
the operating system whether we want to
use our own operating system with some
soft software attached to it or do we
want to go and buy the operating system
from the cloud from Azure Marketplace
and these are just a few of the options
available for us when we want to buy the
compute environment and these complete
environments are easily scalable meaning
we can easily scale our VM instances
from one instance to thousands of
virtual machines in a matter of minutes
or simply put in a couple of button
clicks and all these services are
available on a pair for what we use
model meaning there is no upfront cost
we use the service and then pay for the
services that we have used there's no
literal or long term commitment when it
comes to using virtual machines in the
cloud and these most of the services are
built on a paper minute billing basis
all right and at no point because of the
paper minute building model at no point
we will be overpaying for any of the
services that's that's attractive isn't
it let's talk about batch service now
bad service is always independent
regardless of whether you choose windows
or Linux it's going to run fairly well
and with bad service we can take
advantage of the environment's unique
features and not only that in short the
batch service helps us to manage the
whole batch environment and also it
helps to schedule the jobs now this
Azure batch service is actually runs on
a large scale parallel and high
performance Computing because of that
batch jobs are highly efficient in Azure
and when we run batch services this
Azure batch creates a pool of computer
nodes and installs the needed
applications that we want to run and
then it schedules jobs to those
individual nodes in those pools as a
customer there is no need for us to
install a cluster or there is no need
for us to install a software that
actually can use the jobs or even to
manage or even to scale those
infrastructure or the software because
everything is managed by Azure and this
batch service is a platform as a service
there is no additional charge for using
this batch service except for I mean the
only charges that we'll be paying is for
the virtual machines that the service
uses and the storage that we will be
using of course and the networking
services that we would be using for this
batch serves let's summarize this batch
service we have a choice of operating
system that we can pick and use and it
scales by itself now the alternative for
the batch would be queues but in queues
we'll have to pre-provision and pay for
the infrastructure even if we're not
using it but with a batch we only pay
for what we use and this bad service
helps us to manage the application
manage the scheduling as a whole as if
they are just one thing as next thing in
compute domain let's talk about this
fabric service now this fabric service
is actually a distributed system
platform that helps us to package deploy
and manage a scalable and a very
reliable microservice and containers and
what does it help this Azure fabric
service helps us or it helps the
developers and administrators so they
can avoid the complex infrastructure
problems and they can focus only on
implementing workloads or taking care of
their development taking care of their
application instead of spending time on
infrastructure so what service fabric
service fabric it provides runtime
capabilities and life cycle management
two applications that are composed of
microservices no infrastructure
management at all and with service
fabric we can easily scale the
application to tens or hundreds or even
to thousands of machines here machines
represent containers as next thing in
compute domain let's talk about virtual
machine scale set now this virtual
machine scale set it lets us to create a
group of identical load balanced VMS I
just want to mention it again it helps
us to manage a group identical and load
balanced VMS the number of instances or
the number of VM instances in an in a
scale set can increase or decrease in
response to the demand or in response to
a schedule that we Define you know the
resources needed on a Monday morning is
not the same as that would be required
on a Saturday or a Sunday morning all
right and even within the day the
resources that would be needed in the
beginning of the business hour is not
the resources that would be needed now
at noon or you know after eight or nine
in the evening so the demands could
actually vary in environment and this
skill set helps us to take care of the
varying demand or take care of the
different infrastructure requirement at
a different schedule throughout the day
throughout the week throughout the month
or could be throughout the year as well
the skill set also allows us to provide
High availability to our applications
and it helps us to centrally manage
configure and update a large number of
VMS as if they they are just one thing
now you might ask well virtual machines
are enough why would we need a virtual
machine skill set just like I said this
virtual machine skills that helps us
with a greater redundancy and improved
performance for our applications and
those applications can be accessed
through a load balancer that actually
distributes other requests to the
application instances so in a nutshell
this virtual machine scale set it helps
us to create a large number of identical
virtual machines number one and with
skill set we can increase or decrease
the virtual machine with virtual machine
scale said we can centrally manage and
configure and update a big group of VMS
and it's a great use case when it comes
to Big Data or container workloads as
next thing in compute domain let's talk
about cloud services now this Azure
cloud service is actually a platform as
a service and it's very friendly in fact
it is designed for applications that
support scalability or an application
that requires scalability or reliability
and and on top of it you want them to be
very inexpensive to operate so Azure
cloud service provides all these so
where would this cloud service run well
it runs on a VM but it's a platform as a
service VMS are infrastructure as a
service and when we run applications on
VM through cloud service it becomes
platformed as a service so here is how
you got to be thinking with
infrastructure as a service like VMS we
first create and configure the
environment and then we run applications
on top of it let's go the responsibility
the responsibility for us in VM is that
we manage everything end to end like you
know deploying new patches picking the
versions of the operating system and
making sure they are intact and all that
stuff it's all managed by us but on the
contrary with platform as a service it's
I mean it's as if the environment is
already ready all that you have to do is
deploy your application in it and manage
the platform I mean manage the platform
not as an administrator because all the
administration is taken care by Azure
like you know deploying new versions of
the operating system it's all handled by
the Azure so we deploy the application
and we manage the application that's it
infrastructure management is handled by
Azure so what does cloud service provide
this cloud service provides a platform
where we can write the application code
and we don't have to worry about
Hardware simply hand over the code and
cloud service takes care of it so no
worry on the hardware at all so
responsibilities like patching what do
we do if something crashes how do I
update the infrastructure how do I
manage the maintenance or the downtime
in the underlying infrastructure all
that is handled by Azure it also
provides a good testing environment for
us you know we can simply run the code
test it before it's actually released to
the production I want to expand a bit on
these testing applications so this Azure
cloud service it actually gives us an
staging environment for testing a new
release without it affecting the
existing release which actually reduces
the customer downtime so we can run the
application test it and anytime that's
ready for production all that's needed
for us to do to move it to production is
simply to swap the staging environment
into the production environment and the
old production environment will now
become the new staging envelope
government where we can add more to it
and then swap it back at a later point
so it kind of gives us in swappable
environment for testing or applications
and not only that it gives us Health
monitoring alerts it helps us to monitor
the health and availability of our
application and there is a dashboard we
can benefit from when we use Azure cloud
services and that shows the key
statistics all in one place and we can
also set up real-time alerts to one when
a service availability or a certain
metrics that we are concerned about
degrades as next thing in compute domain
let's talk about functions now functions
are serverless Computing and many times
if you heard about Azure being
serverless a lot of time they are
referencing or the person who's talking
to you is referencing to serverless
Computing or Azure functions which is a
serverless Computing service hosted on
Microsoft Azure the main motive of a
function is to accelerate and simplify
application development functions helps
us to run code on demand without we need
to pre-provision or manage any Azure
infrastructure so Azure functions are
script or a piece of code that gets run
in response to an event that you want to
handle so in short we can just write a
code that you need for a problem at hand
without actually worrying about the
whole application or the infrastructure
that will be running that code and the
best of all the best is when we use
functions we only pay for the time that
our code runs so what does functions
provide or what is azure functions
provide Azure functions allow users to
build applications using serverless a
simple functions with a programming
language of our choice so the current
programming languages that are supported
is C Sharp F sharp node.js the Java and
PHP so here we really don't have to
worry about provisioning or maintaining
servers if a code requires more resource
yes Azure functions handles or it
provides the additional resources needed
by the court and the best part is we
only pay for the amount of time the
functions are running not the resources
but the amount of time the function is
running as next thing and moving to the
new domain let's talk about the
container domain in Azure now the
container domain or the container
service it allows us to quickly deploy a
production ready kubernetes or a Docker
swarm cluster now what's a container a
container is a standard unit of software
that packages of code and all its
dependencies so the applications run
quickly and reliably from one Computing
environment to another it could be a
testing to staging to developing
development environment to staging to
production or from one production to
another production or on premises to
cloud or One Cloud to another Cloud vice
versa now imagine we had an option not
to worry about the VM and just focus on
the application well that's exactly what
containers helps us achieve so these
container instances enable us to focus
on applications and not worrying about
managing VMS or not worrying about the
learning the new tools required to
manage the VMS or even the deployment
and our applications that we create they
run in a container running in a
container is what helps us to achieve
all these not being able to manage or
not needing to manage the virtual
machines so these containers they can be
deployed into the cloud using a single
command if you're using command line
interface and a couple of button clicks
if we are using the Azure portal and
these containers are kept lightweight
but they are equally secured as virtual
machines let's talk about container
service as next thing the container
service or or sometimes called as Azure
kubernetes service it helps us to manage
the containers containers one thing and
a service that's used to manage the
container is another thing now this
kubernetes service or ACS it helps us to
manage the containers so let's expand on
this a bit so this Azure container
service or ACS it actually provides a
way to simplify the creation
configuration and management of a
cluster of virtual machines that are
pre-configured to run containerized
applications on top of them now
deploying them deploying these
containers might take like 15 to 20
minutes or deploying the virtual
machines that run containers in it might
take 15 to 20 minutes and once they are
provisioned we can actually manage them
by using simple SSH tunnel into them and
this ACS when it runs application it
runs applications from Docker images
what does that mean a Docker images
makes sure that at the applications the
container runs are fully portable images
are portable and ACS also helps us to
orchestrate the container environment
not only that it also helps us to ensure
that these applications that we run in
containers can be scaled to thousands or
even tens of thousands of containers so
in a nutshell managing an existing
application into a container and running
it using AKs or ACS is really easy or
that's what it is all about to make the
application management or migration easy
now managing the container based
architecture and we discussed that a
containers could be tens or even tens of
thousands of containers so managing them
is Made Simple using this container
services and even training of model
using a large data set in a complex and
resource intensive environment this AKs
helps us to simplify that environment
all right as next thing in contain in a
domain let's talk about container
registry we spoke about registry a
little bit when we spoke about Docker
images so container registry is a single
place where we can store our images
which are Docker images when we use when
we use containers it's it's Docker
images that we use for our image
purposes so these container images are a
central registry that can be used to
ease container development by easing the
storage and management of container
images so there we can store all kind of
images like Docker swarm are the images
used in Docker swarm or in kubernetes
everything can be stored in container
registry in Azure now anytime we store a
container image it provides us an option
for geo replication what that means is
that we can efficiently manage a single
registry replicated across multiple
regions now these Geo replication and it
actually enables us to manage Global
deployments assuming we are having an
environment that requires a global
deployment so it helps us to manage
Global deployments as one entity because
we are Geo replicating we would be
updating we would be editing one image
and that image gets replicated
throughout the global replication
centers we would have set up and so just
one editing would have actually edited
the global images and those global
images will have provisioned the global
application so one edit replication and
then posting of the applications Global
wide and this replication also helps us
to helps us Network latency because you
know anytime an application needs to
deploy it does not have to rely on a
single source which which can be reached
only through high latency Network
because we have Global replications
around the world anytime the application
wants to check back it would check back
uh the application which is in a very
nearby location for the application
itself Global replication means that we
are managing it as a single entity
that's being replicated across the
multiple regions in the globe has next
thing in a learning let's talk about
Azure databases now this Azure databases
are a rational in fact they have many
flavors in them we're going to look at
different flavors or SQL nosql cache
type of database that Azure offers so
we're going to learn one at a time or
we're going to learn one by one so this
Azure SQL database is a rational
database in fact it's a rational
database as a service it's managed by
Azure we don't get to do a lot of
management in it so it's a rational
database as a service based on Microsoft
SQL Server database engine and this
database is a high performance database
it's very Bible and it's very secure as
well and this High reliability high
performance and for this high security
we really don't have to do anything it
comes along with it and it's managed by
Azure and there are two things that I
definitely need to mention about Azure
SQL database that is it's an intelligent
service number one it's fully managed by
Azure and it also has this one good
thing which is it has built-in
intelligence that learns app patterns
and adapts to maximize performance and
reliability and data protection of the
application that's something that's not
found in many of the other Cloud
providers that I'm aware of so I thought
I'll mention it so it uses built-in
intelligence to learn about the user's
database patterns and helps improve
performance and protection and migration
or importing data is very easy when it
comes to Azure SQL database so it can be
readily or immediately used for analytic
reporting and intelligent applications
in Azure as next thing let's talk about
Azure Cosmo DB now Azure Cosmo DB is a
database service that is for nosql type
and it's it's created to provide low
latency and an application that scales
dynamically or that scales rapidly now
this Azure cosmodb is an a globally
distributed service
and it's a multi-modal database this can
be provisioned in a click of a button
that's all we got to do if we need to
provision and Azure Cosmo DB in the
Azure it helps with scaling the database
now we can elastically and independently
scale throughput and storage across this
database and in any of the Azure
geographic regions it provides a good
throughput it provides good latency it
provides good availability and it
provides our Azure promises a
comprehensive SLA that no other database
can offer that's the best part about
cosmodb so this Cosmo DB was built with
a global distribution in mind and it's
built with the horizontal scale in mind
and all this we can use by only paying
for what we have used and remember the
difference between Azure Cosmo DB and
the SQL database is that Azure Cosmo DB
supports nosql whereas SQL doesn't all
right few other things about Azure Cosmo
DB is it allows users to use key value
graph a column family and document data
it also gives users a number of AP
options like SQL JavaScript mongodb and
and few others that you might want to
check in the document at the time of
reading and the best part here is that
all that we mentioned we get to use only
by paying for the amount of storage and
throughput that are required and the
storage and the throughput can be
elastically scaled based on the
requirement of that R alright let's talk
about redis cache discussion about Azure
database won't be complete without we
talking about released cache now redis
cache is a secure data cache it's also
called it's also sometimes called as
messaging broker that provides high
throughput and low latency access to
data for the applications now redis
cache is based on an popular open source
caching product which is redis sometimes
called as there is cash now what's the
use case it's typically used to Cache to
improve the performance and scalability
of a system that rely heavily on
back-end data stores now performance
when we use redis cache is improved by
temporarily copying the frequently
accessed data to a fast storage located
very close to the application now with
redis cache this fast storage is located
in memory with redis cache instead of
being loaded from the actual disk in the
database itself now this redis Cache can
also be used as an in-memory data
structure store not only that it can be
used as a distributed non-relational
database and a message broker so there
are variety of use cases for this
various cache and by using various cache
the application performance is improved
by taking advantage of the low latency
and the height throughput performance
that this redis cache engine provides so
to summarize this redis cache when we
use redis cache data is stored in the
memory instead of the disk to ensure
that there is high throughput and low
latency when the application needs to
read the data it provides various levels
of scaling without any downtime or
interference now this various cache is
actually backed by reduce server and it
supports a string hashes linked list and
various other data structures now let's
talk about security and identity
Services now identity management in
specific is a process of authenticating
first and then authorizing using
security principles now not only that
identity management involves controlling
information about those principal
identities you might ask now what's a
principal identity now Identity or
principal identity are Services
applications users groups and a lot more
the specialty about this identity
management is that it not only helps
authenticate and authorize principles in
Cloud it also helps authenticate and
authorize principles or resources on
premises especially when you run an
hybrid Cloud environment so all these
services and features that this identity
management helps us to get additional
level of validation like identity
management can provide multi-factor
authentication it can provide access
policies based on condition a permit or
deny based on condition it can also
monitor suspicious activity and not only
that it can also report it it can also
help generate alerts for potential
security issues and in a way to mitigate
it can send us an alert so we can get
involved and prevent and security
accident from happening so let's talk
more about identity management so some
of the services under security and
identity G management or Azure security
center now this Azure security Center
provides Security Management and threat
protection across the workloads in both
cloud and in the hybrid environment it
helps control user access and
application control to stop any
malicious activity if present it helps
us to find and fix vulnerabilities
before they can be even exploited it
integrates very well with analytic
methods that helps us to identify or it
gives us the intelligent to identify or
deduct attacks and prevent them before
it can actually happen and it also works
seamlessly with hybrid environments so
you don't have to have one policy for
on-premises and one policy for the cloud
it's now a Unified Service both for
on-premises and the cloud the next
service in security and identity would
be keyboard now a key vault is a service
or a feature that help Safeguard the
cryptographic keys and any other Secrets
used by the cloud applications and the
services in other words this Azure key
vault is a tool for securely storing and
accessing the secrets of the environment
I mean the secret Keys now a secret is
anything that you really want to have a
very tight control access like the
certificates like the passwords stuff
like that now if I tell you what keyword
actually solves that would actually
explain what keyword is now key vault is
used in Secrets management it's helped
in securely storing The Tokens The
passwords the certificates it helps in
Key Management and what really helps in
creating and controlling the encryption
keys that we would use to encrypt data
it helps in certificate management
talking about the certification
management it helps us to easily
provision manage and deploy pop public
and private SSL TLS certificates in
Azure and lot more so in a nutshell this
key wall it provides users the ability
to provision new walls and keys in just
a matter of minutes all that in a single
command or all that in a couple of
button clicks it also helps users to
centrally manage their Keys Secrets and
policies next in the list let's talk
about Azure active directory now Azure
active directory it helps us to create
intelligent driven access policies to
limit resource usage and manage user
identities but what does that mean now
this Azure active directory is a cloud
based active directory and identity
management service now Azure active
directory combines and it's actually a
combination of the core directory
Services Plus application access
management plus identity protection and
and one good thing about this Azure in
fact there are a lot of good things but
especially when you're running hybrid
environments you might wonder well how
does Azure active directory is going to
behave now this Azure active directory
is built to work on on-premises and
Cloud environment as well not only that
it also works seamlessly with mobile
applications as well so in a nutshell
this Azure active directory it acts as
an central point of identity and access
management for our Cloud environment it
also provides good Security Solutions
that protect against unauthorized access
of our app and the data now that we have
discussed about security and identity
let's talk about the management tools
that Azure has to offer Azure provides
built-in management and account
governance tools that helps
administrators and developers that helps
them to keep their resources secure and
very compliant and again it helps both
in on-premises and in the cloud
environment and these management tools
help us to monitor the infrastructure
monitor the applications it also helps
in provisioning and configuring
resources it also helps in updating apps
it helps in analyzing threats taking
backup of the resources build a disaster
recoveries it also helps in applying
policies and conditions to automate our
environment we use Azure management
tools and it's also used in cost control
methods so this Azure management plays a
wide role across the Azure services and
in the management tools first comes the
Azure advisor now this Azure advisor it
acts as a guide to educate us about
Azure best practices it throws
recommendations that we can select on
the basis of the category of service and
it also provides the impact it can have
or the impact that would happen in our
environment if we follow the
recommendations given and
recommendations or first one is the
recommendations are kind of templatized
and it throws the templatized
recommendations not only that it also
provides customized recommendations on
the basis of the configuration on the
basis of our usage patterns and these
recommendations are not Parts it's not
like something that it recommends and
then just leaves us hanging there these
recommendations provided are very easy
to follow very easy to implement and see
results you can think of azure advisor
as an a Very personalized Cloud
consultant that helps you to follow best
practices to optimize our deployments it
kind of analyzes our resources our
configurations our usage and then it
recommends a solution for us that really
helps in improving the cost
Effectiveness improving the performance
improving High availability and
improving Security in our Azure
environment so with this Azure advisor
we can get a proactive actionable and
personalized best practice
recommendations now you don't have to be
an expert just follow the Azure advisor
and your environment is going to be good
it also helps in improve the performance
security High availability of our
environment and also it helps in
bringing down the overall Azure spend
and the best part is it's a free service
that analyzes our Azure use message and
provides recommendations how we can
optimize our Azure resource to reduce
cost and reduce cost at the same time
boost the performance helps in
strengthening the security and improve
the overall reliability of our
environment and next in the list would
be Network Watcher now this network
Watcher helps users identify and gain
insights in the overall Network
performance and the health of the
overall environment now these Azure
Watchers provides enough tools to
monitor to diagnose to view the metrics
and to enable or disable logs which
means it will generate and collect the
logs for resources in the Azure virtual
Network so with network Watcher can
monitor and diagnose issues in
networking without even logging into the
virtual machines with just the logs
which are real time we can actually come
to a conclusion what could be wrong in a
certain resource in a VM or in a
database you know but just looking at
the logs and not only that it's used for
analytic or to gain some intelligence of
what's happening in our Network we can
again lot of insight to the current
Network traffic pattern using the
security group flow logs that this
network Watcher offers it also helps in
investigating VPN connectivity issues
using detailed logs now you might or
might not know that you know VPN
troubleshooting requires both parties or
it involves two parties another person
the network administrator on this side
and the network administrator on the
other side and they will have to check
logs in their end and we'll have to
check logs and over and stuff like that
but with the network Watcher it kind of
takes it to the next level the logs
itself we could easily identify which
side is having the issue and suggest an
appropriate fix and the next in the list
would be Microsoft Azure portal now this
Microsoft Azure portal it provides a
single unified console to perform
various number of activities like
building not only building managing and
monitoring the web applications that we
build now this portal can be used to
organize our environment or the
appearance of the environment or the
visual of the environment based on our
work style and using Azure portal users
can control who gets to manage or access
the resources all from the Azure portal
and this Azure portal gives a very good
visibility on the spends that happen on
each resource right and if we can
customize it we can also identify spends
based on teams spends based on days
spends based on Department stuff like
that so it kind of gives us a good
visual offer where the money is spending
or where is the bill consumed within the
Azure environment next in the list would
be Azure a resource manager now Azure
resource manager enables us to manage
the usage of the application resources
now we use resource manager to deploy
Monitor and manage solution resources as
a group as if it's one single entity now
the infrastructure of our application is
typically made of various components
which includes virtual machine storage
virtual Network web app database servers
some other third-party services that we
might use in our environment and they
are by nature separate services but with
Azure resource manager we don't see them
as different components or different
entities instead we see them as related
services in a group that supports an
application now we kind of get the
relation between them instead of you
know letting them spread Azure results
manager identifies the relation between
them and helps us to visually see them
all as one or single entity not only
that Azure resource manager helps or it
ensures that the resources that we
provision or deployed at a constant rate
along with the other application it also
helps users to visually see their
resources and how they are connected and
that helps in managing the resources a
lot better resource Group also is used
to control who can access the resources
within the user's organization kind of
gives you the fine grained control over
who gets to access and who does not get
access and the last one in the
management tools would be Automation and
this automation gives us the ability to
automate configure and install upgrades
across hybrid environments it provides a
cloud-based Automation and configuration
service not only that this can be
applied for non-azure environments as
well which is on-premises so some of the
automation we could do is process
automation update management automation
configuration features automation stuff
like that and this Azure automation
provides complete control during the
deployment operation and also during the
decommissioning of the workloads and
resources with automation we can
actually automate a time consuming or
mundane or any task that's error prone
because of human errors those things can
be automated so irrespective of how many
times you run it it's going to run the
same way and that really helps in
reducing the overall time and also the
overhead cost because a lot of the
things are automated which means it's
human error-free which means the
application is not going to break and
keep running for a longer time with
automation we can actually build a good
inventory of operating system resources
and configuration items all in one place
with ease and this really helps in
tracking the changes and investigating
the issue let's say something happened
because we have automation because it's
logging the configuration changes it's
easy to track easy to identify easy to
identify what has changed lately that
has broken the environment go back and
fix it or kind of roll it back that
solves the problem and that actually
summarizes the Azure management tools or
Management Services now let's talk about
the networking tools or the networking
services available in Azure there are
variety of services especially
networking services that Azure offers
and I'm sure it's going to be an
interesting one let's begin our
discussion with content delivery Network
now the content delivery Network in
short CDN it allows us to perform secure
and a very reliable content delivery not
only that it also helps in accelerating
the delivery time or in other words
reducing the delivery time also called
as low times it also helps in Saving
bandwidth and increases in
responsiveness to the application so
let's expand on this the content
delivery network is actually a
distributed network of servers that can
efficiently deliver web content to users
now cdns are we going to use the word
CDN here cdns store cached content on
global Edge servers also called as pops
point of presence locations that are
very close to the end users so the
latency is minimized it's like taking a
copy of the data or taking multiple copy
of the data and storing it in different
parts of the world and whoever is
requesting it the data gets delivered to
them from a server which is very locally
to them so this CDN offers developers a
global solution for rapidly delivering
high bandwidth content to users by
caching the content in a strategically
placed location which is very near to
them so these content delivery networks
it really helps in handling that's one
advantage you get for Content delivery
Network that's we can handle spikes and
heavy loads very efficiently and we can
also run analytic against the logs that
gets generated in content delivery
Network which helps in gaining good
Insight on the workflow and what would
be the future business need for that
application and this just like a lot of
other services this is on a pay as you
go type so you use the results first and
then you only pay for what you have used
the next one in networking would be
expressed route now express route is
actually circuit or a link that provides
an a direct private connection to Azure
and because it's direct it gives low
latency link to Azure it gives good
speed and reliability for the Azure data
transfer it could be on premises to
Azure so it gives very good speed it
gives increased reliability and low
latency for that connection let's expand
on this a bit now this express route is
in service that actually provides a
private connection between Microsoft
Data Center and the infrastructure in
our premises or in a different
co-location facility that we might have
now these Express routes do not go over
the public internet and because they
don't go over the public internet they
offer a high security reliability and
speed and low latency compared to the
connections which are in the the
internet because it's fast because it's
reliable because it has low latency it
can be used as an extension of our
existing data center you know users are
not going to feel the difference whether
they are accessing services from an
on-premises or in the cloud environment
because latency is minimized as much as
possible users are really not going to
see the difference and because it's a
private line and not an public internet
line it can be used to build hybrid
applications without compromising a
privacy or at the performance now these
virtual private Cloud these expressed
routes can be used for taking backups if
assume a backup going through the
internet that would be a nightmare if
you use express route for backups that's
going to be fast and imagine recovering
a data through the internet from the
cloud through the internet to the
on-premises in a time of disaster that
would be the worst nightmare so these
Express routes can be used not only to
backup but also recover the data because
it provides good speed low latency
recurring the data is going to be a lot
sooner the next product or service or
we're gonna discuss in networking is
azure DNS now Azure DNS allows us to
host domain name in Azure and these
domain names come with an exceptional
performance and availability now Azure
DNS is used to set up and manage DNS
zones and records for our domain name in
the cloud now this Azure DNS is a
service for DNS just like the name says
and it provides name resolution by using
azure's infrastructure and by using this
domain we can actually manage the DNS
our cells through the Azure portal with
the same credential imagine having a DNS
provider which does not even belong in
RIT imagine that environment you know we
would have a separate portal to manage
the DNS environment now those are gone
and now we can actually manage the DNS
in the very same Azure portal where we
use the rest of the other services and
this Azure DNS very much integrates with
other DNA service providers it uses a
Global Network of name servers to
provide fast response to DNS queries and
these domains are having additional
availability compared to the other
domain service providers availability
promises these are going to have more
availability than the rest because most
of the servers are maintained by a
Microsoft and it helps resolve sooner it
helps resyncing let's say a server fails
it kind of helps resyncing with the rest
of the servers so all the Microsoft's
environment all the Microsoft's Global
Network of name servers kind of ensures
that our domain names are resolved
properly not only properly but also are
available most of the time all right
next in the list in networking Services
is virtual Network I'm sure this is
going to be very interesting and I'm
sure you're gonna like it so this
networking or virtual Network talking in
Azure it actually allows us to set up
our own private cloud in the public
Cloud it gives us an isolated and highly
secure environment for our application
let's expand on this then this Azure
virtual Network helps us to provision
Azure virtual machines and it helps us
to securely communicate with other
on-premises and internet networks it
also helps in controlling the traffic
that flows through or Flows In and Out
of This virtual Network to other virtual
networks and to the internet now this
Azure virtual Network sometimes called
as v-net is actually a representation of
our own network in the cloud it's
actually a logical isolation of the
Azure Cloud dedicated to our
subscription all our environments are
provisioned in a v-net that is separate
from another customer's witness that way
we have that logical separation there so
this virtual Network can also be used to
provision our vpns in the cloud so we
can connect the cloud and the
on-premises infrastructure and lot more
especially in a environment where we
have hybrid environment surely we will
be using virtual Network because that's
going to require VPN for secure data
transfer in and out of the cloud and in
and out of the on-premises environment
all right so it kind of gives us an
boundary for all the resources so all
the traffic between the Azure resources
they kind of logically stay in between
or logically stay within the Azure
virtual Network and here we can design
the network is given over to us you know
you can pick the IP you can pick the
routing you can pick the subnet and a
lot of freedom is given or I would say a
lot of control on how the network is
designed it's not like something that's
already cooked and we only get to use it
no we can actually build the network
from the scratch we can pick the IP
address that we like we can pick you
know which subnet needs to communicate
with the other subnets stuff like that
and like I said if you are using hybrid
environment you definitely would be
requiring a virtual Network because it
helps connect the on-premises and the
cloud in a secure fashion using VPN the
last product we're going to discuss and
networking is a load balancer this load
balancer actually provides application a
good availability and a good Network
performance so how does it work it
actually works by load balancing the
traffic to and from the virtual machine
and the cloud resources not only that it
also load balances between cloud and
cross premises virtual networks with
Azure load balancer we can actually
scale our application and create high
availability for our services which
means Our obligation will be available
most of the time if any of the server
goes dead the server does not get
traffic what happens if the server gets
traffic user is going to experience
downtime what happens if the server does
not get traffic user won't experience
any downtime the connection is shifted
to an healthy service so the user
experiences uptime all the time so this
load balancer supports inbound and
outbound scenarios and it provides low
latency it gives high throughput of the
data transfer and we can actually scale
up the flow of the TCP and UDP
connections from hundreds to thousands
to even Millions because we have a load
balancer now in between the user and the
application so how does it operate this
load balancer actually receives the
traffic and it load balances the traffic
to the back end pool of instances
connected to it according to the rule
and the health probe that we set that's
how it maintains High availability so
what does load balancer help it helps in
creation of high available scalable
application in the cloud in minutes it
can be used to automatically scale the
environment with the increasing
application traffic and one feature of
load balancer is to check the health of
the user's application instance and it
removes or it stops sending the request
to the unhealthy instance and kind of
shifts that connection to the healthy
instance that way a user or a connection
does not get stuck with an instance
That's not healthy that's all that you
need to know about the networking
Services now let's talk about the
storage services or the storage domain
in Azure now Azure storage in general is
a Microsoft manage service providing
cloud storage which basically is highly
available secure durable scalable and
redundant because it's all managed by
Azure we don't get to manage a lot of it
and these Azure storages are a group of
storage Services they cater different
needs and the storage products include
Azure blobs which is actually an object
storage it includes Azure data Lake it
includes Azure files as you see it it
includes Azure queues it includes Azure
tables and lot more but let's start our
discussion with Azure store simple Azure
store simple is an hybrid cloud storage
solution that actually lowers the cost
of storage to nearly 60 percent of how
much you'd be actually spending without
using it so Azure simple storage or
store simple is an integrated storage
solution that manages the storage task
between on-premises and the cloud
storage what I really like about Azure
is that it's built around the hybrid
environment in mind there are a lot of
other Cloud providers that are there
where running and hybrid environment is
a big challenge you know it has some
compatibility you won't be able to find
an hybrid or a on-premises and Cloud
solution for your need stuff like that
but with Azure especially when it comes
to storage a lot of the things that
we're going to see it clearly is
designed with hybrid environment in mind
all right so let's come back and talk
about store simple so store simple is an
very efficient cost effective and a very
easily manageable sand storage area
networking solution in the cloud I
thought I'll throw in this information
the reason why it got store simple is
really because it uses store simple 8000
series devices which are used in Azure
Data Center and this store simple or
simple storage it comes along with
storage sharing to manage the stored
data across the various storage media so
the current the very current data is
actually stored in on-premises on solid
state drives and data that is used less
frequently is stored in hdds or hard
disk drives and the data that requires
archived or that needs to be archived
very old data let's say less frequently
use data candidate for archive they are
actually pushed to the cloud so you see
how this storage tiering automatically
happens in store simple and one another
cool feature of store simple is that it
enables us to create an on-demand and
scheduled backups of data and and then
store the data locally or in the cloud
and these backups are actually taken in
the form of of incremental snapshot
which means that they can be created and
restored quickly it's not a complete
backup it's an incremental backup and
these Cloud snapshots they can be
critically important when there is a
disaster and when there is a disaster
recovery scenario because these
snapshots can be called in and they can
be put on storage systems and then they
become the actual data so recovering is
faster if you have proper scheduled
backups or if you have frequent backups
and this storage simple it really helps
in easing our backup mechanism which
means it kind of eases our Disaster
Recovery steps or procedures as well so
the store simple it can be used to
automate data management data migration
data movement data tearing across the
Enterprise both in cloud and on-premises
it actually improves the compliance and
accelerates the disaster recovery for
our environment and if there is one
thing that's increasing every new day in
our environment that will be storage and
this stores simple addresses that need
and we really don't have to pre-plan or
think in deep or having a proper storage
because now we have a simple storage
available in the cloud and moreover it's
on a pay-as-you-go type so not much free
planning on storage is needed yes there
will be a need but not as much as I
would without the cloud or without the
simple storage and the next service
under storage that we would like to
discuss is the data Lake store this data
Lake store or storage it's a cost
effective solution for big data
analytics in specific so let's expand
this so this is data Lake storage is an
enterprise-wide repository for big data
analytic workload now that's the major
service that's dependent on this data
Lake store and this data Lake enables us
to capture data of any size of any type
and other any injection speed and it
kind of collects them in one single
space or in one single place for
operational efficiency I mean
operational efficiency and for analytic
purpose Hadoop in Azure is very
dependent on this data Lake storage and
this data Lake store is designed with
performance for analytics in mind so
anytime you think of or anytime you're
using analytic in the cloud or anytime
you're using Hadoop in the cloud in
Azure we are definitely using or we will
be to the most part or the normal
procedure or the Right Storage to pick
would be data Lake store in Azure it's
designed with security in mind so
anytime we use Azure storage we can be
rest assured that we are using storage
from within a data center which has or
which was built with security in mind so
this data store also uses Azure blob
storage behind the scenes for or global
scale durability and for performance
let's talk about blob storage now blob
storage provides large amount of storage
and scalability now this blob storage is
the object storage solution for Azure
Cloud let's expand a bit on blob storage
Azure blob storage is Microsoft offering
for object storage now this blob storage
is optimized for storing massive amount
of unstructured data which could be text
or binary data it's designed and it's
optimized for Rapid reads if I explain
to you on what scenarios we would be
using blob storage that might help you
get a good understanding of what blob
storage is so it's help or its design as
of now it's being used in many ID
environments to serve images or
documents directly to the browser it
helps in storing files for distributed
access a lot of Fetchers can fetch data
from Azure blob storage and it currently
helping users stream video and audio
it's currently being used for writing
log files it's currently being used to
store data as backup and restore at a
later point in times of Disaster
Recovery it also is used as an archiving
storage in a lot of cloud ID
environments it's widely used in storing
analytic data not only storing but also
running analytic query against the data
stored in it so that's a wide use case
for blob storage not only that in
addition to all that we mentioned it
also supports versioning so anytime
somebody updates an data a new version
gets created which means at any point I
can roll back as and when needed and it
provides a lot of flexibility on
optimizing the user's storage need it
also supports tearing of the data So
based on need when I actually explore I
would find a lot of options I can pick
from that you know suits to my unique
storage environment or unique storage
need and like I said it stores
unstructured data and this unstructured
data is available for customers through
rest based object storage environment
the next product and storage service
would be queue storage now queue storage
provides durable queues for large volume
cloud services it's a very simple and a
cost effective durable messaging queue
for large workloads let's expand this
queue storage for a moment now this Q
storage is a service for storing large
amount of messages that can be accessed
from anywhere in the world through HTTP
and https calls a single queue or a
single Cube message can be up to like 24
KB in size and a single queue can
contain millions of such 24 KB in size
messages and how much can it hold it can
hold up to the total capacity of the
storage account account itself so that's
kind of easy to translate How much would
it hold and this Azure queue storage it
provides an messaging solution between
applications and components in the cloud
what does it help it helps in designing
an application for scale it helps in
decoupling in the application so you
know it's not very dependent or
sometimes it's not at all dependent on
the other application because now we
have a queue in between which kind of
translates or which kind of connects or
which kind of decouples both the
environment now we have a queue in
between both the environment can scale
up or scale down independently the next
in the storage service would be file
storage let's talk about file storage
now these Azure files provide secure
simple and managed Cloud file shares now
with file share in the cloud it actually
extends the user servers on-premises
performance and capacity and lot of
familiar tools for the cloud file share
management can be used along with the
file storage that we're talking about so
let's expand a bit on file storage now
this Azure files or Azure file storage
offers a fully managed file shares in
the cloud that can be accessed via the
SMB protocol server message block
protocol now this Azure file shares can
be mounted concurrently by cloud or in
on-premises deployments a lot of
operating systems are compatible with it
windows are compatible Linux is
compatible Mac OS is compatible in an
addition to all this being able to run
on on-premises and on the cloud or being
able to access from on-premises and on
the cloud it can also offer cash for
caching the data and keeping it locally
so it's immediately available when
needed so that's some additional feature
I would say that some Advanced feature
that it offers compared to the other
file shares available in the market
let's talk about table storage let's
talk about table storage now table
storage is a nosql key value pair
storage for quick deployments with a
large semi-structured data sets the
difference between one important thing
to note with table storage is that it
has a flexible data schema and also it's
highly available let's expand a bit on
table storage so anytime you want to
pick a schema less a nosql type table
storage is the one we'll end up picking
it provides an key pair attribute
storage with a schema less design this
table storage is very fast and very cost
effective for many of the applications
and for the same amount of data it's a
lot cheaper when you compare it with the
traditional SQL data or data storage so
some of the things that we can store in
the table storage are are of course
they're going to be flexible data sheets
such as user data for web application
address books device information and
other types of metadata for our service
requirements and it can have any number
of tables up to the capacity limit of
the storage account now this is not
possible with SQL this is only possible
with nosql especially with table storage
in Azure explanation of storage really
concluded the length and breadth of the
explanation this CEO was giving his ID
personal but this ID personal is not
done with it yet he still has a question
even after this lengthy discussion and
his question was well there are a lot of
other Cloud providers available what
made you specifically choose Azure I
mean from the kind of question that he
asked we can say that he is very curious
and he definitely had asked and very
thoughtful question so his CEO went on
and started to explain about the other
capabilities of azure or how it kind of
outruns the rest of the cloud providers
so he started or he again started his
discussion but from a different angle
now so he started to explain what are
the capabilities or how Azure is better
than the competitor so he started with
explaining the platform as a service
capabilities and I'm going to tell you
what the CEO told his ID person so this
platform as a service or in platform as
a service the infrastructure management
is completely taken care by Microsoft
allowing users to focus completely on
the innovation no more infrastructure
management responsibilities go and focus
on Innovation that's that's a fancy way
of saying it when we buy platform as a
service that's what we get we can
contribute our time on Innovation and
not just maintaining the infrastructure
and azure especially is dotnet friendly
Azure supports the dotnet programming
language and it has or it is built or
designed or it is optimized to work with
old and the new applications deployed
using.net programming framework so if
your application is dot net most of the
time you would end up picking Azure I
mean if you try to compare most of the
time you would end up picking Azure as
your cloud service provider and the
security offerings that Azure offers is
it's designed based on the security
development life cycle which is an
industry leading Assurance process when
we buy services from Azure it assures
that the environment is designed based
on security development life cycle and
like I mentioned many times in the past
and I would like to mention it again
Azure has well thought about the hybrid
environments which a lot of the cloud
providers have failed so it's very easy
to set up an hybrid environment to
migrate the data or not to migrate the
data and still run a hybrid environment
they work seamlessly with the Azure
because Azure provides seamless
connection across on-premises data
centers and the public Cloud it also has
a very gentle learning curve if you look
at the documentation it's picture rich
and the documentations are neat and
clear with really it would encourage you
to learn more it will encourage you to
think and imagine and try easily get a
grasp of how Services work so it has a
very gentle learning curve Azure allows
the utilization of technologies that
several business have used for years so
that is a big history behind it it has a
very gentle learning curve the
certifications the documentations the
stage by stage certification levels it's
all very gentle learning curve which is
generally missing in other clouds
service providers now this would really
impress the ctOS or people working in
finance and budgeting if an organization
is already using Microsoft software they
can definitely go and Avail or be bold
and ask for a discount that can reduce
the overall Azure spending in other
words overall a pricing of the Azure so
that's what helped or they are the
information that helped the CEO pick
Azure as his cloud service provider and
then the CEO goes on and talks about the
different companies that are currently
using Azure and they are definitely
using Azure for a reason like Pixar
Boeing Samsung EasyJet Xerox BMW 3M they
are major multinational multi-billion
companies they rely run operate their ID
in Azure and this CEO has a thought that
his it person is still not very
convinced unless and until he shows him
a visual of how easy things are in Azure
so he goes on and explains about a
practical application of azure which is
what exactly I'm going to show you as
well all right a quick project on
building an Azure app using or building
a dotnet application in Azure web app
and making it connect to an SQL database
will solidify all the knowledge that we
have gained so far so this is what we're
gonna do I have an Azure account open as
you see logged in and everything is
fresh here let me go to Resource Group
there's nothing in there it's it's kind
of fresh all right I'm logged in and
this is what we're gonna do so we're
going to create an application like this
which is nothing but an to-do
application a to-do list application
we're just going to run from the web app
get information from us and save it in
the database that's connected to it so
you can already see it's a two-tier
application web and DB all right so let
me go back to my Azure account the first
thing is to create an Resource Group
let's give it an a meaningful name let's
call it Azure simply learn right and
it's going to be a free trial and the
location pick one that's nearest to you
or you know wherever you want to launch
your application now for this use case
I'm going to pick Central us and create
it's going to take a while to get
created there you go it's created it's
called Azure simply learn now what do we
need we need an web app and and a
separate SQL database let's first get
our web app running so go to app
services and then click on ADD it's not
the web app plus SQL that we want we
want web app alone for this example so
let's create a web app give it a quick
name let's call it azure
simply learn the subscription is free
trial and I'm going to use my existing
Resource Group a resource Group that we
created sometime back it's going to run
out of Windows and we're going to
publish the code offset we can create it
all right while this is running let me
create my database
right SQL database create a database
give it a name let's call it Azure
simply learn DB
put it in our existing Resource Group
that we created it's going to be a blank
database all right and it's going to
require some settings like the name of
the server and the admin login the
password that goes along and in which
location this is going to be created the
server name is going to be Azure simply
learn DB that's the server name and the
admin login can be what can be the admin
login name let's see
so let's call it simply learn that's my
admin login name
and let me pick a password
click on create so what have we done so
far we have created an web app and we
have created an a database in the
resource Group that we have created so
if I go to Resource Group it's going to
take some time before things show up so
if I go to my Resource Group I only have
one Resource Group as of now Azure
simply learn and there I have a bunch of
resources being created you know it's
still being created right in the
meantime I have my application right
here that's running out of or that's in
Visual Studio as of now right so once
the infrastructure is set and ready in
the Azure console we're gonna go back to
visual studio feed these inputs in the
visual studio so the code knows what the
database is the the credentials to log
into the database stuff like that so
we're going to feed those information in
Visual Studio by that we're actually
feeding it into the application and then
we're going to run it from there
deploying this application takes quite a
while we really got to be patient right
now we have all the resources that we
need for the application to run here is
my database and here is my app service
there's one more thing we need to do
that is create and firewall exception
rule so one more thing needed is to
create a firewall exception rule right
so the application is going to run from
my local desktop and it's going to
connect to the database right so let's
add an exception rule by simply adding
the client ID it's going to pick my IP
the ipf laptop I'm using as of now and
it's going to create an exception to
access the database so that's done now
we can go back to our Visual Studio I
already have a couple of
apps running or couple of configurations
pushed from a visual studio I'm going to
clean that up if you're doing it for the
first time you may not need to do this
all right so let's start from the
scratch
this is very similar to how you would be
doing in your environment right so we're
gonna select an existing Azure app
service now before that I have logged in
as you can see I have logged in with my
credentials so it's going to pull few
things automatically from my Azure
account so in this case I'm gonna use an
existing Azure app so select existing
and then click on publish
all right if you recall these are the
very same resources that we created a
while back
all right we have clicked on Save and
it's running kind of validating the code
and it's going to come up with an URL
now initially the URL is not going to
work because we haven't mapped the
application to the database that would
be the next thing
all right so the app has been published
and it's running from my web app as of
now
it's going to throw an error like you
see it's throwing an error that's
because we haven't mapped the app and
the DB together so let's do that
all right let's do that so let's go to
server Explorer this is where we're
going to see our
databases that we have created now let's
quickly verify that
go back to
the resource Group
right appropriate Resource Group
which is right here
and here I have my database azure
simply learn database
all right it has some issues connecting
to my database give me a quick moment
let's fix it
all right so we'll have to map the
database into this application
right so let's go to the solution
Explorer click on publish
and a page like this gets shown and from
here we can go to configure
here is our web app all right with all
its credentials let's validate the
connection number one
all right and then click on next
this is my DB connection string right
which the app is going to use to connect
to my DB now if you recall rdb was
Azure simply learn DB and that's not
being shown here so let's fix that
right so let's fix that
click on configure and here let's put
our DB servers URL now before that let's
change this to SQL Server
all right and then in here I put the DBS
URL so go back to azure
here is my DB or server's name
put that here
all right
the username to connect to the server
that's right here
put that in
and the password
to connect to the server let's put that
in
all right it's trying to connect to our
azure
portal or the Azure infrastructure and
here is my database if you recall it's
azure
sldb that's the name of the database
Let's test the connection
connection is good click on OK
so now it's showing up correctly Azure
simply learn DB that's the name of the
database that we created now it's
configured
all right let's modify the data
connections
right let's map it to the appropriate
database again all right so our name of
the database is azure simply learn DB
and then it's going to be
SQL Server that's the data source
the
username is simply learn and the
password is
what we have given in the beginning
all right let's validate the connection
it's good click ok
now we're all set
and ready to publish our application
again now the application knows how to
connect to the database we have educated
it with the uh the correct connection
strings the DNS name the username and
the password for the application to
connect to the database
so visual studio is building this
project and once it is up and running
will be prompted with an URL to connect
and anytime we put or we give inputs to
the URL that's gonna receive the input
and save it in the database
all right so here is my to-do list app
and I can start creating to-do list for
myself all right so I have the items
already listed I can create an entry and
these entries get stored in the uh in
the database I can create another entry
and I'll take the dog for a walk that's
gonna get stored I can create another
entry uh book tickets for a scientific
exhibition
and that's going to receive and put that
in the database and that concludes our
session so through this session we saw
how I can use Azure services to create a
web app and connect that to the DB
instance and how those two Services
which are decoupled by default which are
separate by default how I can you know
use the connection strings to make
connection between the app server and
the database and be able to create an
working app you can also check out Azure
Cloud architect course that will help
you master the Azure infrastructure by

and interesting content in this video
we'll go through Azure machine learning
in detail including its capabilities the
Azure ecosystem that supports machine
learning and the various ways we train
and build models
starting with
what is azure machine learning followed
by who is machine learning for
then we will look into its
infrastructure Readiness and security
then we will dive into machine learning
project workflow
following that we will understand
mlops devops for machine learning and at
last we will explore the Azure machine
Learning Studio
after that we will have a demo too
so without doing any further dealing
let's start with the video
so what is azure machine learning
Azure machine learning is a Cloud
solution that helps you speed up and
manage your machine learning projects it
can be used by Machine learning
Specialists data scientists and
engineers in the daily workflows models
are trained and deployed and mlops are
managed
you can use an open source platform like
Pi torch tensorflow or scikit learn to
build a model or use one created in
Azure machine learning
model monitoring retraining and
redeployment are all made easier using
these tools
but this brings us to a question
that who exactly machine learning is for
so individuals and teams deploying mlops
inside their company can use Azure
machine learning to move machine
learning models into production it is
safe and auditable environment
data scientists and machine learning
experts will find tools to help them
speed up and automate their daily tasks
tools for embedding models into
applications or services will be
available to application Developers
platform developers will find a strong
set of tools for constructing Advanced
ml technology underpinned by resilient
agile resource manager apis
now that we know the basics of azure ml
let's have a look at its infrastructure
Readiness and security
so Azure machine learning is an Azure
Cloud platform that adds security
to machine learning projects so
Integrations for security include the
following network security groups in
Azure virtual Networks
Azure keyword is a world where you may
store security Secrets like storage
account access details
and set up an Azure container registry
behind the v-net
so now let's dive down deep and explore
its project workflow
models are usually created as part of
project with a specific goal and
objective
multiple people are usually involved in
these projects iterative development is
used while experimenting with data
algorithms and models
now coming to the Project Life Cycle
while the project lifespan will differ
depending on the project it will
typically look like this
a workspace space organizes a project
and facilitate collaboration among
multiple users who are all working
toward the same goal
users in a workspace May easily share
the result of the experiments through
the studio user interface
or they can use versioned assets for
jobs like environments and storage
references
so users work can be automated in a
machine learning Pipeline and activated
on a timetable or https request when a
project is ready for operation therefore
models can be deployed to the manage
interferencing solution in real time or
batch abstracting away the
infrastructure management that is
traditionally necessary for model
deployment
now let's proceed further and understand
the concept of mlops that is devops for
machine learning
mlops or devops for machine learning is
a process for generating models for
production use
if not reproducible the lifetime of a
model from training to deployment must
be auditable
mlops or machine learning operations is
based on devops principles and methods
to improve workflow efficiency
continuous integration delivery and
deployment for example these ideas are
applied to the machine learning process
by mlops with the purpose of
experimentation and model deployment can
be done more quickly and quality
assurance and end-to-end lineage
tracking are more efficient ways to put
models into production
now
let's explore what is azure ml Studio
so Azure machine Learning Studio is an
online service that includes low code
and no code alternators for project
development and assets Management in
Azure machine learning
basically it is a workspace where you
can create build train the machine
learning models
for inclusive data science platform the
studio integrates no code and no code
first experience
so now that we have covered all the
important concepts of azure machine
learning
let's have a demo for a better
understanding of how machine learning is
used in azure
so let's start with the Demo First you
need to browse the Link studio dot Azure
ml.net and here you need to login with
your Azure account
so once you have logged in you will be
led to a new window
this is new window here you can see a
few options
so let's start and see one by one what
these options are
so the first one is projects basically
this gives you a list of all the
experiments that you have already worked
on so here you can see we haven't worked
on any experiment yet
then comes uh experiment
experiments are all the programs and
codes that you have worked on to create
it or deploy a model that you've just
created for an experiment
so as I said we haven't created any
experiment yet so the list is and I'll
over here
when you click on samples you can see a
few
sample experiments provided to you by
azure
portal by default
and following that we have web services
so we all know since Azure is a cloud
computing platform so all the data
gathered from our experiments needs to
be uploaded to the cloud so web services
gives you a list of all the experiments
that you have in the cloud so you can
access them from anywhere
so uh when you create an experiment and
work on it when you add it to the cloud
the data is stored here
so then comes data sets
it gives you all the data sets you have
in your Azure portal when you click on
the samples option
again you can see all this data sets
provided to you by default in your Azure
portal
then comes train models
so while working on an experiment you
will come across a point where you need
to train your model
so basically this gives you a list of
all the models that you have trained in
experiments or Azure programs
and in the last com settings
any changes that you want to make to
your workspace is done under settings
here you can see uh this is your
workspace name workspace description
which is by default and all the details
is provided
here only so whatever changes you want
to make your workspace you will be doing
this over here
so now let's start with a demo
so down below you can see the ad or new
Option here
so click on it
and then you can see there are a few
ways templates provided by you
provided to you by Azure itself so we'll
click on blank experiment
once you click on the blank experiments
you'll be guided to a new experiment
window
so this is the new window and this
window is divided into three parts
these are the components
where you will plan your model
this is the canvas to design your model
and then the properties of the model
in the components section you can see
samples already present there so you can
select any one of them according to your
requirements so here when I'm typing
samples
uh
I'll work on airport codes datasets so I
just need to drag this option over here
but before starting with our experiment
let's change the name
so here I'm changing it to airport
codes
demo model
so now you can see the name of the
experiment this changed
now when you click on it
and select visualize
just a second
you can see the number of rows and
columns provided to it the datas which
is required for its data set to be
created and for its model to be created
so the four rows four columns are
airport ID city state and name
now we will move towards the part where
we Define field we need to make a
predictions for so type columns in the
search
bar
under manipulation section
you can
see there are multiple options provided
to you
so here we will select
select columns and data sets
as we are working on data sets
now connect your data set with this
option
so you can see a red alert over here
so
when you click on it
you can see it is asking for values in
your data set so to add values click on
the launch column selector under
properties
section
so once you click on it here you need to
select all the options needed per
required values so for my experiment
model I need all these data sets so I'll
add all of these and then click on the
save option
so let me just add this
let's see now I have saved
all the values I need in our in my data
set
so now you can see the alert is gone
so now we have the data sets that we
want to work on so let's look for an
appropriate algorithm for it
so while looking into the classification
algorithm
we know that our
so here you can see it under
classification model we have
these options
so we know that the target value is
divided into two classifications so the
algorithm we will be using is a
two class
so we will be using two class booster
decision tree
because it calculates the accuracy for
every node and once the calculated
accuracy is more than a required
accuracy then only it moves to the next
node
so basically this gives you a prediction
value close to the accurate value of the
model
so we will just drag this option over
here
so now the next step we have is to train
our model so we just need to type train
over here
and select train model option
so
just drag it to the canvas now connect
the tool booster decision tree to the
train model
now you can again see the red a lot for
a required data as it doesn't have any
data to work on so our next step is to
split the data
so we'll type split
and drag this play data option on our
canvas
as you can see this is also saying
it needs an input Port data set so we
connect a data set with it
so
that it is provided with the
data
so when you click on it you can see it
it is asking for a split percentage
so you split the data into training and
testing where 80 goes to training and 20
to testing so we will mention 0.08 over
here
and
so now we will just connect the 80 data
off to the train model
as we said the 80 goes for training
but you can still see the alert in the
train model because it is not aware of
the column
it needs to train on
so we will click on
uh
launch column selector
now you just need to select all the
columns
you need to work on so I'm selecting the
airport ID number
now you can see uh once I save it
the other alert is gone
now our next step is to find the score
of a model so let's type score
in our search bar
and drag the score model over
here
let me just reduce the size of the
canvas yeah
so we will just connect our train model
to the score model
so
again you will see the Red Alert as it
doesn't know the data it needs to test
on so for that we will connect the
remaining testing data in the split data
option to the
score model
now you can see the reload option is
gone
now coming to the final step that is
evaluation of the model so let's type
evaluation
and here you can see the evaluate model
option we just need to drag it to the
canvas
so
let's
connect it with our score model
now your model for the app both code
data set is complete so this is the
whole
model now you need to save the model and
then click on run option
here I've saved it
and see it's running
you can see the model running and going
through every node
as you can see the green mark
as it's verifying through every node
so once it's done click on evaluate
model
and then click on visualize
now you can see the accuracy is uh
98
yo you can see the accuracy is 98 which
is almost the prediction value now you
can see the positive and negative labels
as well
so this whole data is known as confusion
Matrix
now for the values close to the pos
positive label it gives me the number of
true predictions
that uh the number of data I'll provide
it will it shows that 72 predictions
will be right and one will be wrong
now let's go back and
run this model over the web
so by clicking on a setup web service we
will click on predictive web service
now we will just connect web service
input to the score model
so that once the program is uploaded to
the cloud it is directly connected to
the score model
and gives us the output
so now you need to save this
and run
this will execute the entire model now
all uh we are left with is deploying the
model
now
you just need to click on deploy web
service
so then you will see you will be taken
to a new window
here you can see
the response page where it's showing
test option you need to click on it
so here you can see a new window has
popped up so you just need to mention
the details like for City I am
mentioning Bangalore
for state I'm mentioning Karnataka
and name of the airport is
Camp Pagoda
International
Airport
and I just need to save this data
so now down below you can see it gives
me predictive values
and this is the airport ID
for my mentioned details
so the accuracy of this ID will be 0.98
which is 98 percent
which is almost accurate to the hundred
percent
so this was our experiment and this is
how we can use ml in Azure you can also
check out Azure Cloud architect course
that will help you master the Azure
infrastructure by understanding Azure

our YouTube channel and hit the Bell
icon for most amazing and interesting
content what is azure active directory
now here we're in a situation where we
have two colleagues having a
conversation with each other so one of
them complains that he is finding a hard
time managing multiple user logins at
the same time his friend suggests that
he has a solution that the company start
using as your active directory he says
that with Azure ad they'll be able to
handle multiple user logins without any
issue so just like the question in all
our minds the friend asks how is azure
active directory coming help us so to
help you understand let's think about a
scenario you're an employee working for
an organization and you want to use a
particular service in this case SQL
database so you are assigned a set of
username and password then you want to
use another service a machine learning
service again you're assigned a
different username and password and
likewise for any number of services that
you want to use so for every service
that you're going to choose you need to
be assigned a new username and password
but this becomes a huge issue for the
administrator as they have to handle a
large number of username and passwords
now if you think about a large
organization where there's more than
thousand people working you can
understand how much of a hassle it's
going to be for the administrator at the
same time it's also a really difficult
thing for you to remember that many
numbers of username and passwords it's
difficult on the user as well and that's
where Azure active directory helps now
here's a scenario where we are applying
Azure active directory now you're an
employee you want to use a particular
service and you're assigned a single
username and password and with this
username and password you can access all
the services that you want so there's
only one set of username and passwords
that you need to remember you can use
any of the services that you want as
long as the administrator has given you
access to it so what is azure active
directory now Azure active directory is
a service that falls under the identity
domain it allows multiple users and is a
cloud-based directory and identity
management service now here's an ideal
scenario you're joining an office newly
the admin helps you sign up to whatever
Services you want and you can access
these Services anywhere over the cloud
so now let's talk about something
different Windows ID and Azure ad now
Windows 80 was the previous version of
azure 80. so now we'll talk about why we
needed to change from Windows Active
Directory to Azure active directory so
what is Windows Active Directory now
it's an OS directory service which
allows you to work with multiple systems
multiple Network results sources in a
unified manner now the biggest draw when
it came to Windows ad was that it had
many layers now different layers that
did different bits of work so now let's
talk about each of these layers the
first layer is adds or the windows
active directory domain Services now
each layer as I said before has a
different role to perform adds allows
admin to manage information relating to
user logins and other details like when
they signed up how much they're using
and things like that the next layer is
ADLs or the Azure data Lake storage
services this layer is for allowing you
to store any amounts of data of any type
or size then you have the adfs or the
active directory Federation Services
where you're given a single option for
sign up with which you get access to all
systems and applications then we have
the fourth layer the adcs or the active
directory and certification services
this enables administrators to customize
services and then be able to manage and
issue public certificates and the final
layer is adrms or the active directory
Rights Management Service and this is
used for data protection now here's
where Azure active directory changed the
whole game this means that there's a
large number of layers that
administrators need to take care of now
how about there was a solution for this
and as your ad is that solution as your
active directory integrates all these
five layers into two and these are the
windows Azure active directory or the
waad where it combines all the problems
when it comes to identification
management which is almost all five
layers taken into one and the windows
Azure Access Control service enables the
Federation or the division of all these
Services of an organization and by
division I mean assigning each of these
services to these users so that is taken
care of by the windows as your Access
Control service hence as your active
directory is able to simplify a lot of
the problems that Windows Azure active
directory had for example the
application Office 360 if I use this as
your active directory to manage user
identities here's how now you're an
employee who wants to access one of The
Office 365 Services which could be Excel
PowerPoint Microsoft Word or something
like that so you go talk to the
administrator and he gives you access to
these services with the help of a single
username and password now as long as you
have this username and password and the
administrator has given you access to it
you can use any of these services so
who's the service audience who is using
the active directory service now there
are three types of audience when it
comes to your active directory the first
one is ID administrator the second one
application developers and online
customers so the idea administrators
their main emphasis is to ensure that
the sign in takes place they take care
of all the sign-in procedures they also
solve issues when it comes to
authentication for example to
authenticate a particular user the
problem is solved by the it
administrators then you have application
develop papers who use these services to
develop applications and with this they
have an easier time developing
applications as all these resources are
easily available you have online
customers who make use of services like
Office 365 and other CRM services and
have all their demands catered
immediately so now let's have a look at
how we can use Azure active directory to
provide access to a particular
individual so if you log into the Azure
account this is what you see or you go
into active directory a list of all the
people who are using or have been given
permission to use resources from Azure
okay now we're going to create a profile
we need to set up his name which is John
and second name Jacob
now for properties we need to determine
the source of authority which is already
the active directory so that's fine we
can select a group or add them to a
particular group if we feel like it now
if we add them to a particular group it
means that they have access to all the
resources that everyone in the group has
access to earlier so we'll do that later
we'll select their directory role or we
can select it here if you need to it
could be user administrator or a limited
administrator and now we'll set up a
password so you already got one and
we'll create
and that's it we have created a user now
we'll go to their profile
so what we can see here is that you have
access to every bit of detail related to
this account so you have the name your
first name the username the object ID
job info everything you can even have
other details like how often they've
signed in when did they sign up you can
check their password you can reset the
password delete their account and so
much more
now we can even add a directory role
which we saw earlier and now let's add
this person to the admin group so you
know he gets access to all the services
those people have access to and select
that's it we've added them now the other
things that you can see here there are
applications licenses devices these are
all restrictions you can add or remove
like which device you can use the system
through or with and stuff like that so
that's it and with that we've created a
user and given a Maxis to certain
Services now why should you be
interested in data Factory now let's
consider a scenario so here we have two
colleagues having a conversation with
each other and they say that the data
that they're generating from their
applications or products is increasing
exponentially now considering that this
data is coming from a number of
different products it'll be a bit of a
task to analyze and store all of this
data so he wonders how they're going to
manage that his friend suggests that
they use azure's data Factory now what
does azure's data Factory actually do
first it stores data with the help of
the data League store storage now any
kind of data can be stored in the data
Lake storage then you can analyze the
data you can transform the data with the
help of pipelines and you can publish
the organized data you can visualize the
data with third-party applications like
Apache spark or Hadoop as well now what
exactly is data Factory so now let's
have a look at what exactly is data
Factory now data Factory falls under the
identity domain of services in the Azure
catalog and is a cloud-based integration
service basically what it does is it
works on your data it stores your data
it orchestrates and automates the
movement or transformation of data it
works heavily on the data that you store
now let's see how it actually works or
how the flow of its processes are
firstly we have the input data set which
is nothing but the data that you have
within your data store the one that you
need processed then you pass this data
through a pipeline now what does a
pipeline do a pipeline basically
performs an operation on the data that
transforms it which could be anything
from just data movement or some data
transformation now data transformation
is possible with the help of usql some
stored procedures or high now after this
is done you get an output data set now
this output data set will contain data
that is in a structured form because
it's already been transformed and made
structured in the pipeline stage then it
is given into Link services like Azure
data Lake block storage or SQL now what
it does is restore information that is
very important when it comes to
connecting to an external Source now
this is you know if you wanted an
example you know how in an SQL Server
you need to mention the source and
destination of your data now for example
consider an SQL Server so you need a
connection string so that you can
connect to an external device you need
to mention the stores and the
destination of your data this is how the
Link services work and finally you need
a Gateway now a Gateway basically
connects your on-premises data to the
cloud so you do need a client install on
your on-premises system so that you can
connect to the Azure cloud and finally
you have the cloud here what happens is
your data can be analyzed or visualized
with a number of different analytical
softwares like Apache spark R Hadoop and
so on so all this time I've been
mentioning that data lake is a very
important part when it comes to Azure
data Factory's proper functioning so now
let's talk about what exactly is data
Lake now data lake is a data storage or
a file system which is highly scalable
and distributed it is located in the
cloud and works with multiple analytics
Frameworks which is external Frameworks
like Hadoop Apache and so on so now
let's have a look at it so first you
have your output data set which is data
from the mobile video web social media
so much more it is sent into the Azure
data Lake store and then it is provided
two external Frameworks like R Apache
and Spark so that they can be worked on
now there are two main Concepts when it
comes to data Lake store storage so one
of them is storage and the other one is
analytics now storage is of unlimited
size it can be petabytes terabytes
gigabytes and so much more it shows a
wide variety of data it could be
unstructured or structured data and it
can store really large files and another
concept when it comes to data lake is
analytics now how it works now here are
two examples of how analytics works when
it comes to data Lake now when it comes
to analytics you can monitor and
diagnose real-time data for example data
that you're getting from vehicles or
buildings these can be used to optimize
how they work respond to certain events
or generate alerts in case something
goes wrong then you can also identify
fraudulent transactions on your credit
card or you can identify the current the
geographical position of your card
perhaps monitor how many transactions
have been taking place on that card and
so on so now we're going to have a look
at how we can use the Azure data Factory
to move data from an SQL data database
to a blob storage on the cloud so here's
what we're going to do so first off to
make a database what you're going to
need a software known as ssms so you can
find it on Google it's called you just
need to Google it ssms the first thing
you can take here and there you have it
so you just need to click here and
download the file so we I've already
downloaded the file so basically this is
used to create a database which we will
be transferring to The Blob storage so
this will take about depending on your
computer speed pretty long or little to
no time I've already downloaded it the
process is very simple just directly go
on saying yes yes and finally once
installation is done here's what we're
going to do we should go into the
dashboard of Microsoft Azure we need to
create a data warehouse so we'll go into
all sources Creator Source go to
database
and select SQL data warehouse there we
have it now it's very important that you
remember the names of the service of
everything that you're going to write
here because each of these become very
important later on so I've already set
up a possible set of names
YouTube
it's free trial the source is already
created
a blank database the server we need to
create a new one so we can reheat
we'll name it as YouTube server
YouTube
admin as the server admin login
the password as
all right the location does not matter
okay that's done now here the server is
done and here we need to change how much
you want the lowest I mean how much
computation you want how much did
workload how important your workload is
so we'll put it at the lowest since we
don't require much we'll apply the rest
is normal and create
so now we're creating an SQL data
warehouse so we will wait so now the
deployment is done so we'll go to the
notification and go to the resource here
now this is done so we'll go to the ssms
which I've already opened here and then
go here
and copy this paste it here SQL
authentication login which details we
have already stored here which is admin
YouTube admin and the password which is
also given there
right go to options we go to the
database name which is YouTube
everything else is there you need to
change it to TCP
and connect
you sign in
we'll add the password
again we're going to sign in now
all right
so now that that's completed you can see
that this is what will pop up so this is
the name of the server we've given as
you saw earlier we've got a databases
and here you have the YouTube database
that we just created right click this
and add a new query
I already have a code for this program
it's a very simple program so
copying and pasting this
now if you need the code for this
program let us know in the comments
below it's very simple what we're doing
is creating a table called demo tab with
first name Clark Kent last name is Bruce
Wayne and the table that's created will
have these two rows so now we're going
to execute this there you have it two
rows have been affected so now let's
have a look at our table
um
let's secure this line and there you go
the tables here so now that this is done
we're going back into azure
back and we need to create a storage
account so that's where the storage
where the blob storage is going to
happen so we're going to storage
accounts and click on ADD so here it's a
free trial Resource Group is YouTube
storage account name is
that's all okay us performance is
standard general purpose you can do
locally since we don't need to be very
reliable at least for this one Advanced
just fine view and create
that's done and we create now we'll wait
for the deployment to finish
and that's it the deployment is done so
we'll go to the resource
and go to blobs so this is where the
storage is happening we need to create a
blob
simply
blob
does not exist and okay
it has been created
now for the next bit we need to create
the data Factory now so we go to all
services and search for data Factory
we press add
so here we'll
free trial use existing which we have
YouTube ecos and create so now we've
created a new data Factory
now we'll wait while it's been deployed
so now it's created so we'll go here and
here we click on copy data and this
opens up
we'll name it
description and once now
once now okay
right so we press next so we need to
connect to a data source so so what you
need to do is select a secure Azure SQL
data warehouse so one second to the
previous here we select Azure SQL data
warehouse go here
search for
source
media subscription free trial hey
YouTube server and the databases YouTube
you also need to provide your username
and password I've saved it here
YouTube admin
[Music]
right
okay now we can select the table which
is demo tab next
and now for our destination so where are
we going to connect this to we are going
to Azure blob storage next
destination
subscription free trial hence the Play
Store
now we need to name our
name our storage path next although this
can be
passed on
so here's what we're doing it copying
whatever is inside this to the Azure
blob storage that's what's happening
right now
all of that is set
and
next
it's validating and we'll wait now
it's registering connections creating
database and in the end it's creating a
pipeline
so you can monitor the pipeline from
here if you feel like it
here's what we're going to find so
here's the here's the visual
representation of what's Happening
it's being copied into the blob storage
now let's have a look if it's actually
worked out you go to our database we'll
go into
storage accounts simply store
go to blobs
we've created a new one
and there you have it So based on the
container that you've named there it's
created a new one here so actually I
earlier created the name called simply
blob but as you can see here as long as
you name a container it will create a
folder inside which you will find your
particular thing that you copied and
that's it you've copied data similarly
you can do a number of multiple
operations on this container on the on
the pipeline which is created with the
data Factory you can also check out the

let's now move on to Azure watching
machine before that let's consider a
scenario
Rachel had to host 10 virtual machines
at once per project there was an issue
when her computer RAM was not compatible
with the instances the computer RAM was
only 8 GB and the instances that
required were 10 GB then she says I wish
there is a service that's cost effective
and also provides extra RAM memory one
of a colleague heard this and he comes
up with an idea he says can we use Azure
virtual machine it has a pay as you go
pricing and has this for storage
you can pay for what you use and create
any number of instances with high
storage capacity also if any technical
difficulty arises you can easily
retrieve the files through the backup
server so now she's happy and she wants
to know more about Azure washing machine
Azure watching machine is one of the
wide range of services that Azure offers
to create your instance a virtual
machine is a computer file typically
called an image which behaves like an
actual computer it runs in a window
giving the user the same experience on a
virtual machine as they have on the host
operating system itself multiple virtual
machines can run simultaneously on the
same physical computer each virtual
machine provides its own Hardware like
CPUs memories and other devices as your
virtual machine offers a high range of
flexibility and it maintains the
physical Hardware that runs on it let me
explain some of the benefits of azure
watching machine first we have easy
development and test as your virtual
machine has a quick and easy way to
configure the computer that is required
to code and test an application next
agility and scale Azure virtual machine
is agile and the ability to clone and
spin up multiple instances of the same
virtual machine allows us to scale
services and applications rapidly
efficiently and very cost effectively as
your virtual machine provides enhanced
performance demands for applications can
fluctuate so you pay for the virtual
machines you need and shut down the
unnecessary ones to save the cost
as your virtual machines provide
extended Data Center and can be easily
connected to an organization's Network
it is easy to set up your redundant
infrastructure in Azure and Azure
provides a full Disaster Recovery site
at a fraction of the cost furthermore
let me explain Azure virtual machine
components in details virtual machine
comes under the compute domain of azure
it also offers various services like
availability sets snapshots disks images
and many other services like hosts
virtual machine can be clubbed with
other services like disk images
availability sets hosts and many more so
the first component and the most
important component is the operating
system the operating system creates
connections to the remote desktop
session host there are many operating
systems available like Ubuntu Red Hat
Linux Windows Server sent OS you can
also set the operating disk size so that
the memory is not wasted the next
component is disks as your original
machine use attached virtual hard disks
for storage take two types of virtual
hard disks first is an image it is a
template for creation of new Azure
virtual machine then we have disks it is
a bootable virtual hard disk all durable
disks are backed up by Page blobs in
Azure storage therefore the disks
inherit the benefits of blob storage
High availability durability and many
more this amounted as drives on the VM
the next component is virtual Network
many components operate the virtual
machines in a scalable and secure manner
virtual networks could include equipment
such as separate Network spaces for
internet facing and back-end servers
load balancers firewalls and more many
of these components are deployed into an
Azure virtual Network as your virtual
Network provides many features such as
subnet IP address load balancer and
Network Security Group
another important component of azure
virtual machine is availability sets if
in case there's a slight chance there
could be a failure in physical servers
then these come into picture so in case
of such failure the Azure platform will
migrate the failed virtual machine to a
healthy host to reconstitute the VM it
is highly recommended to deploy at least
two instances of the virtual machine and
virtual machines placed on an
availability set perform identical set
of functionalities
now that we know what Azure virtual
machine is let's look into the demo in
this Demo First we are going to create a
virtual machine connect it and then
create a web server and modify the web
server and finally launch the web
application so let's go ahead into the
demo now so the first step is to log
into Microsoft Azure with your
credentials now let's click on Virtual
machines and create a new one
so I can put add
and you can use the subscription you
want either pay as you go pricing or
free tile
Resource Group will create a new one
that is free role
one
okay virtual machine we can create I'm
going to use VM web
001
and then region I'll be using Okay East
US
then image I'll be using Windows Server
R2 Data Center
size I'll be using B1 MS
select
username and admin
and then password of your choice
and then I'm going to allow selected
ports and choose rdb3389
and next
so always this step I'll be using
standard HD
and then yeah next
so I can see a default virtual Network
and a default submit in public IP as
well as default
and then next
you can allow for auto shutdown but
again it's entirely your choice
I'm going to select an extension to
install and I'm going to install
Microsoft anti-malware
create okay
I'm going to create a few tags now let's
go ahead with it
so I've created Five tags now review
plus create
okay so everything seems good let's
create now
so the deployment is going to take a few
minutes let's wait for it
okay so that's done now let's go to
Virtual Machine and see our virtual
machine
okay so it's been deployed
now let's get into the virtual machine
and copy the IP address
then hit Windows plus r
and open mstsc
and
paste the IP address and connect
let's use a different
filter.com you have to use the
administrator account that we created
before with the same password
click ok
now the remote desktop session host
opens
the next step is to click on server
manager
and add rows and features
click on next
select rule base or feature-based
installation and click on next
then select the virtual machine you've
created and next
and then we are going to select
web server IIs next
sorry
okay so it's already installed my
computer but you have to install this
then let's close this
and open Internet Explorer
let's type in
http
localhost
yeah so now we can see the default was
opening let's minimize this
and let's try it here
we have just put the IP address
I think there's an issue
okay so let's add an inbound Port
networking select networking and add in
one port
let's move 480.
and add
okay so it's added now let's go into
fresh it
now we can see the default web brows
opening so the next step is to modify
the web browser let's go ahead with that
go back to your remote session host
let's go file explorer
so certain folders are created from the
C drive let's open that
it would be under kind of Pub
because this is where the default is
coming from now let's make a new text
document
open that and put
hello
welcome
to this demo
by simply learn
save it
close it let's rename this as
index
dot HD sorry
mem
so this is a text document
so we need to change that
okay let's remove this
okay
let's start
now let's go back to our Internet
Explorer and hit F5
let's refresh this
let's try and okay so let's
yeah so it's done now let's go back to
the previous browser and try let's
refresh
yeah that's done first of all let's look
into why is azure virtual Network
important
so why Azure virtual network is required
so somewhere far away at an office a
company was struggling with few
challenges
the company got a bigger project which
lead to the following challenges that
includes poor network connectivity time
consuming process and building Network
topologies could not divert Network
traffic to its destination on time so
these were a couple of challenges the
company was facing so the employees
thought that what could be the possible
solution to these challenges
and then we require the Azure virtual
Network in that case so first of all
let's understand what is azure virtual
network is
and Azure v-net or a virtual Network
represents your network or environment
to run VMS and applications in the cloud
when it is created the services and
virtual machines within the network
interact securely with each over the
Internet so virtual Network you can
consider it as a virtual Cloud which is
basically kind of a cloud space
virtually assigned to the users or or to
the organization which they can
dedicatedly use for their purpose so for
example if you have to create some
instances or virtual machines onto the
Azure cloud
and you want to connect it with the
on-prem servers for example then you
might require the virtual Network in
that case let's assume that those
instances that are created in the
virtual Network require the range of IP
addresses that you want to allocate to
them and that is something you can
customize using the Azure virtual
Network
how do you want that the traffic should
be routed to your instances in the
virtual Network how the firewall
Securities should be applied everything
the end user can control in the virtual
Network so it seems like that you are
working in your own data center ideally
you would be working on to the Azure
Cloud using the virtual Network
now what are the advantages of using the
Azure virtual Network so couple of them
are it provides an isolated environment
for your application so as I said that
it feels like it seems like that you are
working in your on-prem environment that
means within your data center but
ideally it is a virtual space that is
allocated to you which is a kind of an
isolated environment and that is
specifically designed for your tasks and
the activities
are generally a subnet in a v-net can
access the public internet by default so
we create a subnet inside the virtual
Network which can access the public
internet so there is a public network
connectivity that is enabled in the
virtual net so that a subnet which will
be created in the v-net can be accessed
traffic can be easily filtered from
different resources so you can have some
control lists defined you can have some
security groups created and how do you
want to allow the traffic onto the
servers or the application that is
something which you can control it is a
highly secure network and the security
groups and the policies are basically
implemented by the end user so you can
design how the security should be
implemented High network connectivity so
you have a higher bandwidth as compared
to the normal internet connection you
might be having in the data center
compared to that you use the Azure
Network only which gives you the higher
network connectivity it builds
sophisticated Network topologies in a
simple Manner and which is easily
manageable as well as there are less
troubleshooting issues that we would
encounter
now what are the components of azure
virtual Network
one of them is the subnets
then you have routing
then you have network security groups
now what do we mean by subnets
the subnet is one of the major or a
prime important component in the virtual
Network so what you have to do is first
you obviously you would be creating a
virtual Network
inside that you can create the subnets
subnets you can consider it a logical
partitioning or virtual partitioning
inside the
virtual Network
subnet let's user segment the virtual
Network into one or more sub networks
for example let's assume that you're
working in an organization and in the
organization there are different
departments for every Department there
should be some set of IP addresses that
you want to allocate to the machines
that the employees are using or all the
department should be isolated that means
that they should have their own network
IDs and the network addresses are
located to their machines and in that
case what you would do is you would
create the subnets and the subnet IDs
that would be allocated to those
departments these sub networks can be
separated logically and each subnet
consists of a server so what you do is
when you create a subnet you can you can
create a server or an instance inside
that subnet and how do you want to give
an access to that instance depends on
criteria or the requirement
hence a subnet can further be divided
into two parts one as the public subnet
and the other one as the private subnet
these are the naming conventions of the
subnet then how do you want to give the
internet connectivity depends on how the
public subnet should be interacting with
the internet and for the private subnet
as the name suggests that the internet
is blocked so that means it is
completely isolated in the virtual
Network
the private instances though if you want
that any instance created in the private
subnet should have the internet
connectivity or an access you can
primarily go with the NAT gateways in
that case which is a network address
translation or kind of a translator
which converts the private to public and
vice versa
and that would actually enable the
internet connectivity to your subnets
then in the public instances they can
directly access the instance as the name
suggests public instances that public
subnets that means they have the direct
internet connectivity next component is
routing and the routing is primarily a
routing rules you can say that are
applied and those are actually applied
to the routers only so since on the
cloud we cannot have a direct router
access and hence using the routing as a
component we can Define some routing
rules which are directly applied to the
router in the infrastructure
it delivers the data by choosing a
suitable path from source to destination
for each subnet Azure virtual Network
automatically routes traffic and creates
a route table when you create a virtual
Network automatically a route table is
created and that basically is required
to Route the traffic and that can be
used by every subnet that doesn't mean
that you only have to create a single
route table in the virtual Network you
can have multiple route tables also
created which can be associated with
different subnets as well then you have
the network security groups it is kind
of a firewall that protects the virtual
machine by limiting the network traffic
it restricts inbound and outbound
Network traffic depending upon the
destination IP address port
and the protocol so it is basically
the network security group sits on the
instances and uh or virtual machines and
they basically Define that how the
traffic should be reaching to the ports
onto the virtual machine so how do you
want to open up the ports and for which
IP addresses you want to open up the
ports that is something the end user or
the administrator has to specify our
design so they act as a kind of a
firewall rules only that protects the
virtual machines
so how to launch an instance using azure
v-net so first of all you have to create
a virtual Network so virtual Network act
as a container for subnets so first
thing is that you would be creating a
virtual Network then you would be
creating subnets which are considered as
a subset within the virtual Network
so Cloud instance is included in the
subnet so first v-nets are created then
the subnets are created and then you
configure the properties in the security
group
have a look at this in detail
now with respect to the virtual Network
what you need to do is you have to
create a virtual Network in the Azure
cloud
then you have to create subnets into
each virtual Network which is kind of a
subset of a virtual Network so you can
create one as a public subnet the other
one has a private subnet for example
now you have to assign instances so when
you create an instance you have to
specify that what is the virtual Network
for which virtual Network you're
creating an instance within that virtual
Network you have to select that on which
particular subnet the instance should be
created and then connect instance to a
relevant network security group so
attach your network security group to
the instances and based on the
properties or the rules that are defined
in the network security group that will
be applied to the instances within the
subnets finally configure the properties
in the network security and set the
policies as a result you will be able to
launch your instance on Azure within the
virtual Network
now we will be seeing one demo that how
we can create Azure virtual Network
subnets and new network security group
so just be there to watch our demo on
the Azure virtual Network in today's
session I would be showing how you can
create the virtual networks onto the
azure
and for that you require the credentials
on Microsoft Azure and here you can see
on my screen that I have already logged
in into the Azure console
now what you need to do is in order to
search virtual Network you can type and
search in the dashboard in the search
bar with respect to the virtual Networks
and here you can find
the virtual Network and the gateways so
what you need to do is you just have to
click on the virtual networks and then
it will give you the options to add the
components inside the virtual Networks
so let me first open up the virtual
Network
right now in theory we discussed that
the virtual network comprises of
multiple components and sub-components
so primarily is that first you have to
create a virtual Network then you have
to assign the ipv for cidr Block to the
virtual Network
and then you create the subnets inside
the network which is a subset of the
virtual Network along with that you
define the routing rules and likewise
you create the instances inside the
subnets that will be part of the virtual
Networks
so that's what we are going to do uh in
this demo so I would be adding up a new
virtual Network so you can see here
there are already two virtual networks
that have been added one is the demo
v-net which is by default so when you
created the Azure credentials the demo
virtual network was already created by
the Azure so that it can provide you the
default settings and then the test one
has been created by me and that's the
customized one or you can say a
non-default virtual Network
so I'll I'm going to add another v-net
and
would Define
the name to it so let's wait for
the details to appear so here you have
to define the virtual Network to create
obviously we will be going with the free
trial only and then you have to create a
resource Group so what is a resource
Group it is primarily a collection of
resources that share the same lifecycle
permissions and the policies so if you
have a resource Group created you can
use it otherwise you can create a new
Resource Group so I already have one
that is the demo one I would be using
that in the instance details you have to
specif the name of the virtual Network
so these are certain
uh parameters that you have to go with
while defining the name so let's say I
put something like test v-net
as the virtual Network that I want to
create and that is you have to select a
region where you want to get that
created so these are the available
regions that you can select I would go
with us East
us only and then we have to define the
IP addresses also
see so in the IP addresses uh these IDR
blocks are allocated to the virtual
networks and that becomes a fixed IP
address for that v-net so what you can
do is you can specify a range of IP
addresses now whenever we talk about a
virtual Network and the IP addresses we
primarily focus on the private IPS only
so this is the private IP that we are
actually talking about so I can reserve
some
IP address cidr for our v-net and that
is the range of 40.0.0.0 16. I'm going
to resume so now we'll create one subnet
and we'll name that subnet so as we
discussed that subnets are the sub
components of the v-net so here you can
see we have already created one
subnet with the name public subnet so
likewise we can add another subnet also
and let's name it to something like demo
subnet right and the subnet should have
the IP address range and that IP address
range should be part of the winner in
vtn so same subnet address range you
would be defining in the subnet as well
so that will be 40.0.1 dot or we can
select 2.0
24.
the rest of the things would be default
we are not attaching any route table as
of now so just click on OK and here you
can see that the subnet is created
now once the subnet is created now we
are going to create a virtual machine
inside that subnet and for that we'll go
to the search bar and here we'll type
virtual machines
now we'll create a virtual machine in
the same v-net that is the test v-net
and inside the demo subnet so that our
virtual machine gets the private IP
address from the subnet that has been
created in the v-net itself so what you
need to do is you have to open up the
virtual machines click on ADD
and here you should add a new virtual
machine
so you should select the name of the
virtual machine and the network details
where we would be defining the v-net as
well as the subnet where the virtual
machine should be created
so in the subscription we'll go with the
free trial and in the resource Group we
will go with the demo that has already
been created we'll put a virtual machine
name uh something like test VM
and the rest of the things will be
default
so we'll quickly skip the disk check
also now in the networking we would be
selecting
the test we net as our virtual Network
and in the subnet we would be selecting
the demo subnet so that is the recently
one added in the test we net and we want
that our virtual machine should be part
of that subnet only
now obviously since we are creating a
virtual machine so it should be part of
it should have the public IP also
assigned since from the public network
we need to access those virtual machines
so we'll keep it enabled right and the
next uh would be the default settings
that we are going to proceed with
so let's review all the configurations
and then
create your virtual machine
so here you can see that our virtual
machine has been created validation has
been passed and it takes couple of
minutes to get that updated so let's
wait for a few more minutes so that our
virtual machine is ready and primarily
what we want to look into is that our
virtual machine is created in a correct
v-net and it gets the private IP address
from the subnet that has been part of
the
v-net which has been defined in the
creation of a virtual machine so let's
wait for a couple of more minutes and
we'll look into the status of the main
now you can see here our test virtual
machine has been created now what we
wanted to look into is that our virtual
machine is created in a correct subnet
or not and that is something which we
can validate by checking the private IP
address so it got the private IP from
the range of the IP address that we have
specified in the subnet now in order to
access this particular virtual machine
you have to use the public IP since uh
since we have to access it from the
internet so from the private IP the
social machine will not be accessible
so that's the reason that when we
created a virtual machine we allocated
the public IP address also for this
instance
so that is with respect to
the virtual Network and the
demonstration on it and how we can
create a v-net and the sub components of
the v-net how they are associated or
interlinked with each other and that
actually creates a kind of an isolated
environment on the public Cloud which
gives you the understanding that you can
work into
just like in on-prem environment you can
also check out Azure Cloud architect

so what is azure devops Azure devops
enables teams to organize work
collaborate on code development and
build and deploy applications using
developer Services Azure develops the
culture and set of protocols that brings
together developers project managers and
contributors to collaborate on software
development it enables businesses to
create and enhance products more quickly
than they could with traditional
software development methods you can use
Azure devops services in the cloud or
Azure devops server on premises
Azure devops has built-in functionality
that you may access via a web browser or
an ID client depending on your business
needs you can use one or more of the
following standard owned services
Azure repos Azure develops a built-in
functionality so for sourced management
of your code Azure reports offer git
repositories or team Foundation Version
Control
Azure pipelines build and release
services provided by Azure pipelines to
assess continuous integration and
delivery of your applications
Azure both using carbon and scrum
methodologies Azure both provides a set
of agile tools for planning and tracking
for code bugs and issues
as your test plans manual and
exploratory testing and continuous
testing are among the options available
in Azure test plans for testing your
applications
and at last Azure artifacts this allows
teams to share packages from public and
private sources including Marvin npm
nuget and more and corporate packet
sharing into their pipelines so this
brings us to the features of devop
first we have is dashboard control you
can rapidly navigate to different
regions of the project build and manage
dashboards and set dashboard widgets
using the devops dashboard functionality
then we have improved Source control git
and team Foundation Version Control a
centralized client server system which
are two prominent methods of source
control supported by Azure devops
solution to observe change history you
can add and manage Azure git tags
reviews downloads and modify files
following that we have plan and track
your work you can utilize Azure devops
systems to track teachers requirements
user stories tasks issues and more using
a variety of work items then we have
integrated collaboration servers Zoom
that allows teams to collaborate
throughout the whole Azure devops
feature set including team dashboards
project Wiki discussion within work item
forms and many others then we have
support for exploratory testing manual
exploratory and continuous testing are
made easier with Azure devops which
include workflow customization
end-to-end traceability criteria based
selection and real-time visualization
that show the test activities and at
last comes continuous integration and
deployment many developers use CI CD and
Azure devops makes it so easy to do so
developers May automate various design
activities with Azure pipelines
including defining and Building
Association steps writing test
instructions and managing simultaneous
releases well this brings us to Azure
devops services
you get an integrated set of services
and tools with Azure devops to manage
your software project from planning to
development to testing and deployment a
client or server model is used to
deliver these Services many of them are
offered via a user-friendly web
interface that works with all media
browsers The Source control Bill
pipelines and work tracking are just a
few of the services that may be managed
to a client you can see the left pane is
where to access Azure devops Services as
demonstrated in the figure below so now
that we have covered Azure devop
services
let's move on to Azure devops server
Version Control reporting requirements
management project management automated
bills testing and release management are
all capabilities of azure devops server
a Microsoft product it provides devops
features and spans the complete
application cycle so now that we know
what Azure devops services and Azure
develop server are so let's have a crisp
comparison between them to know how
exactly they differ from each other
despite the fact that Azure devops
service is a hosted version of azure
devops server there are several features
that differ some functions of azure
develop server aren't available in Azure
devops services
so when deciding which platform to use
or considering a transition from
on-premises to the cloud keep the
following points in mind cope and scale
data authentication users and groups and
manage use access so first is scope and
scale data Azure devops services and
Azure devops server is slightly
different
organizations and projects are currently
the only alternatives for scoping and
scaling data Azure devops Services
organization get their own URLs and
always have exactly one project
collection whereas deployment project
collection and projects are the three
methods of scoping and scaling data in
Azure devops server then we have
authentication to connect to Azure
devops services using the public
internet depending on your
organization's Arrangement you can use
Microsoft account credentials or Azure
ad credentials to login you can also
configure Azure ad to require
multi-factor authentication IP address
restriction and other security features
but you connect to an intranet serving
using Azure devops server Windows
authentication and active directory
doming credentials are used to login so
this method is completely open and you
will never be asked to sign it next we
have users and group you may use a
similar technique to Grant access to
groups of users on Azure devops Services
Azure ad groups can be added to Azure
devops Services Group so you must add
users one at a time if you utilize
Microsoft account instead of azure 80.
on the other hand by adding active
directory groups to multiple Azure
devops groups you make chance user
access to deployments in Azure devops
server the membership of AD groups are
kept in sync so users gain and lose
access to Azure devops server as they
are added and withdrawn in Erie and at
last there is manage user access to
manage access to features in Azure
devops and Azure devops server by
signing users to an access level each
user in your Azure devops Services
organization must be assigned an access
level as usual as Visual Studio
subscriber sign-in Azure devops Services
verifies them so without a visual studio
subscription you can give basic access
to five users of coffee whereas all use
of azure devops server is on the honor
System specify the access levels on the
administrative Administration page to
set access level per user based on their
license and assign unlicensed user
stakeholder access only so now that we
have covered all the important features
and concepts of azure devops now let's
move on to the next very important
aspect of azure devops which is azure
devops lab
the Azure devop lab is a place where you
can learn about software developments
and operations with Azure devops
Services you can simplify and speed up
the devops process it explains how to
use Azure devopservices to automate
software delivery and satisfy business
requirements so to understand it in a
better way let's have a demo of azure
devops lab so let's start with our Azure
devops demo so first what we need to do
is navigate to this
website Azure dot microsoft.in or we can
directly login through
dev.assure.com also the first webinar
you need to do is sign into a Microsoft
Azure account
so after
signing in
you will add to this page in that
you just need to click on continue
and here what you need to do is create
an organization under which you're gonna
create your projects multiple projects
and you're gonna attach your team
members to it or group members to it and
we want to get the access to your
projects
so what is the difference between
organization and project is if you have
given anybody access to your
organization or somebody is a part of
your organization then
then that particular individual will
have access to all of your projects but
if you have given somebody only access
to a project then you'll be only
restricted to that particular project
you won't be able to access any other
project that is present under that
particular organization that you both
are part of so basically organization is
something that is used to connect to
groups of or related project or somebody
who's already a part of a particular
organization so here we will give it a
name so I am giving uh simply
demo as the organization name and here
you can see that the projects under this
organization will be hosted under the
South India region
and we need to enter the captcha
and click on continue
in just a second
so now you can see this saying that it
is taking you to an organization
okay so we already have an organization
of the same name so let's just change it
to something else
let's give it simply demo
org
so here you can see that I see this
thing that it's taking to your Azure
devops organization where you'll be
creating your projects
so now you can see your organization
name
here
and well you just need to create the
project name
I'm giving it
simply
Gemma
project
not below you can see the visibility we
can opt either public or private so what
is public or private so basically if uh
you keep its keep the project off keep
the visibility of the project public
then once
you copy this
URL
so as I was sitting once you copy this
URL into some other browser or incognito
mode you will be able to have the access
to the project
but if you keep its visibility private
then only the people who have real
access to your organization or to your
project will be able to access that
project or will be able to see that
project or work on it
as you can see public products are
disabled for our organization so we
can't
select public so we'll go for private
and click on create project
now here or you can see
the home page of your organization where
you have
this project
and here you can access the statistics
of project how it is performing how much
time they have contributed to it for
what all services you have added to your
project
and down below you'll be able to see
that there is just one member which is
the root user of this project and once
you start adding more members to your
project it will their details will be
added to this particular
block
so now here you can see these other
services boards reports pipelines Tesla
and artifacts services that is provided
to you to add to your project
so now let's have a look
at them one by one
so first one is votes
as we click on boards you can see
multiple options your work items both
backlogs Sprints queries delivery plans
here you can see it is all empty as we
haven't added any service or we haven't
worked on a project yet
let's just click on
new work item
so here you can see one is epic issue
and task
so epic is an option that is uh you can
see a pro auction
for work items
so basically epic represents business
initiative to be accomplished and it is
basically available for basic agile
scrum and the cmmi process templates
so what it exactly does it increases
customer engagement that whoever
whatever your project is if it's
uh the engagement
of your project that how it's performing
and how it is performing towards the
people
whom you have given access to the
project also helps to create new
architecture to improve the performance
of your project
and it also support mobile application
so basically when you're deploying any
mobile application in your project or
creating a mobile application as a
project so it will be able to
support that as well
let's click on it
so here you can see you need to enter a
title for your
epic option
so where you need to add the title of
your epic like for say
we are creating a healthcare or an
e-commerce application so obviously it
will be segmented into different parts
like you'll be having search options or
Support options or home page so we just
need to give it a name
and where you can see its state is to do
for now we just have to do because we
haven't
actually created anything in our project
and we haven't given any input
so it's a to-do list and once we start
working on it it gets we can change the
state it it can be in progress or
completing so there are multiple States
for your Epic
and here you can see the area is simply
demo project that means that we want to
assign this
search you know Epic into this project
and we can also click description over
here that what exactly our new epic is
about like for search options we need to
specify or give a description that
this is for searching options related to
our application like for healthcare one
can type
medicines or
doctors
or slots
so
that is that that is thing that we can
add in our description
that it will help the user to understand
what this feature is about
so this was epic and once done we can
click on Save
so here you can see other
starts also like priority
so we can select priority according to
our
will so here by default it is probably
two
so priority basically is which function
will come first
and here you can mention start date
Target date
so once it's done you can click on Save
now let's move
to the next one
second what we have is issue
so basically issues are the for you to
track short work
and the epics are used to track the
group work under large scenarios but
this is that like like we saw the
project statistics so it will help you
to understand the individual progress
so basically issues are raised when you
find any obstacle in your
progress or in your work so it can be
compared to impediments also so when
you're working with agile uh
you need to deal with issues so by
default we have agile
to our project assign
so like for example we can see that uh
we have a meeting so during the meeting
members report if they have encountered
any bug or any any impediments
so what next we have to do is we have to
track them and resolve it so these are
the issues that can uh one can find
like possibilities
so you can assign here
and give it a description again
and just save it so
once a user faces these issues
we can keep a track of it
and
once it is raised we can resolve it
coming to the
next one
next we have is task
so by the name only we can uh well
understand what task is
so a task is a smaller item or
smaller segment to track activity
that contains all the information needed
to accomplish a part of a of an issue or
you can say user story requirements so
this option is available for basic agile
scrum and cmmi process templates
so again we can give it a name what task
we want to assign
and give it a description
and according to that we can
select the priority
and save it
so the task will be added to your
project
we are not for assigning any tasks right
now because as I said we haven't added
any uh particular
project or particular details or
application or we haven't deployed any
application yet in a project
so
that is why we are not adding anything
over here again because first we need to
understand what these services are and
what these services are used for
next we have backlogs so backlogs helps
you
to understand the flow of your problem
like today you have contributed 10
percent
of your time and you have completed the
10 of the work or you have worked on
certain segments of the project like for
say you have worked in the support area
so
it helps you to
understand and keep the track of the
flow of your project how it is
performing and how it is developing and
how it is built every day
foreign
so Sprints are basically a time box
interval that supports it teams ability
to work using the agile processes and
tools so what we can do is whether
you're having let's say you're having a
healthcare application so you just need
to
have a segment of it and drop it over
here
so what would what it will do is uh it
will get the attention of all the team
members so basically what it does it it
makes your project more manageable
it increases the quality of your project
and also makes it work even more faster
and more frequently once you add the
segment to the spin so you can see it in
one week that's the priority and people
need to work on it and it gives the
project more flexibility to adapt to
change
now now sometimes what happens is many
Associates Trump Sprints with agile
software development
so sometimes
agile often thought to be the same thing
coming to the next one we have queries
so the query page basically remembers
the view you have
last navigated and when you log in again
or when you come back again
the same portal it returns you to that
very particular view only
so it can you can say that it runs with
Azure devops command line interface
and all the open like all the pages like
you have gone through you can keep
attack of it over here
you just need to click over here all and
you can just see all the queries you
have
uh Define all this while and also you
can share the queries with the team
members
so they can also know that where you
have been working lately
or which segment you have been working
on or what was the last navigation
which you have been going through in
this whole project
so it can help you manage your project
in a more efficient way
and keep a track of how and what all
segments you have been working on and
what else segments you need to work on
in your project
coming to the next one we have delivery
plans
so here you can see uh we haven't
created any plan yet so basically
delivery plans are a talented view of
multiple teams or theme backlogs or
individual backlogs from different
projects
so basically it replaces the delivery
plans Marketplace extension
and it is only available for Azure
devops services
so here you can hack you can or you can
say it's a summary or a Time summary of
all the projects you have been working
on in a particular organization
so now that we have covered both uh
let's
move to the next one which is repose
so with the name itself we can well
understand that repo stands for
repositories so basically it is a set of
repositories that allows you to console
and manage your project code
like of course say you're deploying a
healthcare application so
these Repose options
help you create repositories and
manage your code of that particular
application and more efficient way
so what you can do is you can connect
project solutions by using the repos
link
as you can see here it is shown
so let's look into its option one by one
first we have
files
so in files your project solution will
be available in this section
so repositories can create manage and
import those Solutions
okay so you just need to upload your
Solutions of your code or your project
here and it will just create
repositories for it and it will help you
create manage those Solutions in a
better way
you can see this here
clone to your computer or portion
existing repository from command line
and imported repositories if you want to
import any uh solution like here you can
just click on import and add the
solution toward the person okay
so this is what files do
basically you can see It'll say it is a
it's like a physical folder itself where
you have all your
name files or repositories or Solutions
you can say of data
so basically it's it functions like a
physical folder itself
so it helps you keep a track
your codes and everything
next comes is comments
so uh in comment section we can manage
commit history
for your repositories that you have
created in files
so it just commits those repositories
with author details from branches like
per se we have a theme one from
spot branch and one from management
branch so
whoever creates that repositories and
have the solution it commits that
repositories under that under that
particular member of the team
with the branch name
then comes pushes
so Bush histories are available in this
section
from each pull request done by the
developers Developers for sale the team
members we who have been working on this
particular project and creating
repositories and solutions
so what is pull request
so pull request or PRS are a way to
change or a review of merge code in our
repositories
so basically team uses these PRS to
review code and give feedbacks or
changes whether like uh for say you are
deploying a code or a solution
so one can review them what all changes
needs to be named or what all
upgradation needs to be made or whether
the code is already fine or not
so basically teams use these PRS to
review the solutions and codes stored in
these repositories
or you can merge multiple Solutions or
multiple codes into the main branch
so basically the viewers can step
through the proposed changes and read
those comments
and what to approve or reject that
particular code
or you can say to upgrade or what are
changes we want to make it they vote for
it that whether that needs to be made to
that particular solution or not
so these are the PRS
next we have branches so we can manage
multiple branching information in this
particular section you can create create
or release branches from Master to death
okay so all users
can actually
can actually create or release branches
from branching information available in
this particular section
next come
tags
so
tags are used to point out specific
comments
like uh giving message tags and data
information to branches you can create
an email conventions to branches by
using submit tags
and the second the next one is pull
request which we have already discussed
the PRS that are basically used in
pushes
so now we have Commit uh come completed
Repose also
so let's move on to the next one which
is
pipeline
see here you can see see that we don't
have any pipeline
created for us yet so let's have a look
at it
provided options one by one
to the first one is environments
so basically it is a collection of
resources where you are actually deploy
your application that you're working on
so it content you can say it contains
one or more virtual machines containers
web apps Etc whatever uh resources you
have actually used for deploying your
application
or what are Services you have used for
creating the environment for the
deployment of your application of course
say we need to deploy our application
and it needs an uh
windows
Java environment so whatever resources
you need to create that environment that
will be added to this environment list
it will be listed over
this section
next we have releases option
so basically this pipeline stores the
data of your pipelines or stages
or tasks
and
deployments in Azure pipelines that
departments you have done so far in your
applications for your applications
actually
so you can say that
it helps your team continuously deliver
software to your customers at a past
pace
with a very minimum you can say lower
risk
so it you can fully automate and
automate the testing and the delivery of
your
software or applications on multiple
stages
or you can also set up an automated
process with approvals and on-demand
deployments
then comes
Library
so again you can see the page is blank
from the name itself you can scrutinize
that it will be a collection
of assets from
Azure devops projects
so basically it is a collection of build
and release assets of a particle project
assets defined in a library can be used
in multiple bills and multiple releases
pipelines on the project
so
all assets that are defined you know
Library share a common security model
so you can control who can Define new
items in a library and who can use an
existing item that you have already
added in this Library
so those are defined for our library
items for say you have added a
particular asset a particular item to
this Library segment
and you can assign a particular member
who will be working on this item
okay so the rules are defined here for
these and these governs the operation
you can perform on those items
that person will be keeping track
whatever changes have been made or
whatever upgradation has been made to
the particular item that has been added
to this
segment Library segment
so then comes uh task groups
so task groups are a way to standardize
and centrally managed deployment steps
for all applications in your projects
so when you include the task group in
your definition and then make a change
centrally to the task group the changes
automatically reflected in all the
definitions
so we can conclude with this that a task
group allows you to encapsulate a
sequence a tasks already defined and you
can say build or release Pipelines
or into a cycle task group
it just encapsulate all those sequences
tasks
so you can choose to extract the
parameters from those encapsulated tasks
as configured variables
and
abstract the rest of the task
information
so what happens is the new task group is
automatically added to the task catalog
and it is ready to be added to other
release and build Pipelines
task groups are stored at the project
level are not accessible outside the
projects group so the task groups will
be only limited to the members who you
have assigned in this project and it
won't be
accessible to the other people or other
team members from different projects
even though they are the member of the
same organization so you can say it's
more of a private
second
now that you have covered task groups
next we have deployment groups
so deployment groups are only available
with classic release flight Pipelines
and it is totally different from the
deployment jobs
it is basically a collection of
deployment related steps Define you know
why a ml file to accomplish a specific
task
so
in nutshell it is a logical set of
deployment Target machine
that have agents installed on each one
the deployment groups represent the
physical environment for example testing
or development of production environment
so a Development Group is just another
grouping of Agents much like an agent
pool you can say
so what you can do with this is you can
specify the security context and runtime
targets for the agents or you can let
yourself use live logs for each server
as a deployment take place
or you can also enable you to use
machine tags to limit deployment to a
specific set of
servers
so this was about deployment groups now
that we have covered one more service
let's move on to the next one that is
test plans
so
test plans the first one we have is
progress report
so you can
analyze with this only the progress
report will be the progress of the
project you have been working on or the
deployments you have been doing or the
tasks you have been performing
so
basically it lets you analyze and view
data for
more than one or an individual test
plans in a particular project
data for test plans in migrated can be
migrated from
an on-premises Azure devop server that
won't show up in this report
okay
so basically the section lets you drill
down by each test plans and give you
summary of each test
plan in it this section also lets you to
navigate to a test plan or shoot of
Choice by double clicking on it okay
so this was the progress report next we
have runs
so basically it represents the execution
of Pipelines
producing a run the pipeline is
processed and agents process one or more
jobs
so when you run a pipeline many things
happen under the couple while you often
won't need to know about them
occasionally it's useful to have the
bigger picture right
so
Azure Pipelines
will get processed under this
test runs
segment so we'll be able to see water
performance
is happening over here like while you're
running a pipeline you can see uh the
running state
the the date you have started that
or what all that
returning pipeline inches like jobs
steps and tasks
runs power both continuous integration
and continuous delivery Pipelines
much we have load test
so basically as your load testing is a
fully managed as Azure service that
enables developers and testers to
generate High scale load with custom
Apache J meter strips and gain
actionable insights to catch and fix
performance bottlenecks at scale
so basically the application performance
and resiliency are more important than
ever before
so how you can run an Azure devops test
so first you need to click on it and
select a test suit that contains all the
automated tests
and you can just choose the run test
option
and it will start processing it so the
service this service basically simulates
traffic for your application you can say
regardless of for on which platform or
where it is actually hosted
so now that we have covered test plans
as well let's move on to the next one
that is artifex so this is the last
service that is provided to the project
by azure devops
so artifacts is a
byproduct produced during the software
development process
so it mainly consists of the project
source code dependency or binaries or
resources that could be represented in
different layout depending on the
particular technology
so it's like an extension that makes it
easier
to discover install or publish
and Maven packages in azure devops
it's basically deeply integrated with
other hubs like Bill so that package
management can become a seamless path
for your existing workflows
so what is exactly it is used for
so if basically it can be used
for both public and private organization
with teams of any size it it basically
manages your
npm or new get packages via feeds and it
allows you to create and share your
makeup
it's a package management solution
all about the services that is provided
to your projects so now that you know
what our service is
do for your project and what are their
benefits and how they function now you
can actually plan your project and start
creating and working on it and start
deploying with the users and what all
services you want for your particular
projects so what you can do is click
here on Project settings
second
yeah you can just click on Project
setting
so now what you can do is you can add in
description that uh what your actual
project is about because I like I said
if you're creating in a healthcare
application so you can just give it a
description that it is for him scare
related to issues employees and helps me
that
like you're trying that particular
application is different possibilities
or Healthcare organization so you can
actually add those information in this
description
and the process which basically it is
basic or private one
but you do get a range of process
for your project when it depending on
the visibility of it like for HR or
strum you can say
so now here you can see that only my uh
ID is attached to it as I'm the only
member here and I'm the administrator so
add members here and
scrolling down you can now that you know
what all services uh provide you or what
they provide to your projects depending
on the need of your project you can just
so select the services you want to
assign to your particular project like
for say if I don't want both assigned to
it or if you can say if I don't want the
services provided by the coach you can
just click on it and select remove both
and I just need to refresh it
here you can see I have overview repos
pipelines artifacts but I don't have uh
test plans and both as you can see
there's planning is basically all the
collection of whatever you're managing
which is indirectly assigned with both
so as you remove the both of the test
band also get removed okay
once
like this you can just uh select what
all services you want specifically and
if you want to delete your project you
can just go ahead and delete it
so this was all about
Azure develop services and I'll show the
robot in studio we can see
the demonstration of how a project
actually functions you can also check
out the Azure Cloud architect course
that will help you master the Azure
infrastructure by understanding Azure

Amazon web services is an evolving cloud
computing platform that offers various
services such as compute power storage
database content delivery and other
resources to help business scale and
grow
AWS services are provided based on a
subscription basis similarly Microsoft
Azure provides a set of cloud services
to design create and monitor
applications on a network
talking about the general features
Amazon web services was established in
the year 2006. today it holds a market
share of
31.7 percent whereas Microsoft Azure was
started in the year 2010 and now has a
market share up to 16.8 percent
Amazon AWS is the world's most broadly
adopted Cloud platform it offers up to
165 Services globally these services are
used by millions of companies like
Spotify Netflix Facebook BBC
Etc talking about Netflix the company
moved its ID operations to AWS in the
year 2009 AWS was able to solve the
company's scalability and data
management issues
Azure offers several services in various
categories including artificial
intelligence analytics containers iot
and many more these services are used by
many famous companies like Accenture
LinkedIn stack eBay and Samsung
Accenture chose Microsoft Azure to boost
productivity and provide better security
to its employees
the AWS pricing model is based on an
hourly basis with AWS every individual
pays only for the services that are
required for his work every person only
pays for the services he consumes
Azure pricing is charged on a per minute
basis the payment system is very simple
and doesn't involve any long-term
contracts
Microsoft Azure is free of upfront cost
and cancellation fees and only users pay
for the resources they consume
with Azure and Amazon AWS there are no
additional costs or termination fees
moving on to the next Factor let's talk
about availability zones
availability zones are isolated data
centers with independent power and
networking these zones protect
applications and files from data center
failures in total AWS has nearly 77
availability zones within 24 geographic
regions around the world
the company plans to establish nine more
AWS availability zones and three more
AWS regions in Indonesia Japan and Spain
on the other hand Microsoft Azure has
many isolated availability zones these
zones are located within an Azure region
and they provide fast network
connectivity Azure has 44 availability
zones around the world the company is
planning to launch 12 more zones
now after discussing the availability
zones let's talk about the services the
services that I am going to compare here
come under the following domains compute
storage database security and finally
networking
AWS and Azure provide a wide variety of
services with low migration costs so
that every individual can shift his or
her current traditional infrastructure
to Cloud platform very easily
AWS ec2 is a suitable example of compute
Services ec2 is a web service that aims
to make life easier for developers by
providing secure and resizable compute
capacity in the cloud it can be
integrated to several other services
like S3 IAM cloud formation
Etc
Azure has a small service called Azure
virtual machine image it helps the
developers to develop and design
identical virtual machines in the matter
of minutes
Azure virtual machines are becoming more
popular among it infrastructures these
machines let an individual create and
use Virtual machines in the cloud as
iaas or infrastructure as a service
virtual machines can be created using
Azure portal Azure Powershell and arm
templates Azure CLI or client software
development kits next comes Amazon S3 it
is the best example for storage service
simple storage service is an object
storage service designed to store and
recover any information from anywhere
via the Internet
Amazon S3 facilitates storage through a
web service interface the service
provides 99.9 durability and 99.9
percent availability of objects
it has the capacity of storing computer
files up to 5 terabytes in size
on the other hand Azure provides a
similar service called blob storage
service
this service provides a large amount of
storage and is highly scalable it stores
an object in the tires depending on how
often the data is being accessed blob
storage supports widely used Frameworks
like java.net Python and node.js it is
the only cloud storage service in
Microsoft Azure that offers a premium
SSD based object storage tire for low
latency Networks
AWS provides a secure Cloud platform
where every individual can manage and
deploy their applications compared to
the on-premises environment AWS Security
offers a high level of data protection
at a lower cost for security purposes
IEM is a suitable service AWS identity
and access management is a cloud service
that controls and manages AWS resources
securely it has no upfront cost also
gives a facility to create and maintain
services within a specific set of users
on your AWS resources in Microsoft Azure
Azure active directory or in short also
called as Azure ad is a web service
which provides MFA multi-factor
authentication features to users in
order to protect their data from cyber
attacks next is Amazon RDS it is a web
service designed to simplify the setup
operation and scaling of a relational
database it is simple to set up use and
scale when required by users it provides
inexpensive and resizable capacity and
automates several tasks such as Hardware
provisioning database setup patching and
backups on the other side the Azure SQL
database automatically updates and
backups data in order to focus on the
development of applications not just
that it also manages database services
and response to client requirements
client requirements such as scalability
of a service data backup and high
availability of database
similarly these Cloud providers have
plenty of services that help users build
and deploy their applications
effectively moving on to the next topic
let us focus on integrating AWS and
Azure with open source tools
now we will explain how to build a
pipeline using Jenkins along with one of
the services of Amazon web services that
is the ec2 in this integration process
we have a sample python application
called as a Docker file
this Docker file will consist of a
python based image
the docker file builds a pipeline in
order to create a Docker image upon
pushing the code to the expository later
the new image is used to start a new AWS
service on an ECS cluster now let's have
a look at how the integration of Open
Source tools happen in Azure in your
Azure Cloud application devops tools
like Docker Maven and Jenkins can be
integrated in case you want to integrate
the Jenkins pipeline go to project and
create a subscription followed by
Jenkins you can specify the required
filters based on your requirement then
choose your endpoint for Azure devops to
communicate with Jenkins
so that was all about Amazon AWS and
Microsoft Azure both AWS and Azure are
honored to be on top of all other Cloud
providers both provide all necessary
features like scalability high
availability and security
but the moment I hear about choosing the
best one I have to say that all that
depends upon the individual business
needs both Cloud providers are the
certified ones that hold immense value
in the current cloud service Market on
AWS versus Azure versus gcp talking
about market share Amazon web services
leads with around 32 percent of the
worldwide public cloud share Azure owns
up to 16 of the worldwide market share
and gcp owns around nine percent of the
world's market share let's talk about
each of these service providers in
detail AWS provides services that enable
users to create and deploy applications
over the cloud these services are
accessible via the Internet AWS being
the oldest of the lot was launched in
the year 2006. Azure launched in 2010 is
a Computing platform that offers a wide
range of services to build manage and
deploy applications on the network using
tools and Frameworks launched in the
year 2008 gcp offers application
development and integration services for
its end users in addition to Cloud
management it also offers services for
Big Data machine learning and iot now
let's talk about availability zones
these are isolated locations within data
center regions from which public cloud
services originate and operate talking
about AWS they have 69 availability
zones within 22 geographical regions
this includes regions in the United
States South America Europe and Asia
Pacific they are also predicted to have
12 more editions in the future Azure
available in 140 countries has over 54
regions worldwide grouped into six
geographies these geographical locations
have more than 100 data centers gcp is
available in 200 plus countries across
the world as of today gcp is present in
61 zones and 20 regions with Osaka and
Zurich being the newly added regions now
let's talk about pricing these Services
follow the pay as you go approach you
pay only For The Individual Services you
need for as long as you use them without
requiring long-term contracts or complex
licensing now on screen you can see the
pricing for each of these cloud service
providers with respect to various
instances like general purpose compute
optimized memory optimized and GPU now
let's talk about the compute services
offered first off we have virtual
servers for AWS we have ec2 it is a web
service which eliminates the need to
invest in Hardware so that you can
develop and deploy applications in a
faster manner it provides virtual
machines in which you can run your
applications azure's virtual machines is
one of the several types of computing
resources that Azure offers Azure gives
the user the flexibility to deploy and
manage a virtual environment inside a
virtual Network gcp's VM service enables
users to build deploy and manage virtual
machines to run workloads on the cloud
now let's talk about the pricing of each
of these Services awcc2 is free to try
it is packaged as part of aws's free
tier that lasts for 12 months and
provides 750 hours per month of both
Linux and Windows Virtual machines Azure
virtual machine service is a part of the
free tier that offers the server this
for about 750 hours per month for a year
the user gets access to Windows and
Linux virtual machines gcp's VM service
is a part of a free tier that includes
micro instance per month for up to 12
months now let's talk about platform as
a service or past services for AWS
elastic Beanstalk is an easy to use
service for deploying and scaling web
applications and services developed with
java.net node.js python and much more it
is used for maintaining capacity
provisioning load balancing Auto scaling
and application Health monitoring the
past backbone utilizes virtualization
techniques where the virtual machine is
independent of the actual Hardware that
hosts it hence the user can write
application code without worrying about
the underlying Hardware Google app
engine is a cloud computing platform as
a service which is used by Developers
for hosting and building apps in Google
data centers the app engine requires the
apps to be written in Java or Python and
store data in Google big table and use
the Google query language for this next
let's talk about virtual private server
Services AWS provides light sale it
provides everything you need to build an
application or website along with the
cost-effective monthly plan and minimum
number of configurations in simple words
VM image is a more comprehensive image
for Microsoft Azure virtual machines it
helps the user create many identical
virtual machines in a matter of minutes
unfortunately gcp does not offer any
similar service next up we have
serverless Computing Services AWS has
Lambda it is a serverless compute
service that lets you run your code
without facilitating and managing
servers you only pay for the compute
time you use it is used to execute
backend code and scales automatically
when required Azure functions is a
serverless compute service that lets you
run even triggered code without having
to explicitly provision or manage
infrastructure this allows the users to
build applications using serverless
simple functions with the programming
language of their choice gcp Cloud
functions make it easy for developers to
run and scale code in the cloud and
build event-driven serverless
applications it is highly available and
fault tolerant now let's talk about
storage services offered by each of
these service providers First off we
have object storage AWS provides S3 it
is an object storage that provides
industry standard scalability data
availability and performance it is
extremely durable and can be used for
storing as well as recovering
information or data from anywhere over
the Internet blob storage is an Azure
feature that lets developers store
unstructured data in Microsoft's Cloud
platform along with storage it also
offers scalability it stores the data in
the form of tiers depending on how often
data is being accessed Google Cloud
Storage is an online storage web service
for storing and accessing data on Google
Cloud platform infrastructure unlike the
Google Drive Google Cloud Storage is
more suitable for Enterprises it also
stores objects that are organized into
buckets Amazon provides EBS or elastic
Block store it provides high performance
block storage and is used along with ec2
instances for workloads that are
transaction or throughput intensive
Azure managed disk is a virtual hard
disk you can think of it like a physical
disk in an on-premises server but
virtualized these managed disks allow
the users to create up to 10 000 VM
disks in a single subscription
persistent storage is a data storage
device that retains data after power to
the device is shut off Google persistent
disk is durable and high performance
block storage for gcp persistent disk
provides storage which can be attached
to instances running in either Google
compute engine or kubernetes engine next
up we have Disaster Recovery Services
AWS provides a cloud-based recovery
service that ensures that your it
infrastructure and data are recovered
while minimizing the amount of downtime
that could be experienced site recovery
helps ensure business continuity by
keeping business apps and workloads
running during outages it allows
recovery by orchestrating and automating
the replication process of azure virtual
machines between regions unfortunately
gcp has no disaster recovery service
next let's talk about database Services
first off for AWS we have RDS or
relational database service it is a web
service that's cost effective and
automates administration tasks basically
it simplifies the setup operation and
scaling of a relational database
Microsoft Azure SQL database is a
software as a service platform that
includes built-in intelligence that
learns app patterns and adapts to
maximize performance reliability and
data protection it also eases the
migration of SQL Server databases
without changing the user's applications
Cloud SQL is a fully managed database
service which is easy to set up maintain
and administer relational postgresql
MySQL and SQL Server databases in the
cloud hosted on gcp cloud SQL provides a
database infrastructure for applications
running anywhere next we have nosql
database Services AWS provides Dynamo DB
which is a managed durable database that
provides security backup and restore and
in-memory caching for applications it is
well known for its low latency and
scalable performance Azure Cosmos DB is
Microsoft's globally distributed
multi-model database service it natively
supports nosql it natively supports
nosql created for low latency and
scalable applications gcp cloud data
store is a nosql database service
offered by Google on the gcp it handles
replication and scales automatically to
your applications load with cloud data
stores interface data can easily be
accessed by any deployment Target now
let's talk about the key Cloud tools for
each of these service providers for AWS
in networking and content delivery we
have AWS Route 53 and AWS cloudfront for
management we have AWS cloudwatch in AWS
cloud formation for development we have
AWS code star and AWS code build for
security we have IAM and Key Management
Service for Microsoft Azure networking
and content delivery we have content 10
delivery Network and express route for
management tools we have Azure advisor
and network Watcher for development
tools for management we have Azure
advisor and network Watcher for
development we have Visual Studio IDE
and Azure blob studio for security we
have Azure security Center and Azure
active directory for gcp we have the
following tools for networking and
content delivery we have Cloud CDN and
Cloud DNS for management we have
stackdriver and gcp monitoring for
development we have Cloud build and
Cloud SDK and finally for security we
have Google cloud IM and Google and
Cloud security scanner now let's talk
about the companies using these Cloud
providers for AWS we have Netflix
Unilever Kellogg's NASA Nokia and Adobe
Pixar Samsung eBay Fujitsu EMC and BMW
among others use Microsoft Azure so as
seen on your screens the companies that
use gcp are Spotify HSBC Snapchat
Twitter PayPal and 20th Century Fox
let's talk about the advantages of each
of these Services Amazon provides
Enterprise friendly Services you can
leverage Amazon's 15 years of experience
delivering large-scale Global
infrastructure and it still continues to
hone and innovate its infrastructure
management skills and capabilities
secondly it provides instant access to
resources AWS is designed to allow
application providers isvs and vendors
to quickly and securely host your
applications whether an existing
application or a new SAS based
application Speed and Agility AWS
provides you access to its services
within minutes all you need to select is
what you require and you can proceed you
can access each of these applications
anytime you need them and finally it's
secure and reliable Amazon enables you
to innovate and scale your application
in a secure environment it secures and
hardens your infrastructure more
importantly it provides security at a
cheaper cost than on-premise
environments now talking about some of
the advantages of azure Microsoft Azure
offers better development operations it
also provides strong security profile
Azure has a strong focus on security
following the standards security model
of detect assess diagnose stabilize and
close Azure also provides a
cost-effective solution the cloud
environment allows businesses to launch
both customer applications and internal
apps in the cloud which saves an ID
infrastructure costs hence its Opex
friendly let's now look at the
advantages of gcp Google bills in minute
level increments so you only pay for the
compute time you use they also provide
discounted prices for long-running
workloads for example you use the VM for
a month and get a discount gcp also
provides live migration of virtual
machines live migration is the process
of moving a running VM from one physical
server to another without disrupting its
availability to the users this is a very
important differentiator for Google
Cloud compared to other Cloud providers
gcp provides automatic scalability this
allows a size container scale to as many
CPUs as needed Google Cloud Storage is
designed for 99.9 durability it creates
server backup and stores them in a new
user configure location let's talk about
the disadvantages of each of these
services for AWS there's a limitation of
the ec2 service AWS provides limitations
on resources that vary from region to
region there may be a limit to the
number of instances that can be created
however you can request for these limits
to be increased secondly they have a
technical support fee AWS charges you
for immediate support and you can opt
for any of these packages developer
which costs 29 per month business which
costs more than 100 an Enterprise that
costs more than fifteen thousand dollars
it has certain network connectivity
issues it also has General issues when
you move to the cloud like downtime
limited control backup protection and so
on however most of these are temporary
issues and can be handled over time
talking about some of the disadvantages
of Microsoft Azure code base is
different when working offline and it
requires modification when working on
the cloud pass ecosystem is not as
efficient as iaas Azure Management
console is frustrating to work with it
is slow to respond and update and
requires far too many clicks to achieve
simple tasks Azure backup is in intended
for backing up and restoring data
located on your on-premises servers to
the cloud that's a great feature but
it's not really useful for doing bare
metal restores of servers in a remote
data center let's now look into the
disadvantages of gcp so when it comes to
Cloud providers the support fee is very
minimal but in the case of gcp it is
quite costly it is around 150 dollars
per month for the most basic service
similar to AWS S3 gcp has a complex
pricing schema also it is not very
budget friendly when it comes to
downloading data from Google Cloud
Storage we'll go over the Microsoft

one is practice with simulators and mock
exams
you can improve your confidence and have
everything set for your Acer 104 exam in
this Final Phase when you feel you have
covered all of your bases in terms of
resources and preparation steps you
should focus on getting some good
simulators these az104 test simulators
are meant to simulate a real exam
setting you can use the simulator to
identify your skills and weaknesses so
that you can work on them
now let's have a look at some of the
practice questions for your better
understanding of this examination
so the first question is you have an
Azure subscription named subscription
one that contains an Azure log analytics
workspace name workspace 1. you need to
view the error events from a table named
even
which query should you run in the
workspace one and the options are
get event where even type equal equal
error
option b
search in event Arrow
option C select from event where even
type equal equal error
and D search an even where even type is
equal Arrow
and the correct answer is
option b
now moving on to the next question you
have an Azure subscription name
subscription one
subscription 1 contains the resource
groups in the following table
rg1 has a web app named web app one web
app one is located in West Europe
you move web app to rg2 what is the
effect of the move
and the options are
the app service plan for web app one
remains in the west Europe policy 2
applies to web app 1.
option b the app service plan for web
app one moves to not Euro for the C2
applies to web app one
option C the app service plan for web
app one remains in the west Europe and
policy 1 applies to web app one
and option D the web app service plan
for web app one moves to North Europe
policy one applies to web app one
and the correct answer is option A
if the source and Target plans are in
the same Resource Group and geographical
region you can migrate an app to another
app service plan
now the app service plan in which your
app runs determines the region in which
it runs you cannot however change the
location of an app service plan
so now coming on to the next question
you have an Azure subscription link to
an Azure active directory cleanint the
tenant includes a user account named
user1
you need to ensure that user 1 can
assign a policy to the tenant Root
Management Group
what should you do and the options are
assign the owner role for the Azure
subscription to user 1 and then modify
the default conditional access policies
option b assign the owner role for the
Azure subscription to user one and then
instruct user want to configure access
management for Azure resources
option C assign the global administrator
role to use the one and then instruct
user1 to configure access management for
Azure resources
and option D create a new management
group and delegate user one as the owner
of the new management
and the correct answer is B
now let's move on to the next question
you need to ensure that an Azure active
directory username admin 1 is assigned
the required role to enable graphic
analytics for an Azure subscription
now the solution is you assign the owner
role at the subscription level to admin
1. does this meet the goal
and the option is either yes
or no
and the correct answer is
yes your account must meet one of the
following to enable traffic Analytics
so your account must have any one of the
following Azure rules at the
subscription scope owner contributor
reader on network contributor
now the next question is
you have an Azure subscription
users access the resources in the
subscription from either home or from
customer sites from home users must
establish a point to sight VPN to access
the Azure resources the users on the
customer sites access the Azure
Resources by using site-to-site vpns
so you have a line of business app named
app one that runs with several Azure
virtual machines the virtual machine run
Windows server 2016. so you need to
ensure that the connections to app one
are spread across all the virtual
machines so what are the two possible
Azure services that you can use
and the options are a an internal load
balancer
b a public load balancer
C
and Azure content delivery Network or
CDN
option D traffic manager
and option e and Azure application
Gateway
and the correct answer is A and E
Network traffic from the VPN Gateway is
routed to the cloud application to an
internal load balancer the load balancer
is located in the front-end subnet of
the application
now let's have a look at the companies
that hire Azure administrator associate
excellent NCR Corporation cognizant
Bosch Microsoft and Yahoo are some of
the great companies that hire Azure
administrator with great amount of
packages
and good amount of salary

welcome you to this Azure interview
preparation session knowing Azure is one
thing having worked on Azure is another
thing and being able to answer interview
questions in Azure is a totally
different thing although one helps the
other it's still different skills and
our aim through this video is to prepare
you with common product and scenario
based interview questions so why wait
let's get started a common Cloud
interview question is what's the
difference between SAS has an is we all
know that a software as a service is
Thin Client model of software
provisioning where client in this case
usually is simply a web browser
providing the point of access to
softwares running on the servers now SAS
is the most familiar form of cloud
service for customers SAS moves the task
of managing software and its deployment
to third-party services meaning the
vendor actually gets to manage all that
so SAS is software as a service
involving applications being consumed
and used by organization so it's
generally using an application and
usually organizations pay for their use
of this particular application now some
examples of SAS would include Office 365
Salesforce is another very good example
of SAS and a lot of Google Apps and
Storage Solutions like box and Dropbox
are a very good example of software as a
service talking about platform as a
service or paths it actually functions
at the lower level than SAS now
typically it provides a platform on
which software can be developed and
deployed now here we developed the
software we deploy the software now Paz
actually provides an abstract of much of
the work dealing with servers and giving
client and environment in which the
operating system and the server software
and the Hardwares the network are
managed and taken care in other words
with a platform as a service all the
things that I've mentioned like these
servers the server software the hardware
everything is managed by the provider
and we can focus on business side of the
scalability and we can focus on
application development of our product
or the service so in short platform as a
service is a service that enables
developers to build build and work with
applications without even having to
worry about the infrastructure or
management of the underlying hosting
environments and some examples of pass
in Azure is SQL and Azure storage
talking about infrastructure as a
service I as now this is moving down the
stack even further now we get to the
fundamental building block of the cloud
service which is infrastructure as a
service is now is is fully of Highly
automated scalable Computer Resources is
full of storage is full of the network
capability that's what is now is clients
have direct access to the servers and
storage just as they would to do
traditional servers but in this case
it's going to be in the cloud in this
case it's going to be more scalable so
is very similar to what you would do in
your on-premises physical Data Center
but when we talk about is we get to do
everything but it's stored in the cloud
so if we need to build a definition
around is is or infrastructure as a
service provides users with components
it provides components it does not give
us a built environment it simply
provides a component such as operating
system a networking capabilities and a
lot more now this is a paid for based on
the usage and can be used to host
applications in other words this is pay
as you go type the more you use the more
you pay the less you use the less you
pay and some of the examples of is in
Azure is a virtual machine that's a
great example for is and v-nets for
networking that's another good example
for is in Azure another common question
in Azure interview is what are the
instant types offered by Azure the main
intention of this question is how well
have you understood the different
offerings in Azure and how well are you
trained to pick the right offering for
the right service now one size does not
fit all and thereof there are a lot of
services in Azure that under the carpet
it does the same thing but depending on
how different your requirement is we'll
have to pick the appropriate service so
this actually this question what are the
different instant types offered by Azure
it's to test how well have you used the
product and services available in Azure
and how well have you applied them for
the given requirement you shouldn't be
provisioning more you should be
provisioning less at the same time so
it's kind of matching the right service
to the right requirement so what are the
instant types offered by Azure as you
see in the list we have general purpose
compute optimized memory optimized
storage optimized GPU virtual machines
and high performance compute virtual
machines now answering just the names
won't be enough in an interview you'll
have to go further and explain why and
in What scenario you would use general
purpose and what are the use cases what
type of servers is a good fit for a
general purpose and what type is a good
fit for computer optimized so on and so
forth and that's exactly what we're
going to do now so the general purpose
VMS you know they provide a balanced CPU
to memory ratio and it's very good for
testing very good for development
environment very good for small and
medium databases and also for low to
medium traffic web servers and some of
the use cases are like we said test
servers low traffic web servers small to
medium databases some Enterprise grade
applications it's also good for
relational database it's also good for
servers used for in-memory caching it's
also good for some small analytic
database very good for microservices and
if you're trying to build a proof of
concept for an idea that you just have
or just parked this is another good
server for doing proof of Concepts
because you're not going to send actual
traffic to web I just want to show that
you know your idea works so general
purpose server is a very good use case
for those scenarios and the largest
instance size we can get in general
purpose is standard d64 V3 which comes
with 256 gigabit of memory and 1600
gigabit of SSD temporary storage on the
other hand compute optimized VMS have an
a high CPU to memory ratio and are very
good for medium traffic web servers very
good for batch processing servers very
good for application servers now because
it's computer optimized and compute
means a CPU it's an excellent choice for
workloads that demand faster CPU but
does not need as much memory or
temporary storage virtual CPU some of
the workloads that run very well on
computer optimized are analytic
workloads gaming servers require more
CPU they run really well batch
processing are some of the application
that can be placed in computer optimized
and by doing that we get the actual
benefit of the computer optimized
instance and the largest instance size
or the largest instance size type is
standard f72s a V2 and here we get 144
gigabit of memory and 576 gigabit of SSD
temporary storage in compute optimized
VMS in the same lines memory optimized
to VM they offer High memory to CPU
ratio and that are great for databases
databases require more memory so it's a
great fit for a database and it's a
great fit for medium to large scale
caches applications that require
in-memory analytics so this memory
optimized memories more so it's very
good for in-memory analytics
applications and the largest instance
size we get here is standard
m128m and look at the gigabit of memory
it's a 3892 gigabit of memory and look
at the temporary storage it's a 1400
336 a gigabit of temporary storage on
the same lines storage optimized now I
guess I don't have to explain to you
what storage optimized is used for you
might have easily guessed looking at the
flow yes storage optimized VM offer High
disk throughput and IO and are very
ideal for Big Data SQL nosql databases
data warehousing servers large
transactional databases and lot more and
some of the examples of the applications
that can be launched on storage
optimized or Cassandra mongodb Cloudera
redis these are some familiar
applications that can get benefited when
we run them on storage optimized and one
difference between storage optimized and
the other servers are they are generally
optimized to use the local disk on the
Node attached directly to the VM rather
than using an durable disk which is
actually an a remote disk space now what
does this allow this allows for greater
input outputs per second or throughput
for the workload so that's what we get a
greater throughput a greater input
outputs per second is what we get and
when we use storage optimized and the
largest instance size available in
storage optimized is a standard l32s and
the memory is 256 gigabit and look at
the temporary storage it's a
5630 gigabit of temporary storage GPU
type VMS easy to guess at GPU optimized
VMS are specialized virtual machines
available with multiple gpus attached to
them now these sizes are designed for or
these VMS are designed for computer
intensive graphic intensive a
visualization workloads that require a
lot of graphical Processing Unit
attached to it so in short these are
virtual machines that specialize in
heavy graphic rendering and video
editing it also helps with model
training and interferencing with a
standard nd24 RS which has a 448 gigabit
of memory and 2948 gigabit of temporary
storage and the last but not the least
but the best last but the best is high
performance compute or Azure H series
virtual machines now they are the latest
in high performance Computing VMS and
are aimed to handle workloads like batch
processing analytic molecular modeling
and fluid dynamics a lot of complicated
applications in this VM and this is the
fastest and Powerful CPU virtual machine
with the optional High throughput
interfaces and the largest instance size
that's available is a standard l32s
which comes with the 224 gigabit of
memory and 200 gigabit of SSD temporary
storage and a third common question is
what are the deployment environments
offered by Azure there are two main
deployment environments one is the
staging environment and the other one is
the production environment now in
staging environment let's talk about
staging first so when you are deploying
a web app or web app on Linux you can
deploy them to a separate slot instead
of the default production slot when
running them in standard premium or
isolated app service plan tiers now the
deployments slots are actually live app
with their own host name and at a later
point the staging environment can be
swapped with the production environment
so why do we need an staging environment
what are the benefit of it so the
benefit of deploying a replication to a
non-production or staging environment it
provides a platform to validate changes
to our application before it can be made
live in the production environment and
in the staging environment the app can
be identified using the azure's global
unique identifier also called as the
guid URL and it's very very similar to
the production URL except that it has a
custom name in front of it that
identifies it as the staging environment
and for production environment this is
the live production environment that's
serving customers request that serving
the customer content now it can be
slightly different from the staging
environment in a way that the URL that's
used to identify the production
environment that's more often DNS
friendly name like the name of the
actual service dot
cloudapp.net that way it differs in case
of staging environment you have a custom
name right before it so the custom name
and then the cloudapp.net but in this
case you get the direct service name as
the name of the URL so this is live
production environment which receives
and handles and serves customer traffic
another commonly asked question in Azure
is what are the advantages of scaling in
Azure the actual thought behind the
question is to see how much have you
understood scaling how much have you
seen and how much have you applied the
scaling effect in the production
environment and have received benefits
in return so let's talk about it
advantages of scaling in Azure some of
the advantages are we get the maximum
application performance now Auto scaling
is a built-in feature for the cloud
services be it AWS Azure Google and
couple of other cloud service providers
it's a built-in feature for a cloud
service a cloud service should be Auto
scalable and that includes mobile
services virtual machines and when we
run our applications on mobile services
or virtual machines the website actually
gets the best performance during the
change in the demand again different
applications might require different
performance needs for example for some
apps the performance measured based on
memory and another a good example is the
fluctuating demand for example you could
have a web app that handles millions of
requests during the day and literally
nothing at the night and auto scaling
this environment Auto scaling any of
this environment will automatically
scale or fatten your environment so to
receive the all the incoming traffic and
during lean period it actually gets
Slimmer and Slimmer so to help you with
the cost so it actually maximizes the
performance that's what Auto scaling
does and like we said Auto scaling
scales up and scales Down based on
demand it not only scales up but also
scales down so to help you with the cost
and if you know the particular pattern
in which the application is going to
receive traffic then we can very well go
ahead and schedule scaling to our
application or schedule scaling that
infrastructure based on time if we
already know that Monday to Friday
that's the traffic that I would get and
it's a constant one it's not a public
facing but you know it's an internal
application so I know all the 500 users
or the Thousand or the 5000 users who
will be using it so at any given point
it's just 5 000 users it's not going to
go beyond that and during Saturday and
Sunday literally nobody's going to be in
office so no load at all so in that case
I pretty much know how the pattern is
going to be I can go for scheduled
scaling if I know and the pattern and
auto scaling like I said not only helps
with keeping the application highly
available it also helps with the cost
effectiveness of our infrastructure so
anytime there's a VM or a group of VMS
running on less CPU Auto scaling is
gonna actually get the environment
Slimmer and Slimmer so we're not
unnecessarily running any resources and
paying for it if you're being
interviewed for the infra site in Azure
this is another common question that
gets asked how are Windows Active
Directory and Azure active directory
different let's talk about the Windows
Active Directory first the non-cloud
Windows Active Directory was the service
was released along with Windows 2000
server Edition and this active directory
is essentially a database that helps
organizations to organize the users
organize the computers and a lot more it
provides authentication and
authorization to the applications not
only to the applications but also to
file servers to printers and lot of
other on-premises resources that's what
the basic non-cloud active directory
does on the other hand the Azure active
directory is not designed to manage a
web-based Services the Azure active
directory on the other hand was designed
to support web-based services that use
rest API interfaces for Office 365
salesforce.com
Etc unlike the plain active directory
this uses an completely different
protocol so protocol wise it's different
and the services that it support is
quite different now besides that it also
has couple of other differences as well
and let's look at them so the actual
active directory or the windows actual
directory is a directory service that
facilitates working with interconnected
complex and different network resources
in a very unified manner on the other
hand Azure active directory is
Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud-based
directory and identity management
service and the Windows Active Directory
has five layers to store data to store
user details and to issue the manage
event certifications on the other hand
Azure active directory integrates or
compresses the five layers in to adjust
two layers here Windows Active Directory
works with on-premises servers like
applications file servers and printers
Etc on the other hand Azure active
directory it works on web-based services
that use restful interfaces if you're
being hired for the development
environment or for the cloud devops
support environment or even for the
production support environment you might
find yourself being asked this question
what are the types of cues offered by
Azure now Azure supports two types of
queue mechanisms the storage queue and
the service bus queue Let's Talk About
Storage queue first now the storage
queue which are part of azure storage
infrastructure it provides a simple rest
based interface simple rest based get
put and Peak interface it provides
reliable persistent messaging within and
between other services it follows the
pub sub model or a pub sub messaging
infrastructure and it's best suited for
users that need to store more than 80
gigabit of messages in the queue it can
provide a logs for all the transactions
executed against the user's queue so
that's what we get with storage queue
and on the other hand service bus queue
the service bus queues are built on top
of broader messaging infrastructure and
they are designed to integrate
applications and applications component
that can span multiple communication
protocols so that way it differs so this
is good for applications and components
that may span multiple communication
protocols and even different totally
different network environments so in
short these service buses or the service
bus queues in Azure are part of azure's
messaging infrastructure and they
integrate applications or application
components that can actually span
multiple different protocols and
multiple different network environments
it also provides and first and first out
style for delivery and the user's queue
size has to remain under 80 gigabits
another familiar question is what are
the advantages of azure resource manager
now the resource manager helps us to
manage the usage of the application
resources this question is actually to
test how well have you tested how well
have you used resource manager and have
gotten the benefit of it this question
actually tests how easy it has become
after the introduction of resource
manager compared to when doing
deployments or when provisioning
resources without the resource manager
so let's get into the answers for the
question what are the advantages of
azure resource manager the in-shared
resource manager is called arm so the
arm helps deploy manage and monitor all
the resources for an application a
solution or a group so all the
interconnected application all the
interconnected Services can be monitored
as group using resource manager and a
users can be granted to access to
sources that they require within a
resource manager so in an account I can
have like 10 different resources created
by resource manager or a resource Group
created by resource managers and I can
allow deny connection to those services
or only to those Services based on
whether the user should be accessing one
and not accessing the other so that way
it becomes easy to give access to a
group of application it helps in getting
billing details for the group of
resources now which group is using more
which group is using less and which
group has contributed more to this
month's bill stuff like that so those
details can be obtained using Azure zos
manager and provisioning resources is
made much easier with the help of this
resource manager another question is how
has integrating hybrid Cloud been useful
for Azure well with the use of hybrid
Cloud we get the best of both the worlds
so what's hybrid Cloud it's nothing but
combining the public cloud and the
private cloud and allow loving data on
applications to be shared between them
so whenever the compute or the
processing demand fluctuates hybrid
cloud computing gives businesses the
ability to seamlessly scale their
on-premises infrastructure in the public
cloud and handle any kind of
overflow in the requirement or overflow
in handling the application so it really
helps it helps it boost the productivity
of our on-premises application so with
the hybrid Cloud we get a greater
efficiency with combination of azure
Services a devops process and tools for
the application running in on-premises
and by having a hybrid Cloud environment
users can take advantage of a constantly
updated Azure service and other AWS
Marketplace applications for their
on-premises environment and the other
benefit is with hybrid Cloud environment
we can simply deploy applications
regardless of its look locations in case
of on-premises we'll have to worry about
the location but when we expand our
on-premises environment in the cloud and
they can or we can pick any of the
locations and simply deploy it in them
and this enables the applications to be
created at a greater speed what's
federating in Azure SQL now this
question is very specific about SQL how
can we scale the SQL database now this
is a very good question or a valid
question or an important question in the
interview because many customers or
companies have not been able to meet the
user demand because they could not scale
out the databases the theory of scaling
out or adding servers to accommodate the
increased workflows and traffic is not
hard to understand but the implications
can be very complicated the implications
can be very expensive we're well aware
of scaling the web service that's very
common but how do we scale the database
so Microsoft provides the tools and
Technologies so we can scale out the
database in the cloud and that's what is
called SQL or Federation in Azure SQL so
the way we scale out the SQL database is
by sharing sharing the database so
sharing actually enables users to take
advantages of the resources in the cloud
not only that it allows users to have
their own database or a shared database
amongst each other because we're
creating a highly available database
because we're having shards in a
database it actually reduces the
possibility of a single point of failure
for our database and more importantly
because we're sharing because we're
using Federation and Azure SQL it
provides an cost effective scaling of
our databases by using Cloud resources
or by using billing only for the cloud
resources that we have used so no
pre-provisioning no over provisioning it
Provisions the right amount and we pay
the right amount let's talk about this
one what are the different types of
storage offered by Azure now the
different types of storage offered by
Azure are as you already know and as you
can see they are Azure blob storages
table storages file storage and queue
storage so let's expand one after the
other now blob storage are nothing but a
massive scalable object storage and
that's very good for storing text and
binary data and Azure blob storage is a
Microsoft's object storage solution for
the cloud now lab storage is optimized
for storing massive massive amount of
unstructured data that can be in form of
text or or in form of binary data so in
short blob storage enables users to
store unstructured data and those data
can be in the format of pictures music
video files and lot more and it stores
them along with their metadata and
another advantage or another feature
benefit that we get from blob storage is
when an object is changed it it is
verified to ensure it is of the latest
version number one and number two it
provides maximum flexibility to optimize
the user's storage needs and this
unstructured data is available to
customers through an URL or an rest
based object storage so they are the
benefits that come along with The Blob
storage table storage on the other hand
is an a nosql store for schema Less
storage of secured data now this Azure
table storage is a service that stores
structured nosql data in the cloud and
because this table is a schema-less it's
very easy to save your data it's very
easy to adapt your data as the need for
your application grows and this table
storage is very fast and cost effective
for many type of applications so some of
the some of the type of data that we can
store is table storage is good for
flexible databases like user data for
web applications address book store
average device information storage and
if you want to store metadata this is a
very good use case to store them in
Azure table storage Azure files is
another storage here it's an managed
file share for cloud or on-premises
deployment so file storage provides a
file sharing capabilities accessible by
the server messaging block protocol and
this can be accessed from the cloud and
this can be accessed from on-premises as
well now here in file storage the data
is protected by SMB 3.0 and https
protocols and the more important thing
is azure takes care of managing hardware
and the operating system deployments for
Azure file storage so this additional
file storage can be used when we want to
burst the storage capacity in
on-premises so on-premises the primary
and cloud is the secondary or the
extended on-premises storage so it
actually improves the on-premises
performance and capabilities for are on
premises Data Center and then we have
cues Azure queues it's a messaging store
for Reliable messaging between the
application component so we spoke a
little about this in the previous
question so the Azure queue storage is a
service for storing a large amount of
messages that can be accessed from
anywhere in the world via HTTP or https
a protocol and here the a single message
can be up to 64 kilobits in size and in
a queue we can have millions of messages
and the limit can actually go up if we
have not reached the limit of the
storage account so it's millions and
millions of requests that can be stored
in the storage tube or the queue storage
so the queue storage in short provides
message queuing for large workloads and
it enables users to build flexible
applications and separate the functions
one from another so one fail link
doesn't affect the other application
which is running healthy and this queue
storage it ensures the application is
scalable and less prone to individual
component failures because they are
decoupled separate now it also helps in
monitoring the queue which ensures the
customer's demands are mapped so Q is a
great place to monitor or a great
component to monitor so we understand
how much a peak have we reached for a
particular application service or a
container what this text analysis API in
Azure machine learning now a text
analysis is actually an cloud-based
analytics API and it provides an
advanced natural language processing
over the raw text and it has got four
main functions like the sentiment
analysis or and the key phrase analysis
language deduction and then few other
things now what do you mean by sentiment
analysis now sentiment analysis is from
the log from the comments from the text
commands that we receive do an analysis
and find out whether that's an positive
or A negative statement now if it is a
the API the API returns and sentiments
code between 0 and 1 and 1 is positive
and 0 is negative and then in text
analysis we have a key phrase extraction
which is it will automatically extract
the key phrase to quickly identify the
main points in that key phrase for
example if you're analyzing an text
which says the food was delicious and
there were wonderful stuff then the API
Returns the main talking points of that
phrase like food food is the main
talking point and wonderful stuffs that
was a main talking point so that's
another feature that this text analysis
has and then we have language deduction
in text analysis right irrespective of
what you pay taste it can try to gauge
and try to align it to the 120 or up to
120 languages that it supports so I can
simply take text from the internet and I
can paste it and the text analysis
software is going to identify the
language and then can run phrase and
sentiment analysis on those texts right
so in short text analysis is an API a
set of web services that can be used for
text analysis it can be used to analyze
unstructured statement sentiment
analysis key phrase extraction and lot
more and the results are generally
between 0 and 1 and 1 being positive and
0 being the negative sentiment there is
no much training or in other words this
is not as complicated as couple of other
text analysis softwares are available in
the market we can simply paste we can
simply upload the text and we can call
the service and it runs a sentiment
analysis on it all by itself let's look
at this question what are the advantages
of azure Q storage if you're going to
work on a development environment if
you're going to work on an environment
that Embraces devops this could be a
question what are the advantages of
azure queue storage now Azure queue
storage is built to flexibly operate the
applications and separate the functions
between the applications that run large
workloads so when we design applications
for scale these applications can be
decoupled so that they can scale
independently you know and thing
happening on an application is not
dependent on another application and
anything happens to an section of the
application will not affect the other
application because they are now
decoupled and corrected through the
queue storage so the queue storage gives
us asynchronous message queuing for
communication between the applications
irrespective of whether they are running
in the cloud or whether they are running
in desktop or whether they are running
on premises or on mobile devices so in
shot this queue storage enables message
queuing for large workloads in a simple
and cost effective and a durable manner
talking about the advantages advantages
is it provides Rich client libraries for
Java Android C plus plus PHP Ruby and
lot other services getting added during
every new release from Azure and the
main advantage again is it enables users
to build flexible apps and separate the
functions for bigger or greater
durability again introduction of queues
into our application it ensures our
users applications are scalable and less
prone to individual component failures
meaning one component failing is not
going to take the whole application down
right if one component fails it's just
that component that stays fails the rest
are healthy and the rest are going to
function it also helps us to monitor the
cues and ensure the servers are an
overhead and by sudden traffic a burst
so how much do I have in the queue kind
of determines the traffic for my
application and if the queue is more I
can always go and auto scale my
environment and the queue is less I can
always go and Shrink or make my
environment thinner so it can save cost
and anytime there is more data in the
queue I can Auto scale monitor the
metric and do auto scaling based on that
metric so the environment knows that
there are more data's coming in I need
to expand myself to handle that much
amount of data this is a very common
question what are the two kinds of azure
web service roles now a service role is
a set of managed and load balanced
virtual machines that work to perform
some tasks and based on what it's going
to run on top of it is it going to run a
web service or is it going to run a
worker service defines what kind of
roles that gets attached or that goes on
this virtual machines so we have two
types web role and worker roles the web
role is a cloud service role that's
configured to run web applications
developed on programming languages
Technologies and majorly they support
IIs internet information service and
they support asp.net PHP Windows
communication foundation and so on so
that's web roles and these web roles it
automatically deploys and hosts
application through the user's IIs
internet information service on the
other hand worker roles are roles that
runs applications and service level
tasks which generally do not require IAS
so IIs is actually the differentiating
factor so in worker roles is not
installed by default the worker roles
are mainly used to perform supporting
background process along with web roles
and do tasks automatically compressing
or uploading the images running scripts
and uh or doing some changes in the
database getting new messages from the Q
and processing and a lot more you know
the work the applications or the work
that does not require IAS that's what
this worker role does again the main
difference between the web role and the
worker role is that the web role
automatically deploys and hosts your
application through is whereas the
worker role does not use IES and runs
our application as Standalone this is
another classic question what is azure
service fabric so Azure service fabric
is actually a distributed system
platform that makes it easy to pack
deploy and manage a scalable and
reliable microservices and containers
now service fabric also addresses some
of the significant challenges in
developing and managing Cloud native
applications and the problem that IT
addresses and fixes is now developers
and administers can avoid complex
infrastructure problems and focus on
implementing Mission critical and
demanding workloads that that can be
scaled and that can be managed through
the console or from the single place in
short service fabric provides a platform
that makes the process of developing
microservices and managing application
life cycle a lot easier and the
advantages of service fabric is that now
we can produce application with faster
time to Market because all the worry
about the infrastructure is taken away
from us we don't have to design an
infrastructure all that we need to worry
about is simply the application and the
application life cycle again the
advantage is it supports Windows it
supports Linux not only that it supports
servers on premises and in the cloud
with service fabric we can scale up our
environment to even thousand machines in
just a single command or if there is a
immediate need for thousand machines I
can immediately scale them up to
thousand machines that's possible with
service fabric now let's look at this
question you can expect this question if
the customer is run running hybrid
environment meaning having some of the
applications in on-premises and running
some of the applications from the cloud
and for some reason when classifying the
application that goes to the cloud and
that stays on premises they have decided
to keep the database in-house so in that
environment a lot of customers do that
so in that environment this is a classic
and a scenario based question a client
wants the front end of their application
to be hosted on Azure in the cloud and
once the database to be hosted in
on-premises for security reasons or to
have full control on that databases how
do we go about suggesting a solution for
this customer the ideal solution in this
scenario is to use the v-net based point
to site VPN solution so all the
front-end applications will be in the
cloud and they'll be hosted in a v-net
and from the v-net they'll be connecting
to the database through and point to
site or VPN so the traffic and the
writings and the reads are not coming
through the internet but through a point
to site VPN link that's connecting the
Azure v-net and the on-premises
environment and this model or this
approach or the solution is best suited
for scenarios where there are only a
limited number of results that needs to
be connected between on-premises and the
cloud this is a very common question
what's Azure traffic manager of course
we know more running applications on a
single server we know more running
applications on or or from a single
environment right the same application
is being run from multiple environments
within Azure and it can be running from
Azure and on-premise as well so multiple
environments between Azure and
on-premises and a lot of customers have
such environment and if you are facing
an interview with such customer this
could be an ideal question what is azure
traffic manager now the Azure traffic
manager is a dns-based traffic load
balancer that actually enables us to
distribute traffic between Services
across Azure Global regions and by doing
this it provides a good availability and
a good responsiveness to the application
and this traffic manager it uses DNS to
direct client requests to the most
appropriate service endpoint based on
the traffic routing logic and the health
of the endpoints that it maintains so in
short this traffic manager is a load
balancer that enables users to provide
High availability and responsiveness by
Distributing traffic in an optimal
manner across the Azure when we run the
same application in different regions so
some of the advantages or some of the
use cases of using Azure traffic manager
is it provides multiple automatic
failover options it also helps with
reduced downtime it also helps with the
distribution of user traffic across
multiple locations so one location is
not overloaded and then it helps with
users knowing from where our customers
are getting connected from that's
another big use case with Azure traffic
manager let's look at this question
right this is an ideal question now
there are group of servers connected
together within an virtual Network and
now we need to move them or create a
separation between them how do you go
about achieving it so the question goes
like this you need to isolate Network
traffic among VMS in a subnet which is
part of a virtual network with little
downtime and impact on the user so
that's the given scenario and the best
way we can do it is create a new virtual
Network and move all the VMS in that
subnet to the new virtual Network now
this feature is not possible with a lot
of other cloud service providers like
AWS and lot of other providers now in
those environments we might need to shut
down we might need to stop the VM create
a new VM based on the image and it's an
Hefty process but here in Azure I can
simply I move the VMS from one subnet to
another virtual Network without needing
for any additional security like the
network security group I can simply
isolate them if I need to by creating a
simple a new virtual Network and moving
the servers to the new virtual Network
look at this one this is another common
question with respect to Azure what is
public private and hybrid Cloud so this
is really to test how well have you
understood the different Cloud offerings
in the market public private and hybrid
or at least the three basic offerings in
the market public private and hybrid
Cloud now the public cloud is the most
common way of deploying cloud computing
applications and it has resources like
servers storage and are owned and
operated by third-party cloud service
providers like Microsoft Azure Microsoft
Azure is a very good example of public
Cloud so here every component that the
user is using is running only on azure
or that's public Cloud right let me talk
to you about some of the advantages of
public Cloud some of the advantages is
low cost because there's no need to
purchase Hardware or software and we pay
only for the services that we use in
public cloud and there is literally no
maintenance because the service provider
maintains the environment for us and
with public Cloud we have nearly
unlimited scalability meaning we can get
resources on demand and can meet our
business requirements on demand and the
public clouds are very highly reliable
because they have a vast network of
servers and they ensure that our
application does not fail so there are
some advantages of public Cloud let's
talk about private Cloud now private
Cloud consists of compute resources used
extensively by one business or one
organization now this private Cloud can
be physically located at our
organizations on-site data center or it
can be hosted by a third party service
provider whichever the case the private
cloud services and infrastructure are
always maintained on a private Network
and they're maintained on hardware and
software that are dedicated solely for
one organization or solely for your
organization so in short private cloud
in Azure is azure Services being run
within an on-premises data center or
on-premises data center used by the user
to host systems or applications and some
of the advantages some of the advantages
is it gives more security resources are
not shared with others so have higher
level of control and security over our
resource and application is possible and
then we have a hybrid Cloud now hybrid
cloud is the best of both worlds so it
combines the features of both public and
private cloud and some of the user
components are being run on Azure and
others within on-premises data center so
they kind of share the resources in
other words they kind of share the
application half of the application
would be running in on-premises and half
of them would be in the cloud and they
would be working in harmony to support
the application and the business need so
that's hybrid Cloud this is one another
good example question that wants to test
how well you pick services or how well
have you understood the Azure products
and services and are picking the right
service for the need so the question
would go like this what kind of storage
is best suited to handle unstructured
data a lot of storage options available
and the requirement here is what or
which one would you choose for
unstructured data the answer for that
question is block storage because blob
storage is designed to support
unstructured data it works in this way
it places the data into different tiers
based on how often they are accessed
different tier means different
performance different performance means
different costs associated with it so a
lot of add-on advantages will we get
when we use blob store storage for
unstructured data in addition to it any
type of unstructured data can be stored
in a blob storage this is not true with
couple of other storage options that we
have in Azure only with blob storage we
can store any type of unstructured data
and the data Integrity is maintained
every time an object is changed in the
blob storage and the best part is the
blob storage helps increase applications
performance and reduces the bandwidth
consumption and reduces the bandwidth
consumption for that application so they
are the benefits that we get for blob
storage and blob storage are the ones
that are well suited for unstructured
data and that's what your answer should
be it's really an five-step process and
if you have worked and if we have done
some Labs some basic Labs with Azure you
can easily answer this question so it's
a five-step process first step is to log
into the Azure the second one is to
create an resource resource or a
resource manager and within the resource
manager you will be selecting the
resource and then pick the offering
system do you want windows or Linux and
within Windows what's the flavor you
want or within Linux what's the flavor
you want so decide on it and then
entering the relevant information
relevant information like the name of
the instance or the VM that we're going
to launch and the password the URL that
goes with it and couple of other
relevant information that goes gets
itself attached with the VM and then
select the size of the virtual machine
different size different types available
for the kind of application and for the
intensity of the application that will
be running on top of it so select the
virtual select the size of the virtual
machine review everything whether
they're good or not if there are any
changes required go back and edit them
and then come back and launch and your
VM is there for you to start working
within like three or four minutes not
even five minutes within three or four
minutes it gets ready and you can start
working on it so it's a quick and it's a
five step process and you should be able
to answer it easily if you have done few
labs in Azure let's now look at some
scenario based question you've been
posed with a scenario so we thought
through it and we picked some common
scenario based questions that are being
asked in interview and I thought we'll
present it for you with the answers with
explanation so you can get benefited
through it so let's look at this
question you're asked to make sure your
virtual machines are able to communicate
securely with each other to ensure
security or to have good amount of
security what would you do and the
correct and the best answer for this
would be using virtual Network in Azure
which enables us to communicate with the
internet securely which enables us to
communicate with the on-premises data
center in a secure fashion so the
advantage of using virtual network is
users can create their own private
Network users can pick their own private
IP ranges users can create create their
own subnet users can create their own
routing between those two subnets a lot
more goes into that virtual Network so
it's very customizable and the users are
provided with an isolated and highly
secure environment for applications it's
completely isolated from other customers
it's completely isolated from other
applications that are running in other
virtual Network that we own So within
our account we can have multiple virtual
networks and one application running on
a virtual machine is completely isolated
from other applications running on other
virtual machines and of course all
traffic stays within the Azure Network
Azure virtual machine or within the
Azure Network depending on how you set
up the routing if you have set up a
routing to go or reach the Internet it's
going to go otherwise it's going to stay
within Azure if you have set up routing
to reach on-premises then it's going to
go and reach on-premises otherwise it's
not going to go and reach on-premises
it's going to stay Within the Azure and
it also allows users to design their own
network like we already discussed
picking up IPS picking routing you know
picking subnets you know how many
servers should be present in that
particular subnet or how many servers
should that subnet accommodate the size
of the subnet the IP ranges the natting
the masking of ips creating of VPN all
that's possible with the virtual Network
so it really allows users to design
their own network and using virtual
machine is how we secure applications in
the cloud let's look at this other
scenario how do you ensure that every
time a user logs in they are not asked
to re-enter the password as part of
authentication so you really don't want
your users to re-enter the password
every time they log in to a different
application well all the applications
have their authentication mechanism in
place all of them wants to authenticate
the user before they login ensuring the
user is not a login every time does not
mean that no wiping away all the
authentication and authorization that's
present in that application you still
need that in place but how do you make
the user hassle free so they're not
asked to re-enter the password or the
same password again and again let's look
at the options available the first one
is to enable Microsoft account
authentication well it's not going to
fix because with that the user will
still need to re-enter the username and
password a deploy express route it's not
going to fix either because express
route is a network level service that
connects on premises to the cloud so
that has got nothing to do with
prompting or not prompting for password
and then we have set up VPN between
on-premises Data Center and Azure set up
80 domain controller in VM and Implement
integrated Windows authentication well
you can use the same username and
password for on-premises and the cloud
but this setup the VPN and the area
controller set up it's not going to stop
you asking for repeated passwords so
this is all about using the same
password in on-premises and in the cloud
and this has got nothing to do with not
prompting the user to re-enter the
password all right so that's same
password is different from not prompting
the user to re-enter the password they
are two different scenarios so that is
also out of the equation and the last
one is configure ad sync to use single
sign-on that's the right one so when we
configure the ad to use a single sign-on
then it's going it's not going to ask
for the username and password every time
we access an application because we have
logged in and that login is going to
stay active for like 24 hours or so
depending on how you configure it and
within that time you can access a lot of
other applications and it's not going to
ask for the username and password
because you already have a single signed
on and you have signed in using the
right credentials let's look at this one
you need to ensure that virtual machines
remain available while migrating to
Azure what would be the appropriate
service to use right let's look at the
options traffic manager traffic manager
is is literally and DNS service and then
let's look at the other one update
domains it again has to do with traffic
manager updating the URL so the traffic
manager gets updated and then starts
sending requests to that particular URL
it's going to take some down time
because when we update the URL they will
have to be populated to all different
places and it takes time so within that
time any user trying to access it's
going to fail and then we have express
route and cloud services express route
could be the in fact it's the right
answer because express route it's an
extension of our on-premises and Cloud
environment and in this question it
really comes out from a customer who's
having an hybrid environment so they
have applications running in
non-premises they have applications
running in the cloud and they want to
have a way to migrate applications from
on-premises to the cloud in other words
kind of do a cut over between
on-premises and the cloud and this
express route is a service that connect
between on-premises and the cloud so
when you do the cutover the traffic is
now sent to the cloud instead of being
handled in on-premises in fact the
services and the application is getting
down are getting shut down in
on-premises so the request will come in
the same pattern instead of there being
handled in on-premises they are now
routed to the cloud using express route
and the API calls get addressed or the
the queries gets answered in the cloud
through the express route service look
at this question you are an
administrator for a website called Web
game and you are required to validate
and deploy changes made to your website
by your development team with minimum
downtime so the real question is how do
you validate the deployment changes
let's made by the development team let's
look at the options create a new linked
resource create a staging environment
for the site enable remote debugging on
the website and then create a new
website well why would you want to
create a new website just to validate
the changes and doing a remote debugging
is not going to help because debugging
only captures logs of the changes
happening it does not do anything with
validating the changes create a staging
environment could be or is the right
answer because when we have staging
environments anything that we run on
production can be run on staging
environment and any failures that would
happen in production if we simply run it
in production can be captured when we
run the application in the staging
environment so that way staging
environment is a very helpful and useful
service and that way I can catch any
errors in other words I can validate the
changes that were done by my development
team before I'm move it to production
and that reduces the downtime in the
production environment look at this one
last question that we have for you it's
our standard tier application is used
across the world and uses Azure website
standard tier it uses large amount of
image files so you can get it this could
be an e-commerce website which has a lot
of pictures in it and this is causing
the application to load slow how can we
handle this situation let's look at the
options given configure blob storage
with custom domain well this application
has pictures but the pictures only the
pictures is not all that the application
has all right so configuring blob
storage might not help this could be an
very interactive website and that can't
be run from blob storage let's look at
the other options configure Azure
website Auto scaling to increase
instances at high loads now it's the
picture that's causing issues for the
website it's not the CPU or it's not the
memory unavailable memory not enough
that is causing the application to be
slow so we need to identify what's
causing the application to be slow so
it's not the CPU it's not the memory so
configure Azure for auto scaling is not
going to help and then what are the
other options let's see configure Azure
CDN to cache all responses from the
applications web endpoint a CDN could be
the right answer but look at that it
says a CDN to cache all responses from
the applications web endpoint CDN is not
designed for that though it can do it
that's not the best way to use CDN to
capture all responses from the
applications web endpoint the proper
design for CDN would be to Cache the
frequently used ones in other words cash
the static content which are photos
videos logos and pictures and a lot more
and a static content that never changes
let's look at the last option configure
Azure CDN to Cache site images and
content stored in Azure blob storage
absolutely correct so here we will have
to reduce design the application to
store the pictures high quality lazy
loading or slow loading pictures because
of the high quality and the bigger size
so store them in CDN and then the
content let it be stored in Azure blob
storage that's the right way of
Designing the application and if we do
it this application is going to run
faster or the application is going to
respond faster to the users and with
that we have come to the end of this
