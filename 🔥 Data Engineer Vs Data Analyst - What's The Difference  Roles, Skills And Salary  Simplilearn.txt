in this exciting world of data data
engineers and data analysts are the
superheroes behind the scenes they
unlock the secrets hidden in heaps of
information that companies gather every
day both are vital to company's success
but they have distinct skill sets
responsibilities and contributions
in this video on data engineer versus
data analyst we'll explore the key
aspects of these two roles which
includes their definitions
skills required roles responsibilities
salaries and companies that hire them
now but before we begin let me ask you a
quick question
so what is the primary role of a data
engineer in the realm of data driven
decision making within an organization
option A is analyzing and interpreting
data to draw valuable insights option b
is designing and building data pipelines
and systems options is creating data
visualization and reports for
stakeholders option D is conducting
statistical analysis to predict future
Trends now you can pause this video and
answer in the comment section below
alright now let's understand who is a
data engineer
so a data engineer is a professional
responsible for Designing building and
maintaining the infrastructure that
enables data storage retrieval and
processing they focus on creating robust
data pipelines data warehouses and
databases ensuring that data is easily
accessible reliable and available for
analysis by data analysts and other
stakeholders data Engineers are
proficient in various programming
languages database systems and Big Data
Technologies so this was about the data
engineering now let's understand who is
a data analyst
so a data analyst is the one who
analyzes and interprets complex data
sets to uncover insights patterns and
Trends they utilize various statistical
and analytical techniques to derive
meaningful conclusions and support
decision making process data analysts
are skilled in data visualization tools
to present their findings effectively
alright so this was about data analyst
now let's have a look at the skills of a
data engineer first
all right now moving on to the skills of
a data engineer
so first is programming Proficiency in
programming languages like python Java

optimally for analysis so this was
another skill now moving on to the next
skill that is data integration so the
ability to gather data from different
sources cleanse transform and load it
into the data warehouses or data leaks
is another skill of our data engineer
next is ETL that is extract transform
load tools
so experience with ETL tools like Apache
nifi tail end Informatica for automating
