without without further Ado let's get
started so first head over to the Wix
website and log into your account so you
can press get started and either you can
sign up with Google press continue so
first they will ask you a few questions
like who are you creating a website for
so just answer those and press continue
so here I'm creating for myself so
initially Wix will first ask you if you
want to use AI to help set up your
website but today we are planning to do
everything manually so let's select
setup without chat and now the ask
questions about what type of website you
want to create so I want to create an
online clothing store so let's type that
in yeah and then you can type the name
of your business let's just give XYZ
collections for now XYZ Fashions or
collections Let It Be
Collections and then they will ask what
your goal is like is it to sell products
get booked online is it to host an event
so as as as an online store it's to sell
products
again they will ask many questions so
just you know answer those okay
finish so this is basically a dashboard
so we'll discuss about this later so now
first our goal is to find a template to
pick a suitable template for our website
so let's go to design site and again
here you have two options you can either
generate a design with AI or you can
customize a template so for now we are
customizing a template so let's choose
pick a template see as you can see there
are variety of templates available so
scroll through and select one that
matches your brand
style so let's see so let's choose this
template let's go to
edit so you should choose a template
that not only looks good but it should
also fit the structure you need for your
online store so keep that in mind so now
we are in the Wix editor the main
interface where you will customize your
website so as you can see here on the
left side you have the main menu which
lets you manage your site's design add
elements and configure settings now at
the top you'll find the toolbar for
quick access like saving your design and
previewing it so the first thing you
have to do is you have to go through the
website you know you must familiarize
yourself with the interface so that it
will make the editing process much
smoother and easier for you so that's
the first thing you have to do just get
familiar with the website options so now
let's get into designing so as you can
see this is the template and the
template is divided into sections right
so here you have the header section here
you have the main body section here you
have the gallery section and then you
have the footer so each section is fully
customizable okay you even though this
is a template you can change each and
everything of it like the images you
know the text everything so this allows
you to make the site of your own so
let's start with the header first let's
just zoom in a bit yeah
so here you can go to Quick edit to edit
the header so here you can change the
background color adjust the layout you
can adjust the layout and you can edit
the menu so let's just check how we can
edit you can even select images like
these kind of images for the background
or you can keep it plain according to
your wish and according to your
creativity basically okay this so this
is how you can change colors of the
header now you'll also want to manage
your site pages so what you can do is
you can go to page menu page and menu
from the left hand menu to add delete or
reorder pages okay so currently in this
template this is the order of the
template so first we have the homepage
then we have new collections then we
have collections for women men right so
if you want you can reorder like suppose
if you want the men's section before
women section what you can do is you can
just you know slide it you can just drag
it this is all drag and drop method you
can just drag it it's that easy it's
that simple okay and even if you want
you can add I items also so for example
basically you try to keep your menu
simple but again you must have like some
of the must have categories are shop
about us and contact right so here we
have shop here we have about us but at
you can see there's no contact so what
you can do is if you want to add contact
just add menu item you can create a new
page or you can create a new section you
know you can create Dynamic pages so
right now I want to create a section now
they'll ask what do you want to link to
so is it a web address is it a document
so right now we want like if you want
email for like contact you need email
and phone number right so here you can
write in your email here you can write
in your phone number and press done now
next let's add your sto's logo so as you
know logo is very important for a brand
so now let's see how you can upload your
logo so you can delete this section if
you don't want just does um just a
second yeah press
delete now let's add elements here you
can search like here a search bar you
can search logo custom logo yeah so
either you can upload your own logo like
if you have created a logo already you
can upload the images from your file or
else which also helps us to create logos
so let's add the logo first adjust it
let's see if the logo is here just a
second yes now let's go to logo design
design my logo okay now again they will
ask you questions about your business so
this is an
online clothing store yes next now they
will just ask you what vibe do you want
for your logo you know what it wants to
repesent should it be modern should it
be fun should it be creative so I want
it to be creative basically and it
should be a fresh one yeah you can
choose multiple options give next and
again they'll ask you what text you want
in your logo so basically I I just want
XYZ collection so I just want XYZ so
let's type that in and then you you can
give your tagline if you want to or else
if you don't want to you can skip this
part now let's see what Wick suggests
the logos Wick suggests so these are the
logos that big suggests so you can you
know select whichever appeals to you
okay for example right now we'll just
select
this let's go to customize now here
again even though they have suggested
you a logo you can again you know work
on it and make it better you can change
the color if you didn't like the color
you can change the color if you want to
you can add text to this if you want to
okay you can add shapes you can add
symbols right and even you can upload
images like inside this if you want more
images you can upload images from your
file also so for now let's just so for
now let's just save this okay yes our
logo is created of course you can make
it much better yeah so I've just told
you you can make much better logo with
this like I have just showed you the
options so go through it use your
creativity and make a better logo
because logo is very important like a
well-designed logo is key to your brand
identity so you must ensure that it's
clear and looks great on all devices now
let's customize the hero section
background so here you can again go to
Quick edit you can change the background
color I prefer to keep it plain color
which is better so let's keep it black
now this area must be very well edited
because this is a great place to
Showcase your latest products or
promotions so make sure that you use
high quality images that align with your
Brand's Aesthetics to make a strong
first impression so you can change these
images for that you can go to manage
media so these are the images from the
template so what you can do is you can
actually delete it you know you can
select this particular image you can
delete it right so accordingly you can
delete these images and you can add a
new image from media so if you go to add
media you can you know add the your
product images from your site
you can go to upload media and from your
file or you can drag and drop from your
computer so that's how you upload your
image to the website right now it's time
to edit the text so click on the text
box we'll just see an example click on
the text box choose edit text and we can
just update it with something like you
know summer collection out
now
[Music]
some collection out now you can res it
to bring it to a single line yeah now
you can change the font sorry we had to
select it I think this is cool and again
you can make it bold you can make it
italics you can underline it you can
change the color okay let's keep it
let's keep it red so this is how you
edit the text accordingly you can edit
texts so your text should be cleared and
consign so be careful with the you know
text color you choose the text font you
choose and also the size of the text you
choose because your text will always
contain a strong call to action so it
must really appeal and also you know
draw the attention of the customers
going through your website so please
keep that in mind so now let's add new
sections to the homepage so go to add
section from the left menu and choose
from options like product Gallery
testimonials or newsletter sign up so
here let's just go to testimonials for
example now you can just drag and drop
so these are the templates you can
choose from a drag and drop so you can
just drag and drop it I want it at the
end just before the fotter yeah so it's
done now again as I have already told
you how to you know change the images
and also work on the text you can use
those and customize your testimonial
section so now let's customize the page
footer so here you can add your stores
contact information social media links
and important legal links like terms of
services and privacy policy so you must
make sure your Futo contains all the
essential links and information
customers might need including return
policies and customer service details
also so now let's see how to add contact
form so customer interaction is crucial
so let's add a contact form for that you
have to go to elements add elements you
can select contact form you can just
search
here contact strips and again you can
drag it to your choosen section so
customize the fields according to your
needs such as name email and message so
adding a contact form ensures that
customers you know can easily reach to
you with questions or feedback so
consider setting up an automatic
response to acknowledge inquiries
promptly so this is how you can edit
your website in Wix website now before
going live so like now our next step is
going live so before going live you'll
want to connect a custom domain to your
site right so for that you can go to
settings and select connect domain so
you can either purchase a new domain
through Wix or connect one you already
have so having a custom domain adds
professionalism and make it easier for
customers to find you online right so
while choosing a domain choose a domain
name that reflects your brand and which
is easy to remember mostly award using
numbers of hyph if possible so after
connecting your domain you'll be taken
to the vix dashboard so this is your
command center where you can manage
orders track inventory and you can also
access analytics so from here you can
also update your site manage SEO and
settings and send marketing emails so
you must regularly check your dashboard
to stay on top of orders and site
performance so you can use the Analytics
tool to refine your marketing strategies
so before we publish it's essential to
preview your website right so click
preview button which is at the top right

that everything is working perfectly
from navigation links to the checkout
