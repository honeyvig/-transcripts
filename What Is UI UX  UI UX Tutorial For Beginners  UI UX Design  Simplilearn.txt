so so without any further Ado let's get
started so let's understand better what
uiux is and what's the difference
between the two UI ux aims at improving
the user experience and usability of a
product UI or user interface refers to
the graphical layout of an application
or website it includes elements like
buttons menus icons and visual design
aspects UI design focuses on creating an
intuitive aesthetically pleasing
interface that users can interact with
effectively ux or user experience on the
other hand encompasses the entire user
journey within the application or
website it involves understanding user
Behavior conducting usability testing
and optimizing the overall flow and
functionality to enhance user
satisfaction ux design aims to ensure
that the product meets the user needs
and provides a seamless and enjoyable
experience in technical terms UI is
concerned with the presentation layer
while ux delves into the interaction
design information architecture and
usability aspects of the product both UI
and ux work together to create a
cohesive and user centered digital
experience now you might be wondering
what are the skills you need to get into
this field is a degree required and if
not where should you study the skills
from a lot of confusions so let's sort
that out first firstly you need soft
skills like communication skills to
communicate your ideas in the group
collaborative skills learn to work with
different people and a team develop
presentation and storytelling skills and
product thinking skills know what will
make your product successful now let's
move on to the mus have technical skills
you must know how and when to do user
research know what method to execute and
document your research findings you must
learn to analyze data and know to
provide Solutions learn how to map user
flows to explain the flow of the product
learn design tools like figma be
familiar with wi Framing and prototyping
now wireframes are simplified outlines
of a design focusing on structure and
layout without incorporating visual
design elements prototypes are
interactive models that simulate user
interactions providing a hands-on
experience to test usability and
functionality before the final
implementation learn to properly
Implement visual designs like color
typography contrast Etc okay now let's
let move on to the different research
techniques of uiux design user research
is basically collecting information from
the users and knowing their needs or
expectations now there are two types of
researches which are quantitative
research and qualitative research
quantitative research involves
collecting and analyzing numerical data
to identify patterns predict outcomes
and generalize findings about a target
audience or topic methods like
quantitative usability testing web
analysis itics card sorting and surveys
help gather data on user behavior and
attitudes now qualitative research on
the other hand focuses on capturing
subjective insights into users
experience to understand their
underlying reasons motivations and
behaviors common methods include user
interviews diary studies focus groups
and usability tests so I hope you got an
idea about what all you should cover in
uiux design at a beginner level now
let's move on to how would you need to
apply these skills or what would be the
tasks expected from you once you are
into your job your tasks include
conducting user research activities like
interviews surveys and usability testing
to understand user needs you'll create
VI frames and simple prototypes to show
design ideas clearly you'll also help
choose colors fonts and icons for
interfaces and design interactive
elements like buttons and menus to make
them easy to use you'll observe users
during testing sessions to get the
feedback for improving designs
collaborating with other teams you'll
ensure design goals match business needs
and Technical requirements now comes the
most worried part will AI take away your
jobs while AI can help with some parts
of UI ux design like making repetitive
tasks easier or suggesting design ideas
it won't take over the whole job
designing is about understanding
people's feelings and emotions and AI is
in greated it plus humans bring
creativity and problems solving skills
that AI can't match so while AI might be
a useful tool for designers it won't
replace them because humans have a
special touch that machines just can't
replicate now as a beginner we are sure
you will always be confused about which
tool I should learn and get started with
there are numerous tools available but
for beginners in uiux design a
userfriendly and versatile tool like
figma is often recommended figma is a
