hey everyone welcome to Simply learn in
this video we will explore API security
so let's talk about a real world example
remember Facebook and the Cambridge
analytica Scandal Facebook had apis that
allowed thirdparty apps to access user
data and these apis weren't properly
secured so Cambridge analytica managed
to Hardware data from millions of users
without their consent this breach of
trust led to a mive public outcry and
Regulatory scrutiny in this video we
will look at common threats like
injection attacks and broken logs that
is authentication and share practical
tips to keep your apis secure so grab
your favorite treat sit back and let's
dive into the world of API security
together craving a career upgrade

description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back so guys before commencing let's
have a quick in for for you if you are
an aspiring cyber security professional
looking for online training and
certification from the best universities
and in collaboration with leading
experts to enhance your credibility then
search no more simply learn postgraduate
program in cyber security from MIT
University in collaboration with EC
Council should be a right choice for
more details you can use the link in the
description box and pin comment so let's
get started and the first thing we have
on the list is what is an API so all
right let's break it down imagine you
are at a restaurant you are hungry and
ready to order some food you tell the
waiter what you want and the waiter
takes the order to the kitchen the chef
in the kitchen Cooks up your meal and
hands it back to the waiter who brings
it to your table in this scenario the
waiter is like an API application
programming interface the API takes your
request tells the server in this case
that is the kitchen what you need and
then brings back the response in Tech
terms an API allows different software
systems to communicate and share data
for example when you use an app on your
phone to check the weather that app uses
an API to request weather data from a
remote server the server sends back the
weather information and the app displays
it for you so this is how API works now
we see why is API security important
think about your house you lock your
door doors and windows to keep Intruders
out right the same goes for apis they
need to be secured to prevent
unauthorized access if someone breaks
into your house they can steal your
valuables similarly if someone gains
unauthorized access to your API they can
steal sensitive data or even take
control of your system take the Facebook
Cambridge analytical Scandal for example
insecure apis allowed the harvesting of
personal data from millions of users
without their consent this shows how
crucial it is to secure apis to protect
user data and maintain trust so this was
about why API security is important now
moving to Common API security threats
and the number one on the list is
injection attacks so now that we have
understand why securing API is essential
let's dive into some common threats
first up is injection attack imagine you
give a recipe to a chef but someone
sneaks in and add harmful ingredients
without you knowing that's an injection
Attack One common type is SQL injection
where an attacker inserts malicious code
into an API request for example if a
user enters colon drop table users colon
hyphen iph instead of their username and
the API doesn't validates this input the
database might execute it and delete
import and data so to prevent this
always validate and sanitize user inputs
now move to the next that is broken
authentication so let's talk about
broken authentication so think of
authentication as the lock on your front
door if your lock is weak or easy to
pick anyone can walk in broken
authentication means your API
authentication mechanisms aren't strong
enough making it easy for attackers to
pretend to be legitimate users for
instance if an API uses predictable
tokens hackers can guess them and gain
unauthorized access use strong
unpredictable tokens and Implement
multiactor authentication to strengthen
security so now we move to number third
that is sensitive data Expos exposure so
let's consider sensitive data exposure
imagine sending a postcard with all your
bank details written on it anyone who
intercepts it can read your information
similarly if your API sends data without
proper encryption anyone who intercepts
it can see the data for example if an
API transmits passwords in plain text
it's like handing over your secrets on a
silver plate always use https to encrypt
data in transit and encrypt sensitive
data at rest so moving to the next that
is State limiting and Doos attacks so
another threat to be aware of is DDOS
attacks picture a popular store on Black
Friday sale with thousands of customers
flooding in all at once the staff can't
keep up and the store gets overwhelmed
that's a Doos that is distributed denial
of service attack attackers flood your
API with so many requests that it
crashes or becomes unresponsive
implementing rate limiting like allowing
only a certain number of request per
minute can help manage the traffic and
prevent such attacks now move to the
next that is man in the middle attacks
so imagine having a private conversation
but someone is secretly listening and
can even alter your words that's a man
in the middle attack if an attacker
intercepts the communication between
your API and the client they can read or
modify the data being transmitted so
using https or TLS ensures that the data
is encrypted making it much harder for
attackers to e drop or tamper with the
information next on the list list is API
spoofing so let's discuss about it so
think of API spoofing as someone setting
up a fake ATM machine it looks real but
it's actually stealing your card
information attackers create fake apis
to trick users into providing sensitive
data always verify API end points and
use secure authentication methods to
ensure you are interacting with
legitimate apis now we'll see the best
practices for securing apis so the
number one on the list is authentication
and authorization so we have looked at
some common threats now we'll dive into
the best practices for securing up and
the first we look up is authentication
and authorization so think of
authorization 2.0 as a special access
pass that only authorized users can get
it ensures that only users with the
right pass can access the data open ID
connect adds an extra layer by verifying
the users's identity comparing API keys
to basic passwords that is tokens just
like J WTS are more secure because they
include user specific data and have an
expiration time now move to the next
best practice that is encryption so
always use https which is like sending
loged packages that only recipent can
open it ensures that the data being
transmitted is encrypted and secure
additionally encrypt sensitive data at
rest just like storing valuables in a
safe so it protects it from unauthorized
access next is input validation so let's
consider input validation and you should
always use clean user inputs to prevent
malicious data from sneaking in for
instance if a user enters a script tag
that is script and sanitize it to
prevent xss that is cross site scripting
attacks so using parameterized queries
is like using prepared ingredients in
cooking ensuring that the input is safe
and expected now moving to the next that
is rate limiting and throttling so
moving on to rate limiting and
throttling that limits the number of
requests a user can make it's like
settling a limit on how many times
someone can knock on your door tools
like Cloud Fair can help filter out
malicious traffic and keep your API
running smoothly protecting against DDOS
attacks now move to the next one that is
logging and monitoring so keep a record
of all AP request to support unusual
activity it's like having a CCTV camera
to monitor who's coming and going tools
like promus and graph can help you
monitor API health and alert you to
potential issues the next next we have
is API Gateway and security so API
gateways act as bouncers controlling
access and adding security features like
rate limiting and IP whistling look for
features like request validation Thro
link and data encryption to enhance
security so these were all the best
practices for securing apis now we'll
see tools and Technologies so the number
one is Postman that's a grade for
testing apis and ensuring they handle
request properly without exposing
vulnerabilities the next is oap zap and
BB suit they are like ethical hackers
simulating attacks to identify security
flows so now let's look at API
management platforms for API management
platforms like apig AWS API Gateway and
Azure API management that offer buil-in
security features making it easier to
manage and secure your apis now we'll
see some real world case studies so the
number one notable API breaches case
study is the Facebook Cambridge
analytica Scandal that is a laring
example where insecure apis led to
massive data misuse it's a reminder of
why API security is crucial similarly in
20121 T-Mobile suffered a breach where
attackers accessed customer data through
insecure apis highlighting the
importance of robust security practices
and then we have some successful API
security implementations that is Google
employees strict authentication rate
limiting and encryption practices
setting a standard for secure API usage
so stripe uses strong encryption and
secure authentication methods ensuring
that sensitive financial data is well
protected so with that guys we have come
