1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,610
so below there and welcome to another

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,100
tutorial my name is Tamara Bakshi and

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,440
today I'm joined by mark stir event so

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,730
thank you very much mark for joining

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,269
today

6
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:10,139
would you like to quickly introduce

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,480
yourself sure I work in developer

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,509
advocacy in IBM specifically I work on a

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,369
lot of code patterns so we're creating

10
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,600
code patterns with Watson and AI and

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,189
we're making the public on github so

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,750
that you can follow the code pattern and

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,410
try them out

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,180
that's great thank you very much for

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,519
joining in today but today specifically

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,800
we're talking about the Watson assistant

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,719
and how you can tie it in with the

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,360
Google assistant and Amazon the lexo

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,800
into example use cases

20
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,110
first of all car rentals and how you can

21
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,910
actually rent out car leasing chatbots

22
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,230
and they're not going to be talking

23
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,940
about checking the weather through

24
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,980
natural language in fact you may

25
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,930
remember I already have a video on the

26
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,570
Amazon Alexa and tiny then would ask 10

27
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,610
Meg and in fact helping me out with that

28
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,430
project was Mark servant that guy wasn't

29
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,070
able to find out how exactly to have

30
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,350
Alexa output its intense or whatever you

31
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,449
say to Watson system because that

32
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,159
requires a little more grounds thank you

33
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,439
very much for that Marc but now let's

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,650
get into the actual use cases okay so

35
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,270
tell us a little bit about what kinds of

36
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,350
applications we're gonna be building

37
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,200
today okay so the basic applications and

38
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,460
then they're meant for demo they're

39
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,650
fairly simple but the main thing we

40
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,330
wanted to do with both of these is show

41
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,259
you how you can use an Alexa or a Google

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,850
assistant front-end which is fairly

43
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,939
popular and available a lot of devices

44
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:31,829
but instead of trying to build that

45
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,200
conversation and those platforms take

46
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,299
advantage of Watson wants an assistant

47
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,369
and build a conversation a dialogue

48
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,310
there so what we have is we have ways of

49
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,070
getting basic text from the conversation

50
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,240
when you're speaking to these other

51
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,520
devices it gets into Watson and Watson

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,009
controls the reply and the response in

53
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,439
the back and forth so first we'll use

54
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,799
slots to gather information so what kind

55
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,450
of car do you want what color car all

56
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,250
these slots need to be filled before you

57
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,070
satisfy that and later we'll give an

58
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,950
example of digressions because

59
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,899
we did with the with the Google

60
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,690
assistant example the rental cars is as

61
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,610
you're talking to a retail agent and

62
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,069
being prompted maybe what kind of car do

63
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,709
you want a lot of people will ask

64
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,590
questions typical ones are are you a

65
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,860
robot you know guys talk to your manager

66
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,500
or I'm just I'm really upset right now

67
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,750
and you want to be able to handle those

68
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,060
and we don't have examples where we're

69
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,920
actually calling out to another person

70
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,989
but we have example if I could handle

71
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,790
the dialog you'd have to be able to

72
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,310
reply to the digression and still jump

73
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,720
right back to what kind of car do you

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,269
want a very powerful feature and it's a

75
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,849
very surprisingly natural conversation

76
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,030
that you can have with a fairly simple

77
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,459
chat bot that's great mark now I mean as

78
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:50,720
you mentioned a lot of people are gonna

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
do things like chit chat with a bot

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,560
after you Bank in Australia I applied

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,049
Watson to their mortgage or loan

82
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:00,200
applications the second most asked

83
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,360
question on that chat bot was what's

84
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,280
your favorite color and the first most

85
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,389
asked question was will you marry me so

86
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,260
because you can tell a lot of people

87
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,239
will use a job often when it's intended

88
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,400
to work before before but even more

89
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,810
gonna use it the things that it wasn't

90
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,850
intended for I'm trying to stump it

91
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,200
because it's a robot but that's why

92
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,359
Watson exists and now using Watson

93
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,220
assistant with other platforms like the

94
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,440
Google assistant ends on Alexa Sirikit

95
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,090
so anymore that you could use it with

96
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,739
you're able to create one unified

97
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,630
experience in chat BOTS across all

98
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,670
platforms that having to rebuild it for

99
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,400
every individual library or every

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,319
individual platform and then you can use

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,940
really powerful tools that Watson

102
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,400
assistant provides in order to build

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,019
more natural conversations like that

104
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,609
Russians going from one topic to another

105
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,799
and then slots trying to get the correct

106
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,540
information and no matter how many

107
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,910
messages you provide so now that let's

108
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,349
talk a little bit about how exactly this

109
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:52,970
application is gonna flow so what could

110
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,040
you have to quickly walk us through say

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,440
the car rental use case okay so the car

112
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,000
rental use case is using Google

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,030
assistant so we start over here with

114
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,410
Google assistant

115
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,040
we care how abbreviate some of these

116
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,270
things on video so it's calling out so

117
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,570
we're gonna have an HTTP endpoint

118
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,340
calling out and it's got JSON in there

119
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,500
with enough information basically all we

120
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,900
want is the text so Google assistant

121
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,820
will handle the voice and we're going to

122
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,350
get a string of text along with some

123
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,310
other information but that's the request

124
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,450
so it's coming into IBM cloud which

125
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,810
we're using to host an ojs server so

126
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,970
that's where we have the endpoint so IBM

127
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,800
cloud takes care of the hosting it gives

128
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,720
us the endpoint we've got code that's

129
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,240
getting this JSON and I've got the text

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,220
and I could call out to Watson so Watson

131
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:01,320
services our service also hosted on the

132
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,390
cloud and so that's where we have

133
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,400
workspaces for different conversations

134
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,830
so the the Weather Channel one was one

135
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,020
convert one workspace the rental car

136
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,910
conversation was another workspace so I

137
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,830
have those hosted and they have the

138
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,750
node.js server setup so that it's going

139
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,070
to communicate with Watson malfini Alexa

140
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,360
one was built a little bit differently

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,190
and we switched to another color I guess

142
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:32,460
so I need another marker more than

143
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,110
another color so if we go to the Alexa

144
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,960
it's the same model we set it up so that

145
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,550
we're basically just getting all the

146
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,430
words that were said in in text and it's

147
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,100
going to also call our HTTP we're going

148
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,229
to have that text in a JSON structure

149
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,890
but there we use cloud functions so IBM

150
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,820
cloud functions

151
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,090
that's hosting our code so that was

152
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,310
JavaScript but again once we get that

153
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,030
request we just call out using an SDK -

154
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,530
call out - what's an assistant and get

155
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,420
their reply now the amount of code you

156
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,790
need to call out is very little and once

157
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,320
you get the reply from once and you have

158
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,360
the answer in both cases you're just

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,860
building a little bit of JSON in a

160
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,380
specific format that Google will

161
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,130
understand or Alexa will understand the

162
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,930
Alexa one does have one other bit the

163
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,210
conversation is the same but if it comes

164
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,610
back and says to a weather lookup then

165
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,320
it has some code to call up to the

166
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,600
weather game service I should mention

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,800
that weather weather channel data

168
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,120
weather channel data so even though

169
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,940
that's a fairly simple test example that

170
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,930
you can use you give it a location it'll

171
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,310
give you the real weather report from

172
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,160
the Weather Channel okay thank you for

173
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,410
walking us through that now let's take a

174
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,270
look at a quick demo how you can apply

175
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,280
this to the Google assistant and that

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,990
let's get into how this actually works

177
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,970
featuring of course service computing

178
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,440
the weather channel of course kind that

179
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,110
really accurate weather day of my VM and

180
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,820
of course using nodejs along with the

181
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,980
Watson assistant in order to host these

182
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,860
natural conversations let's take a look

183
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,540
hey Google talked to Watson

184
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,150
all right getting the test version of

185
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,870
Watson I can reserve a rental car for

186
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,259
you what day do you need a car I need it

187
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,220
tomorrow what time on Thursday do you

188
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,190
want the car to be ready sometime around

189
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,130
noon

190
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,110
what type of car would you like and like

191
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,370
an economy car what color economy car do

192
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,690
you want why don't you make that a car

193
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,590
that's really fast what color sports car

194
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,080
do you want definitely a red sports car

195
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:59,360
okay please confirm you want a red

196
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
sports car on the 16th of August 2018 at

197
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,530
12 p.m. is that correct that's correct

198
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,620
great unfortunately I don't really have

199
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,840
any cars this is a demo chat

200
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,060
let's start over what date do you need a

201
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,890
car I'd like a blue mid-sized car

202
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:33,170
Thursday at midnight what time on

203
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,740
Thursday do you want the car to be ready

204
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,770
how about 12 a.m. ok please confirm you

205
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,080
want a blue midsize car on the 16th of

206
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,760
August 2018 at 12 a.m. is that correct

207
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,760
ok

208
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,490
unfortunately I don't really have any

209
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,600
cars this is a demo chat okay so we'll

210
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,250
show you where the code patterns live so

211
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,350
you can use them and you'll try them out

212
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,330
on your own so we have the code here and

213
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,580
all the steps you need to run it here at

214
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,520
github.com slash IBM we have Alexis

215
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,880
skill Watson conversation this is the

216
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,290
one word we've hooked up a Watson

217
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,040
workspace with an Alexis skill and if

218
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,600
you look at the readme you'll see what

219
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,330
we provide with code patterns a lot of

220
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,100
information about what we're doing and

221
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,960
the exact steps you need to run it so

222
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,580
there'll always be an architectural

223
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,650
picture that shows you what I tried to

224
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,930
draw on the board you'll see the

225
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,640
components here we're using IBM cloud

226
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,740
functions we're using red is to store

227
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,390
context and we're calling out to Weather

228
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,820
Channel in addition of course to Watson

229
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,190
assistant but if you look at the readme

230
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,620
you'll see that we have an example video

231
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,990
and we have detailed steps so you can

232
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,450
run this one locally or on the cloud

233
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,180
well this one we run it locally but we

234
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,790
also use IBM cloud functions and we have

235
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,470
a very similar thing for the Watson

236
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,630
Google assistant so this one's at

237
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,960
github.com slash IBM slash Watson Google

238
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,380
assistant again with dashes and the

239
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,089
readme here you'll see a very similar

240
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:11,460
format you'll see the architecture you

241
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,920
talk to Google it talks to no js' and

242
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,150
talks to Watson assistant and the steps

243
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,070
here since this one is running right on

244
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,950
the cloud we just have a deployed IBM

245
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,470
cloud button so you can do that and

246
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,510
it'll deploy your node.js server it'll

247
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,940
spin up your Watson assistant service

248
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,400
with your workspace so very easy to get

249
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,320
this one up and running but it's also

250
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,790
documented so you have all the steps you

251
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,830
need so one that fires up you'll get a

252
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,959
Watson assistant service running an IBM

253
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,050
cloud and it will upload a workspace so

254
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,040
here we uploaded a workspace for the

255
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,279
rent-a-car conversation and if we take a

256
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,450
look at this you'll see that there are a

257
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,450
lot of intense and I didn't have to put

258
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,910
in most of these I simply use the

259
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,600
existing content catalog we have some

260
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,990
industry specific conversations and also

261
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,950
things like vodka

262
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,710
all general and customer care so for

263
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,280
rent renting a car I used a lot of the

264
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,110
bot control well I use a little of the

265
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,490
bot control to say confirm reject for

266
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,580
example and start over customer care for

267
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,660
things like when are your open and

268
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,040
general for things that people ask a lot

269
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,750
that I wouldn't have even thought about

270
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,700
but when I looked in there I saw

271
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,490
questions like are you human are you a

272
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,670
robot and I talked to your manager

273
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,920
you're stupid

274
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,870
all those things that can be thrown in a

275
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,480
chat box and you want to address and

276
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,300
since I have another sort of PowerPoint

277
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,280
of walks an assistant is that you don't

278
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,870
need to build absolutely everything from

279
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,940
scratch of course some very specifics to

280
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,500
your use case you will need to program

281
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,630
in of course or the content catalog

282
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,280
takes a bunch of things they are

283
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,500
repetitive or mundane and you won't need

284
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,330
to code those in because the intents and

285
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,160
entities are there for you you just need

286
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,810
to put it in the relevant dialogue for

287
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,830
them yeah

288
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,600
for example if you look at the intent so

289
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,230
like taking those three categories I

290
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,670
just added those to my workspace and

291
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,790
you'll see the list of intents I got so

292
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,250
a lot of bot control a lot of customer

293
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,370
care a lot of just general you know like

294
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,280
this human or bot question and if you

295
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,580
look at any one of these you'll see

296
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,410
let's see what's a very easy one just

297
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,470
approve response you could expect a yes

298
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,180
or no response in your chat bot and

299
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,200
that's a pretty weak chat bot but just

300
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,390
by using this one that came from the

301
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,170
catalogue it already had 21 examples you

302
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,820
know affirmative all right correct for

303
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,370
sure got it great plus it's being

304
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,870
trained so you don't have to

305
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,060
specifically say any one of these these

306
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,810
aren't keywords so you've gone from

307
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,910
expecting and yes or no if you're hard

308
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,480
coding it to 21 examples plus machine

309
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,250
learning to build on that and get

310
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,410
various variations of that it'll still

311
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,180
understand your attempt yeah so if you

312
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,000
scroll down like for example let's just

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,760
say the word absolutely isn't here if I

314
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,860
were to still say the word absolutely it

315
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,710
would understand

316
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,570
this is the intent I mean even though

317
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,860
the word absolutely wasn't in the

318
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,660
examples yes the reason it does that is

319
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,800
because of machine learning it

320
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,660
understands my Intendant understands

321
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,370
what I listen man ticks not the sin

322
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,810
tactics of what I'm trying to say right

323
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,700
and if I found out that it doesn't

324
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,600
understand

325
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,510
you betcha I'm for sure you can just add

326
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,340
the intent it'll train it immediately

327
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,250
perfect and you'll you'll very quickly

328
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:48,130
be able to handle that mmm-hmm so also

329
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,850
if we look down here so the general ones

330
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,090
are where it was interesting to see what

331
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,480
people might ask like the human or bot

332
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,790
and again you have a bunch of examples

333
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,180
so in my dialogue I didn't care to

334
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,010
address all of these all you really need

335
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,140
is someone's going to type something in

336
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,180
that more or less matches this intent

337
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,850
you understand what they're thinking you

338
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,260
don't need to know the details about

339
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,050
exactly what they asked but you're going

340
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,390
to reply with your answer for what you

341
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,730
do when someone's intent is to find out

342
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,280
whether you're a human or not mm-hmm so

343
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,810
this takes a lot of the work out of

344
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,300
trying to build that and a lot of the

345
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,920
the machine learning the training is

346
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,740
done now in addition to the content

347
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,950
catalog I did a simple reserve a car cop

348
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,800
you know intent that just says I need a

349
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,070
car rent a car but this dialogue is

350
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,110
fairly straightforward look its sole

351
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,480
purpose is to rent a car and deal with

352
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,040
these other digressions while it's

353
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,080
trying to rent you a car exactly so it's

354
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,820
going to go into reserve a car mode with

355
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,980
pretty much everything you do and that's

356
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,630
the dialogue so let's take a look at the

357
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,450
dialogue well those are the intents now

358
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,460
let's take a look at a dialogue yeah I

359
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,260
mean the dialogue is the part that does

360
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,820
this rental car thing I was talking

361
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,480
about and so if we look here I kept it

362
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,030
fairly simple there's a starting point

363
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,440
where I wanted to be able to clear the

364
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,780
context to make sure that it doesn't

365
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,240
remember what you reserved last time

366
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,280
there is a way to start over and start

367
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,130
fresh but it always jumps right to

368
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,710
reserve a car after it says hello I can

369
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,380
rent you a car so that first time that

370
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,030
intro you want is you want to say

371
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,920
something what it's going to do so it's

372
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,510
got the intro and it jumps to reserve a

373
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,300
car quit is important

374
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,430
be able to kind of end this especially

375
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,650
with Google assistant there's some

376
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,750
special checking in the code because if

377
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,490
you don't handle that that end responds

378
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,720
correctly you're gonna get an error in

379
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,990
Google assistant it it will be unhappy

380
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,720
if it says I want to quit and you reply

381
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,220
with something that's asking for more

382
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,860
information yes it's an error is which

383
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,250
is kind of annoying so that's handled

384
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,840
but all those intents that I consider

385
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,390
digressions I put these in a folder so I

386
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,430
can deal with them but I have the

387
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,590
ability to jump in and out of those and

388
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,690
let's take a look at the reserve at cart

389
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,710
one the specific one for observing car

390
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,990
it has slots so this is where you see

391
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,550
what it's checking for and all these are

392
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,740
considered slots when it wants to

393
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,500
reserve a car if it doesn't know what

394
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,210
day is going to ask you what day you

395
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,160
mean it if it doesn't know what time it

396
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,520
will ask you what time okay but if I say

397
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,430
I need a car tomorrow at noon it's gonna

398
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,580
fill in both those slots mm-hmm another

399
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,660
slot is car type car color and then at

400
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,460
the very end when this last ones in

401
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,610
focus that's going to do the confirm but

402
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,770
with these first four now if I say

403
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,020
tomorrow at noon I need a red midsize

404
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,240
car they're all filled in it'll go

405
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,640
straight yeah so yeah you're right

406
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,660
that's actually a very very powerful

407
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,370
feature of these slots it's like for

408
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,230
example last time I created a actual

409
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,030
Facebook live series on the Watson

410
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,410
system back on these we called Watson

411
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,300
conversation and there was someone who

412
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,550
asked during the Facebook slides well if

413
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm trying to order a pizza and I want a

414
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,630
thin crust pizza the medium size with

415
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,970
these toppings 22 specify them one by

416
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,410
one and listen to everything watch

417
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,810
enough to say no you don't now using

418
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,270
slots in literally one conversation

419
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,740
they're ready to put everything to get

420
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,200
to and in this simplified rental car

421
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,470
dialogue has two perfect examples for

422
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,770
that the date and time if I say what day

423
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,270
do you want a car and you say tomorrow

424
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,970
at noon yeah a lot of chat bus might

425
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,850
catch the tomorrow mm-hmm but and then

426
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,680
they're gonna say what time because

427
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,120
they're not looking for that time and

428
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,950
that's really annoying if you said

429
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,590
tomorrow at noon and in the bottom

430
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,630
as what time - exact and the other great

431
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,940
example is the car what I think what

432
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,760
type of car would you want a person

433
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,720
might say I want a red sports car yeah

434
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,760
some BOTS would then say what color red

435
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,179
that's right

436
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,150
which it's okay I guess

437
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,460
but it's really annoying and and people

438
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,440
want to have BOTS to interact like a

439
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,900
human and the entire point here is for

440
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,460
the chat BOTS to a Cuban or else I mean

441
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,350
why would you have a forum why would you

442
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,510
want to use a chat bot - for it to be

443
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,169
natural

444
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:22,450
yeah our point is like for example when

445
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,610
you call up one of those for example

446
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,399
helplines there and the robot is answer

447
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,049
anyway say tell me what your problem is

448
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,730
and they don't understand yes it's so

449
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,070
frustrating to keep telling them yeah

450
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,750
we're trying to get to the point that

451
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,490
you just want human on the line ASAP

452
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,799
what this is meant to do is connect with

453
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,809
humans be natural so you're not

454
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,970
frustrated talking to it and absolutely

455
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,500
repetitive questions you're going to get

456
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,000
frustrated yeah I know people are a

457
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,520
little concerned when chat BOTS start to

458
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,260
sound too human-like

459
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,929
like are these are they being tricky or

460
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:55,330
is it sneaky is there something wrong

461
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,250
with that I'm not sure but people are

462
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,570
definitely a little uncomfortable with

463
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,210
that but the great thing about talking

464
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,610
like a human is it changes the whole

465
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,220
interaction exactly the way people talk

466
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,330
to a very robot a form-based prompting

467
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,640
thing is very different than the way

468
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,220
someone naturally conversely like with

469
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,500
this time and date thing I don't need

470
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,510
just I don't want to just have prompts

471
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,210
where I have to say the word I can say

472
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,750
oh I guess I probably need it by 3

473
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,289
o'clock yeah um and it's should be good

474
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:30,880
enough to understand the important part

475
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,220
of that exactly without forcing me to

476
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,250
clean up the way I talk exactly - magic

477
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,049
form yeah a few years they're going to

478
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:39,970
use a search engine you try and take

479
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,320
whatever you're trying to search for and

480
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,409
move it in this weird weird syntactical

481
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,450
sort of template right we're for Google

482
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,270
or Bing or to find what you're looking

483
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,380
for because it's just doing simple

484
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,419
keyword matching nowadays because of

485
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:54,130
machine learning for example Watson

486
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,080
right if you take a look at how Watson

487
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,210
played Jeopardy seven years ago he was

488
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,410
able to understand the puns a riddle

489
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,360
we're playing jeopardy questions and now

490
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,890
you can take it back soon New York

491
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,660
technology implement your own chat BOTS

492
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,270
right now the thing I thought was fun

493
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,750
about this particular one we didn't demo

494
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,180
digressions did we not yet let's take a

495
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,370
look at that I forgot about that

496
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,280
so this chat BOTS going to be very

497
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
persistent about trying to fill these

498
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,030
slots and get your rental car but as we

499
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,830
mentioned with all the bot control and

500
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,330
the other things I put in this digress

501
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,250
and return folder I don't have the

502
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,530
ability to in the middle of this

503
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,550
collecting these slots digress and

504
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,750
there's a little thing here with the cut

505
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,210
under customize that allows you to turn

506
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,390
on and off digression whether you're

507
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,450
allowed to jump to a digression and

508
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,010
whether you only want to go to

509
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,290
digressions that return to the note so

510
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,690
here I'm going into these this

511
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,610
digression folder and they're all going

512
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,890
to return to my node so I can digress

513
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,540
but it's going to come back and say what

514
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,080
color mm-hmm and most of my digression

515
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,210
is that I that I was interested in are

516
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,390
in this folder there was one bot control

517
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,850
one here this starter start over that I

518
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,550
left separate and I made sure I could

519
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,200
not digress to that because at one point

520
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,680
I did get another loop oh so the easiest

521
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,690
fix for that was let's not allow that

522
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,940
one because of this little jump to yeah

523
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,530
but there would be a variety of ways of

524
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,960
fixing that but if I go into the folder

525
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,980
and I look into a digression so in the

526
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,770
middle of this date and time size color

527
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,060
if someone says are you a human that is

528
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,540
this digression so I just have a note in

529
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,810
the dialogue I put in one response that

530
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,170
says oh I clicked on the wrong one this

531
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,560
is the prefer me to a human agent asking

532
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,290
for your manager things like that would

533
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,720
be refer to a human and in this case I

534
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,420
just had my my robot say I'm sorry the

535
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,800
humans did not come actually watch so I

536
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,960
just have some simple examples like I

537
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,060
put one in there but of course you can

538
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,570
have and should have many responses so

539
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,430
that it doesn't sound so recorded that

540
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,920
the same response at any time the better

541
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,820
example for that

542
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,150
is the the the joke I did one bad joke

543
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,940
but if I really cared to do it I would

544
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,100
put multiple responses in there you get

545
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,540
a different one every time or at least

546
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,630
feel like it's different every time why

547
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,000
did the chicken rent a car to cross the

548
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,030
road seemed relevant I didn't have any

549
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:37,400
rental car jokes but in the middle of

550
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,470
conversation these questions can be

551
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,200
asked it will say this but since it's

552
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,420
jumping right back to the chatbot you

553
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,440
will get the joke

554
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,920
the hahaha in a robot voice to some

555
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,470
extent of this and then you'll get what

556
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,150
color car did you want because it's

557
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,060
still persistent about filling in those

558
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,560
slots and getting you to the end of that

559
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,670
part of the conversation the like refer

560
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,730
to your manager refer to agent those

561
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,130
types of things I think typically you

562
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,660
might have more code in here where you

563
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,030
would actually have some routing maybe

564
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,990
from your chat bot to human engines but

565
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,190
we certainly didn't get into that with

566
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:21,200
our example mm-hmm so I don't did you

567
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,910
want to see the digression example let's

568
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,620
take a look because I was going to show

569
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,290
you an example of Alexa but since we

570
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,420
missed that we can go with this first

571
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,440
yeah okay so I have the two different

572
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,530
developer environments here the console

573
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,960
for actions on Google and the Alexus

574
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,530
skills developer kit so I happen to be

575
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,600
here on the Google one and since we

576
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,300
didn't cover that earlier let's just try

577
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:53,090
this you can type or speak say talk to

578
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:58,400
Watson unfortunately I don't really have

579
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,040
any cost so this is a demo chat this was

580
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,380
completing what I did last time let me

581
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,250
see if I can get it to start over start

582
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:13,360
over what Dave you need a car

583
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,310
do you need do you know any jokes I know

584
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,620
one joke why did the chicken rent a car

585
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,090
to cross the road

586
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,710
ha ha ha what do you need a car there go

587
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,780
so that's a digression and it's still

588
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,250
going to say what day do you need a car

589
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:37,100
and if I say that was a stupid joke

590
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,450
there's an intent to D it was still

591
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:47,640
listen I know one joke sorry it caught

592
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,040
on the joke thing yes let me try this

593
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,530
again that was stupid

594
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,750
I'm sorry you feel that way I'm still

595
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,970
learning what there's an intent for

596
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,440
negative feedback yeah and there's an

597
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,480
intent for positive feedback this is a

598
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,820
very simple chat bot knows how to say

599
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,250
I'm sorry you feel that way but all that

600
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,380
knows how to do is go back to prompting

601
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,150
but at least it knows how to say I'm

602
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,910
sorry exactly so what it's doing is

603
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,220
you're saying you're providing it

604
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,110
negative reinforcement and saying all

605
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,360
right you know it it's responding to you

606
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,820
phone's going right back to one is a day

607
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,680
at the car and so you don't need to

608
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,930
manually say hey you know based off of

609
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,060
context where were you jump backs that

610
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,700
no you do all of that now with this new

611
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,470
directions future it can go over to

612
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,900
notes and come right back to gather in a

613
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,600
slot information and another very simple

614
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,360
one is that was great well thank you

615
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,430
it's my pleasure what day do you need a

616
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,800
car but you'll see what this is actually

617
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,510
showing here only by mistake you turn on

618
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:57,690
the microphone there's some gibberish in

619
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,520
there but it picked up on the bat was

620
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,260
great exactly so what's happening to use

621
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,700
a natural ended processing is

622
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,170
compensating for the fact that the

623
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,530
speech recognition that it was and and I

624
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,300
really feel like the interaction I

625
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,440
didn't spend a lot of time on these

626
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,250
digressions

627
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,840
but just a little bit like this thank

628
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,770
you is my pleasure

629
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,050
what did you need a car and the I'm

630
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,480
sorry you feel that way yeah so much

631
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,190
more natural than when it originally

632
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,370
would just keep prompting the actually

633
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,740
the Alexa one has that example

634
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,720
doesn't have digressions it has weather

635
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,640
yes and it will keep prompting for

636
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,650
location over and over and over yes and

637
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,800
it seems a bit rude this is much more

638
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,770
easy to work with yes I see so we might

639
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,179
as well jump to that I think we demo

640
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:43,309
what we needed to demo your heads and

641
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,940
that and the digressions but here the

642
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,970
the Alexus skills kit very similar

643
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,860
console if you go through the steps

644
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,780
you'll set it up and you can test it

645
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,370
right here I usually find this as the

646
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,350
best place to test it but you can also

647
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,270
you know you can release it there are

648
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,040
other web forms you can test it with or

649
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,140
if you have an Alexa device you can test

650
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,320
it you see if this is ready to go this

651
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,670
one this one I hold the mic the other

652
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,240
one I just click it Oh

653
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,190
Alexa talked to Weather Channel sorry

654
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,290
I'm not sure I did this feels cold what

655
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,040
is this one called Watson yes

656
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,900
Alexa asked Watson what the weather is

657
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,059
weather for what location remember if

658
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:31,040
you enter your full address in the Alexa

659
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,410
app I'll be able to automatically get

660
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,820
the weather for where you are

661
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,800
this is using the Alexa built in this is

662
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,490
using the Alexa built in let's try again

663
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,420
ask weather channel

664
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,400
hi I can help you to find current

665
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,710
weather conditions okay so it was a

666
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,080
little tricky getting in and out while

667
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,440
it was resetting but now Alexa's talking

668
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,090
to our Watson Service I recognize that

669
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,240
response yes says it can help with the

670
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,160
current weather what's the forecast

671
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,230
please tell me your location this is our

672
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,720
one slot and the no content is because I

673
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,790
keep clicking the microphone you haven't

674
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,160
supposed to hold it so the one slot is

675
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
the location

676
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,650
so like the rental car one if I say do

677
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:27,450
you know any jokes in what location it's

678
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,450
gonna keep from anything okay yes yes so

679
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,570
not only is it not funny not fun but

680
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,760
it's in a lot of cases is kind of

681
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,620
annoying yet because this agent that

682
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,630
you're working with trying to accomplish

683
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,420
something with is really just ignoring

684
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,390
you exactly so this is what happens and

685
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,340
you don't use directions so that's why

686
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,410
you license it so that's digressions and

687
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,690
we should say Honolulu because we want

688
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,490
to show you that this actually songs to

689
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,950
the weather forecasts okay Oh in what

690
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,290
location oh it only got Luther Toronto

691
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,940
it's a nice day here in Toronto yes it

692
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,130
is okay I'll look up the weather for

693
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,140
Toronto looking up weather information

694
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,450
for Toronto partly cloudy

695
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,290
lows overnight in the low 70s so the

696
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,660
coat pattern for Alexa it it does have

697
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,980
the wiring there to have that

698
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,740
conversation that simple slot a simple

699
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,300
example of how to work with Watson

700
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,750
assistant but then when it's when you

701
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,490
get to the point where you have a

702
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,630
location want to look up the weather

703
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,120
that's your intent it will call up to

704
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,100
the Weather Channel and it will get back

705
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,780
the the weather forecast where you

706
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,000
actually have a lot of details about

707
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,730
whether you could get much more

708
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,240
information but when you're talking to a

709
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,820
voice device yes fortunately there's a

710
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,490
fairly brief one then you can be spoken

711
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,380
okay so

712
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,750
what didn't we cover we covered

713
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,010
everything so we talked about the code

714
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,200
pattern we talked about Watson system

715
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,180
the attempts to use in the dialogue and

716
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,740
how you can use a Content catalog before

717
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,260
we talk about the slots that we can use

718
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,120
specifically like our mental example of

719
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,130
course the digressions and you've also

720
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,460
shown a quick demo of the Alexa and now

721
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,430
I think that's only half of code I think

722
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,470
I think it is I think we covered it oh

723
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,970
if you did want to look at the code

724
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,710
though of course it's on github and

725
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,150
remember there's it these are both

726
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,250
written in JavaScript one has a node.js

727
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,330
server one has IBM cloud functions so

728
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,650
the that most of these call-outs are

729
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,870
very simple not a lot of code you need

730
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,110
to me but you have to code me alright so

731
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,340
thank you very much everyone for joining

732
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,750
in today that's what we had to show you

733
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,820
the code the demo of a like site Google

734
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,800
assistant and how you can use Watson

735
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,880
assistant as the one sort of

736
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,100
conversational fabric for all these

737
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,840
different platforms so again thank you
