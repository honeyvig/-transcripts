00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,330
hello there and welcome to a special

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,960
video my name is ken devaki and today

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,650
i'm with two very special guests two of

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,590
my mentors Timothy Duncan and Thierry

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,039
you her let's begin today so but will we

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,480
actually get let me tell you a little

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,579
bit about what we're going to be covered

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,860
today now a lot of my subscribers send

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,200
in questions about platforms like IBM

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,570
bluemix Mannion's watson and a lot of

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,579
those questions are actually quite

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,730
redundant so today what I want to do is

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,780
I want to be getting some of those

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,000
questions to of course the experts of

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,219
those platforms themselves I'm not

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,079
seeing what Hans's they actually have

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,230
for us but actually again stop to enjoy

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,960
sex consultants yeah thanks am I am I to

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,469
the Duncan and I have been with IBM for

21
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,780
about 300 over three years now and the

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,610
last few years I have been specializing

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,680
and bloonan I am a bloomin specialist

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,409
and basically what I specialize in is

25
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,500
helping clients take ideas off their

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,650
brains and and deliver them as as

27
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,350
applications in the cloud I help them do

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,659
the value it can be a complex solution a

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,400
lot to take in when you first come into

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,860
something like Watson and bluemix so I

31
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,810
help coins break that down in efficient

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,759
manner understand what services they

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,040
might need to use internalize on ideas

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,630
and then develop those ideas on the

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,369
cloud by connecting them facilitating

36
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,930
connections with people like tiry tiry

37
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,850
would you like introduce yourself all

38
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,000
what a segue yes so let him say oh you

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,220
bet I'm the CEO of Darwin ecosystem and

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,820
I built cognitive solutions basically

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,700
based on Watson and bluemix and we

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,829
specialize on detectable tolerance and

43
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,689
what happens when the standard changes

44
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,969
but surely what we do so we're in the

45
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,520
heart of this in terms of the algorithm

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,140
and how we use this technology and what

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,610
it really means and we do this for

48
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,350
clients and we build micro

49
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,840
services we build solutions and we

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,780
augment people's ability to interact

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,920
with computers absolutely perfect so now

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,620
that you have been introduced to both my

53
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,989
mentors let's begin with the questions

54
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,430
that I subscribers understand again

55
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,739
first question but I actually received

56
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,780
quite a bit is actually questionable

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,200
what is blue all right I'm a bloomin

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,840
specialist I will answer that question

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,250
typically speaking the analogy I use

60
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,220
when describing bloom is to a client or

61
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,370
first-time user of the platform is first

62
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,080
my stones will look at the platform by

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,790
her trial fee like the others have a

64
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,100
chance to look at the UI but then once

65
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,569
you've a chance to experience that then

66
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,760
is good to hang on to an analogy

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,590
something very simple to break down that

68
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,300
concept in a way where you can hold on

69
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,830
to that while you're progressing through

70
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,060
this journey because there is a lot

71
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,799
taken as a lot of different sections a

72
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,140
lot of different types of services micro

73
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,090
services that you can use the

74
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,519
application development process I can

75
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,540
make your life a lot easier

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,060
so understanding the overall concept

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,110
before diving into them is very

78
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,570
important in the concepts and algae that

79
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,820
usually use is I describe bluemix as the

80
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,239
home depot of the IT world and vensim so

81
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,280
it's a place where developers can go and

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,829
began aqui that there are tools

83
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,650
available to them to build applications

84
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,380
much like a builder would go to Home

85
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,450
Depot to get maybe two boys to build

86
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,549
something but then I said and then some

87
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,049
and the reason why is that and then some

88
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,720
if you went own Depot as a builder and

89
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,209
then you have all the tools you compile

90
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,410
them all together that you needed to

91
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,060
build a certain project and then there

92
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,950
was a back door and you went outside

93
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,230
that back door and you had all of this

94
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,320
space to build your creations on top of

95
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,880
but not not only added space but

96
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,070
scalable space can be moved around it's

97
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,180
portable

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,650
there are all different types of

99
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,030
advantages to having on-demand

100
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,150
consumption and computing power that you

101
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,530
have on boom so very simply put it's a

102
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,150
place that houses a bunch of tools and

103
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,590
then you can take those tools to build

104
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,230
applications and host them and I an IBM

105
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,480
public cloud now iBM has a lot of

106
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,830
different technologies allow different

107
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,049
application and a lot of different

108
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,739
clouds that you can go into there is the

109
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,250
system Z cloud there is a quantum cloud

110
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,900
now there's a 50-quid constant cloud

111
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,669
that has just got released which will be

112
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:28,990
commercially available in the near

113
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,840
future so this particular cloud is ibm's

114
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,910
premier public cloud there are other

115
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,930
places where you can connect with

116
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,850
servers and host your hose or

117
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,380
applications but this this one in

118
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,610
particular which is bluemix

119
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,550
is the public is the generally available

120
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,940
public cloud that IBM had yeah so

121
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,860
hopefully that's a good name so clean up

122
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,460
the connect with a well as a visible

123
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,220
purpose over I built I built things like

124
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,840
the right cell design going to your shop

125
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,150
right that's what I do so

126
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,570
lumic's is it's really a platform as a

127
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,250
service I will need to have the

128
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,550
equipment on that machine anywhere from

129
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,820
the servers which are in the cloud

130
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,870
obviously so I don't have to have them

131
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,479
and for your audience try to understand

132
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,729
to break down like what it is right so I

133
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,889
have a served on top of that server I've

134
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,500
got the ability to build applications

135
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,060
mobile application web application

136
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,430
basically service in databases and then

137
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,830
I make sense of those databases right

138
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,990
and I can run statistics on them and

139
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,840
whatnot and here is where it's fun the

140
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,389
fun part of bluemix is that there is

141
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,240
these incredible cognitive services

142
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,130
it's incredible Watson it will talk

143
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,870
about Watson a little one right but

144
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,000
these services work I can make the

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,639
computer do things that humans do

146
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,789
naturally and this is a unique

147
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,370
environment a unique playground for

148
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,610
developers to experiment and bring more

149
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,900
intelligence to solution absolutely

150
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,560
perfect

151
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,680
now you mentioned about basically

152
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,260
different

153
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,630
cognitive services that Munich's

154
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,540
provides or need watson importance want

155
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,770
to continue and dive more into

156
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,630
Washington let's talk a little bit about

157
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,240
what types of services dmx actually

158
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,730
provide removal of that yeah that's good

159
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,700
good conversation of dive into so

160
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,140
there's generally three pieces in

161
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,000
bluemix they need to be aware of that is

162
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,270
categorizing and you have compute apps

163
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,610
and services so compute is your

164
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,200
infrastructures of service offerings

165
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,810
which the bare metal servers or via size

166
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,370
or networking or storage those you know

167
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,160
basic fundamental components you needing

168
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,710
application development process now you

169
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,630
progress up the stack a little bit and

170
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,240
you automate a little more of that

171
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,130
compute and process that needs to host

172
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,840
an application then you get what we call

173
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,840
the apps section now acts have compute

174
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,540
options such as docker containers IBM

175
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,180
Dugger containers while boundary and

176
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,980
then open with which is probably the

177
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,230
most progressive circle is computing

178
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,780
event driven model computing and then

179
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,940
you have a globe application so those

180
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,070
what we call the the title of apps and

181
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,410
what that means is that you're

182
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,750
progressing up up the stack and managing

183
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,060
less of the stack when hosting your

184
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,380
application do you have something you

185
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,000
want to add to that theory let's say

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,550
that one of the one of the modules which

187
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,520
are great when you say what it does is

188
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,500
the ability for instance to troll

189
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,050
TextEdit with your application and

190
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,900
receive the personality of the text the

191
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,210
sentiment of the text or through words

192
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,610
and get concepts so that you can expend

193
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,320
and build really cool solutions or even

194
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,110
sense to send like voice but let's say

195
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,360
we were taking this podcast and we would

196
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,950
throw it through the system and it could

197
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,410
tell you exactly where I spoke in what

198
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,540
concept by spoke and even analyze the

199
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,700
personality these are wonderful things

200
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,710
the two tools that you have no abilities

201
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,260
these incredible applications and those

202
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,500
tools are generally broken up into

203
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,940
categories so we just talked about

204
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,550
infrastructure we talked about apps now

205
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,050
let's talk about services a little bit

206
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,550
services you touch on micro services

207
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,490
go now IBM and other third parties have

208
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,520
micro services which are blocks of code

209
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,919
that performed work for people now there

210
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,389
are certain blocks of code that are very

211
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,849
useful so why reinvent the wheel over

212
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:22,289
and over again why don't we just make

213
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,080
that a micro service and app developers

214
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,330
can then embed that service into their

215
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,860
application now there's lots of

216
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,620
different types of micro services data

217
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,779
analytics blockchain IOT Watson is one

218
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,849
of them you want to talk about fuses of

219
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,459
the categories and more to spread in

220
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,200
some of those or you having you

221
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,730
mentioned you mentioned a major category

222
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,829
right I think this is where you write

223
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:48,930
the micro services a little black box

224
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,640
that does some magic and your

225
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,529
information into transforms it and it

226
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,880
gives you all these wonderful things you

227
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,950
are talking about IOT like HN I think

228
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,290
the ability to just through that blocks

229
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,200
on to bluemix connect objects smart

230
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,730
objects right and then analyze

231
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,620
information and look for patterns if

232
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,959
things different or how can i for

233
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,029
instance correlate what an object is

234
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,010
telling me with what somebody is telling

235
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,350
me this is like longer it off right and

236
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,420
I don't need to build it and that's

237
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,010
abuse I just need to connect them

238
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,800
together so we analytic services you

239
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,510
want to you want to be able to put a

240
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,940
whole bunch of data into the system and

241
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,820
text or give you projection for instance

242
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,130
things that would require complex

243
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,470
analytical skills and whatnot that you

244
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,690
can reject easily in your decision

245
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,820
Rachel Commerce I mean think about

246
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,070
understanding customers behavior what

247
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,810
would be reliable because like put the

248
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,779
data models into it and save a lot of

249
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,899
time coding with best practice services

250
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,270
and then span across so many different

251
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,670
ways of doing it so that's how we use

252
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,230
data finding is very powerful

253
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,779
yeah I agree and you know let's let's

254
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,029
let's take this back to the analogy we

255
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,820
use at the very front which is bluemix

256
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,250
being the home depot the IT world and

257
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,899
then some having all that capacity to

258
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,149
build on top of so what do we consider

259
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:08,910
services within Home Depot so if you

260
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,100
with the Home Depot and you bought some

261
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,020
tools that would be comparable to buying

262
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,329
services or compute options you wouldn't

263
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:16,680
expect to go to Home Depot

264
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,050
and build your services your tools from

265
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,749
scratch sprinkle build right look so IBM

266
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,490
has IBM and bluemix at the same

267
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,290
mentality where you can go into the

268
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,240
storefront and you can have to be

269
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,740
guaranteed those enterprise grade

270
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,689
tooling and you can count on to build

271
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,629
scalable innovative applications in the

272
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:36,360
cloud I'm going to wake up

273
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,629
yeah so now that were on the topic of

274
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,029
bluemix now say for services it provides

275
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,970
it wasn't Watson self-evident let's

276
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,100
check back a little Watson another

277
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,439
question a lot of people actually ask me

278
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:52,429
is what is the relationship between

279
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:55,889
Watson and lyrics I don't think that one

280
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,339
yeah all right okay so think of Watson a

281
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,189
single phrase like we all have right and

282
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:05,100
we were anything right so there's a

283
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,660
whole bunch of very smart people that

284
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,540
have taught Watson how to do certain

285
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,559
things and those particular things can

286
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,170
be accessible to lumix just that simple

287
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,389
so typing Swanson how to be a

288
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,550
psychologist and this is one of the

289
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,759
services right a personality analytics

290
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,170
whole bunch of psychologists went ahead

291
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,509
and say hey Watson you empty silly

292
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,199
brains can learn very well it was the

293
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,329
new empty filling brain can learn very

294
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:38,100
well I hear it was a fiery personality

295
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,199
looks like here is somebody who's really

296
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,670
smart what they look like when they

297
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,740
express themselves but if it what is the

298
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,370
evidence of emotionality and whatnot so

299
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,199
all these scientists and all these

300
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,170
experts psychologists marketing experts

301
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,670
Tom Watson house arranging like these

302
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,189
things LTS very complex and I couldn't

303
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:57,929
teach a system to do that you could not

304
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,759
teach us and them but these are generic

305
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,910
I would say assessment no they are in

306
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,100
Watson and then we have a lude service

307
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,110
that goes in and that's a difference and

308
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,759
basically I said to LuAnn you know what

309
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,360
take this text give it to Watson to

310
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,730
understand the personality of the tanks

311
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,209
and bring it back to me so I can use it

312
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:19,339
okay yeah so we'll be facing back to the

313
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,499
gate with the cake with the links it is

314
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,839
the interface between the brain and its

315
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,209
specialty and a service that has been

316
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,699
built elaborate and the size of the same

317
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:29,089
coin

318
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:31,339
exactly well yeah it says your brain

319
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,929
would be useless if we did eyes I

320
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,689
resolve and a mouth right and here to

321
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,069
receive information and express

322
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,410
information it's the same thing right

323
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,649
right completely and now that we're on

324
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:45,379
that topic of bloomix services not

325
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,269
limited what they are and how they work

326
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,850
one more question last question the

327
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,369
lawmen crabbers ask me how does the

328
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:55,279
typing wallet for writing for bloomin

329
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,410
okay so let's dive into that a little

330
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,379
bit so what's unique about clouds in

331
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,749
terms of pricing that you wouldn't get

332
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,910
over the past few decades from on print

333
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,850
pricing so I'd really look at that cafe

334
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,779
catback cost for object cons so

335
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,619
generally speaking over the last two

336
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:15,110
decades people would buy software

337
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,939
licenses and you would post those

338
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:19,730
licenses on print and generally those

339
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,970
licenses come with a sizeable feet now

340
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,980
within cloud that completely flips the

341
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,869
model on its head now you're only paying

342
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:29,569
for what you use you don't you don't you

343
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,459
don't have the license it's not on Krim

344
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:34,189
you're essentially renting it from IBM

345
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,329
or wherever your cloud provider is and

346
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:40,610
backpacking is on demand so the pricing

347
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,970
is an aggregate of everything you use

348
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,699
down to the visits to the smallest

349
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,379
decimal so for example using if you're

350
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,759
using a Watson ap on you would be

351
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,100
charged for watching speeches X you

352
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,119
would be charged for the number of

353
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,100
minutes that you process through that

354
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,269
API data analytics you use a database

355
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,309
you would be charged so the databases

356
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:03,160
are charged by how much stores you have

357
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,170
over a length of time that's also how

358
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,480
compute is also measured how much how

359
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,459
much computing capacity are you are you

360
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,309
dedicating to your application over the

361
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:14,749
amount of time so something like a

362
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:16,639
gigabyte an hour or that Cloud Foundry

363
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,829
operates on so the main thing about

364
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,290
pricing they got to be that you have to

365
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,190
key in on is your own

366
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,170
paying for what you use and nothing less

367
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,570
and you generally pay either monthly or

368
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,130
you can pay yearly because IBM deals

369
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,630
with enterprise customers so we

370
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,790
understand that many of our customers

371
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,890
have procurement systems so we have

372
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,720
flexible pricing models which can meet

373
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,730
variety of different use cases if you

374
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,350
like a credit card bank account we have

375
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,930
that option if you like an account that

376
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,880
sends you an invoice every month that

377
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,290
you can process with your procurement

378
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,030
system we have that option if you want

379
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,340
to budget upfront for a year's worth of

380
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,830
spending if you are a large enterprise

381
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,260
customer and you all you operate on a

382
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,820
yearly budget and go on a budget that

383
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,890
upfront we also have an option as you

384
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,880
can do that for it so we're very

385
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,860
flexible and how you pay for it

386
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,200
but how you're charged is an aggregate

387
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,140
of only what you use exactly exactly

388
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,330
in that time back into technology I

389
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,800
believe it would basically be like

390
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,360
instead of buying those tools you're

391
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,280
lending them out and paying for whatever

392
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,190
use those tools yeah so I mean you would

393
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,960
take those tools and immediately go back

394
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,030
in the back and build with them and then

395
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,710
when you're done I mean they would

396
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,810
operate if the tool was needed to

397
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,090
support the application or your house

398
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,310
out there and that real estate the tool

399
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,250
would stay there and support it but it

400
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,930
was still yes it was still chemically be

401
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,360
owned by Home Depot or IBM bluemix in

402
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,450
this case experiment completely and

403
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,910
those were the four questions that a lot

404
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,610
of my subscribers easily ask me about

405
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,030
bluemix and Watson in fact we do have

406
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,130
another positive video coming out very

407
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,860
soon about artificial intelligence as

408
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,380
well and so that's going to be it for

409
