of Engineering the link is in the
description box that will navigate to
the course page where you can find a
complete overview of the program being

Learners has to say about the course hi
I'm Philip I am 61 years old and last
year I upskill with simply Learners post
program at cyber security after working
30 years in the IIT sector in various
different profiles I'm happy to tell you
that I was able to clear and pass my
cissp and ccsp certification exams on
the first attempt after taking the
course course I must say was packed with
practical examples it was led by highly
skilled certified instructors with many
companies before such security analysts
and the architect on a contract basis
but I needed some stability which I got
with the job I just started with Infosys
as a cyber security consultant
happened on our first now let us
understand about this certified ethical
hacker or ceh exam so the ceh exam
focuses on theoretical understanding and
does not involve hacking actual systems
it emphasizes comprehension of hacking
Concepts tools and methodologies however
to obtain the ceh Masters designation
you must also pass a six hour practical
exam with 20 challenges this exams
evaluates a practical application of
Knowledge and Skills in real life
scenarios but that's a choice if you
want to apply for Masters so the CH exam
is 4 hours long the exam consists of 125
multiple choice questions the passing
score required for certification varies
depending on the specific exam some
exams state in passing score as a
percentage While others base it on the
difficulty of questions and the
knowledge or skills needed to
demonstrate competence in the subject
the actual cut score determined by
subject matter experts depends on the
difficulty of the questions and ensures
fairness in evaluation skills if you
encounter more challenging questions
fewer correct answers are needed to pass
while an easier set of questions
requires higher percentage of correct
answers thus performance related to the
passing standard can be higher even with
fewer correct answers in a difficult
question set so now let's have a look at
the sections so the sections covered in
the program includes section number one
that is background then there is section
number two which is analysis or
assessment then there is section number
three security then comes section number
four tools systems and programs Section
5 is procedures and methodology section
6 is regulation and policy section 7 is
ethics so this was about the ceh exam

criteria so the eligibility criteria for
CH exam before you start preparing for

requirements firstly you must show this
easy Council that you have at least two
years of experience in information
security in a special realization in
that field through your educational
background additionally keep in mind
that the CH exam has a cost of 100 US
dollars and make sure you fulfill these
criteria before moving forward to avoid
wasting your time so this was about the
eligibility criteria for series exam now
