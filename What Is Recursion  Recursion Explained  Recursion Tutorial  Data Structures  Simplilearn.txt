let's get started with the agenda for
today's
session we will start this session by
understanding what is
recursion followed by that we'll find
out how recursion gets executed in
memory area
once done with that we'll look into
different types of recursion and finally
we will Implement a program that
demonstrate the concept of recursion I
hope I made myself clear with the agenda
now let's get started with our first
topic what is
recursion well recursion is a process in
which a function repeatedly calls itself
either directly or indirectly those
calls are majorly done by explicitly
calling function by its name however
however it can also be accomplished by
implicit calling as well the fundamental
idea behind calling the function over
and over again is to break a larger
problem into smaller sub problems we do
this for reducing the computational
complexity of a larger Problem by
breaking it into several pieces this
tactic is also called as divide and
conquer approach in programming so now
you must be thinking about how we can
break the larger problem into smaller
sub problems well to do that that we
break the given problem statement into
two parts the first one is base case and
the second one is recursive
step the base case is nothing but the
simplest instance of a problem that
consist of condition which holds the
recursive function given the function
calls argument this base case computes
the output of our program right away
whereas in the recursive step we compute
the result using one or more recursive
calls to the same function but with the
inputs decrease in size or complexity to
understand this breakdown let's have a
look at mathematical aspect of recursion
suppose you have to formulate a
mathematical function for computing the
sum of N natural numbers that means the
function that you are going to create
must calculate the summation of all
natural numbers in the range 0 to n
mathematically it can be represented as
summation of all numbers from K is = to
0 to K isal to n now the critical
question here is how can we actually
represent this in form of recursive
function the answer is quite simple all
we need to do is break this larger
problem into small fragments we can
represent this problem as n plus sum of
all natural numbers till n minus one
this process of traversing in function f
n minus 1 * is called the recursive step
of our problem statement whereas the the
base case is a condition which is
stopping the recursion when K is
reaching value zero in terms of
programming it can be represented using
a vog now I hope you guys have
understood how we can break a larger
problem into smaller sub problems moving
further we are going to understand how
recursion gets executed in memory
area in order to do that we'll take this
C program as an example in this program
we have two methods the main method
contains one variable and the statement
that invokes a function named fun this
function fun is making a recursive call
in this function body we have both base
case and recursive step inside this
functions body now whenever a function
is called its activation record will be
maintained inside the St so for this
program we are going to look into its
control flow as we know the main
function gets invoked primarily by an
operating system thus will include the
main function at first in our memory
stab this activation record will consist
of local variables of function
parameters and the record of return
address to the colum but here for the
sake of Simplicity we are just
maintaining the local variables inside
the activation record after this step as
you can see the main function is
activating method fun with argument
three once activated it will promp three
on screen and will invoke fun 3 - 1 that
is fun 2 now again as 2 is greater than
zero the control will invoke fun 2 - one
that is fun one after this the control
will activate fun zero this time once
the control enters an if block it will
execute a return statement and
activation record zero will get popped
out of the memory stack forther every
function inside the memory stack will
get popped out from it which will result
in generation of output the output that
will get printed on the console for this
particular program is 32 1 now here is
the interesting question that we want
you all to answer based on the
properties of recursion that we have
discussed till now which of the
following statements seems right to you
the options that we have are recursion
is always better than iteration option b
recursion uses more memory compared to
the iteration option C recursion uses
less memory compared to the iteration
it will be interesting to see how many
of you guys will get this right so guys
do leave your answers to this question
in comment section Below in a week's
time we'll be announcing the right
answer and you all can check it out now
moving ahead we'll discuss different
types of recursion in programming there
are basically four types of recursion
the first one is direct recursion the
second one is indirect recursion the
third one is tail recursion and the
fourth one is non-tail recursion so
let's discuss direct recursion a
function is called direct recursive if
it calls itself in its function body
over and over again to better understand
this definition let's look at the
structure of a program that is direct
recursive in nature in this program we
have a method named fun which is calling
itself again and again in its function
body thus we can say that it is direct
recursive in nature next St is indirect
recursion the recursion in which the
function calls itself via another
function is called as indirect recursion
for example in this program you can
clearly see that the function fun one is
explicitly calling Fun two which is
invoking fun one again explicitly hence
we can say that this is an example of
indirect recursion further we have tail
recursion a recursive function is said
to be tail recursive if the recurs C you
call is the last execution done by the
function let's try to understand this
definition with the help of an example
if You observe this program you can see
that the last line ADI will execute for
method fun is recursive call and because
of that there is no need to remember any
previous state of our program finally we
have a non-tail recursive function on
our list a recursive function is said to
be non-tail recursive if the recursion
call is not the last thing done by the
function after returning back there is
something left to evaluate let's
consider one example in this function
you can clearly observe that there is
another operation after the recursive
call hence our ADI will have to memorize
the previous state inside this memory
block that is why this program can be
considered as non-tail recursive now
finally let's Implement a program to
demonstrate the recursion
the program that we are going to
implement is solution to the problem
statement that we discussed earlier
according to that problem statement we
have to calculate the sum of N natural
numbers given the number n now in order
to address this problem we are going to
use C programming language so without
any further Ado let's head over to the
code
editor now in order to get started with
coding implementation first we'll create
an utility function to calculate sum of
N natural numbers so let's do
that and we'll pass an argument in
N now we have arrived inside the body of
function sum what we'll first do is
we'll calculate sum of N minus one
natural numbers by making an recursive
call to function sum so let's do that
sum n
minus1 and we'll store this value inside
a temporary variable
now we'll add this temporary variables
value to n in order to return it as an
result the statements that we just wrote
are called as recursive steps But If You
observe this statement we are not
putting any limitation to our recur you
call so that is why we'll have to add
base case to our function so let's do
that
f n equal to equal to 0
then
return
0 with this we have successfully
implemented our sum function so let's
work on our driver method to generate
the result in this driver
method first first we'll create an
variable
n and after that we'll write a print F
statement
enter the natural
number n to
calculate the sum
of N numbers
semicolon and in next line we'll write
scanip statement in order to take input
from our user
so inside this we'll write modulus D
comma ambass in
n and
semicolon and in next statement we'll
make a call to our sum function in order
to calculate sum of N natural numbers so
how we can do that well we can add
modulus D here
comma sum
n
semicolon and I hope our code works fine
now so let's check it by compiling
here the console is asking us to provide
with value of variable n and I'm going
to provide value five here so let's
provide value
five and enter so the output that we are
getting is 15 here that means our code
works fine with this successful coding
implementation we came to the end of
this video I hope that you guys have UND
how recursion works now in the upcoming
sessions we'll discuss some Advanced
problems of recursion so if you have any
doubts about the concept covered in this
video then let us know in comment
