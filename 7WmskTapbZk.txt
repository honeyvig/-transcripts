2
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,800
so hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,240
tutorial my name is tamy Baki and this

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,039
time we're going to be going over how

5
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,320
you can use mongod DB with Parson more

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,760
specifically how pars is able to use

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,199
mongod DB as a database backend and keep

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,759
a really nice and simple to use

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,280
interface for developers and database

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,760
owners so let's take a look at how this

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,200
works now one of my subscribers actually

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,520
originally sent in this question so now

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,800
I'm creating this video so I'd like to

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
say a big thank you to him who actually

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
sent in the question all right so let's

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,359
begin now what I'm going to do here is

17
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,280
um in case you didn't already know now

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,559
I'm I'm assuming that you are already

19
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,640
familiar with the parse server uh and

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,199
you used it before uh but now I'm going

21
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,239
to show you how it actually works in the

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,920
back end uh and what happened is the

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,320
person who's actually sent in this

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,280
question uh he was actually uh wondering

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,720
exactly how parse is able to use mongod

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,119
DB as a backend and how that comes into

27
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,759
play when we're hosting a custom parse

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,560
server so let's take a look at how that

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,799
works it actually all begins begins with

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,079
the actual par server itself uh and

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,600
there are actually two pieces of

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,360
software that pars has made available to

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,439
the public

34
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,000
uh and I don't want you to get confused

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,079
between these uh because there are two

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,680
really distinct types of software first

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
of all the parse dashboard and the parse

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
server now let's take a look at this

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,200
first of all let's just say that we've

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
got a mongod DB back end okay so this is

41
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,040
our back end and this is what's actually

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,320
storing our data and it's called mongodb

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,840
okay it's a nosql setup basically uh

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
it's based off of the nosql

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,960
environment uh now part from mongodb of

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,799
course we've got part and under parse

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,439
we've got two categories as I said we've

48
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,159
got the parse server uh and so I'm going

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,399
to say

50
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,399
parse

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,040
server okay uh and apart from that of

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,920
course we've also got our parse

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,599
dashboard so we can just write that here

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
so we've got our

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,760
parse

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
dashboard okay

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,440
now let me explain exactly how all of

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
this comes into play now the par server

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,040
uh is basically this uh interface okay

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,280
and basically what we're doing what our

61
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,120
Point our goal is is to make mongod DB

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,560
accessible and easy to use for everybody

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,599
whether that's someone who's going to be

64
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,080
taking a look at the database internals

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,720
uh and see how everything's going on

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,760
inside the database the the actual data

67
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,640
in the database they want to simple to

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,360
use interface like I mean just for

69
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,879
example PHP my admin uh to actually see

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
what's in the database and do stuff with

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,080
it uh and also for developers who are

72
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
actually incorporating into their

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,920
applications we want a simple to use and

74
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,159
easy interface for all of those people

75
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,680
and so that's why we have two separate

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,440
pieces of software the par server is is

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,560
basically going to make it easy for

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,360
developers to have their own uh sort of

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,440
interface for mongod DB through things

80
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,799
like iOS Android Java c node.js a

81
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,120
variety of different languages lots of

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,159
different languages even go uh and the

83
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,959
parts dashboard is going to be this uh

84
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,959
web interface where you can take a look

85
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,519
at what's inside of your database uh and

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,080
actually uh work accordingly now let me

87
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,000
explain how this actually works but

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,959
let's also just say that we've got your

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
application or the code that's using

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,000
your mongod

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
DB

92
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,239
now okay so this is your application

93
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,159
here

94
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,200
now let's just say we've got application

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,159
number two as well this is really going

96
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,040
to help me drive across the

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,799
point Okay so we've got application and

98
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,720
application

99
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,320
to now the first thing I'm going to take

100
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,440
a look at here is par server mongodb now

101
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,639
the point of parse server is to be able

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,600
to have this little communication

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,960
protocol to and from mongod D oh sorry

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,639
uh so basically we're GNA have this

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,680
little communication protocol between

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,600
par server and mongod DB and the way

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,840
this is going to work is through a

108
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,160
regular mongod DB connection just like

109
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,039
how you would implement it in your

110
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,360
applications and so of course the mongod

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,400
DB can communicate back to pars as

112
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,639
well now the parse server will provide a

113
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,080
rest API and that rest API can then

114
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,199
really easily be used with mongod DB and

115
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,360
this will also uh this will also sorry

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
with with mongod DB and the rest of your

117
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,840
applications here and this rest API has

118
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
a few credentials as well such as the

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
API key and the master key oh sorry the

120
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
app key and the master key but I won't

121
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,120
be getting into how those work just yet

122
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,520
that's a topic for a different video uh

123
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,280
but let's just say the par server has

124
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,039
this really neat rest API that you can

125
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,880
use to contact mongod DB however what

126
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,560
happens is let's say this is an iOS

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,280
application this is a node.js

128
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,600
application what's going to happen is

129
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,639
let's just say for example um you don't

130
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,680
want to use the rest API which uh

131
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,240
sometimes you don't want to uh you want

132
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,759
to have a really simple interface uh and

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,639
the way you can do this is by using the

134
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,240
language sdks that pars actually

135
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,160
provides by default for many different

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,600
languages including node.js and Swift

137
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,160
for iOS uh and so what can happen is

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,199
let's just say you've got your iOS

139
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,639
application what happens is instead of

140
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,000
using a really

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
difficult connection from IOS to mongodb

142
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,960
it becomes a lot more simple if you were

143
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,120
to just have one

144
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,840
connection and this is in this case your

145
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,240
sorry language SDK uh and this language

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,160
SDK will then in turn communicate with

147
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,919
your par server which will communicate

148
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,080
with your mongod DB instance uh get

149
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,520
retrieve delete update data do anything

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,280
you'd like to and of course we'll keep

151
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,560
returning the results back to you it's

152
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,000
basically as if the application doesn't

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
care about what this is doing it just

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
imagines that there's this big database

155
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,000
here but par server isn't actually your

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,479
database it's your communication

157
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,720
protocol

158
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,240
basically okay so once you've got that

159
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,280
done then let's take a look at parse

160
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
dashboard and then I'll get into

161
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,520
application number two now the parse

162
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,280
dashboard is this really simple to use

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,720
interface just like PHP my admin to

164
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,599
basically uh administer your database uh

165
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
and to take a look at what's inside of

166
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,879
your database to update rows to add

167
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,680
tables uh to add rows do a lot of

168
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,879
different type of stuff uh and so the

169
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,160
parse dashboard is actually basically

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,039
this UI that's built on top of the parse

171
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,240
server again it's built in node.js

172
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,080
and of course what's happening is it's

173
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,280
using that node.js language SDK for

174
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,080
parse and it's able to communicate with

175
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
a parse server of your choosing and it's

176
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,199
able to show you your data but now comes

177
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,039
in the interesting

178
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,039
part mongod DB in the second application

179
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,520
now let's just say that you've hired a

180
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
developer and that developer doesn't

181
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,879
have any experience of using the par

182
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,319
server but that developer has experience

183
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,479
using

184
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,120
mongodb now what can happen is your

185
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,360
application here application number two

186
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,199
which is your node.js application your

187
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,680
developer doesn't know how to use parse

188
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,560
with with node.js only knows how to use

189
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,240
a mongod DB connection but then you're

190
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,520
like oh wait what do I do now well I

191
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,319
can't use parse but we're using parse

192
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,960
what do we do hire you developer

193
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,639
no now since par server is basically

194
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,680
this this stack sitting on top of mongod

195
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,400
DB this little uh this uh development UI

196
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
basically I like to call it uh and

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,520
what's happens is your second

198
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,159
application can actually directly

199
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,319
communicate with mongod DB and what'll

200
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,840
happen is those changes will actually be

201
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,159
shown across whatever par server is

202
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,199
doing the reason I'm saying this is

203
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,680
because okay let's say you've got a

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,279
mongodb instance uh and you register a

205
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,360
new user through application number two

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,919
that data goes directly through to

207
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,440
mongodb it does not go through the part

208
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,839
server into mongod DB because if you if

209
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,360
you think about it this is what's

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,399
actually storing all of our data it's

211
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,399
not doing any processing all this is

212
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,480
doing is it's taking the data and

213
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,760
storing it the rest is all interface the

214
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,480
rest just makes it easy to work

215
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,120
with and that is exactly how this works

216
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,959
and that is what the actual relationship

217
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,000
is between the parse dashboard and

218
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,519
mongod DB and of course the par server

219
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,160
and mongod

220
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,560
DB one more thing I'd like to note here

221
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,440
though is that of course these two are

222
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,800
basically server software serers side

223
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,640
software so they have to run on ports

224
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,240
like for example I don't exactly know

225
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,680
what the default Port is uh but like for

226
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,800
example this could run at 4,000 and this

227
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,320
could run at oh I don't no maybe 3,000

228
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,920
really whatever it is some sort of Port

229
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,399
that these are going to run on and the

230
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,240
rest will be able to communicate through

231
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,560
that web uh through that web interface

232
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
and through that web

233
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,680
API all right so that's exactly how

234
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,720
Parts both the parse server and the

235
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,399
parse dashboard are able to use DV

236
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,000
to store information and make your life

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
working with databases much much easier

238
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,440
in fact if you haven't already heard

239
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,519
about the par shutdown for some reason

240
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,160
uh pars has has completely shut down now

241
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,680
uh at least the services that they

242
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,160
provide like uh hosted hosted par

243
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,079
servers uh but what they've done is

244
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:08,480
they've made parse server and parse

245
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,000
dashboard open source so that's why I

246
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,120
keep on emphasizing that you can

247
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
actually connect these to your own

248
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,040
mongodb instances and you can actually

249
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,519
use your own uh sort of like servers to

250
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,399
host these although there are other

251
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,560
hosting services available for pars and

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
there will be some links to them in the

253
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,360
description all right so that's going to

254
