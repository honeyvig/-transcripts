Learners say about our courses
so without any further Ado let's begin
over to our tutors welcome to project
management tutorial from simple learn I
am Chandra Mr a professional consultant
and coach in best practices related to
project management and IT service
management today as part of this
tutorial we are going to learn the basic
understanding about the project
management and the required knowledge
for a project manager to become
successful in managing projects so as
part of this tutorial we are going to
look at what is project management what
is Project components of project
management Project Life Cycle key Focus
areas in project management job roles in
project management and project
management certifications so what is
project management now as defined in
pmis pmbok project management is
application of knowledge skills tools
and techniques to project activities to
meet project requirements so every
project will have an objective to
accomplish similarly the objective
project management is to make the final
deliverables in a finite time and budget
this involves having clear understanding
about the deliverables of the project
require resources for the project
resource in terms of Human Resources
Technical Resources Financial Resources
Etc project managers should have a full
picture of those aspects we can call it
as constraints or aspects and manage
those throughout the Project Life Cycle
for which a project manager should have
a full view about a project and what is
that this project has to accomplish that
objective should be clear so as part of
project management the six constraints
which project manager should look at are
scope time quality cost risk and
resources so each of these areas has
very important role to play in project
management the clarity in scope the
clarity in terms of schedule within
which the project has to be delivered
the cost what it incurs to that
particular project once it is finalized
one cannot vary when cannot change
without any proper approvals similar to
that we have quality management which
has to ensure the scope the
specifications what are defined project
output will be accordingly achieved risk
every project is taken up for a specific
reason by organization so organization
should assess the risk associated with
the project and similarly as project
progresses various different risks has
to be identified like Risk related to
project management risk related to
technology area risk related to
resources risk related to financial
things so broadly risk management plays
a very important role so there will be
something called contingency reserve
kept for a identified risk above the
cost what is estimated for various
deliverables from the project so every
projects require resources resources may
be in terms of Human Resources Financial
Resources technology resources
environmental resources so all these
resources are used to produce the output
of the project so these resources has to
be managed with the sufficient
optimization and standardizations
required now let us understand the
definition of a project so what is a
project PMI defines a project as a
temporary Endeavor undertaken to create
a unique product service or result the
temporary nature of a project indicates
that the project has a definite
beginning content so when I say product
unique product it means every output it
may be similar products you are
producing with the same features and
functionality but the output of every
project is unique because it is unique
in terms of all the six constraints what
we just discussed now now when I say
product it is very easy for us to
visualize it may be a desktop it may be
a laptop it may be a car it may be a
machine Etc but how do I visualize a
service a Project's output is a service
now it is it's about building a
capability a project by through a
project a capability can be built to
ensure Services can be provided that's
what the output of project is service
for example if I think about a taxi
services for providing a taxi services I
need a mobile app I need taxi I need a
server I need a data center so all these
are various different products and
services here service example can be
internet service so combination of all
the services and products builds the
capability for an organizations who can
provide the taxi services so building
that capability we say it is an output
of a particular project which is called
service similarly results can be
Improvement of something Improvement in
customer satisfaction increase in some
specific objectives or specific results
need to be achieved in performance
perspective so output of every project
will be unique product or a service or a
result this we need to clearly
understand so when we say there is a
definite beginning and end every project
starts at a certain point in time and
ends at certain point in time so it has
a definite beginning an end that is the
reason it is temporary in nature it is
not an ongoing business activity right
so every project will have a life cycle
a beginning and end so when it starts
till end until the result or service or
a product which comes as an output of a
project project lifecycle is not ended
so interestingly in a product life cycle
or in a service life cycle you come
across many project life cycles so one
Project Life Cycle means one project is
initiated to introduce a product or
Services next project or initiated would
be to enhance the capability of a
service or a product next project
initiated after some time is to optimize
something similarly at the end of the
product life cycle project is initiated
to retire the product or services so in
a given product life cycle there will be
multiple Project Life Cycle so what is
involved in the Project Life Cycle it
involves five areas five groups we can
call it as so initiation planning
execution monitor ring and closure so
when I say initiation it's up all about
understanding what is Project giving the
basic understanding of the project
collating the details and having key
stakeholders identified once that is
done one will move towards planning so
here in the initiation it is very
clearly one has to understand is Project
is worthwhile of doing so one has to
check the feasibility one has to measure
that particular investment is making
sense and then confirm yes it makes
sense to invest now next planning as we
have a basic understanding of yes this
project has to be done and a discussion
with the key stakeholders have happened
now that moves towards planning now in
planning one will understand the project
in entirety if it is a waterfall
approach one has to have a clear
articulation of entire project a
comprehensive details holistic approach
now if you go if you're going in a
project in a agile way of approach now
in this learning you may have a big
skeleton as you go in each of the
iteration you may go deep dive into
detail planning if it is a agile
approach so planning provides you the
clear Insight towards what needs to be
done in this project how it has to be
done and what are the results which can
be achieved out of that particular
project so this involves making that a
clear blueprint of an project objectives
what we are supposed to achieve so this
will become a reference point throughout
the Project Life Cycle then execution as
you have a blueprint of the project as
the direction of that project is set
detailing of the project has been made
one will go ahead and execute the
project execute in a sense
implementation acquiring resources and
implementing it so execution phase
involves the allocation of resources and
making the deliverables as required you
acquire resources you configure a
resource you ensure right resources are
acquired if it is human resource one has
to educate the human resource with the
project required knowledge or details or
one has to provide that assignment in
such a way that skills of that
individuals what they should have is
acquired by those individuals so that
deliverables can happen and they needs
to be managed the entire team needs to
be managed for that a clear structure
has to be created similarly when you do
technology resource perspective those
components has to be tested configured
then integrated again tested for
unchecked the performances so Collective
action of this results in a deliverable
during the execution so as the
deliverables are happening in the
execution it is quite obvious project
manager has to monitor review control
that particular deliverable and also the
processes tools resources used during
the project even those needs to be
monitored so that they are complying to
the defined processes so during
monitoring there may be a deviation one
can found during monitoring there may be
the project is running the way it is
required so in this monitoring phase it
involves an action from project manager
to Monitor and control the work of the
project so comparing with the blueprint
of plan what is accomplished what is
created during the planning phase of
this project and as the execution
happens monitoring and control is
monitoring it and checking is that
activity is what is being done is
according to the plan or not similarly
the deliverables which comes as an
output of our projects are tested
thoroughly whether those have a specific
features and functionality and are they
functioning the way it is required now
project has to be delivered to the scope
what is defined it should not go beyond
that or below that similarly the
schedule what is made for the project
within that schedule project deliverable
system accomplished within the cost what
is budgeted for the project so during
the project your project manager may
find there are certain deviations which
are occurred there are additional
challenges which has come in so for this
reason one has to ensure continued
monitoring as the execution happens and
identifies a deviation and ensure
Whenever there is a deviation there is a
correction Whenever there is an
additional things coming in that needs
to be considered carefully whether that
need to be involved as part of this
deliverable or should be taken it
separately so this requires lot of
conversation with all the stakeholders
of the project during the entire Project
Life Cycle especially during planning
execution monitoring and control since
they are not the one which is happening
in sequence so planning can also come
back again where there is something
which you may require to modify so may
require to have a change in the
blueprint Itself by adding that new
changes coming in so you go back to
planning so planning execution
monitoring and control are going hand in
hand so that project deliverables are
happening as needed similarly all the
process or instructions all those
templates what is given are used one is
complying to those requirement it is
very important and project is done
within the scope schedule and time and
the quality metrics defined then as the
completion of the project happens as the
monitoring and control says yes
deliverable has happened according to
the requirement then the project moves
to the closure the closure may be
closure of a specific project phase a
milestone deliverable or a phrasal
deliverable or it can be deliverable at
the end of the project which is the
ultimate deliverable so processes in
closing has to be triggered Whenever
there is end of the phase Whenever there
is a deliverable to conclude and also at
the end of the project to conclude the
entire project so during the closure one
has to ensure capturing all the details
in terms of what is accomplished against
what is defined what went wrong what
went well what is a learning one has to
take to the next level or the next phase
or to the next project and at the same
time a sign off has to be obtained
formally and everything should be
summarized and have a good handshake
with the project stakeholder mainly a
business or customer and also
disseminating of Team means you will
dismantle the entire team and send them
back to their specific units or
specialization and they may get assigned
to new project or if it is a functional
they can go back to their functions to
do their functional activities so that
was about entire Project Life Cycle what
happens now while doing this I mentioned
there are six constraints that is scope
schedule cost quality risk and resources
so keeping these in mind one has to
ensure project is successful in all
aspects so to become successful there
are few key areas which has to be looked
at so first six key areas are scope
schedule cost quality resources and
stakeholders now let us look at the
scope what the scope means scope is
about what needs to be delivered what is
in scope what is out of the scope so
this refers to all those deliverable
scope all those activity scope basically
we speak about two things one is product
scope and project scope product scope is
all about ensuring the features
functionality of products are well
defined and understood and signed off
and while delivering that product that
is tested against those defined features
and functionalities whereas projects go
focus on all the activities needs to be
done all those templates which has to be
used all the process which has to be
complied with all that skills which is
required to be applied so this is going
as defined so by doing this activities
which is defined as part of project
scope the result the deliverable will
come out which will be in line with the
deliverables features and functionality
which is defined as part of product
scope it is very important to ensure
entire projects happens within this
particular scope there should not be any
deviations from this schedule
perspective for that specifications what
we have defined for a product and a
project so these needs to be done in a
specific point in time means in a
specific schedule there will be start
time and time right so one has to plan
how long a project would take and what
are the deliverables should happen in
what sequence what activities are
required to accomplish this so all these
needs to be understood so while
performing the schedule management one
has to look at a specific deliverable at
a specific point in time by applying a
specific set of activities required so
this will tell you the duration of the
project this will provide you the
sequence of project this will also help
you to understand the dependency between
one task to another task this will also
help you to understand how the
deliverables happening in what sequence
which helps in prioritizing your
deliverables third is cost so as we know
to do any project it is very essential
to ensure project happens within that
budget so project cost is estimated
initially then that estimated cost will
be checked checked in terms of is the
assumptions considerations are right or
wrong is that really so much of a
monetary Source or required for the
project and then after understanding the
justification and obtaining the clarity
budget is I mean monetary resources are
allocated and confirmed approved then it
will become a budget that will be a cost
Baseline so these estimation allocation
of budget once it happens that will
become a base and any deviations from
that cannot happen so easily so any
deviations because of additional of
scope that can be handled through change
management but idealistic scenario the
cost should not escalate or come down
organization can also set certain
tolerances at the project level
considering various different scenarios
like scenario of risks scenario of
something which deviated from the
deliverable so to what extent it can
deviate that tolerance will also be set
at the economic or monetary value
perspective that is about cost
now quality as we know quality is a very
important area which ensures the project
is delivered in time with all the
specifications defined by using all the
methods means by following all the
processes work instructions templates
and delivering as needed where it
enables the project to monitor it easily
so basically the requirement of
compliance and standardization and
optimization is to ensure everyone
follows the same steps to the activity
so what quality management focus is to
ensure the intended objectives of a
projects are achieved already there is a
definition done in terms of various
different practices or processes needs
to be followed similarly specification
of each of the products are defined and
from that there should not be any
deviation so quality management should
focus on ensuring those activities are
done as defined those deliverables are
done according to the specifications
what is different it is very important
that way so for that there is a layer of
quality management should be a layer of
quality management where auditing our
control activities are initiated
periodically so that any deviations can
be seen easily and remember a project
manager can become cannot become part of
quality management like project manager
cannot audit project manager should have
a team or take the help of a team who
can able to do mostly the one which is
who is not part of the project is always
better resources now as I mentioned
earlier every project need resources it
may be human resources it may be
technology resources it may be any other
resources which are required to do the
project so organization acquires
resources configured and then deployed
for example in a project you acquire a
server you configure a server you deploy
a server technology resource human
resource is onboarded recruited project
induction is given then at the same time
the skills and capabilities of
individuals are according to the
requirement of project that needs to be
ensured and what needs to be delivered
and how it has to be delivered should be
cleared to the particular human resource
so looking at all the aspects of
resources to acquire to build and manage
it is very important to look at the
resource management so this will help in
carrying out a specific task in a
project in a best possible manner so
interestingly when I say human resource
always there is a possibility that a
conflict can occur so when I say
conflict conflict of interest may be in
terms of what the individuals has to do
conflict in terms of the preferences in
terms of solutions what they are looking
at conflict in terms of using resources
different opinions different preferences
various reasons conflict and come across
so it is very important to project
manager to understand this dynamics of
human resources and manage this
conflicts project manager cannot shy
away from handling conflicts project
manager has to hone and resolve those
conflicts in the favor of project not in
the favor of any individuals so there
are various techniques to look at
resolving conflicts so that is like
compromising problem solving smoothening
accommodating so whichever helps for
that project scenario for the project
objectives that needs to be applied that
technique has to be taken up so here the
resolution is not at the specific
individual's preference it is with the
objective of other projects as any
impact what kind of impact positive or
negative if it is negative no that's not
the direction the direction should be
ensuring project gets that value through
this conflict resolution so project
manager should own it it's an
accountability of a project manager then
as the human resources are acquired
there are five stages Team Dynamics are
involved so one has to bring them then
educate them about a project as a
education on the project happens one has
to go and do the job on floor that needs
to be observed means one has to manage
by looking at it and any corrections
needs to be done that needs to be guided
so it is very Dynamic thing when it
comes to Human Resources similarly in
technology resources standardization
there is no ambiguity as such but right
Resources with the right configurations
should be acquired that is very
important the next stakeholders so who
can be stakeholders every project will
have a stakeholder who are internal and
external to the project so the internal
stakeholders are those who are part of
the project who are part of the
organization or part of the customer
organization or part of supplier
organization a competition to my
business means my organization's
business all this we can call it as a
stakeholders now every stakeholders will
have a specific interest a power an
ability to influence now through their
position through their distance from the
project they will get impacted at the
same time they will also impact the
project similarly they influence and
they get influenced because of the
project so a project manager should
identify all the stakeholders and
understand this what is the kind of
stakeholder is this in terms of power in
terms of legitimacy in terms of
influence in terms of impact after
understanding that there should be a
strategy for handling the stakeholders
how am I going to engage with these
stakeholders it is very important and
accordingly the engagement should happen
and then stakeholder engagement should
resolve in the favor of projects again
so if it is a customer customer should
get the inputs required through review
or periodic updates and the engagement
required with the customer so that
customer is having up-to-date
information about the project if it is a
team continued monitoring and control
and ensuring team delivers the results
what is required so focus of a
stakeholder should be in such a way that
your strategy should enable project to
become successful and get a proper
response from the stakeholder means a
supporting engagement so next few key
Focus areas to mention is communication
risk procurement critical success
factors deliverables and work breakdown
so this list is not exhaustive as we
Deep dive into project I think you can
just keep listing the key Focus areas
more than this but whatever we have
indicated are the minimum which needs to
be looked at so when I say communication
communication is basically a
conversation exchange of message which
happens between two entities now
whenever we communicate it is necessary
to understand that it has to happen with
two individuals or two entities there
should be sender there should be
receiver in the absence of receiver if
sending is happening that communication
doesn't make any sense there should be a
receiver and there should be an
acknowledgment from the receiver now
this is one of the most ignored area in
many of the projects even the
communication happens more often more
frequently but what people face
difficulty in realizing that as they
communicate generally informally
formally they just take those for
granted now when you identify the
stakeholder one has to understand what
is the communication requirement for
those stakeholders what is that
communication why is that communication
what is the content of the communication
how frequently we should do that
interactions or Communications intent of
that particular communication what is
the expected action or response from
that communication all this needs to be
very very clear and this can be
articulated it has to be articulated so
one it is articulated once there is a
picture in terms of what kind of
communication has to happen it is quite
obvious there should not be any
deviation from the agreed Communications
requirements and whenever there is a
need of change to the communication
requirements from the stakeholders that
needs to be updated for this one
established stakeholders identified so
stakeholder management and communication
are very closely linked and Associated a
engagement with the stakeholder will
become successful with an effective
communication approaches next is risk so
every project which is undertaken by
organization that will have certain
amount of risk which organization will
evaluate similarly within the Project
Life Cycle lot of risk comes up which
would have certain impact to the project
now risk refers to by definition an
uncertain event it has an uncertainty an
event which is uncertain and when it
occurs it will have an impact on the
project positively or negatively now
current scenario in everywhere the
projects What You observe closely people
tend to look at the risk which are
threats that is negative only but they
fail to recognize the risks which are
opportunities the positive risks so
another gap which we see when do the
risk management is that is done in the
initial phase of the project as the
project is kicked off someone will do
the risk assessment have a list of risk
identified but unfortunately there is no
categorizations for that risk and how is
that going to impact the project that is
not clear thirdly risk management or
list of risk are created only once it is
not done repeatedly so risk
identification and Analysis and
assessment of that risk has to be done
throughout the life cycle of your
project reason being the risk which
looks as in high impact when project is
initiated as the project progresses the
impact levels will vary maybe in the
middle bit of the project the impact may
be very high or low so likewise the
impacts of the risk will vary throughout
the Project Life Cycle it may be
positive it may be negative so as you
identify the stakeholder throughout the
Project Life Cycle as I said that is
also a dynamic I cannot just have a list
of stakeholders and I keep it as it is I
need to update that also regularly risk
identification assessment and Analysis
should also be done regularly
periodically so that one will have a
clear understanding about is that risk
still valid is that risk is there still
or not what is the level of variations
in terms of impact of the risks so this
clarity will be there so that necessary
organization or project manager can get
ready to face those risks if it is a
negative risk definitely you should have
a mitigation or avoidance or acceptance
whatever the mitigation plan you have to
eliminate the negative impact of the
risk when it occurs okay if it is a
positive risk it's quite obvious one has
to take the advantage of that one has to
enhance exploit share a positive risk so
that organization is benefited further
procurement so whenever a project is
initiated whenever a project is taken up
the organization who is doing the
project cannot create everything cannot
develop everything in that Project Life
Cycle so organization would take a
decision make a decision stating that
some of the deliverables we make
ourselves some of the products we make
ourselves some of the products we
purchase some of the services we
purchase so to purchase that has to
happen from a specific supplier you
cannot go with every supplier you should
evaluate those suppliers qualify the
supplier errors and then select onboard
the supplier and then get the services
or products supplied by that particular
supplier so while doing this one has to
understand what type of Contracting they
need to enter with so three types of
contracts we speak basically one is
about a Cost Plus contract where cost is
fully known to the project manager and
to the organization so apart from known
cost a fee will be paid to the supplier
another one is fixed price where project
manager or the organization who is
awarding that contract to A supplier
will not know what is the cost instead
it is a fixed price but important here
is the scope of work needs to be clearly
articulated and defined another type of
Contracting can be time and material
where the billing will happen based on
the amount of time one is spent on that
particular a higher resource or onboard
resource entertainment material basis
and what is the effort that resource has
been put based on that building will
happen so three types of contracts
depending on the different scenarios of
the project will be signed with the
contractor however before doing that it
is very essential to identify those
suppliers sign off with them and monitor
and manage them so if deliverables are
not there it is very essential to look
at the termination known as to terminate
otherwise one has to ensure instead of
uh terminating should be able to put
some effort to educate them also so that
they come up to the market so project is
benefited so depending on what needs to
be done that call has to be taken on a
regular basis then critical success
factor so for every project there should
be an articulation of critical success
factor So based on that one can confirm
yes project has achieved his objectives
our project has not achieved its
objectives so key is a critical success
factor should be supported through the
metrics key performance indicators so
key performance indicators provide those
metrics to say critical success factor
is achieved for example if you want to
become successful in an exam critical
success factor is scoring or passing the
exam domination or let me say to pass
the examination key performance
indicator is scoring 60 and above so
critical success factor for me to get
promoted is to pass in this particular
exam so to pass in this exam minimum I
should score is 60 percent that is kpi
passing in the exam that is critical
success factor so how will I measure
that success factor is kpi so every
project which it produces a specific
product or Services by using a specific
resources and each of these the
resources the processes the templates
the deliverables all these needs to be
measured on a continual basis so there
are critical success factors defined and
those are measured by defining kpis to
the critical success factors so
basically critical success factor
provides the Insight towards what needs
to be measured and when you measure what
should be the focus and to achieve those
critical success factors the indicator
is key performance indicators when you
measure yes the moment you achieve that
your CSF is achieved next deliverables
so deliverables are those which comes as
an output of the project right it may be
a product it may be a service it may be
result so this refers to the output
within the scope of a project so there
can be one or more deliverables within a
single project so these deliverables may
be the items that are to be sent
externally to a customer or a
stakeholder so every deliverable will
have a defined scope will have a defined
specification so those derivatables has
to be measured tested and one has to
confirm yes this deliverable is
performing as we are intended to have
the performance accordingly the decision
will happen should we accept this
particular deliverable or not if there
any deviation that has to go back for
correction so that's the reason we have
monitoring and control all the control
processes like control quality focused
on the product straight whether it has
achieved that results or not is that
functional as needed or not one has to
ensure these deliverables has all those
features and functionalities only then
that can can be handed over to the
respective stakeholder customer or
operation whoever the stakeholder it is
next is work breakdown structure so when
we say work breakdown structure when I
look at a specific piece of product or
services and have a bigger picture I
cannot even visualize the various
different components various different
actions involved in achieving that
bigger deliverable so if I say a car so
I can think of a body external I can
think of a mirror on that body I can
think of a glass in the front side as
well as the back side and also I can
think of Interiors like seat then
accelerator steering dashboard only
second visualize but since I am not a
technology expert relating to car can I
visualize all those parts which are
working inside for car to move like
engine the battery assembly I don't know
what to say further so all these can be
visualized by an expert so every product
or Services should be broken down into
multiple pieces I'm not saying go and
break that product I am saying that
product will have multiple components
which are involved those needs to be
segregated for example if I say cars
exteriors cars interior so cars
exteriors external items you can see
whatever you visualize body body
structure mirror mirror assembly
headlights then tires so likewise
whatever I can visualize I will make it
as a line items under the exterior so
under for example under a mirror mirror
I can speak about mirror glass mirror
cap mirror pedestal and mirror assembly
where it moves where you can move the
mirror so these are the various
components involved in a mirror so I
need to ensure by breaking down the
product into multiple levels the Depots
decomposing it to multiple levels I can
able to visualize the product very
clearly what is there in detail so once
I have the details I will articulate
those what is that particular work
breakdown element is product breakdown
element is then I will look at what
skills and capability is required for
the product and I will assign the
resources accordingly so once activities
resources everything is assigned
automatically this will become our
breakdown structure further after
creating our breakdown structure one
will go on sequence the activity look at
sequencing will happen based on in what
priority deliverable should happen What
order deliverable should happen then
once the sequencing is done it will be
checked to see whether anything can be
optimized anything can be done in such a
way that smooth flow of the project can
happen there is no dependencies which
will make project to delay like as the
flow happens smoothly so you would find
the various techniques like critical
path method Network diagramming critical
chain method so all these are used the
floats of an activities are checked then
leads and lags of the activities the
relationship between activities so
accordingly full visualization in terms
of how the project will flow and how in
what order the deliverables are
happening can be easily visualized so
that is the reason first activity is to
do the product breakdown which would
result in what regular structure so
those are the points till now whatever I
mentioned are the basic understanding
one should have about a project and
project management so as you deep dive
into various best practices like PMP by
PMI prince2 by axelos scrum Master scrum
Master similarly you have certified
scrum master so many agile practices so
when you look at any of the best
practices that will tell you clearly
articulate what should be the practice
for you to adopt and adapt that
practices so that your project can
become successful so any of those
approach you touch upon all those refers
to these basic things in the absence of
these basic things none of those best
practices discusses the project
management now typically in the industry
there are a lot of job roles to the
project management which we have seen so
based on that this information is
captured here on various job rules in a
project management so some of them are
like project manager so senior project
manager Project Lead resource manager
pmo that is project management office
analyst steering committee member so not
necessarily all the project management
roles are limited to this so these are
the roles which commonly you see and we
are trying to capture that to give the
Insight right when I say project manager
the project manager is the owner one has
to take an accountability for the
project right so project managers takes
the project according to the plan and
plays a lead role in all the steps of
the project management right so
responsibility should be managing
reviewing and prioritizing the task
wherever necessary looking after risk
management stakeholder management and
project communication management some of
the salary what we found while we were
doing the survey the success ratio of a
project depends majorly on the project
manager so the demand for project
manager is rapidly increasing in the
market so accordingly uh
75474 per year that is a USD in INR it
is fifteen hundred thousand so this is
what the salary of an approximation what
was found next role we look at senior
project manager where senior project
manager is ahead of the overall project
management plan the role demands
in-depth knowledge of all the project
aspects on a specific on the specifics
of the project the responsibilities
would be planning and coordinating
complex projects visiting project sites
to check progress and handle complex
issues so salary looks like one not four
thousand dollars per year here twenty
ninety two thousand INR per year so the
role of senior project manager is one of
the highest paying roles in the industry
as we have seen having several
allowances and bonuses because of the
criticality involved in the project and
the accountability level of that
particular individuals in the
organization next role Project Lead so
project leads are the one who leads the
people throughout the project and
provide them with all the information
required throughout so responsibilities
involved motivating the team benefit
taking care of their needs and paying
attention to what they feel ordering or
controlling the project team since the
project lead has more freedom than the
project manager salary Project Lead
makes sure that project gives the best
possible outcome and is hence the demand
for the project lead in the company
never reduces so in USD 82 000 per year
whereas in INR it is one million to
sixty nine thousand per year next roll I
will cut on resource manager so resource
manager is the human resource needed to
make the project success right so one
has to manage those resources
responsibility involved assigning the
right people to the right projects at
the right time managing employees
currently and determining hiring needs
depending on the Project's requirements
so salary would be around 64 000 USD
which comes around 966 794 in INR
project management office analyst for
this role the project management office
analyst works with pmo means project
management office and does not look at
the project or manage the project
directly instead does most of the data
driven work which required for a project
to have our project to get supported by
that so that project managers will have
better Insight analyzing and
interpreting the data concerning the
project figuring out the future risks to
the project finding new ways to advance
the idea of the project management so
salary would be one or six thousand two
fifty three per year in USD whereas 449
thousands 337 in INR per year so
steering committee member so the
steering committee members are the
members who do not work on the project
themselves they are there to help the
project manager like providing inputs
during the development of a project
advising on the budget and evaluating
the project strategies taking regular
feedbacks on the project managers and
asking necessary questions so salary
would be around 68 497 dollars per year
so those were the various rules and that
is not that list is not an exhaustive
list various different roles we come
across but these are the basic roles
which is seen in the industry these
roles are being recruited now there are
various project management
certifications which are offered as I
mentioned earlier so those
certifications are PMP that is project
management professional from PMI agile
certified practitioner that is PMI ACP
again from PMI then certified associate
in project management so difference
between capm and PMP is like capm would
act as a basic level of certification
for those who does not have a sufficient
project experience project management
experience whereas pmps for those was
some project management experience
similarly PMI sap is the one who is
aspiring to look at agility in project
management and they can go for it
certified scrum Master yes it is a scrum
Master certificate which will explain
the role of a scrum master in detail
similarly prints to a certification from
axolos which also speak about all the
aspects of the project what we discussed
and provides the framework for for
project management axillos also provides
Princeton certification in agile also
agile prints to certification so we will
look at each one of this certain details
which are required for us to know so
project management professional as I
mentioned is most acknowledged and value
the certificate value what it carries
which has resulted to the certified
Professionals in landing up in highest
paid jobs in the world so certified
managers gets 20 percent more salary
than the average salary so to take up an
examination one has to go through the
formal training of 35 hours that is one
of the prerequisites and there should be
some experience of 4 500 hours of
project managing project by Leading
rovery's activities of a project and
once the person becomes eligible with
their prerequisites person will become
register in the pmis website becomes
member and then go for examination so
examination fee for PMP would be 4.5
dollars for the members who are
registered with PMI and for those who
are not registered as a member with PMI
it is 555 the duration of the
examination is 4 hours and the number of
questions will be 200 which are multiple
choice questions so is each questions
carries one marks there is no negative
score now prerequisites one has to have
4 500 hours directing and leading the
projects that experience has to be
filled in while filling the application
if a person is a bachelor degree holder
and along with the 35 contactors of PM
education now prerequisites for the one
who is not a graduate who may be high
school or diplomo is 7500 hours of
directing and leading projects 35 hours
of PM education so those are the
prerequisites before one will go on
appear for examination so once an
individual passes PMP examination that
certificate is valid for three years so
now after three years if the person
aspires to keep the certificate
continued they need to produce 60 pdus
professional develop units which has to
be acquired during those three years how
to acquire one has to go through
additional learning one has to
contribute towards project management
knowledge base so those needs to be
evidenced and then renewable fee has to
be paid and certificate has to be
renewed then agile certified
practitioner as we saw for PMP here
agile certified practitioner
demonstrates that one has relevant
experience and education to handle and
Lead agile projects the organization has
started shifting towards agile as we
know in today's industry which makes
this certification fast growing in the
world so examination fee would be 435
dollars for PMI members 495 for non-pmi
members duration is three hours and
multiple choice questions 120 questions
prerequisites is 2 000 hours project
management experience with thousand five
hundred hours agile experience and 21
contact hours of agile practices so
maintenance 30 videos are required for
every three years and after paying the
renewal fee that can be renewed now
certified associate in project
management so here this is an entry
level certificate of PMI especially for
those people who has less project
experience it intends to demonstrate
fundamental knowledge terminologies and
processes of effective project
management so examination fee would be
dollar 225 for PMI members whereas 300
dollars for non-members of PMI so
duration of examination is three hours
and examination will have 150 multiple
choice questions so prerequisites
someone who has secondary diploma 23
contact hours of PM education is enough
there is no experience of doing the
project is required as we saw in PMP so
maintenance is again three years someone
only to continue this certification as
to retake the examination every three
years next certified scrum master so
certified scrum Master is an entry level
certification that helps the
professionals to begin as the scrum
practitioners is one of the most sought
after certified applications as other
after this one can get the designation
of certified scrum Master which is
offered by scrum Alliance so examination
fee which will change time to time which
is not revealed so one has to approach
the training organization where they
will get trained on certified scrum
master so duration of examination is 60
minutes and pattern would be 16 hours 2
days of training and 50 multiple choice
questions after that particular two days
of train then prerequisite is done for
maintaining these credentials so one has
to ensure it has renewed every two years
then projects in controlled environment
that is prince2 so prince2 is a method
which is effective mostly from the base
of UK all the organizations who are from
UK region prefer prints to certification
and it is as popular as any other
project management certifications like
PMP so examination fee would vary from
900 to thousand dollars depending on
where exactly you're taking the
examination and certification will
happen at two levels one is at
Foundation level and other one is
practitioner so in Foundation it is 60
Questions multiple choice and in
practitioner it is 68 questions now 60
questions or 68 questions each carries
one marks for correct answer any wrong
answer there will not be any negative
scoring one has to score 55 percent to
clear the examination so prerequisites
for prince2 foundation is none whereas
prince2 Foundation is a prerequisite for
principal practitioner examination so to
maintain the certificate one has to
achieve 20 cpts every year continued

looking to get certified as a project

aspect of project management as a career
that is salary of a project manager

sixty thousand dollars to seventy
thousand dollars
senior project managers or those in
leadership positions can earn salaries
exceeding 120 000 and project managers
even reach 150 000 or more
entry level project managers in India
can expect to earn an annual salary of
around 8 to 12 lakhs per annum senior or
highly experienced project managers can
earn salaries ranging from 12 to 28
lakhs per annum now we'll see some of
the top companies hiring Network
engineers
these companies are Amazon Google
Microsoft Apple Facebook IBM Cisco
Systems Intel and Deloitte hi guys my
name is ishan and I welcome you all to
this session of project planning today
we will be learning about different
aspects of project planning but before
we begin let's have a look at an
incident here's Max an assistant project
manager who looks tensed and is pacing
around the room then Jack a project
manager who works with him walks into
the room and asks him why does he seem
so tensed to which Max replies he's
facing difficulty in estimating the
budget Jack responds it might be because
he is not planning the project properly
Jack reassures Max and begins to tell
him about project planning so today we
will be learning about what is Project
planning and check out the fundamentals
of project planning then we will see why
project planning is so essential for a
project to be successful after that we
will check the tools for project
planning and finally we will have a look
at the steps for project planning so
without any further Ado let's begin with
what is Project planning project
planning is the second step or phase of
the Project Life Cycle Project Life
Cycle has five different phrases from
initiation to closure today we will be
learning about this phase that comes
immediately after initiation in which
the project plan is documented and
further requirements are defined project
planning includes the following things
the first and foremost thing is
describing the objectives or outputs we
are expecting the project to yield
second we have is the elaboration of the
scope to make sure what the project is
all about and what all can be expected
from the project the third step we have
is forming a schedule this schedule is
important to run or perform different
tasks of a project each task having its
own start date and end date this helps a
project to finish in the scheduled time
and limit lastly we have making and
generating progress reports in which all
that went during the tenure of the
project is documented this helps in
evaluating the project and helps in the
forthcoming projects now let's have a
look at the project planning
fundamentals the First Fundamental that
we have is the determination of scope
cost and resources that determination
helps us in having a rough estimate
about the time that is required to
finish the project it helps us in
determining the number of people
required and what should be their skill
set we can divide the project into
smaller manageable sections and this is
made possible with the help of work
breakdown structure the second
fundamental refers to identifying the
problem there are several techniques by
which we can collect information and
discover issues there may be several
problems in a project and in that case
several risks or issues are prioritized
and the risk that requires immediate
attention is dealt with first then comes
identification of stakeholders when we
can identify the stakeholders we can
know who all will be affected and in
what way which helps us having a better
understanding of the project
stakeholders may be anybody they may be
the part of the project team or project
managers or customers they help during
the project and contribute to its
success then the last fundamental we
will discuss is defining project
objectives a project plan is made
keeping in mind the requirements of the
project team and expectations of the
stakeholders if the project team can
meet the expectations of the
stakeholders then only we can say that
the project is successful now when we
know about project planning and its
fundamentals it's time to see why
project planning is so important project
planning reduces the cost and time of
the project as every step is monitored
and optimized in the best possible
manner project planning increases
employee satisfaction as every employee
who is a part is engaged in the team for
improved project performance project
planning helps in the implementation of
quality assurance as the output of every
step is duly tested lastly project
planning helps in reducing project risk
as planning helps to analyze prioritize
and deal with that risk moving on let's
have a look at the tools for project
planning the first tool that we have is
a Gantt chart today Gantt charts are one
of the most popular project management
tools they help in tracking the status
of the work at a particular time and
their independencies on each other Gantt
charts help in showing different phases
and steps involved in a project the
second tool we will talk about is
critical path method or CPM critical
path method helps in scheduling the
project activities so that the project
runs properly the critical path method
focuses on the longest stretch of
dependent tasks and determines the time
needed to complete them the next tool is
Project evaluation and review technique
or per chart pert provides a graphical
representation of the Project's timeline
explaining the independencies of
different tasks this tool not only helps
in making a schedule but also helps in
coordinating with all the team members
the fourth tool we will check is work
breakdown structure work breakdown
structure is a very common tool that
makes it possible for the team to break
its work into manageable sections work
breakdown structure is a step to step
process that helps in completing the
project efficiently the last tool we
will see is Project documentation
project documentation is an integral
part of the project life cycle project
documentation helps in understanding the
mistakes done during the project and
more importantly provides guidelines for
the upcoming project now when we know
about different tools for project
planning it becomes essential that we
know the necessary steps of project
planning there are seven steps in
Project planning let's have a look at
each of them in detail the first step is
identification of stakeholders as we
have discussed stakeholders could be
anybody they could be a part of the team
or a project manager or a customer when
we identify stakeholders we can find out
the expectations and requirements that
are to be looked upon in this project
this gives us a clearer picture of the
project and helps in establishing the
Project's goal so the next step we have
is defining the project scope this helps
in determining a list of specific
project goals and deliverables that are
to be achieved during the course of the
project after we have defined the
project scope it is time to set project
objectives and prioritize them the
initial ideas that were there before are
now elaborated and final steps to
complete the project are defined in the
next step the deliverables are
determined after all project
deliverables are the only reason why the
project is being created this step
involves finding out what these
deliverables will be and the deadlines
of the delivery then the step that comes
into picture is creating a project
schedule module the project schedule
refers to the guidelines when a
particular task is to be started and
when it is supposed to end this helps in
monitoring the growth of the project and
later helps in generating progress
reports the next step is the step of
risk analysis this step plays an
extremely important role in the success
of the overall project it helps in
identifying the risk prioritizing them
and taking steps to limit them the last
step in Project planning is to generate
progress reports in this step we update
the stakeholders about the project
growth and it is done so that all the
concerned team members can have a look
at the progress of the project after all
this information Max thanks Jack for the
explanation and looks forward to plan
projects within the budget and of better
quality in this session we will talk
about project plan in Excel we will
learn about a project plan and how we
can make an effective plan in Microsoft
Excel before we begin let's have a look
at all the topics we will be covering
today first we will see the basics of a
project plan then we will check the
process of project management in
Microsoft Excel and why should one refer
to Microsoft Excel apart from this we
will learn about how to make a Gantt
chart in Excel towards the end we will
check some Microsoft Excel templates so
without any further Ado let's get
started let's see what is a project plan
project plan is a basic thing that is
needed to execute a project according to
project management book of knowledge a
project can be defined as an approved
elaborative document that guides the
team during project execution and
project control when we are making a
project plan a project plan must answer
several questions for us these questions
are like what are we expecting our
project to deliver how are we expecting
to get our deliverables within the
desired time who all will be a part of a
project and what tasks they will have in
the project when will the project start
and when it is expected to end that is
the deadlines of the project now let us
learn about project management in Excel
Microsoft Excel is one of the most
common application these days it is used
in both offices and at homes Microsoft
Excel is an easy project management tool
that allows the team members to easily
see the task in a project develop a plan
and track its progress before we learn
more about project management in Excel
let's first have a look why do we use
Excel Microsoft Excel is an easy tool to
plan a project so it can be used by
people who are beginners in terms of
project management in Excel one can find
several analytical tools like
concatenate Len and counter so this
makes data analysis easy and effective
as the entry of data is easy same is
tracking and controlling our project
status then there are several project
management templates in Excel that help
us to have an effective distribution of
project data we will be checking several
project management templates towards the
end of this video now let's have a look
at the process of making a Gantt chart
in Excel before we begin this it's
important we know what is a Gantt chart
a Gantt chart is like a horizontal bar
chart that is used for project
management with the help of a Gantt
chart we can check the status of the
task the date they start the date the
end and the dependencies on each other
Gantt chart helps in coordinating and
monitoring different tasks in a project
now let's have a look at the steps that
will help us in making a Gantt chart
first step we have is make a project
table we have several rows and columns
like here we have three columns in the
First Column we have the tasks in the
second we have a start date and in the
third column we have the duration or
tenure of the task the second step is to
make a bar chart in Excel for this we
will select the entire second column
then we will go on the insert Tab and
click on the bar graph chart there we
can select stack bar graph in 2D bar
charts as a result we will have the
entitled bar graph on the screen in the
third step we will add the duration to
the bar graph we will right click on the
chart and in the menu that appears we
will select select data option a window
that appears on the screen in that
window we will select add option as
shown we can also see the start date is
already in the entry section then in the
dialog box that appears type tenure in
the series name and click on the Range
selection icon that's shown in the
figure now select the relevant data from
the tenure column and click on ok now we
can see a bar graph that has two colors
on the screen this bar graph now has the
duration of the tasks the fourth step we
have is adding description to the Gantt
chart now we will open the box again and
in that box we will select the edit
option as shown in the figure then we
will select the tasks as we had selected
the duration of the tasks before and
click on OK we can now see the tasks
have appeared towards the left side of
the Gantt chart the fifth and the
remarkable step will help us convert
this bar graph into a Gantt chart we
will now click on the bars and select
the format data series option from the
menu that appears then in the format
data series dialog box we will select no
fill option we can find our Gantt chart
on the screen now in accordance with the
data that we had entered now we can see
the tasks on the left side are in the
reverse order so what we will do next is
we will click on the task panel then go
to the format access dialog box and
select the categories in reverse order
option now we can find our tasks in the
right order one more thing we can notice
is Gantt chart is starting with some
other date and not with the dates that
we had entered so for this we will copy
the first date in some other L then
clicking on the copied cell we will go
to the home menu to select the dialog
box as shown in the figure then in that
drop down menu you will select the
number option we can now find a value
displayed in the copied cell we'll copy
that value click on the dates on the
chart and as the format access dialog
box opens you will paste that value in
the box that says minimum shown in the
figure as a result we will have our
final Gantt chart on the screen in the
last step we can give several designs to
a Gantt chart change colors and make it
more presentable for us now when we know
the basic steps of making a Gantt chart
I will show that practically to you in
Microsoft Excel our first step is to
open Microsoft Excel and in Microsoft
Excel we will make a project table in a
project table we will have three columns
the First Column will be task the second
column will have the start date the
third column will have tenure or the
duration of the task so beginning with
tasks we have task one in Task 1 we have
1.1 one point 0.2 1.3 then comes task 2.
in task 2 we have 2.1 2.2 2.3 and 2.4
then we have task 3 in task 3 we will
have two subsections 3.1 and 3.2 then we
will start with the starting dates in
starting dates we will put 1st January
the Task 1 1.1 will be first of January
then this will be 4th January let's say
this is 5th January then we will put
this as 11th of January and this will be
again 11th January only this will be
15th January let's put this as 17th
January let this be 19th January task 3
begins on 23rd January
and it the 3.2 section begins at 26th of
January now let's put the tenure or the
duration of the task we will begin with
task 1. it takes 12 days and 1.1 takes 7
days we say this takes four days and
this takes 8 days then for task 2 it
again takes 12 days it takes 5 days 5
days and let's say this takes 6 days and
this takes four days then we come to
task three this takes eight days and
let's say this takes six days and the
3.2 section takes five days so this is
how a project table is ready in the
second step we will select the entire
second column after we have selected
this column we will go to the insert tab
in the insert tab we'll go to the bar
columns and in this we will select 2D
stacked bar charts now we have the
entitle bar chart in accordance to our
data on the screen then comes the third
step we will add the duration of the
tasks to the bar graph we will click on
the chart and after we click on the
chart we will select select data option
in the select data source dialog box we
find the start date is already there now
we will click on ADD and after we click
on add in the series name section we
will put tenure then in the series value
we will click on this icon and select
the entire tenure series and click on OK
so this is the bar graph that we have
now this is now in two colors the orange
color and the blue color this bar graph
now has the duration of all the tasks in
our project table now in the fourth step
now it's time for us to add description
to our Gantt chart instead of this one
two three four five we will put Task 1
task 2 and the sub tasks so what we will
do is we will again go to that box we
will left click on the Gantt chart
select the select data option and then
we'll go to the start date here we'll
select the edit option in the edit
option we will select all the tasks and
click on ok now we can see all the tasks
are aligned towards the left of the bar
chart as we can see this is a bar chart
or a bar graph and not a Gantt chart the
next step we have is converting this bar
graph into a guide chart so we will
click on the bars and select the format
data series option from the menu that
appears here we have this format data
series option now we can see the dialog
box on the screen here we'll go into the
color section fill section and then we
will select no fill now we can see the
blue lines have disappeared so this
looks like a Gantt chart so now when we
have a Gantt chart on the screen we can
notice that the task here are in the
reverse order so what we will do is we
will click on these tasks and select the
format access option here we'll select
categories in reverse order we can see
our Gantt chart is now in order like we
have a task 1 on the top and task 3 at
the bottom the dates are starting from
11th of December but the dates we have
provided are from 1st of January now we
will copy this cell then go on the dates
box here we'll go to format access in
the format access we can see minimum in
this minimum we will paste this value
and press enter as we press enter we can
see our Gantt chart starting from the
date that we wanted to start and that
too in the correct order starting from
Task 1 to task 3. now as a result we
have our final Gantt chart on the screen
in the last step what we can do is make
our Gantt chart more representable we
can change the color of These Bars we
can give them shapes and we can do many
other things to make it more presentable
we will first select the bars like what
we will do is we will select Task 1 and
let's say we give it the color blue then
task 2 we will give it color green and
in task 3 we'll give it give it the
color black so here the sub sections
will give different colors to to the
subsections as well then we come to task
2.1 this is how we can change the color
of these cells or apart from changing
colors we can select a bar graph and do
the gradient fill so this is how we can
make a Gantt chart more presentable
after changing the colors or changing
the shapes we have our final Gantt chart
on the screen finally let's have a look
at some Microsoft Excel templates for
project management Microsoft Excel
templates help in collecting data
putting them into order and check the
dependencies with each other with the
help of these templates we can monitor
the status of the tasks and we can also
check the progress our project has made
moving forth we will check some
important Microsoft Excel templates the
first template we have is Excel project
review template this template helps us
have an overview of the project we can
have a clear understanding of all the
tasks that are planned and that are
completed this helps project managers to
measure the progress of the project and
take further steps accordingly second
template we will check is Excel budget
template in this template late we can
monitor all the expenditures of our
project it helps us in managing the
budget of a project and also helps in
comparing the budget of a project at
different phases let's have a look at
the budget template in Excel ones we can
download this template from Office
timeline.com the Gans are towards the
right is in accordance with the dates
towards the left if you fluctuate the
date we can see the template working the
start date for Task 1 could be changed
to 10th June if we change this date to
10 June we can see the fluctuation in
the Gantt chart so this is how we can
use this template directly let's have a
look at the third template now third
template we will see is Excel Sprint
Project tracker template this template
is used majorly in agile projects where
the project is made in several streams
or sessions this template includes the
start date the end date and the duration
of each task we can also see the
percentage completed of each task let's
have a look at this print project
tracker template as well we can see the
Gantt chart towards the right and the
data towards the left so if we change
any data we can see the Giants are
changing for example we can change the
data in Sprint to feature 3. let's
change the start date to July 2nd we can
see the Gantt chart changing this is how
we can use this template directly to
track our sessions let's have a look at
the fourth Excel template this template
is Excel project tracker in this
template we have the data of all the
tasks with the status and owners we can
track the percentage of tasks completed
and also compare the plan duration of
the task to the actual duration of the
task after the critical part tracker
let's check the Excel project schedule
template this template helps in
effective management of the project as
it helps in monitoring the time that
each task of the project takes it
provides a clear view of all the work
associated with the project let's have a
look at this template in Excel once we
can see the Gantt chart in accordance to
the data if we change the estimated as
at two places let's say at the design
review we make it 15 hours instead of 5
hours and at the create Staffing plan
and we make it 2 hours instead of 20
hours we can see the Gantt chart
fluctuating this is how we can use this
template to manage the schedule in a
project moving forward the next template
we will see is Excel project status
report template this template helps us
having a list of project deliverables
and the risks associated with that
project this template helps the project
managers about different crucial
activities involved in a project after
this we have Excel Milestone tracker the
Milestone tracker helps us in tracking
or monitoring different tasks in a
project project managers use this
template to monitor the project
performance with respect to the
timelines the last template we will see
is Excel project planner Excel project
planner includes a list of tasks with
the respected owners along with the
start date and the end date of that task
this helps in monitoring each task and
comparing the estimated task date with
the actual ones let's have a look at
this template in Excel we can see the
Gantt chart with respect to the data
entered let's make changes at several
places in the data we can make this 22
to 24 you will make this 23 go to 2 and
we can make this 5th September go to 15
September and when we make the changes
we can realize the Gantt chart is
fluctuating so this is how we can use
this template to plan a project
effectively and efficiently in this
lesson we will focus on Project time
management let us begin with the
objectives of this lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to
Define project time management explain
project schedule Gantt charts and
network diagrams identify the key terms
used in Project time management
describe the project time management
processes explain various schedule
network analysis techniques
in the next screen let us take a quick
look at the project management process
map
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the third
knowledge area that is Project time
management and its processes
let's begin with the first topic of this
lesson project time management
the purpose of project time management
is to ensure that the projects get
completed on time
this knowledge area is primarily
concerned with developing a project
schedule and ensuring that project goes
as per the agreed schedule
if there is a need to change the project
schedule the change should happen by
following a proper change control
procedure another term used in the PMP
examination is schedule management plan
schedule management plan is part of the
project management plan and has
information on the planned project
schedule and its management and control
let us discuss the Key activities of
projects time management in the next
screen
the Key activities that are part of the
project time management include
identifying activities estimating time
and resources and sequencing activities
it is important to identify a list of
activities that would be a part of the
project next an estimation of time and
resources required for completing the
identified activities are done
finally these activities need to be
sequenced as per the dependencies in the
next screen let us discuss project
schedule
project schedule represents the time
dimension of the project plan and has
information like when the project would
start when each of the project
activities would happen in what order
the project activities would happen when
project would be completed
Etc
usually Software System is used to
develop the project schedule
the project team can enter the list of
activities in the software as well as
their dependencies and the software can
produce the project schedule as the
output Microsoft Project is the most
popular tool used for project schedule
development generally project schedule
is considered similar to project
management plan
project management plan is different
from Project schedule project management
plan not only has information about the
Project's schedule but also other
important project related plans like
Risk Management Plan cost management
plan
Etc let us focus on Gantt chart in the
next screen
Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that
illustrates a project schedule it shows
the dependencies between the project
activities as well as their percent
completion
a sample Gantt chart is shown on the
screen
two summary elements of the work
breakdown structure are depicted to
complete those elements there are a
number of activities under them some of
these activities have dependencies for
example activity B and C have a
dependency activity C can start only
when activity B is completed
the chart gives you an idea about when
specific activities are planned to
finish and when the overall WBS element
will get delivered create tasks and work
with the Gantt chart this will make
answering Gantt chart-based questions
easy and fun in the next screen let us
understand the relationships that exist
among project activities
Network diagram is extensively used in
the project time management knowledge
area to plot the activity dependencies
this is a graphical representation of
the project activities in the form of a
network
there are two ways to draw a network
diagram
in precedence diagramming model PDM or
activity on node Aon boxes represent
activities and the arrows indicate the
dependency this type of network can have
all four types of relationships between
the activities
in Arrow diagramming model ADM or
activity on Arrow AOA the arrows
represent activities the relationships
and sequences can be inferred from the
direction of the arrows and linkages
between the activities
and such types of network only finish to
start relationships can be shown
such diagrams may need to make use of
dummy activities to indicate some
dependency between the activities
there may be questions in the PMP exam
based on the network diagram so create
and work with the diagram this will make
answering Network diagram based
questions easy and fun
in the next screen let us look at a
network diagram
a sample Network diagram is shown on the
screen activities A and C can happen in
parallel B and D require both A and C to
complete whereas e requires both B and D
to complete activity on Arrow Network
diagram makes use of hammock activities
they are used to show a comprehensive
summary activity combining several other
activities underneath for control and
Reporting purposes in the next screen
let us look at a few important terms in
time management
when a successor activity can start
before the predecessor activity can
complete it is considered lead for
example you can start preparing the test
environment two weeks before the
development activity finishes
when the successor activity has to wait
for a few days after the predecessor
activity has been completed it is
considered lag for example one needs to
wait for two days for the foundation to
settle before work on the pillars for
the next floor starts
rolling wave planning is an iterative
planning technique in which the work to
be accomplished in the near term is
planned in detail while the work in the
future is planned at a higher level it
is a form of progressive elaboration
in the context of estimating techniques
analogous estimating is based on the
previous project data therefore if the
last five similar projects took six
months to complete the next one will
also take six months this technique
employs expert judgment
another estimating technique is
parametric estimating this technique
uses a mathematical model to calculate
projected time for an activity based on
the historical records from previous
projects and other information
a few common parameters are identified
based on the previous project data and
that parameter is used to predict the
time required to complete the next
activity or project
for example you can normally complete 10
kilometers of Highway construction Lanes
a week
effort is the total amount of work
required to complete the activity
duration is the amount of time it takes
in terms of elapsed or calendar days if
you have an activity that requires 10
people to work for five days the total
effort is 50 person days but the
duration is only five days
in the next screen let us look at the
project time management processes
there are seven project time management
processes they are plan schedule
management define activities sequence
activities estimate activity resources
estimate activity durations develop
schedule and control schedule
the first six processes are executed
during the planning process group
the ultimate goal of these planning
processes is to develop the project
schedule the seventh and the last
process is a part of the monitoring and
controlling process group
in the next few screens let us discuss
these processes in detail we will begin
with plan schedule management
as defined in pmbok guide plan schedule
management is the process of
establishing the policies procedures and
documentation for planning developing
managing executing and controlling the
project schedule
it belongs to the planning process group
let us look at the inputs to this
process
the project management plan provides
other subsidiary plans and will guide
the schedule planning activities on the
project
the project Charter provides an overall
context and the high-level product and
project description which might help
determine the approach for schedule
management few projects might have
scheduling constraint for example
projects of Olympics 2016 should be
completed at the same time
Enterprise environmental factors provide
the organizational context to the
project including the culture of the
organization the infrastructure like
scheduling systems available key
personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
templates past performance data and
estimates historical information and
knowledge base
now let us look at the tools and
techniques employed in this process
expert judgment refers to input received
from knowledgeable and experienced
resources
experts can draw from their previous
experiences the proper approach to
govern the schedule on a project
meetings may be organized to determine
the schedule management plan
anybody responsible for the project
schedule management such as the project
manager sponsored customer and other
stakeholders must attend these meetings
several analytical techniques may be
used to determine the schedule
management plan these may include
different planning approaches and
philosophies such as rolling wave
planning or different scheduling
software that allowed to build what-if
scenarios and study the effect of
advanced scheduling techniques like
leveling fast tracking and crashing
now let us look at the outputs of this
process
schedule management plan is a component
of the project management plan that
describes the criteria and activities
required to arrive at the project
schedule as well as how the project may
be baselined monitored and controlled
in the next screen let us define
activities process
define activities is the process of
identifying the specific actions to be
performed to produce the project
deliverables it belongs to the planning
process group the important input for
the define activities process is the
scope Baseline scope Baseline is a term
used collectively to refer to project
deliverables constraints and assumptions
of the project
in addition to the scope Baseline the
other inputs in this process are
Enterprise environmental factors
organizational process assets and
schedule management plan
a reason why Enterprise environmental
factors is an input to define activities
is because the organization might be
using project management software to
define activities and that may influence
the activity definition process
the knowledge base containing historical
information regarding activities lists
used by previous similar projects is a
good example of organization process
assets applied to scheduling
the tools and techniques used in
defining activities are decomposition
and rolling wave planning the last
technique is expert judgment where the
experience of project team members is
used in developing detailed activity
lists
the output of the process is activity
list activity attributes and Milestone
list
activity list contains a list of
identified activities activity
attributes are the additional
information about the activity itself
a milestone is a significant point or
event in the project a milestone list
identifies all the milestones and
indicates whether the Milestone is
mandatory or optional
let us move on to the next process
sequence activities
sequence activities is the process of
identifying undocumenting relationships
among the project activities and is also
part of the planning process group
for every activity and Milestone except
the first and last one is connected to
or at least one predecessor and one
successor
the inputs to this process are activity
list activity attributes and Milestone
list all these are the outputs of the
Define activity process
the other inputs are schedule management
plan and project scope statement
schedule management plan provides
guidance in terms of methodology to be
employed for many of the scheduling
activities on the project
organization process assets are also an
input to sequencing activities because
the organization might have some kind of
knowledge base for scheduling project
activities
the Enterprise environmental factors
relevant to this process may be
scheduling Tools in use project
management information systems work
authorization systems Etc
one of the important tools and
techniques used in sequencing activities
is the Precedence diagramming method
in this method the activities are drawn
on a network diagram and all the
different kinds of dependencies between
the activities are determined
while determining activity dependency it
is important to identify the type of
relationship or dependency between the
activities
the other technique is leads and lag
which is widely used for sequencing
activities
the output of the process is the project
schedule Network diagram which is a
graphical representation of the project
activities in a form of network which
also shows the activity dependencies
while designing the network diagram new
activities might be identified and that
would result in some of the project
document updates especially the ones
that list all the project activities
in the next screen let us look at the
estimate activity resources process
after sequencing the activities the next
step in Project time management is
estimating the resources required to
accomplish each of the identified
activities
estimate activity resources process also
belongs to the planning process group
here resources do not mean only the
human resources but includes all other
resources like equipment raw materials
Machinery Etc
schedule management plan is the first
input schedule management plan provides
guidance in terms of methodology to be
employed for many of the scheduling
activities on the project
the other inputs to this process are an
activity list and activity attributes
that are the outputs of the time
management processes
risk register is another input risks to
the project May influence the decisions
about the resources that need to be
deployed hence risk register becomes an
input to this project
in addition activity cost estimates are
another input cost and resource
estimates on a project are interrelated
and influence each other
for example the cost might dictate the
number and type of resources that can be
employed or the time might dictate the
cost that may need to be incurred
along with this the resource calendar is
also an important input because it has
the information about the availability
of each of the resources
some of the Enterprise environmental
factors that can influence estimating
activity resources are availability of
required resources within the
organization
the organizational process assets is
also an important input as the
organization might have standard
policies for Staffing or for hiring
contractors on the project
with all these inputs available for
estimating activity resources there are
various techniques used for estimating
the required resources the first
technique is using expert judgment
in this technique an expert in resource
planning and estimating can estimate
each of the activities
the next technique used is alternative
analysis in this the activities are
analyzed to identify different ways of
completing them this is to ensure only
the required resources are assigned to
each of the activities this helps in
resource optimization
along with the two techniques many
organizations routinely publish their
estimating data and this could be used
in activity resource estimation
another technique that is routinely used
in activity estimation is bottom-up
estimating which is decomposing the
activity further down to understand it
in more detail and estimating at that
level later all such estimates are added
to arrive at the estimate of the
activity
in real projects one has to use all the
estimate each of the activities
sometimes the project management
software also helps in estimating
the software estimates are based on the
inputs provided to It software should
only be considered as a supporting tool
in estimation and never fully rely on
its output
clearly the output of this process is
the activity resource requirements along
with this resource breakdown structure
is also prepared the resource breakdown
structure is the categorization of all
the required resources in various
categories that is human resources
equipment raw materials Etc
in the process of estimation several
other project documents may also be
updated
for example the resource estimates are
directly correlated with cost estimates
let us now move on to the next process
estimate activity durations
the next process is to estimate the
duration required to complete each of
the activities
the duration estimation should be done
by someone who is familiar with the
project for example the same activity if
done by a high skilled resource would
take less time compared to a less
skilled resource
this may vary regardless of the resource
used due to the project requirements
in addition the activity duration
estimation should be updated
continuously as you move ahead with the
project because as the project
progresses there will be more clarity on
the project the inputs of this process
are similar to the ones in sequence
activities process
schedule management plan is the first
input schedule management plan provides
guidance in terms of methodology to be
employed for many of the scheduling
activities on the project
for instance it may contain information
about the estimation techniques to be
employed and the people who need to be
involved in the estimation process
activity resource requirements is also
an input to this process because
resources assigned to an activity would
significantly affect the activity
duration that is the lower skilled
resources would take more time than the
high skilled resources
the other inputs include activity list
activity attributes and resource
breakdown structure
resource calendars are also an input to
this process the type and skill set of
resources available to the team may have
an impact on the time it would take to
complete the activities
risks to the project May influence the
decisions about the time required to
complete the activity hence risk
register becomes an input to this
process
the project scope statement defines the
constraints and assumptions affecting
the project duration
an example of Enterprise environmental
factor that can affect duration is
organization's productivity metrics
which is collected based on the
experiences from multiple projects
the last input in this process is
organizational process assets
now let us look at the tools and
techniques used for estimating activity
durations first is the expert judgment
which means using previous project
experiences and estimating the current
project duration this can be used with
other estimation techniques and used to
reconcile differences if different
techniques result in different estimates
three-point estimating is a method where
three estimates are used instead of one
it is part of a project management
philosophy known as program evaluation
and review technique
pert
estimating activity durations is often
done as a team exercise as each activity
may require multiple skill sets to be
applied
therefore it is important to use group
decision making techniques to arrive at
a consensus or at least an estimate that
is acceptable to all the team members
Reserve analysis adds buffer into the
project schedule to deal with any
uncertainty the contingency reserve may
be added as a percentage of the activity
duration or fixed number of work periods
the other tools and techniques are
analogous estimating and parametric
estimating
the outputs of this process are the
activity duration estimates and project
documents updates
the activity duration estimates is
represented in terms of the range of
possible results for example 10 days
plus minus two days that is the activity
would take minimum eight days and
maximum 12 days in the next screen let
us look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better
after reading the problem statement
click the solution button to look at a
possible answer
develop schedule is the process of
analyzing activity sequences durations
resource requirements and schedule
constraints to create the project
schedule
it belongs to the planning process group
generally scheduling software is used
for developing the project schedule
entering the activities durations and
resources into a scheduling tool
generates a schedule with planned dates
for completing project activities
developing a project schedule is an
iterative process revising and
maintaining a realistic schedule is a
task in itself and it continues
throughout the project as the work
progresses
the most of the inputs of this process
are the outputs of estimate activity
durations process
they are risk register project scope
statement project staff assignments
resources calendars organizational
process assets
Enterprise environmental factors
schedule management plan activity list
activity attributes project schedule
Network diagrams activity resource
requirements resource breakdown
structure and activity duration
estimates
various tools and techniques are used to
develop schedule process
schedule network analysis is a technique
that generates project schedule
it employs various analytical techniques
such as critical path method critical
chain method
modeling techniques and resource
optimization techniques to create the
project schedule
the other tools and techniques include
leads and lags schedule compression and
scheduling tool
let us now look at the outputs of this
process
the project schedule consists of a
minimum plan start date and planned
finish date for each activity
although project schedule can be
represented in tabular format it is more
often represented graphically using
either bar charts or network diagrams or
a combination of the two
the final schedule which is the output
of the developed schedule process is
also called schedule Baseline once the
schedule is baselined it can be changed
only through formal approvals meeting
the schedule Baseline is one of the
measures of project success
scheduled data produced may include
number of resources key Milestones Etc
project calendars specify the available
working days and the number of shifts in
each day it indicates how many hours and
days are available for the work of the
project to be completed
project management plan updates are a
result of the developed schedule process
many of the other subsidiary plans of
the project plan may get impacted which
may include cost management plan scope
management plan risk management plan Etc
this may also result in other project
documents being updated
in the next few screens let us discuss
schedule network analysis techniques
it is essential to know if the required
resources are available at that time
along with the time estimate of each of
the activities since schedule is
calendar based it helps in estimating
the same
schedule network analysis technique
generates project schedule there are
various schedule Network techniques
critical path method relies on
determining the critical path on a
project schedule
critical chain method is a variant of
the critical path method wherein the
critical chain is determined based on
The Logical resource and other kinds of
dependencies between the activities
what if scenario analysis is about
trying to vary a certain parameter to
observe the impact on the schedule for
instance you may want to check result if
you put in more resources on a
particular activity to reduce its
duration
resource optimization techniques try to
arrive at the optimal utilization of the
resources used on a project
ideally you would want the resources to
be fully utilized but you would also
want to build in sufficient buffers in
case a certain resource is not available
due to various reasons
in the next screen let us look at the
program evaluation and review technique
program evaluation and review technique
is based on three-point estimates for an
activity
the pessimistic estimate refers to the
worst case scenario whereas most likely
estimate is what you expect to happen in
a realistic scenario
the optimistic estimate on the other
hand represents the amount of time an
activity would take in the best case
scenario
based on these three estimates the
expected duration of the estimate is
calculated as per the formula given on
the screen
the formula for calculating standard
deviation of an activity and variance of
an activity is also given there is no
question asked on variance but the
formula is important because if the
standard deviation of the whole project
is to be calculated the process is to
calculate the variance of the whole
project and then take its square root to
calculate the standard deviation of the
project
concept-based questions on pert can be
expected in the PMP exam so make a note
of the formula while you prepare for the
exam
in the next screen let us understand
pert with an example
let us now figure out how we can apply
the three-point estimation that pert
uses in order to draw some useful
conclusions
assume that the optimistic pessimistic
and most likely estimates are 20 70 and
30 respectively using these values you
can determine the expected duration and
the standard deviation as indicated
now if the causes of variation are
random you can assume that the actual
values would be evenly distributed about
the mean and we'll follow the normal
distribution sometimes referred to as
the bell curve further you can use the
properties of the normal distribution
there is a 68 probability of the actual
value falling within first Sigma from
the mean
95.4 percent probability for the second
Sigma and 99.7 percent probability of
the actual value falling within third
Sigma extending this Logic the notion of
Six Sigma is reaching a level of
confidence that only 3.4 times out of a
million would the actual value fall
outside the stated range part allows you
to plan based on the intended level of
confidence in the outcome and determined
buffers accordingly
let us discuss the critical path method
in the next screen
critical path is defined as the longest
duration path through a network diagram
which determines the shortest time to
complete the project float can be
considered as a buffer time available to
complete an activity
float is calculated once the network
diagram is ready
it is also called as slack there are
three kinds of float the first being the
total float which is the amount of time
an activity can be delayed without
delaying the project end date or an
intermediary milestone
the second type of float is free float
which is the amount of time an activity
can be delayed without delaying the
early start date of its successor or
successor's activities
the last type is independent flu which
is the amount of time an activity can be
delayed if all the predecessors finish
at their latest finish dates and you
want to start all the immediate
successors at their earliest start dates
the slack of the activities on the
critical path is zero because there is
no scope to delay activities on the
critical path
critical path actually represents the
project duration
delaying activities on the critical path
is as good as delaying the project
duration
concept-based questions on critical path
can be expected in the exam so it is
essential to have a clear understanding
of the concept
in the next screen let us learn how to
calculate float
float of an activity can be calculated
by two methods however the first step in
critical path method is to identify the
critical path of the network once the
critical path is identified follow the
forward pass to find early start and
early finish for each activity
the float of the activities on the
critical path is zero so they represent
the overall project duration
use forward pass or backward pass to
calculate the total activity time
calculate late finish and late start
using backward pass method note the
total float formula before you start for
the exam
in the next screen let us look at
forward pass and backward pass methods
in detail
in forward pass you can either go
through the network starting with time 0
and keep calculating the time required
to complete each of the activities until
you reach the last activity of the
project
the starting time for each of the
activity in this approach is called
early start and the end time for each
activity is called the early finish
alternatively in backward pass you can
travel through the network from the
project end date and calculate the time
required to complete each activity
the end date in this approach is called
the late finish and the start date of
the activity in this approach is called
the late start
the float of the activity is either the
difference between the late start and
early start or the difference between
the late finish and early finish
both the differences work out to be the
same before the start of the PMP exam
please make a note of the total float
formula
let us understand the critical path
calculation with an example in the next
screen
let us look at an example for critical
path
there are five activities in this
project and two paths in the network
diagram
start one two four five and is One path
and start one three five and is the
second path
since the duration of the path start one
two four five and is 18 days which is
more than the duration of the path start
1 3 5 and the critical path of the
project is start
1245 and
let us take Activity 3 as an example
first calculate the early start and
early finish dates
Activity 3 can start only after Activity
one since the early finish of Activity 1
is 3 it becomes the early start of
activity 3.
Activity 3 cannot start earlier than 3
because Activity 1 can be completed only
by then
therefore early start of Activity 3 is
3. since the duration of the activity is
four days
the early finish of Activity 3 is 3 plus
4 equals seven days
now let us calculate the late start and
late finish of activity 3. late start of
Activity 5 is 14 days the Activity 3
happens just before activity five so the
late finish of Activity 3 is 14 days to
calculate the late start you can
subtract the duration from late finish
therefore the late start of Activity 3
is 14 minus four equals 10.
in the next screen let us focus on
schedule compression
look at the four activities in the table
the normal cost of executing each of the
activities as well as how much each of
the activities can be crashed is also
provided which activity would you crash
to reduce the project Time by one day
activity a will be crashed if the
duration of the project is reduced by
one day as the per unit cost of crashing
the activity a is the least
all the activities are assumed to be on
the critical path here while crashing if
you end up Saving Time on a path which
is not the critical path you will not
end up Saving Time on the project
in the next screen let us look into the
impact of schedule compression
different schedule compression
techniques have different impact on the
project
the impact of Fast Track leads to risk
additions and increase in management
time for the project manager
crash leads to cost addition and
increase in management time for the
project manager
reduce scope on the other hand saves
cost and resources but increases
customer dissatisfaction
likewise cut quality saves cost and
resources but increases risk
resource reallocation does not add cost
or increase risk
in the next screen let us look into the
other techniques used in scheduling
there are several techniques that are
used in scheduling projects
what if scenario analysis in this
technique questions like what if a
particular scenario changed on the
project would that produce a shorter
schedule are put forth to understand the
impact of specific changes on the
schedule the goal is to produce a
realistic schedule
Monte Carlo analysis in this method a
computer simulates the outcomes of a
project making use of randomly generated
values that map the probability
distribution of the input variables
together these two techniques are called
modeling techniques
resource optimization techniques
these are also used to produce a
resource Limited schedule resource
optimization results in more stable
number of resources used in the project
critical chain method this technique
develops the project schedule that takes
into account both the activity and
resource dependencies
in the next screen let us look at the
last process in Project time management
control schedule
control schedule is concerned with
determining the status of the project
schedule determining that the project
schedule has changed and managing the
actual changes as they occur
the project schedule is an important
input to this process it is the actual
schedule that needs to be controlled
scheduled data contains information
related to the schedule that may need to
be monitored in order to take actions to
bring the project back on schedule
project calendar describes the working
hours and days for the project
work performance data has information
like which activities have started their
progress and which activities have
finished
the other inputs of this process are
project management plan and
organizational process assets
the key tools and techniques of this
process are the performance reviews
performance review is measuring
comparing and analyzing schedule
performance such as actual start and
finish dates percent complete and
remaining duration for work in progress
the other tools and techniques include
resource optimization techniques
modeling techniques schedule compression
leads and lags scheduling tool and
project management software
in development schedule process these
techniques are used for the first time
to develop the project schedule whereas
in control schedule process these
techniques are used to update the
project schedule the key output of the
control schedule process is the work
performance information this is
represented in the form of schedule
variance SV and schedule performance
index SPI
as a part of the control schedule
process the project team will generate
forecasts likely schedule for
forthcoming activities and project as a
whole
the other outputs include organizational
process assets updates change requests
project management plan updates and
project document updates in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer
here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson
project time management includes the
processes required to manage the timely
completion of the project
a project schedule defines the start and
end dates of the project and the project
activities these activities are assigned
a duration and sequenced in a logical
order
Gantt charts and network diagrams are
used to identify project activities and
determine the relationships and
dependencies between them get chart
displays the start and end dates of
project activities the overall project
schedule and The Logical task
relationships while Network diagram is
used to plot the activity dependencies
plan schedule management define
activities sequence activities estimate
activity resources estimate activity
durations develop schedule and control
schedule are the seven processes under
project time management
schedule network analysis technique
generates project schedule based on the
estimates of time and resource
requirements in this lesson we will
focus on Project cost management let us
begin with the objectives of this lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to Define project cost management
differentiate between cost estimation
and cost budgeting explain control
accounts describe the project cost
management processes
apply earned value management technique
to track project performance
identify key terminologies used in
Project cost management
in the next screen let us take a quick
look at the project management process
map
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the
fourth knowledge area that is Project
cost management and its processes
in the next screen let us understand the
concept of project cost management
project cost management involves
activities like estimating the cost of
each of the project activities adding
the cost estimates of the related
activities to arrive at the cost budget
and controlling the cost to ensure that
project activities are completed within
the defined budget in the next screen
let us discuss cost management plan
the cost management plan is a vital step
in Project cost management it contains
information like planning the project
cost managing and controlling the
project in relation to the cost Baseline
and managing cost variances project cost
management plan is a part of the project
management plan
the methods used in estimating the cost
of each of the project activities are
similar to the ones used in estimating
project time for example time estimation
methods like expert judgment analogous
estimating bottom-up estimating and
Reserve analysis are few of the
techniques that are also used in
estimating activity cost let us discuss
control account in the next screen
control account is an important Concept
in the project cost management project
cost is generally estimated at
individual activity level
it becomes difficult to manage cost at
the activity level in large projects
therefore the cost is managed at a
higher level this requires related
activities to be clubbed and their cost
being managed together as one unit this
unit is called control account
while estimating the project time WBS is
created to break down the project into
smaller deliverables these deliverables
are broken down into work packages and
these work packages are in turn broken
into activities control account is
defined at a level higher than the work
packages for example if five work
packages are part of the one control
account the cost of all activities
belonging to these five work packages
are managed as one unit
in the next screen let us discuss the
project cost management process
project cost management has four
processes
they are plan cost management estimate
costs determined budget and control
costs
the three processes Plan cost management
estimate costs and determined budget are
a part of planning process group and
control cost process is a part of
monitoring and controlling process group
let us look at each of these processes
in detail
let us begin with the first process that
is Plan cost Management in the next
screen
managing costs on a project is a
critical exercise if the activities are
planned well it becomes easier to
achieve harmony with the overall cost
and budget of the project Plan cost
management is the process of
establishing the policies procedures and
documentation for planning managing
expending and controlling the project
costs let us look at the inputs required
for this process
the project management plan provides
other subsidiary plans and guides the
cost planning activities on the project
the project Charter provides an overall
context and high-level product and
project description
which help determine the approach for
cost management for example for some
projects budget could be a constraint
whereas for others budget would not be a
constraint but subject to the other
objectives
Enterprise environmental factors provide
the organizational context to the
project including the culture of the
organization and the infrastructure for
instance the scheduling systems
available the key personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
templates past performance data and
estimates historical information and
knowledge base
now let us look at the tools and
techniques employed in this process
expert judgment refers to input received
from knowledgeable and experienced
resources
experts can devise an approach to govern
the costs on a project by using their
previous experiences
meetings may be organized to determine
the cost management plan everyone
responsible for the project schedule
management such as the project manager
representatives from the appropriate
accounting or financial organization
sponsor customer and other stakeholders
must attend these meetings
several analytical techniques may be
used to determine the cost management
plan these techniques help to map the
impact of various decisions on cost for
example how do risk management processes
impact cost
Etc
cost management plan is the primary
output of this process it establishes
the units of measure levels of precision
organizational process links control
accounts to be used rules for
performance measurement and Reporting
frequency and methodology of monitoring
the costs and various other details that
lay the overall framework for cost
Management on a project
in the next screen let us discuss the
second process under project cost
management
estimate cost
estimate cost is the approximation of
the monetary resources required to
complete a project activity
cost of a specific activity is estimated
based on the information available at
that point of time as the project team
gets more information about the project
the activity cost estimation may change
let us look at the inputs of this
process
scope Baseline is the most important
input as it details out the Project's
scope of work
along with that project schedule is also
important this contains information like
when and which resource is required for
the project
it is good to remember that the same
kind of resources may have different
costs at different points of time
Human Resource Management plan is
another important input various elements
like Personnel rates Rewards or
recognition programs Etc are covered in
the human resource management plan which
is important in approximating the cost
estimate Human Resource Management plan
will be discussed in detail in the human
resource management knowledge area
risk register is also an input because
risk mitigation costs should be
considered in cost planning more
information on risk and its effect in
the project will be looked at in detail
in Risk Management knowledge area
another input Enterprise environmental
factors provides organizational context
to the project
organization process asset is listed as
an input as organizations might have
standard set of cost estimation policies
or templates
cost management plan is another
important input the cost management plan
lays the framework for the cost
management processes in the project
it provides guidelines such as the units
of measure accuracy desired
methodologies and tools to be used Etc
let us now look at the tools and
techniques used in this process
expert judgment Reserve analysis
analogous estimating cost of quality
parametric estimating project management
software bottom-up estimating
three-point estimating vendor bid
analysis and group decision making are
the various tools and techniques used in
this process most of the tools and
techniques used here are similar to the
ones used in the time management
knowledge area
vendor bid analysis is a technique used
to estimate project cost
for example a project requires material
procured externally through suppliers in
order to get that you invite bids from
three or four suppliers and assess their
quotations based on their quotations you
can get an idea of the cost that will be
involved in getting the material for the
project
group decision making technique is
another important technique for project
cost estimation
cost estimation is an exercise which may
be carried out by a group or Committee
in order to gather well-rounded input
therefore group decision making
techniques may be used to arrive at a
decision that team can work with
the outputs of this process are quite
straightforward
estimates of each of the activities are
arrived at basis of the estimate
includes things like how the estimate
was developed what were the assumptions
made in estimating Etc
project document updates is also one of
the outputs because the cost estimates
may result in updates to other aspects
of the project for example quality risk
time
Etc
in the next screen let us discuss the
third process under project cost
management determined budget
once the estimate of each of the
activities is arrived at the next
project cost management process is to
determine budget it is the process of
aggregating the estimated costs of
individual activities or work packages
to establish an authorized cost Baseline
this is where the control account
concept comes into picture
the estimated costs of the activities
are aggregated to arrive at the cost
budget at the control account level
once approved this cost budget becomes
the cost Baseline of the project
cost performance is measured against the
cost Baseline that is how much more
would the project cost be compared to
the original cost Baseline the cost
Baseline includes all authorized budgets
but excludes management Reserves
the inputs used in determining the
project budget are the activity cost
estimates and the basis of estimates
which are the output of the previous
cost management process
the cost management plan lays the
framework for the cost management
processes in the project it provides
guidelines such as the budgeting cycle
tools and techniques used to prepare and
approve the budget
Etc
in addition to these two important
inputs scope Baseline is also looked at
project schedule provides aggregate cost
in a particular calendar period to
ensure how much money can be made
available during that time
similarly resource calendar provides
information on the resource which is
assigned to the project at a particular
point of time this information is then
used to indicate resource costs over the
duration of the project
risk register gives an understanding of
the overall level of risk on the project
and therefore the level of contingency
reserves that need to be built into the
budget
agreements entered in two with the
suppliers are also required to finalize
the budget again organizational process
asset is an input because organization
may have few policies for reporting the
cost budget or there might be some cost
budgeting tools being used there are
various tools and techniques used in
determining budgets cost aggregation
technique involves adding up the cost
and aggregating them at the control
account level so that the cost can be
managed in a better way
in reserve analysis once the costs are
estimated some extra amount is added to
the estimate as a management Reserve to
take care of any unplanned activities
expert judgment is a technique in which
an expert's help is sought to estimate
the activity cost expert is someone who
might have worked on a similar project
in the past and has a good idea to
estimate the activity cost involved
historical relationships are used to
predict the total project costs using
mathematical model
this is similar to analogous estimate or
parametric estimate method
funding limit reconciliation technique
is used to ensure that cost on the
project is budgeted or spent as per the
availability of the fund for example if
the project can get the funding of only
fifty thousand dollars a month the
project budget should be planned
accordingly
the output of this process is the cost
Baseline this is an authorized project
budget over a period this is used to
measure Monitor and control over all
cost performance of the project
in addition to this the Project funding
requirements are also arrived at funding
requirements means how much fund the
project requires monthly quarterly or
yearly for the execution
the last output of this process is
Project document updates an
understanding of determining budget may
be useful when answering questions in
the PMP exam so make a note of the
inputs tools and techniques and outputs
of determining budget in the next screen
let us discuss the last process of
project cost management that is control
cost
control costs is the process of
monitoring the status of the project to
update the project budget and managing
changes to the cost Baseline
updating the budget involves recording
actual costs spent until date any
increase to the authorized budget can
only be approved through the perform
integrated Change Control process
some of the typical activities that
happen as part of the control cost
process are ensuring that cost
expenditure does not exceed the
authorized funding monitor the cost
performance to understand variants and
monitoring the work performance against
the funds expended
the inputs to the process are project
management plan organizational process
assets Project funding requirements and
work performance data
work performance data contains the
information about the project progress
the important tools and techniques used
in controlling costs are earned value
analysis management
forecasting to complete performance
index
other important aspects of controlling
costs are the review the performance
analyze the reserves to make sure the
project has enough budgetary reserves to
meet the expenses and project management
software which helps in tracking and
managing costs
now let us look at the output of this
process
the key outputs of this process are work
performance information in terms of cost
variance CV schedule variance SV and
earned value EV and forecasts about the
cost performance
this process may also result in change
requests arising out of cost control
measures as well as updates to project
documents the project management plan
and organizational process assets
business scenario based questions on
Project cost control can be expected in
the exam so if you have questions on
these Concepts get them cleared as that
will help you score higher in the next
screen let us learn about earned value
management and its related terms
earned value technique is an excellent
way to track the project progress
against the project plan it is a method
of measuring the project performance
objectively and comparing it against the
project Baseline results from an earned
value analysis indicate deviation of the
project from cost and schedule baselines
Baseline is the initial approved value
along with approved changes therefore
schedule Baseline is the first approved
project schedule along with approved
changes
there are various terms used in earned
value technique
planned value is the authorized budget
assigned to the scheduled work
earned value is the work performed in
terms of budget authorized for that work
actual cost is the cost incurred in work
performed budget at completion is the
budgeted amount for the total work
estimate at completion is the expected
total cost for the project
to complete is the expected cost to
finish all the remaining Project work
variance at completion is the projected
budget surplus or deficit at the end of
the project all the parameters displayed
on the screen are measured in terms of
cost you may come across business
scenario based questions on earned value
Management in the PMP exam so ensure
that you develop a clear understanding
of this topic let us look at an example
of a planned value in the next screen
planned value is the estimated value of
the work planned this value is measured
in terms of currency say dollar if the
plan value is three hundred forty
dollars then the work plan is worth
three hundred forty dollars
how do you calculate earned value the
solution is add the budget allocated to
each of the activities that have been
completed at the point of time the
resulting value is the earned value
in the next screen let us look at the
formula used to calculate earned value
in cost variance negative means the
project is over budget positive means
the project is under budget similarly in
schedule variance negative means the
project is behind schedule whereas
positive means the project is ahead of
schedule
the value of the next two parameters
cost performance index CPI and schedule
performance index SPI values vary
between 0 and 1. for example a CPI of
0.8 implies that 80 cents of work is
obtained for every dollar spent in the
project
similarly if SPI is 0.9 it implies that
project is progressing at only 90
percent of the speed originally planned
the next parameter is estimate at
completion or EAC
there are different ways of calculating
the EAC value the method used depends on
how the cost and schedule variances are
expected to play for the rest of the
project BAC by CPI is used if you expect
that the current cost performance will
continue until the end of the project
AC plus BAC minus EV is used if you
expect that the rest of the project will
be managed at the budgeted rate
AC plus BAC minus EV by the product of
CPI and SPI is used if you want to
factor in the impact of the cost as well
as schedule variances
AC plus Etc is used if you want to
re-evaluate the Project based on a
forecast value for the estimated cost of
the remainder of the project
the next parameter is estimate to
complete or
Etc which is the cost of project from
this point to the end
this is calculated by subtracting the
actual cost from the estimate and
completion in addition variance at
completion can be calculated by
subtracting the estimate at completion
from the budget at completion variance
at completion is the cost estimation
whether it is over or under budget
another parameter is the to complete
performance index or tcpi this is the
cost performance needed to achieve a
desired outcome
for example if the project needs to be
managed to the original budget BAC then
tcpi that is the CPI that must be
maintained for the rest of the project
is calculated as BAC minus EV by BAC
minus AC
rly if it has to be managed within a
revised Target say EAC then tcpi is
calculated as BAC minus EV by EAC minus
AC before the start of the PMP exam
please make a note of the formulas of
earned value technique in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer
let us take the example of a software
development project there are four
phases and each phase takes a month to
complete and is expected to cost ten
thousand dollars the phases are planned
to be completed one after the other the
status of the project at the end of the
month three is summarized in the table
requirements definition is completed and
actual spending on this is ten thousand
dollars
architecture and design is done and
actual spending on this is twelve
thousand dollars development and unit
testing is only fifty percent done
though it was supposed to be completed
by Third month it has cost nine thousand
dollars until date
system testing and go live has not yet
started
Note S indicates start time F indicates
finish time and PF indicates that it is
partly finished at the end of the month
based on the above information calculate
the CV SV CPI and SPI of the project
let us look at a solution in the next
screen
before we end this lesson let us also
look at a few definitions that might be
useful for your PMP examination
law of diminishing return this means the
more you put into something the less you
get out of it for example doubling the
number of resources working on a project
will not necessarily have the time
working capital the amount of money the
company has to invest on the project and
the day-to-day company operations
funding limit reconciliation the process
of comparing the planned expenditure in
a given period with the available
funding for that period
large assets purchased by the company
lose value over time this is called
depreciation there are two forms of
depreciation straight line and
accelerated
same amount of depreciation is taken
every year for instance a car with a
price tag of ten thousand dollars and
useful life of 10 years is depreciated
one thousand dollars per year at the end
of the tenth year the value of the car
is considered zero for all accounting
purposes accelerated depreciation
depreciates faster than the
straight-line depreciation for instance
a car with a price tag of ten thousand
dollars depreciates three thousand
dollars the first year
1500 the next year one thousand the
third year and so on let us now check
your understanding of the topics covered
in this lesson
here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson
project cost management includes the
processes involved in estimating
budgeting and controlling costs so that
the project can be completed within the
approved budget
cost management plan contains details on
how to plan manage and control the
project cost in relation to the cost
Baseline and manage the cost variances
cost estimate is an educated guess of
how much an activity or project will
cost
budget considers the cost estimate and
accordingly sets aside funds for the
completion of the project
under control account technique related
activities are clubbed and their costs
are managed as one unit
the four project cost management
processes are Plan cost management
estimate costs determined budget control
costs
earned value management technique
indicates potential deviation of the
project from the cost and or schedule
baselines
in this lesson we will focus on Project
quality management let us begin with the
objectives of this lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to Define quality and quality
management differentiate between quality
planning quality assurance and quality
control explain cost of quality and its
categories describe the project quality
management processes
explain the seven basic tools of quality
explain Six Sigma
in the next screen let us take a quick
look at the project management process
map
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the fifth
knowledge area that is Project quality
management and its processes in the next
screen let us understand what quality is
the project manager is responsible for
quality in a project however it is also
the responsibility of each and every one
in the project to ensure that whatever
they do meets project quality
expectations quality is defined as the
degree to which a set of inherent
characteristics fulfills requirements a
project is said to meet quality
expectations when all the project
requirements agreed in the beginning of
the project are met and the resulting
product is usable usable means that the
intended users can use the product
without any problem in the next screen
let us look at some quality related
terms
it is important to discuss a few terms
to understand the concept of quality
better customer satisfaction is defined
as conformance to requirements and
fitness for use it is important to
understand the subtle distinction
between quality and greed grade is a
classification based on technical
characteristics low quality is always a
problem but low grade may not be a
problem rather it would be a matter of
choice similarly it is important to
understand the distinction between
precision and accuracy precision is the
granularity of measurement that is how
fine-grained can you measure the outcome
accuracy is how correct you are that is
how close you are to the desired value
in the next screen let us understand the
concept of optimal level of quality
quality comes at a cost more effort put
in quality will give better results
however you cannot keep on investing on
increasing the quality as there is no
limit to how much a product can be
improved investment in quality is
determined by knowing the optimal level
of quality
optimal level of quality as shown in the
diagram is said to be achieved at the
point where the incremental revenue from
Improvement equals the incremental cost
to secure it suppose you are the
manufacturer of toys but the toys are
below quality and the sales are low to
improve the quality you invest in
identifying the demands of children
sharing few samples and recording their
feedbacks once all these are captured
and implemented in the products you lure
the parents to buy them as the
investment is increased to manufacture
good quality toys the cost will
therefore increase and it might become
prohibitive for parents to buy optimal
level of quality is reached at a point
where you get maximum number of buyers
for the toys manufactured now that we
are clear on the concept of quality in
the next screen let us discuss quality
management
quality management involves performing
activities like creating standard
policies and procedures and ensuring
that those standard procedures are being
followed properly in the project it aims
to ensure that project meets all the
initial agreed requirements without any
deviation and that the specified
approach to Quality is implemented on
the project
three broad activities are done as part
of quality management they aren't
quality planning quality assurance and
quality control
quality planning is the first step when
quality related activities of the
project are planned quality assurance is
the next stage of implementing those
quality plans and quality control is the
last stage when periodic checks are done
to see if project quality is improving
in the next screen let us look into the
differences between the three aspects of
quality management
it is important to understand the
different kinds of activities that come
under quality planning quality assurance
and quality control once the quality
planning is done the quality management
plan is ready this quality management
plan has standards templates policies
and procedures to be followed in the
project it contains information on the
level of quality being aimed and the
plan to achieve that level it is the aim
of quality assurance activities to
ensure that the activities planned under
quality planning phase gets executed for
the project it is the task of quality
assurance to determine if the project is
complying with the organizational as
well as project policies and procedures
this is ensured by conducting regular
process audits to identify deviation
from what is planned in the quality
management plan
these audits are generally done by
quality Department of the organizations
quality assurance focuses on the process
not on specific products the role of
quality control is to measure specific
project data or results against
standards to inspect and verify the
Project's product defect repair and
measure whether quality indicators are
improving quality control is about the
product and data for example it was
planned as part of quality management
that project would get completed plus or
minus 10 percent within the cost budget
three months back when the measurement
was done project was over budget by 20
percent
when the measurement was done a day
before it was only 15 percent over
budget
therefore the project has showed an
improvement of five percent in the last
three months and it is quite likely that
over the next three months project may
get within the planned limit of 10
percent
instead of showing Improvement if the
data shows cost increase then corrective
and preventative actions are required to
get the project within the 10 percent
limit this is quality control
in the next screen let us discuss a few
quality management Concepts
let us look at some terms that are
commonly used in quality management
parlance total quality management or tqm
is a quality management philosophy that
involves holistic thinking about meeting
the objectives of an organization it
places the responsibility of quality
squarely on the management Kaizen is a
Japanese term that stands for change for
butter Kaizen philosophy is one that
should always be looking for small and
continuous improvements in the process
deeming cycle or pdca cycle that is plan
do check Act is a process control and
Improvement approach propagated by the
famous quality Guru Edward deeming it
means you plan for something executed
check the output and based on the
lessons you act to bring the deviations
under control
kanban is a pool based management system
that originated in Japan based on just
in time jit Inventory management
the idea behind kanban is to minimize
the work in progress and achieve a
smooth flow in the process from start to
finish
because building up inventory only to
paper over the imperfections in the
system tends to hide the problems
in the next screen let us focus on cost
of quality
cost of quality is the cost that needs
to be incurred to make a quality product
the sum of all the costs incurred is
ensuring that project conforms to
requirement is cost of quality
cost of quality can be broken down into
two major categories first is the cost
of conformance or the money spent during
the project to avoid failures this can
further be subdivided into prevention
costs which is the cost to prevent
errors like training the team creating
documents on equipment and in time to do
it right the other subdivision is
appraisal costs or the cost for
assessing quality like testing
destructive testing loss and inspections
the second category is the cost of
non-conformance it is the money spent
during and after the project because of
failures this is subdivided into
internal failure costs it is the cost of
failures that occur before the product
is released to customers for example
rework and scrap the second subdivision
is external failure costs it is cost
incurred on failures that occur after it
has been least by the team for example
liabilities warranty work and lost
business concept based questions on cost
of quality can be expected in the exam
so please make a note of the categories
of cost of quality let us look at the
project quality management processes in
the next screen
there are three project quality
management processes of which the first
process plan quality management is done
as part of the planning process group
the next process perform quality
assurance is done as part of the
executing process group and the last
process control quality is done as part
of the monitoring and controlling
process group in the next three screens
let us look into each of these processes
in detail
the aim of the plan quality management
process is to identify the relevant
requirements or standards to execute the
project effectively to achieve the
desired quality level
quality planning results in the creation
of the quality management plan
aim of the plan quality process is to
identify the standards a standard is an
agreed upon process to work or achieve a
result a standard can be set from within
the organization or government once all
the standards for the project are
identified the aim of the quality
planning activities involves determining
what work needs to be done to meet those
standards
before adhering to the standards you
should question their relevance with the
project implementing all possible
standards applicable to the project in
random will have cost and time
implications
let us look at the inputs to this
process
the project management plan provides the
scope schedule and cost Baseline all of
which have an implication on the quality
management plan
quality plan has a direct correlation
with these it might also have an impact
on and be impacted by other subsidiary
management plans such as risk management
the stakeholders of the project may have
specific requirements and Views about
the quality parameters of the project
and these have to be considered
the risk register gives an indication
about the kind of risks that are
inherent in the project and also those
which must be considered while planning
the activities to ensure quality the
requirements for the project need to be
considered for planning quality related
activities because quality is all about
meeting the requirements in addition to
these Enterprise environmental factors
and organization process assets are also
listed as inputs because the standards
can be either from within the
organization or from government or other
external bodies standards from within
the organizations are usually the best
practices learned over a period while
executing numerous projects an example
of government standards can be standards
to control air pollution by the motor
vehicles which vehicle manufacturers
must adhere to to accomplish quality
planning first analyze the benefits
versus the costs of meeting quality
requirements next identify the cost of
quality and confirm if that kind of
investment in quality is Justified
in addition to these two benchmarking
helps in analyzing the quality of
activities of similar projects executed
in the past this helps in identifying
the particular quality of output of the
previous project which in turn acts as a
basis for the current Project's quality
planning
design of experiments can also be used
for Quality planning this is a
statistical way to determine what
variables will improve quality the most
for example in case of manufacturing
doors it can be determined that
increasing the quality of the wood can
have Maximum Impact on improving the
quality of the tour in addition the 76
quality tools also known as the seven QC
tools are used to determine the plan to
achieve the desired level of quality
statistical sampling as a tool becomes
relevant whenever the quality plan
cannot be applied to all the artifacts
produced for example if destructive
testing is a requirement then it can be
carried out only on a sample not on the
entire population
statistical sampling helps in arriving
at a representative sample that can give
useful information
other additional tools such as
brainstorming force field analysis Etc
may be used to determine the quality
management plan for the project
conducting regular meetings is another
important tool the quality management
plan has to be determined in a
collaborative manner by Consulting the
team members and other stakeholders
quality management plan is a key output
of this process
checklist is a list of items to inspect
for example many of the office buildings
have housekeeping checklists to ensure
that all floors cabins Etc are cleaned
checklists are created during quality
planning and used in quality control
metrics are Project Specific data that
need to be measured to check the status
of the project the simplest project
metrics can be cost and schedule metrics
are also decided during quality planning
and used in quality control one of the
roles of the project manager is to not
only manage the project but also improve
processes in the project to decrease the
instances of defects which in turn saves
time and money such activities are
listed in the process Improvement plan
which eventually becomes part of project
management plan
as a result of the planning activities
other project documents may also get
updated for example the quality
management plan may result in updates to
the cost or resource requirements there
may be questions in the PMP exam based
on the plan quality management process
so please ensure you have a fair
understanding of the concept before you
take the exam
in the next screen let us discuss the
second quality management process
once the quality planning is over the
next process and project quality
management is quality assurance which
involves determining whether the
standards are being met and the
processes are being followed therefore
the input for this process is the work
that has been completed during the
quality planning stage
they are project documents quality
management plan process Improvement plan
quality metrics and quality control
measurements let us look at the tools
and techniques used in this process
quality audit is the process to check
whether the project is complying with
the organization policies standards and
procedures and determine whether these
policies standards and procedures used
are efficient and effective
so a good audit not only looks at this
compliance but also for the new Lessons
Learned From the current project that
can help make the future projects better
process analysis involves using the
lessons learned from doing the initial
few work to make the remaining work more
efficient
for example if the project involves
installing a software package then the
lesson learned from the first few
installations can be used to improve the
process on remaining installations
apart from these all the quality
management and control tools such as the
seven basic quality tools will be
relevant to this process
the key output of this process is
Project documents updates to ensure that
if there is any deviation from agreed
standards it is corrected also if there
are any lessons learned that can help
improve the future projects the
organization process assets get updated
this quality assurance may result in
Improvement suggestions change requests
may be generated and the project
management plan may need to be updated
understanding characteristics of quality
assurance tools and techniques may be
useful while answering the exam so
prepare this topic well before you take
the exam in the next screen let us
discuss the last process of quality
management
the key focus of the quality control
activities is on the correctness of the
work
quality control helps answer questions
like is everything okay with the project
does the project plan require changes to
successfully execute the project will
the project succeed
Etc
let us look at the inputs to this
process the quality metrics measurements
are done continuously to see whether the
project quality is improving the project
deliverables are inspected against the
planned checklists quality control acts
upon the deliverables and work
performance data produced in execution
it also refers to the project management
plan for understanding deviations from
the plan it also considers the approved
change requests information from other
project documents and organizational
process assets there are seven popular
tools and techniques used in doing the
quality control activities they are
collectively known as seven basic tools
of quality other relevant tools are
statistical sampling inspection or
testing and review of the approved
changes quality control activities
result in quality control measurements
the verified deliverables validated
changes information about the work being
performed recommended changes and
updates to the organizational process
assets project management plan and other
project documents in the next screen let
us look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer
Six Sigma is a highly disciplined
process that focuses on developing and
delivering near perfect products and
services consistently if large volume of
data is plotted over a period of time
you would most probably have a
bell-shaped graph such graphs are also
called normal distribution graph it's
called as normal distribution because
any large volume of data is plotted with
the intent to track variations would
most probably be in a bell-shaped curve
the line corresponding to the top of the
bell curve is the median of the data
sample standard deviation concept is
used to measure how far any data is from
the mean standard deviation is also
called Sigma one standard deviation from
the mean covers 68 percent of the data
Six Sigma means six standard deviations
from the mean this would cover
99.9966 percent of the data
we will look at an example of Six Sigma
in the following screen to understand
Six Sigma let us look at an example a
tire Manufacturing Company produces 100
000 tires a day it is not possible to
verify each and every Tire manually to
ensure it is defect free instead random
sample of these manufactured tires are
taken and checked for defects assuming
that the thickness of the tires is a
parameter to measure defect any tire
that has a thickness more than or less
than 10 millimeters is considered to be
defective now if you measure the actual
thickness of all one hundred thousand
tires manufactured daily and plot them
on a graph you get normal distribution
graph one standard deviation from the
mean covers 68 percent of the data
meaning if the thickness of the 100 000
tires are plotted 68 000 of them lie
within one standard DVD above or below
the mean now if a company operates at
Six Sigma level they would ensure that
all tires that are up to six standard
deviations from the mean are defect free
therefore in such cases you can expect
only three defective tires out of a
million tires manufactured let us now
check your understanding of the topics
covered in this lesson
here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson
a project is said to meet quality
expectations when all the project
requirements agreed in the beginning of
the project are met and the resulting
product is usable
quality management includes creating and
following policies and procedures that
meet the Project's defined quality needs
quality planning defines the standards
templates policies and procedures
quality assurance determines if the
project is complying with the policies
and procedures quality control measures
specific project results against
standards
plan quality management perform quality
assurance and control quality are the
three project quality management
processes
seven basic quality tools are used to
plan and achieve the desired levels of
quality
at Six Sigma level there would be only
three defects out of a million units
manufactured
in this lesson we will focus on project
management framework let us begin with
the objectives of this lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to Define project project
management program management and
portfolio management
recognize the roles of project
management office
identify the project constraints and
their impact on the project
explain the role of a project manager in
stakeholder management describe
different organization structure
differentiate between a Project Life
Cycle and a product life cycle
let's begin this lesson with
understanding what a project is in the
next screen
a project is a temporary Endeavor
undertaken to create a unique product
service or result for example developing
a new product service or result
constructing a building industrial plant
or infrastructure and implementing
improving or enhancing existing business
processes and procedures in the next
screen we will focus on the
characteristics of a project
a project can be distinguished based on
its characteristics the definition
describes two characteristics of a
project first it is temporary in nature
temporary here does not mean short in
duration a project can extend for long
duration based on the requirements for
example creating a new indigenous
missile defense system for a country
however there is always a definite plan
start and end date for a project it
cannot go on indefinitely
secondly the project is supposed to
produce a unique output the output could
be a product service or result there can
be many common activities between two
projects but the outcome of each project
should be unique in some way or the
other
now let us look at what marks the end of
a project a project ends when either the
objectives are met or the project is
terminated because the objectives will
not or cannot be met
the other reason to terminate the
project can be that the need for the
output of the project does not exist
anymore usually the sponsor of the
project takes a call about the closure
of the project
it is important to differentiate Project
work from regular operational work for
example your office receptionist does
the same work every day of picking any
incoming call and directing the call to
the right person in the office
this is an ongoing repetitive work and
can be classified as operation
operations unlike projects are neither
temporary nor unique
creating a new software system to
effectively track your customer
complaint can be an example of a project
when the software is successfully
developed the project objective is met
which marks the end of the project when
you start using this software to track
customer complaints you are entering
into the operations phase
in the next screen let us now look into
project management
as defined in the pmbok guide project
management is the application of
knowledge skills and tools and
techniques applied to project activities
to meet the project requirements project
management is achieved by proper
application and integration of the 47
processes project application and
integration means these processes should
be executed in the right manner as well
as in the right order in the next screen
let us discuss how to manage a project
program management is defined as the
application of knowledge skills tools
and techniques to a program to meet the
program requirements and to obtain
benefits and control not available by
managing projects individually as
defined in pmbok guide a program is a
group of related projects which when
managed as a group in a coordinated
fashion provides benefits and control
that are not available while managing
them individually these benefits could
be from decreased risk economies of
scale improved management of
dependencies delivery of additional
capabilities optimal utilization of
shared resources and so on let us now
learn the various features of program
management
random projects cannot be grouped
together as a program the projects in a
program should be related in some way or
the other and there should be some value
added in managing them together
a project may not be a part of any
program but a program will always have
projects a project can also be executed
as a standalone project
a program is designed to deliver some
strategic benefits value to the
organization these benefits can be
tangible or intangible examples of
tangible benefit could be increased
profit margins or operational cost
savings examples of intangible benefits
could be improved team morale or
building up certain competencies
while a project manager focuses
relentlessly on the Fulfillment of the
Project's requirements that is scope
cost time quality a program manager
needs to focus on ensuring that the
organizational benefits are realized in
the next screen let us understand what a
portfolio is
portfolio is yet another term used along
with project and program
a portfolio may have multiple projects
and programs that are managed as a group
to achieve strategic objectives note
that all projects and programs in a
portfolio may not be necessarily
interdependent or directly related
a portfolio can be created based on the
business objectives
for example nit Service Company can have
a portfolio named Japanese projects
which is formed with an aim to take over
the Japanese Market by giving more
attention to these projects within this
portfolio similar projects can be
managed as a program
and all banking projects from Japan can
be managed as a banking program
in the next screen let us discuss
portfolio management
portfolio management is the centralized
management of one or more portfolios
this includes identifying prioritizing
authorizing managing and controlling
projects programs and other related work
to achieve strategic business objectives
therefore whether the company should
have Japanese projects as portfolio or
not is decided by portfolio management
in the next screen let us understand the
relationship between portfolios programs
and projects
the image on the screen will help you to
understand the terms portfolios programs
and projects a portfolio is part of an
organization's overall strategy it
represents a conscious decision by an
organization to invest in the portfolio
the overall objectives of a portfolio
are then cascaded down to the lower
level components the components could be
sub-portfolios programs or projects
these components can further be broken
down into smaller components for ease of
management
although a project may not contain
operations a program or a portfolio it
can include other work this other work
May comprise training and development
customer support and services
Etc if the other work has Synergy with
the overall objectives and adds to the
capability to deliver the higher level
benefits then it can be included in the
program or portfolio as well
in the next screen we will discuss
project management office
project management office or pmo is a
specific type of body or Department
within an organization
pmo performs several roles in the
organization and these can broadly be
classified as primary roles and other
rules
typically the pmo may take up any one or
a combination of the three primary roles
it provides the policies methodologies
and tools and templates for managing
projects within the organization it
provides support and training in
organization on how to manage projects
and finally it provides project managers
for different ongoing projects in the
organization
pmo may also help in managing
interdependencies between the projects
selecting managing and deploying shared
or dedicated project resources if need
be terminating a project and organizing
Lessons Learned sessions and maintaining
the project management knowledge base
for an organization in the next screen
we will discuss how to manage the triple
constraints
any project can be done successfully if
there is no constraint on time or there
is unlimited budget available
unfortunately that is not true in real
life
a project is performed within some
constraint and these constraints are
usually competing therefore if you
change one it would affect the other for
example if the project duration
increases it would lead to increase in
the project cost as well
triple constraint is a term that
originally referred to the three
competing project constraints within
which the projects are performed these
constraints are cost time and scope
quality is a primary concern for a
project manager
therefore the project manager has to
make trade-offs to keep the scope cost
time quality plane and balance to
achieve the balance the project manager
also needs to manage other aspects of
the project for instance the people
stakeholders risks communication and
procurements
the project manager plays the essential
role of integrating all these different
aspects of project management in the PMP
examination you can expect business
scenario-based questions focusing on the
triple constraints
in the next screen let us understand who
a stakeholder is
a stakeholder can be defined as the one
whose interests May positively or
negatively be affected or perceived to
be affected by the decision activity or
outcome of the project as per the
definition the project team project
manager project sponsor pmo Office
customer
Etc are the stakeholders of the project
a project sponsor is the one who gives a
go ahead for a project and provides the
necessary resources to execute the
project therefore the head of projects
in the organization who provides a green
signal to start a project and allocates
required resources to the project is the
project sponsor a project sponsor is
usually somebody placed high up in the
organizational hierarchy of the
Performing organization that is the
organization in which the work of the
project is being carried out
in the next screen let us look at
stakeholder management
one of the key responsibilities of a
project manager is to manage
stakeholders a project manager has to
involve the stakeholders from the
beginning of the project until the end
so they are aware of every step a
project manager has to take up specific
activities for stakeholder management
identifying both internal and external
stakeholders
missing out any stakeholder can be
disastrous for a project a stakeholder
who has identified towards the end of
the project may come up with his own
requirement at that stage and
incorporating them can be risky
determining stakeholder requirements
after identifying all the stakeholders
the project manager also needs to ensure
that their requirements are clearly
identified sometimes stakeholders might
themselves not know of their requirement
and it is the job of the project manager
to get them right by doing a proper
stakeholder requirement analysis
determining stakeholder expectations
stakeholders might also have some
unstated expectations
which need to be clarified to see if it
can become a project requirement it is
again the role of the project manager to
determine the stakeholders expectation
communicating with stakeholders
once all the stated and unstated
stakeholder requirements are known the
project manager as part of stakeholder
analysis should focus on communicating
them regularly to keep stakeholders
involved in the project once you
understand the practices of stakeholder
management it will be easier for you to
answer scenario-based questions in the
examination in the next screen let us
look at the various organization
structure
projects are performed in an
organization and the functioning of the
organization might affect the project
the different organization structured
types explained here are based on the
level of authority that a project
manager gets into and those
organizations
in a functional type of organization the
organization is grouped by the area of
specialization within different
functional areas for instance marketing
accounting engineering Etc are
departments within the organization each
employee typically reports to a
functional manager in such types of
organization normally projects are
undertaken within the department itself
if a project requires any assistance
from another department the request
moves from the head of the requesting
Department to the head of the concern
Department the team members do their
normal departmental work in addition to
the project work
the next type of organization is
projectized organization in such
organizations there are no departments
the organization's resources mostly work
on projects team members report to a
project manager the project manager has
complete control over the resources when
the project is completed either they
move on to another project or they look
for some job outside the company they do
not have a department for themselves
the third type of organization is a
matrix organization which is a blend of
functional and projectized
organizational structure a team member
belongs to a department as well as they
are part of a project team in such
organization team members have two
bosses one their department head and the
second their project manager
since there are two bosses here this
type of organization is further
classified into three different types
they are weak strong and balanced Matrix
organization
so out of the two bosses that team
members have in Matrix organization if
the project manager has more authority
over the team member such organizations
are called strong Matrix where the
functional manager has more Authority
it's a weak Matrix organization if they
both share equal Authority then it is a
balanced organization
there is another term that you might
find in the exam called type Matrix this
generally refers to a co-located team
that is a team that has been placed in
the same location to enhance their
performance in the PMP exam if there is
no mention of the organization type you
can assume it to be a matrix
organization
let us look at each of these
organization structures in detail in the
next screen let us look at functional
organization
in a functional organization the
resources of the organization are
grouped by functions sometimes called
departments examples of functions could
be sales Finance Administration
manufacturing Etc
each function plays a definite role in
the organization and is headed by a
functional head or supervisor all the
resources in such an organization report
directly into their functions therefore
A salesperson would report into the
sales organizational hierarchy a
purchase executive would report into
procurement and so on you would notice
that in a functional organization the
project manager's role is not explicitly
called out when a functional
organization embarks on a project each
of the functions that are involved May
volunteer some resources to work on the
project one of these resources may end
up playing the project manager's role
the resource assignments may not even be
full time and sometimes even the project
manager is part-time since the project
manager has no authority over any of the
resources they are dependent on the
functional heads this makes it more
challenging for the project manager to
coordinate in the team
however functional organizations provide
an opportunity for specialization for
example if a purchase executive was
reporting into the purchase Department
that executive would have exposure to
all the purchasing that happens within
the organization and has a well-defined
career path
in functional organizations project
management happens at the functional
head level next let us look at the
projectized organization and the next
screen
the projectized organization has all the
resources aligned around projects the
project managers have complete control
over the resources working on their
projects the biggest advantage of the
projectized organization is that the
resources have loyalty to their projects
and project execution becomes easier
this kind of structure is suitable for
organizations whose work is in the
nature of projects there are few
disadvantages in this structure as well
firstly the role of the resource is over
once the project is completed secondly
highly specialized roles within a
project may not be fully occupied all
the time for example a purchase
executive may have work for selected
periods on a project while purchase
activities are going on however for the
rest of the period their capability may
not be optimally utilized there is less
scope for functional specialization as
the project boundaries limit the kind of
work for the resources
each project manager is in charge of a
project and its resources
next let us look at the Matrix
organization
in a matrix organization the resources
report to the functional managers and
are managed by the project managers as
well
there might even be a function that
represents all the project managers in
the organization which provides project
management expertise
The Matrix structure has three variants
commonly referred to as weak balanced
and strong
in a weak Matrix the authority of the
project manager is the weakest and
strongest in a strong Matrix structure
the titles given to project managers and
functional or weak Matrix organizations
are project expediter or project
coordinator they would be called project
managers in a balanced or strong Matrix
structure and have slightly more
authority over the time of the team
members the advantage of the Matrix
structure is that resources can be
optimally utilized while preserving the
capacity of the project managers to get
projects executed efficiently resources
can specialize in their functions and
have stability in their careers also
contribute to the projects at the same
time potentially
the disadvantage of Matrix organization
is that the communication overhead
increases significantly this is because
every resource in the organization
belongs into a project and into a
function leading to a dual reporting
structure
in a matrix organization project
management happens at project resource
level
in the next screen let us summarize the
advantages and disadvantages of
different organizational structures
each organization structure has its own
set of advantages and disadvantages the
advantage of functional organizations is
that resources may find clearly defined
career paths and Achieve specialization
and skill development in their
respective Fields it will be a flexible
Workforce since only one manager will be
responsible avoiding confusion the
disadvantage of such organization type
is that project work is hampered
Department work is always given higher
priority than the project work in
addition there is no career path in
project management which leads to lower
interest in projects
in the case of the projectized
organization one of the clear advantages
is better communication within the
projects since Project work is the only
work team members are doing it also
leads to loyalty towards the project
goals the disadvantage of such
organization type is the inefficient use
of resources because every project team
has their own support function therefore
this might lead to the duplication of
effort it also leads to the resources
being left with no work since their
roles are over once the project is
completed
it also hampers skill development
because the project requirements dictate
what kind of work team members perform
at different stages on a project
now let us look at the Matrix
organization it also has the advantage
of better coordination and maximum
utilization of resources
however the disadvantage is the higher
potential for conflict among the
managers which might lead to
communication complexity and overhead
management
in the next screen let us focus on the
comparison on Project Life Cycle and
product life cycle
Project Life Cycle spans the initiation
of a project until the closure of the
project
the product life cycle on the other hand
also encompasses the operational and
maintenance phases
a typical products lifecycle starts with
conception of the product and goes until
its withdrawal from the market the
withdrawal might be because it becomes
obsolete or there is no further need for
the product in the market
a product has a long life cycle a
product can require or spawn many
projects over its life
for example a project in product
conception phase could be to determine
customer needs whereas a project during
product maturity phase could be used to
perform competitive analysis
typically a product life cycle is longer
than the Project Life Cycle a project
also has its own life cycle and this
life cycle depends upon the industry and
the organization within which the
project is being executed
sometimes different organizations within
the same industry use different life
cycles
there can be questions in the exam based
on the comparison of project lifecycle
and product life cycle so understanding
the differences will be useful in
answering such questions
in the next screen let us discuss more
on Project Life Cycle
a life cycle is composed of phases each
phase represents a discrete unit of work
required to be done on the project there
are different ways of classifying
project life cycles let us first discuss
the sequential versus overlapping life
cycle
in sequential phases the subsequent
phase starts only after the previous
phase has been completed whereas in
overlapping phases two or more phases
may run in parallel for some time this
could help fast tracking and compressing
the amount of time required the other
way of classifying life cycles is how
they go about the process of planning
and predictive life cycles there is a
large upfront planning phase where all
the details of scope cost time are
planned before beginning the subsequent
phases
these phases then are executed in either
sequential or overlapping modes they are
suitable for large projects where all
the requirements are likely to be known
in advance and where upfront planning
effort is required to get the necessary
approvals another feature of predictive
life cycles is that each phase May
potentially be different in the nature
of activities and may require people
with different skill sets for example
traditional software development life
cycle has phases like requirements
feasibility planning design construction
testing and transition
we will continue project life cycles in
the next screen
incremental and iterative life cycles
have a short upfront high level
definition and planning phase
product is then developed through a
series of iterations where iteration
increments or adds to the functionality
by a little all the activities are
intentionally repeated in iterations
adaptive or agile life cycles are
variants of incremental and iterative
life cycles where iteration is very
short typically two to four weeks
agile methodologies are becoming very
popular in the software development
industry and in other Industries where
the requirements are highly changeable
and frequent feedback is beneficial
let us now check your understanding of
the topics covered in this lesson
here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson
project management is the application of
knowledge skills and tools and
techniques applied to project activities
to meet the project requirements
pmo provides the policies methodologies
and tools and templates for managing
projects within the organization
project manager has to integrate various
project aspects like the people
stakeholders risks communication and
procurements with the project
constraints time scope cost and quality
identifying internal and external
stakeholders determining their
requirements and communicating with them
regularly is an important role of a
project manager
functional projectized and Matrix are
the three types of organization
structures based on the level of
authority given to the project manager
Project Life Cycle spans the initiation
of a project until the closure while
product life cycle also encompasses the
operational and maintenance phases if

in this lesson we will focus on Project
Communications management let us begin
with the objectives of this lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to Define communication and project
Communications management identify the
different communication methods
technology and channels explain the
elements of a basic communication model
describe the project Communications
management processes in the next screen
let us take a quick look at the project
management process map
there are 47 processes and project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped into five process
groups in this lesson we will look at
the seventh knowledge area that is
Project Communications management and
its processes in the next screen let us
understand communication
communication can be best defined as a
two-way process of exchanging
information between two entities as you
can see on the screen if project is an
entity the project needs to communicate
with other entities in the organization
like project managers Senior Management
of the organization and any other
stakeholder of the project similarly
these entities may also have to
communicate with the projects the
communication between project and the
stakeholders is always two-sided project
manager is responsible for ensuring
proper communication to and from the
project in fact a project manager spends
almost 90 percent of his or her time on
communication you can now understand how
important it is for a project manager to
plan this activity well in the next
screen let us discuss communication
methods
communication can be done in two ways it
can be done written or verbal both
written as well as verbal communication
can either be formal or informal formal
means communicating by following some
basic rules whereas informal means
taking a casual approach these two
combinations result in four different
communication methods they are formal
written formal verbal informal written
and informal verbal formal written
method is used for project management
plans project Charter and over long
distance communication formal verbal
method is used during presentations
whereas informal written method is
applicable while writing notes or emails
informal verbal on the other hand is
applied during conversations
you can expect questions in the PMP exam
which require choosing a communication
method for a given situation so a fair
understanding of the communication
methods can help you score higher in the
next screen let us look at the various
communication Technologies
communication technology refers to the
different media used for communicating a
few such Technologies are listed on
screen among which email fax and
telephone are a few popular
communication Technologies in the next
screen let us understand the
communication Channel with the help of
an example
communication takes place between four
people in a team the lines across the
members represent there can be six
unique channels of communication
existing within the team now if the team
comprises 10 members how many unique
channels of communication will be
calculated you can use the formula n
multiplied with n minus 1 and the
resulting sum divided by two n is the
total number of people involved in
communication in this case n equals to
ten if this is put into the formula you
will get 45 as the result
therefore 45 unique communication
channels exist in a team of 10 people it
is difficult to manage such a large
number of communication channels
therefore it is important to structure
communication otherwise everyone starts
communicating everything to everyone and
it can become a real chaos in the
project in the PMP exam you may be asked
to calculate the number of communication
channels in a scenario-based question so
please make a note of the formula to
answer the question correctly in the
next screen let us discuss the basic
communication model
project Communications management
includes the processes required to
ensure that information about timely and
appropriate generation collection
distribution storage and ultimate
disposition of project is prepared and
circulated to all project stakeholders
it is the responsibility of a project
manager to ensure that the information
requested by the stakeholder is
communicated to them the frequency at
which the information needs to be shared
may also vary from stakeholder to
stakeholder for example think about a
simple process of sharing a project
status report with the customer and
Senior Management this knowledge area
explains how it should be done as per
PMI
in the next screen let us discuss the
project Communications management
processes
there are three project Communications
management processes
process is carried during different
process groups plan communication
management is done during planning
process group manage Communications is
done during executing process group and
control Communications is done during
monitoring and controlling process group
in the next few screens we will cover
each of these processes in detail
plan Communications management is the
process of developing an appropriate
approach and plan for project
Communications based on stakeholders
information needs and requirements and
available organizational assets
this belongs to the planning process
group stakeholder register is an
important input to this process it is a
list of all the stakeholders the project
management plan has information about a
large number of the project requirements
and the stakeholders who need to receive
communication of various kinds are
therefore a critical input to this
process in addition to these two
organization process assets and
Enterprise environmental factors are
also inputs to this process many
organizations have standard templates to
prepare communication management plan
which are part of the organizational
process assets and Enterprise
environmental factors the first
technique used in this process is the
communication requirements analysis
where the communication requirements of
each of the stakeholders are analyzed
and categorized in this you try to find
how many of the stakeholders need
similar kind of information which can be
grouped together if you send information
through an email system all those
stakeholders who need similar
information can be marked in CC in the
email next you can decide on the
communication technology these days
email is the most widely used technology
but in few cases you might have to send
information using some other technology
like fax or registered post for example
all government Communications are done
using registered post to keep a written
record finally you need to understand
how communication really happens that is
the communication models and the various
communication methods used you may need
to conduct meetings before agreeing on
and finalizing the communications
management plan the communications
management plan is the prime Mary output
of this process which lays down the
procedures around Communications in the
organization communication management
plan has information like which
stakeholder needs what kind of
information at what frequency and how as
a result of this process some other
project documents may also get updated
there may be questions in the PMP exam
based on the planned Communications
management process so a fair
understanding of the process will help
you answer such questions correctly in
the next screen let us look into a
business scenario to understand this
concept better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer
manage Communications is the process of
creating collecting Distributing storing
retrieving and the ultimate disposition
of project information in accordance to
the communications management plan it
belongs to the executing process group
managed Communications is done
throughout the Project Life Cycle
everything cannot be planned during
communication planning so manage
Communications takes care of responding
to unexpected requests for information
as well Communications management plan
is an important input work performance
reports have information regarding
project performance and Status
information organizational process
assets are the standard templates
created for the status report by
organizations in some organizations
there are guidelines for communication
distribution Enterprise environmental
factors are the other inputs to this
process various tools and techniques are
used in this process Communications
technology represents the means of
technology that is email instant
messaging telephone conferencing Etc
that are used to exchange information
the use of communication models helps
you determine the technique that is best
suited for a particular situation
communication methods are the various
methods used to communicate for example
whether it is interactive or offline
whether information is being pushed by
the provider or pulled by the recipient
Etc Information Management systems help
design a framework for managing the
information within a project that is how
it is acquired where it is stored and
how it is distributed and destroyed in
performance reporting all the
information is synthesized in the form
of performance reports that are later
distributed to the appropriate
stakeholders and forms an important part
of the communications strategy on a
project the first and primary output of
this process is the communications
messages that are generated during the
project the other outputs include
project management plan updates project
document updates and organizational
process assets updates in the next
screen let us discuss controlled
Communications process control
Communications is the process of
monitoring and controlling
Communications throughout the entire
Project Life Cycle to ensure the
information needs of the project
stakeholders are met it is part of the
monitoring and controlling process group
the inputs to this process are the
project communications project
management plan and issue log which has
a list of issues that are raised by
different project stakeholders data
related to the work being performed on
the project and various other project
documents which may have to be
communicated other inputs include work
performance data and organizational
process assets let us look at the tools
and techniques in detail the information
management systems provide tools to
collect consolidate and present the
information in the form of code concise
Communications expertise must be sought
from different stakeholders on how you
should go about this process several
meetings may be needed to ensure the
efficiency and efficacy of the
communications the major outputs of this
process is the work performance
information which indicates that the
work performance data has been analyzed
interpreted and presented in an easily
comprehensible form this process may
also give rise to change requests
updates to the project management plan
project documents and organizational
process assets in the next screen let us
look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer
here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson communication is
a two-way process of transferring
information from one entity to another
the four commonly used communication
methods are formal written formal verbal
informal written and informal verbal the
total number of unique channel of
communication can be calculated using
the formula n multiplied with n minus 1
and the resulting sum divided by two by
analyzing the communication model
problems in Project communication can be
identified project manager is
responsible for timely availability of
information to all stakeholders the
three project Communications management
processes are plan communication
management management Communications and
control Communications
in this lesson we will focus on Project
human resource management
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into ten knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the sixth
knowledge area that is Project human
resource management and its processes in
the next screen let us understand
project human resource management
project Human Resource Management
includes the processes that organize
manage and lead the project team
one of the key elements of human
resource management is that each of the
project team members should have clear
assignment of their roles and
responsibilities
in addition even the team working on
project management tasks should be a
part of the project team and they are
responsible for project management
functions like initiating planning
executing monitoring and controlling and
closing along with other leadership
activities in the next screen let us
understand the difference between
functional and project manager
an organization may have both functional
managers and project managers the
difference
functional manager is the one who
handles a business function or
department for instance the HR manager
is responsible for the HR department in
an organization therefore an HR Manager
will be a functional manager generally a
functional manager is also a subject
matter expert
the roles and responsibilities of the
functional manager depend upon the core
business of the organization and overall
organization structure functional
managers normally own the resources and
provide the projects with necessary
resources they also negotiate with the
project manager regarding resources the
project manager on the other hand is
responsible and accountable for the
success or failure of a project and the
quality of the project they are not
technical experts the project manager
may not have authority over the
resources depending upon the
organizational structure they often have
to negotiate with the functional manager
for the resources and are responsible
for the product quality a project
manager will credit the team with the
success of the project and accept the
blame for the failure
now let us look at an example to
understand the roles played by
functional and project managers the CEO
of an organization initiates a new
project to secure an ISO
9001
2008 certification for the company now
this project would require team members
from each of the company departments and
whoever is the project manager of this
project will have to request the
functional manager to assign one of
their team members to the project
resources assigned to the project go
back to their respective departments
once the project is completed
let us now discuss the project Human
Resource Management processes in the
next screen there are four project Human
Resource Management processes the first
process plan human resource management
is done as part of the planning process
group the next three processes are part
of the executing process group these
processes are acquire project team
develop project team and manage project
team let us now look into each of these
processes in detail in the next screen
let us begin with plan human resource
management
plan human resource management is the
process of identifying and documenting
project roles responsibilities required
skills reporting relationships and
creating a staffing management plan this
process is part of the planning process
group in addition to that finalizing the
project hierarchy of who reports to whom
and designing the Staffing management
plan is also part of this process
the first input to this process is the
project management plan there could be a
lot of information in the project
management plan and subsidiary plans
that may be relevant to the creation of
the human resource management plan for
example the Project Life Cycle processes
the timelines how the work will be
accomplished Etc the other key input for
this process is the activity resource
requirement team members can be
identified based on these requirements
in addition to this Enterprise
environmental factors like current
employment Outlook Etc are also
important for example if the economy is
booming and there are Apple job
opportunities for the team members the
reward and recognition system can keep
the project team interested in the
project organizational process asset is
also an input to this process an example
of the organization process assets can
be template or a form to request for a
new resource let us now look at the
tools and techniques used to develop
human resource plan
the roles and responsibilities are
captured in the form of organization
charts and position descriptions there
are various ways to draw this chart it
can be either hierarchical chart which
shows the reporting function or it can
be text based the other technique used
for developing the human resource plan
is networking this involves formal or
informal interactions within the
organization and outside by the project
manager to identify the best team for
the project depending upon various
interpersonal factors
organizational Theory helps to
understand how individuals come together
and function as an organization
expert judgment and meetings are
required to put the human resource plan
together
the output of this process is human
resource management plan this plan
contains documents like Staffing
management plan
project organization chart and roles and
responsibilities Matrix
the Staffing management plan is a
comprehensive document that describes
when and how team members would be added
to and released from the project
another component of the Staffing
management plan is the recognition and
reward system
recognition and reward system helps
project managers motivate their team the
Staffing management plan is relevant to
the projects of a functional or Matrix
organization where project team members
are always caught in a dilemma about
prioritizing Project work against
regular departmental work in the next
screen let us discuss organization
charts and role descriptions
a project manager needs to make sure
that there is an organization chart
prepared specifically for the project it
should clearly identify the roles and
the reporting relationships between them
a sample organization chart is shown on
the slide
another way of clearly delineating
responsibilities among team members is
by using a responsibility assignment
Matrix one form of responsibility
assignment Matrix is the raci chart in
the raci chart R stands for responsible
a for accountable C for concerned or
consulted and I for informed for each
important activity or deliverable on the
project it needs to be clearly
identified who is responsible or
contributes to it who is ultimately
accountable who is merely concerned
about the success and who needs to be
informed or kept in the loop an example
of the raci chart is shown on the screen
in this case project manager John is
accountable for the project plan and the
other team members Chris Sally and Ting
are responsible for completing the plan
similarly you can note the roles of each
resource in the other activities
in the next screen let us understand
resource histogram
resource histogram as a method of
depicting how many resources are
required for the life of a project if
You observe the chart shown on the
screen it indicates that the number of
Staff hours required on the project
increases to a peak in 2014 and then
slowly tapers off especially for long
running projects the level of Staffing
needed may vary considerably over a
period This has implications for other
parts of the plan as well for example
the cost will vary as the number of
resources change this piece of
information helps a project manager to
understand at what time they need to
onboard and off-board resources on a
project in the next screen let us look
into the second human resource
management process that is acquire
project team
acquire project team is the process of
confirming human resource availability
and obtaining the team necessary to
complete project activities
this process belongs to the executing
process group
acquiring resources may not be required
in the planning phase therefore it is
done in execution phase though you may
plan to acquire few in the planning
phase major acquisition is done in
execution phase this may be true where
large projects are run spanning over
many years with several detailed
activities the key input is the human
resource management plan Enterprise
environmental factors help understand
which team members will be available to
work on the project
how much they will cost
Etc organizational process assets will
help understand the hiring procedure of
the company the policies that govern the
use of team members on the project
Etc the key technique for acquiring the
project team is negotiation as a project
manager you have to negotiate with the
company's Senior Management resource
manager or with prospective candidates
to secure the most suitable resources on
the project sometimes the resources may
be pre-assigned to a project this
typically happens when they are the key
resources without which the project
cannot take off sometimes the project
team is acquired by getting required
resources through external vendors most
of the bigger organizations have
approved a list of vendors who provide
resources on a contractual basis
nowadays the concept of virtual team is
also quite popular to get a project team
so even though the project is being
conceived in one country a big big part
of the team can be in another country
for example if the project is conceived
in the USA majority of the team can be
in Germany and both the teams can
coordinate over the phone email chat Etc
multi-criteria decision analysis is also
an important tool to achieve the
objectives while acquiring the human
resources for the project it is
important to consider a number of
factors such as availability cost skill
set experience attitude relocation needs
Etc these criteria have to be considered
in totality and balanced out against the
Project's requirements the output of
this process is Project staff
assignments resource calendars and
updates on project management plan let
us now discuss the next process develop
project team
once the project team is acquired the
next step is developing the project team
develop project team is the process of
improving competencies team member
interaction and overall team environment
to enhance project performance
this process belongs to the executing
process group the inputs to this process
include project staff assignments
resource calendars and Human Resource
Management plan one of the techniques
used in developing project team is
interpersonal skills it is more of an
art than a science and this is where
individual characteristics of project
managers matter a lot if the project
manager genuinely commands trust and
respects the team members developing the
team becomes easy team members look up
to the project manager not only for
getting Project Specific Instructions
but also for their career advancement as
well social activities like celebrating
a team member's birthday going for
parties outside the office
Etc helps in team building training is
also an important tool for developing
the project team as it helps in
increasing the knowledge of competencies
of the team members sometimes
co-locating the team members at a single
place also helps in developing team
bonding this is especially important if
team members work from different
geographical locations knowing a person
face to face does help in reducing
conflict project managers can also
encourage the team members by providing
recognition and rewards Personnel
assessment tools give the project
manager insights into the strengths and
opportunities for improvement in the
team members these tools also help in
understanding members aspirations so
that the project manager can better
align the project goals with the
individual aspirations finally the
project manager should also set some
ground rules in the project to ensure
that team performs their work without
any problems some such rules can be
everyone should reach office for daily
meeting by 9 30 am sharp if there is
more than a 10 delay in completing any
activity assigned it should immediately
be escalated to project manager if there
are any unforeseen circumstances it
should be immediately brought to the
notice of the project manager Etc the
output of this process is team
performance assessments this is done by
the project manager to evaluate and
enhance the effectiveness of the team as
a whole this is a document which
explains team Effectiveness as
information about the team evolves the
Enterprise environmental factors may
also be updated questions that test a
project manager's role in developing a
project team can be expected in the PMP
exam so ensure that you have a fair
understanding of the role before you
take the exam in the next screen let us
discuss the manage project team process
managing the project team is different
from developing the project team though
it is also done during the execution
process group it relates to measuring
team members performance providing
feedback resolving issues and managing
changes to optimize project performance
to measure team members performance the
manager should know the work assigned to
them as well as their performance on the
assigned work hence project staff
assignments and team performance
assessments are listed as input to this
process the human resource management
plan serves as a guideline for managing
project teams some organizations have
template and procedures to do such
assessment and that being the reason why
organization process asset is also one
of the inputs to this process the work
performance reports as well as issue
logs will be inputs because the team
management activities have to be
performed in this context observation
and conversation is a technique where
the project manager monitors and
discusses the tasks done by the team
this does not imply formal project
status reports but having an informal
interaction with the team before
documenting the project status report
knowing about the issue early helps in
resolving them early formal performance
appraisals are helpful in evaluating the
team members performance on the project
the project manager creates these with
the help of the team supervisors it is
an established practice in most
organizations to evaluate team members
for their work this may have a bearing
on their future assignments salary
promotions Etc since the power of
appraising lies within the project
manager the project manager can use this
as an effective tool for managing the
team since multiple resources work on a
single project it is quite natural to
expect conflicts it is the
responsibility of project manager to
resolve conflicts Conflict Management
has been discussed in detail later in
the lesson you can expect questions on
Conflict Management in the exam
the other tool is interpersonal skills
the output of managing a project team
includes corrective action
recommendations like which team members
to be changed implementing some reward
system to motivate the team Etc updating
the project management plans documents
organization process asset and
Enterprise environmental factors are the
other outputs of this process there can
be questions in the PMP exam that test a
project manager's skill in managing a
project team so ensure that you are
aware of the inputs tools and techniques
and outputs of managing a project team
let us discuss Team Dynamics in the next
screen any team naturally goes through
several stages as it gets together these
stages are forming storming norming
performing and adjourning informing
stage a team formally comes together for
the first time in storming stage
disagree payments start to surface this
is followed by norming when the teams
start working together and trusting each
other in performing stage they are able
to deliver results as a team finally the
team is adjourned when the work of the
project is completed or the project is
terminated
in the next screen let us discuss
conflict management
many organizations look for people with
diverse background to get different
perspectives about work if people with
diverse backgrounds and culture work on
a project it is quite natural to expect
conflict conflict often results in
opportunities for improvement the root
causes of conflict can be scarce
resources scheduling priorities and
personal work Styles while the popular
belief is that personality or ego can be
the key reason for conflict it is the
least possible reason for conflict as a
project manager if you find yourself in
between a conflict with a team member
sit across the table and resolve it if
not they should get their immediate
managers involved and try to resolve it
to avoid conflicts a project manager
should let everyone involved have
complete clarity about the project
assign the roles and responsibilities to
each of the team members clearly ensure
that there are no overlapping
responsibilities which could be a
possible cause for conflict sometimes
boredom at work can also lead to
conflict so one of the responsibilities
of project manager is to keep motivating
the team members and let them work on
interesting and challenging assignments
business scenarios based questions on
Conflict Management can be expected in
the PMP exam so it is essential to have
a fair understanding of the topic in the
next screen let us look at conflict
resolution techniques
there are five techniques of resolving
conflict they are withdraw or avoid
smooth or accommodate compromise or
reconcile force or direct collaborate or
problem solve in withdraw or avoid one
Retreats from a potential conflict
situation or defers the resolution to a
later date this does not resolve the
conflict but allows for more time in
smooth or accommodate areas of agreement
are emphasized to reduce the intensity
of the conflict again this does not on
its own result in a resolution but it
may succeed in changing the perceptions
about the situation in compromise or
reconcile there is some give and take in
order to bring some satisfaction to all
parties depending on how the process
went this may be perceived as a when
when or a lose-lose situation because
none of the parties really get what they
want enforce or direct a person in a
position of authority directs how the
matter should be resolved it may be
necessary to do this when the matter has
to be resolved immediately however this
may result in upsetting one or more of
the conflicting parties and collaborate
or problem solving the parties in the
conflict are asked to come together to
collaborate and look for a resolution to
the problem this offers the greatest
likelihood of a satisfactory and
permanent resolution and should be
resorted to whenever possible business
scenario-based problems where a
resolution technique has to be selected
can be expected in the PMP exam so
understanding the conflict resolution
techniques is essential in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer one of the key
responsibilities of a project manager is
to get work done by the team there are
certain powers that a project manager
can use to get the work done a project
manager has to use a combination of
techniques to get this accomplished
various powers of a project manager are
legitimate or formal reward penalty
expert and referent in legitimate or
formal project manager can formally
assign a work to a team member that he
or she has to do project manager can
reward and recognize the team members
the reward could be as simple as
assigning challenging or sought after
work to a team member this can motivate
good performers on the project sometimes
project manager can penalize the team
member numbers for poor performance some
project managers are able to command
Authority because of their expertise in
a certain field project manager can be
considered as a reference of higher
authority to get the work done sometimes
referent Authority also arises from the
personal charm or Charisma of the
project manager legitimate reward and
penalty are the powers derived from the
project manager's position in the
company expert power exists when the
project manager is an expert on the
subject matter reward and expert are
usually the best forms of authority to
use penalty is the worst way of
influencing and managing the team a
project manager should resort to this
only as a last option regardless of the
project manager having formal reporting
authority over the team they are
naturally looked upon as the leaders for
their projects project managers need to
be familiar with the leadership styles
and be able to tailor their style
according to the needs of the project
and that of the team there are three
leadership styles the first one is
authoritarian or autocratic in this
style the leader sets clear expectations
of the team and expects complete
compliance in a participative or
Democratic style the leader offers
guidance but also involves the team in
decision making in a delegative or
laissez-faire style the leader leaves
the work to the team without offering
much guidance in most circumstances you
would want your leader to employ a
participative style but there may be
occasions when other styles might be
appropriate in the next screen let us
discuss McKenzie's 7s framework
a popular framework in management
science is the McKenzie's 7s framework
there are seven elements that are
divided into two categories an
organization working on a project will
have these elements already in place and
hence these become the hard elements the
first three elements of the 7s framework
are the strategy structure and systems
the leader or project manager is
expected to step in and exhibit soft
elements to earn the mantle of
leadership
the next four elements are shared values
Skills style and staff
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the
eighth knowledge area that is Project
risk management and its processes risk
is an uncertain event or condition that
can affect a project positively or
negatively although most of the time you
view this uncertainty as bad sometimes
it also has a likely positive outcome
let us look at an example of risk having
a positive outcome you are using a
software for managing timesheet of your
team members due to budget constraints
you are forced to use a new software
though you were initially reluctant to
use it you found the new software to do
better than the current one it is more
efficient and has better reporting
facility an example of bad uncertainty
can be swine flu government declares
mandatory holiday to check flu spread
which may affect your project object
work risks can be managed only if they
are measured quantitatively Suppose
there are many risks identified in a
project and you have limited resources
to manage them you should know which
risk is most important that has to be
managed first therefore measuring risk
becomes very critical risk is measured
by assigning a monetary value to it and
that value is arrived at by multiplying
the probability and impact of the risk
risk can be categorized in various ways
one such categorization is external
internal technical or project management
related risk external risk arises out of
external policies or regulations for
example government policy that the river
water can be used for drinking purposes
May hinder your production which is
dependent on the river water internal
risk arises from within the project for
example the complexity of the work may
result in time and cost escalation
technical risks arise from the
technology being used projects and space
exploration have a lot of technical
complexity risks could be related to
project management for example if there
are many interdependencies between the
sub-projects it is a risk from the
project management standpoint
the categorization of risk can be based
on the origin risks can be classified as
scope risk resource risk schedule risk
cost risk and quality risk
scope risk can include redoing the same
task if the scope is not well understood
when the only resource is assigned to
some other project it is called resource
risk a decision tree helps in analyzing
risk and its impact on making decisions
in a scenario where there is uncertainty
on the outcome suppose you want to buy a
car you can buy either a new car or an
old car which one should you buy which
has more risk over a period of five
years consider the concept of decision
tree to solve this problem the initial
cost of buying a new car is twenty
thousand dollars and the cost of buying
an old car is fifteen thousand dollars
for a new car the probability of it
having any problem fail scenario is only
10 percent that is there is a ninety
percent likelihood that it will just
work without any problems past scenario
and if it does have any at all the
impact of the problem is fifteen
thousand dollars the reason is that it
was bought at a higher cost an old car
has seventy percent probability of
having a problem the reason being the
probability is high because the car was
already used by someone else in the past
however the impact here is low say ten
thousand dollars if you add probability
multiplied by impact of both the options
at the decision nodes you will find
buying an old car over a period more
risky than buying a new car the project
cost will be arrived at after
considering the risk reserves of both
the known risks and unknown risks there
is a specific order in which these
reserves are calculated in the project
cost First the cost of all activities is
identified activities are the smallest
unique project tasks all the activity
costs add up to the cost of the work
packages work packages are the last
level of classification in a work
breakdown structure work packages costs
adds up to the control account cost one
or more work packages are clubbed
together to create a control account and
manage the cost of the work packages
next the project costs are identified
there can be multiple control accounts
in a project now once the project cost
is calculated some Reserve is added to
take care of any uncertainties you may
have made some assumptions to calculate
the cost of the activities and by adding
some Reserve you would want to take care
of those uncertainties in this case make
a note that you are accounting for the
assumptions made and it can be said that
this Reserve takes care of known
uncertainties this Reserve is also
called contingency reserve at this point
you have arrived at the cost Baseline
that is the cost for the project that
will be used for budgeting and tracking
purposes once the planned cost is
arrived there there is another Reserve
that gets added called management
Reserve note that management reserves
are not part of the cost Baseline and
are used during emergencies only by
adding contingency reserve you have
taken care of known uncertainties and by
adding management Reserve you take care
of unknown uncertainties that is those
risks that perhaps have not yet been
identified unknown uncertainties are
added based on experience or expert
judgment project risk management
includes the processes of conducting
risk management planning identification
analysis response planning and
controlling risk on a project the key
objective of risk management is to
increase the probability and or impact
of positive events and decrease the
probability and or impact of negative
events there are six risk management
processes
plan risk management identify risks
perform qualitative risk analysis
perform quantitative risk analysis and
plan risk responses belong to the
project Planning Group and control risks
belong to the monitoring and controlling
process group in this lesson we will
focus on Project stakeholder management
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the 10th
knowledge area that is Project
stakeholder management and its processes
in the next screen let us understand who
stakeholders are
a stakeholder is anybody who has a stake
in the project a stakeholder may be an
individual a group or an organization
who may affect or be affected by or
perceive to be affected by a decision
activity or outcome of a project further
the nature of the impact can be positive
or negative thus giving rise to the
notion of positive or negative
stakeholders irrespective of whether a
stakeholder is positive or negative it
is important to engage with the
stakeholders and get them involved in
the project this can make a critical
difference to the success or failure of
the project a single disgruntled
stakeholder can bring the entire project
to its knees whereas an actively engaged
and influential stakeholder can have the
opposite effect let us understand who
the common stakeholders of a project are
there are several categorizations of
stakeholders the project managers
themselves are important stakeholders
the project team members represent
stakeholders in the project the Senior
Management of the organization which is
working on the project has a stake in
the project the sponsor that is the
person or entity that provides the money
and resources for the project and
essentially Champions the project is an
important stakeholder the customer which
may be different from the sponsor is a
stakeholder as well for instance and
many of the projects in the social
sector the sponsor may be the government
or a development agency whereas the
customers would be the people who
actually benefit from it the end users
which may be different from the
customers or the sponsors are
stakeholders too the vendors or
suppliers who provide goods or services
to the project are important
stakeholders people whose lives may be
impacted by the output of the project
are also stakeholders for example if a
highway project requires possession of
privately owned land people whose land
is being taken away are the stakeholders
if the construction of a dam or water
reservoir benefits the downstream
farming communities they are the
stakeholders here competitors who
provide alternative goods or services
are stakeholders too sometimes
environmentalists or other social groups
may become stakeholders the government
or political leadership may become
stakeholders for projects in the public
domain it is sufficient to state that
there could potentially be hundreds of
stakeholders for a large project it is
in the interest of the project manager
and the project team to clearly identify
all such stakeholders up front and then
actively manage them throughout the
project in the next screen let us
discuss the classification models for
stakeholder analysis
not all the stakeholders have the same
amount of influence or power over the
project therefore the way to manage each
stakeholder needs to be calibrated based
on a proper classification of the
stakeholders this is the role of the
classification model you can come up
with a grid that Maps the power of the
stakeholders the interest they have the
influence they may have or the impact
that they can have on the project
through the power interest power
influence or influence impact grids it
can be represented by mapping
stakeholders to a power or interest grid
the diagram on the screen has x-axis
which represents interest level and
y-axis which represents the power level
based on the various combinations of
power levels and interest levels the
grid can be divided into four quadrants
the stakeholders on the top right
quadrant with high power and high
interest need to be managed closely that
is you have to monitor their involvement
and engagements very closely the
stakeholders on the bottom right
quadrant with high interest but low
power need to be kept in the loop that
is you should share information with
them and keep them regularly informed
the stakeholders on the top left
quadrant with high power but low
interest can be managed by keeping them
happy for example by making sure that
their interests and opinions are taken
into consideration the stakeholders on
the left bottom quadrant with low power
and low interest may be managed less
actively by simply monitoring how things
are going with them the salience model
describes classes of stakeholders based
on their power ability to impose their
will
urgency need for immediate attention and
legitimacy appropriateness of their
involvement level this is a useful
framework to guide the stakeholder
management strategy on a project
practice creating power grids for
business scenarios this will help in
understanding the level of Engagement of
project manager needs to maintain with
various stakeholders
in the next screen let us discuss the
stakeholder engagement assessment Matrix
the stakeholder engagement assessment
Matrix allows visualizing the current
and desired states of a stakeholder's
involvement in the project the five
levels of involvement are as unaware
resistant neutral supportive and leading
unaware is where the stakeholder is not
aware of the project or its impact
resistant is where the stakeholder is
aware of the impacts and is resistant to
change neutral is where the stakeholder
is aware of the project and is neither
supportive nor in opposition to the
project supportive is where the
stakeholder is aware of the project and
its impact and is supportive of the
change leading is where the stakeholder
is aware of the project and impacts and
is actively engaged to ensure that the
project is successful
let us now look at the Matrix the table
has one row per stakeholder identified
you place C in the column which best
indicates the current level of
Engagement for that stakeholder then you
place D in the column which best
indicates the desired state of
Engagement this table can be a quick
visualization tool that helps understand
where work has to be done in the
stakeholder management activities in the
next screen let us discuss the skills
required for stakeholder management
stakeholder management is both an art
and a science
since it involves dealing with people
and people are inherently non-linear and
unpredictable there is no one size that
fits all strategies or tools that will
work while managing them
however a project manager may use a few
traits and techniques while managing
stakeholders which are classified as
interpersonal skills and managerial
skills a project manager must possess
good interpersonal skills that is must
invest the time and energy to build
trust this involves multiple things such
as establishing a personal Rapport
following through on commitments being
punctual Etc once the trust is
established it helps in smoothing many
difficult bends conflict management is
an important skill for a project manager
while communicating with stakeholders
the project manager must practice active
listening they must not assume that they
have all the answers
instead they should spend some time to
understand the issues and the
stakeholders points of view this alone
can go a long way in smoothing ruffled
feathers and building constructive
relationships resistance to change is
natural a project manager must know how
to convert that into a positive energy
in its favor managerial skills that may
help in accomplishing the project
objectives a project manager must be
able to build consensus among the group
while absolute uniformity may not always
be possible or desirable the project
manager must use techniques to ensure
widespread discussions and arrive at a
path that the group can buy into the
project manager must be able to
influence people often without
necessarily being in the position of
authority the project manager must be
skillful to negotiate agreements the
project manager must be able to
understand and modify organizational
behavior in order to move the project in
a certain direction
Network diagram is extensively used in
the project time management knowledge
area to plot the activity dependencies
this is a graphical representation of
the project activities in the form of a
network
there are two ways to draw a network
diagram
in precedence diagramming model PDM or
activity on node Aon boxes represent
activities and the arrows indicate the
dependency this type of network can have
all four types of relationships between
the activities
in Arrow diagramming model ADM or
activity on Arrow AOA the arrows
represent activities the relationships
and sequences can be inferred from the
direction of the arrows and linkages
between the activities
and such types of network only finish to
start relationships can be shown
such diagrams may need to make use of
dummy activities to indicate some
dependency between the activities
there may be questions in the PMP exam
based on the network diagram so create
and work with the diagram this will make
answering Network diagram based
questions easy and fun
in the next screen let us look at a
network diagram
a sample Network diagram is shown on the
screen activities A and C can happen in
parallel B and D require both A and C to
complete whereas e requires both B and D
to complete activity on Arrow Network
diagram makes use of hammock activities
they are used to show a comprehensive
summary activity combining several other
activities underneath for control and
Reporting purposes in this lesson we
will focus on Project scope management
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the
second knowledge area that is Project
scope management and its processes let
us begin with the first topic of this
lesson that is Project scope management
project scope management includes the
processes required to ensure that a
project comprises all and only the work
required to complete the project
successfully the project scope
management is concerned about the scope
what is not there in the scope is also
clearly identified
in the next screen let us look at the
Key activities performed under project
scope management
let us look at a few of the typical
activities that happen as part of the
project scope management
constant monitoring is essential to make
sure that all the project work is being
completed the gradual uncontrolled
increase in scope of the project is
referred as scope creep
it is necessary to define the project
scope boundaries and not let people
randomly add to the project scope
gold plating is doing more than what is
required as part of the project scope
this has to be avoided in projects
as per the published statistics about
projects done globally less than 40
percent of projects can be considered
successful therefore the focus should be
on what is required rather than
squandering around with what is not
required forty percent might be
considered less but a project is
classified as successful only if it
meets all its objectives and is done
within time and cost budgets
in the next screen let us understand the
differences between product scope and
project scope
project scope management deals with
managing both the product scope as well
as the project scope
product scope refers to the features and
functions that characterize a product
service or result
the word product may also include
creation of a service for example in the
banking industry each of their services
is called a product
likewise a savings account is one of
their products mutual fund is another on
the other hand project scope is the work
that needs to be accomplished to deliver
the output of the project which could be
a product service or result with the
specific features and functions
for instance to deliver a product you
may also need to produce a requirements
document or a design document
these are not part of the product scope
but it may very well be part of the
project scope in the next screen let us
discuss a few key terms used in the
project scope management
WBS stands for work breakdown structure
it means breaking the project
deliverables into smaller and more
manageable components called work
packages the last level of work in such
subdivision is called work packages and
the whole structure is called WBS
for example a typical software
development project would have various
activities like finalizing requirements
designing the new system coding testing
and going live with the new system each
of these translates into high level
deliverables which can be further
subdivided into smaller activities which
are more predictable
WBS dictionary like any dictionary
contains the explanation of the terms
used in WBS
a typical WBS dictionary has details
like the control account name of the
work package description of the work
package resource assigned if there are
any assumptions or dependencies to
complete the work package the due date
to finish the work package Technical
dependencies and so on
WBS dictionary is useful for the person
or group working on the work packages as
it further elaborates the decomposed
work package
control account is a level within WBS at
which management wishes to exercise
control for example perform earned value
analysis Track Performance
Etc in this lesson we will focus on
Project integration management
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the first
knowledge area that is Project
integration management and its processes
in the next screen let us understand the
concept of project integration
management
project integration management involves
unification consolidation articulation
and integrative actions that are crucial
for successfully completing the project
the project integration management is
high-level work that project manager
does and it involves managing
interdependencies among the other
knowledge areas the other nine knowledge
areas involve detailed work in a
specific direction for example project
cost management Deals Only with how to
manage cost in a project
the project management processes do not
happen independently for example a new
resource added to the project may
require changes in cost or schedule or
both in dealing with such situations the
project manager integrates the processes
of project management the need for
integration drives much of the
communication and the work of the
project manager let us discuss the key
role of project manager sponsor and team
in the next screen
project manager team members and project
sponsors have different roles to play in
a project
the project manager is supposed to play
multiple roles in the project the key
role is to perform integration the
project manager puts all the pieces of
the project together into a cohesive
whole in doing so the project manager
tries to ensure that the project is done
faster cheaper and utilizes resources
optimally while meeting the project
objectives
as the project progresses the team
members work on completing the project
activities the role of the Project's
sponsor is to protect project from any
unnecessary changes and to ensure that
it has the required resources for
completion
the Project's sponsor is the champion
for the project within the Performing
organization that is the organization in
which the work is being performed
in the next screen we will cover the
project selection methods
an organization can undertake a project
under contract with an external
organization or take up a project driven
by internal business needs
there should be a formal process of
selecting project in all organizations
to ensure that it is making the best
possible use of limited corporate
resources
for example if the organization has an
option to take up any one out of the two
projects both of which use the same
corporate resources the organization
would naturally select the one which is
more profitable
there are two broad ways to select a
project one way is the benefit
measurement method where one project is
compared with other competing projects
another approach is based on
mathematical models wherein you examine
the most optimal selection of projects
by trying to optimize a goal for example
maximize operating profits such methods
may be called constrained optimization
methods
there are different methods under both
these categories and you should be
familiar with the names of these methods
broadly the benefit measurement methods
focus on ascertaining the costs and
benefits of undertaking the project
the methods under benefit measurement
method include murder board where a
panel of experts shoots down a new
project idea peer review scoring models
economic models and benefit compared to
cost
the constrained optimization methods
rely on mathematical modeling techniques
to determine the best selection of
projects to achieve certain business
objectives the methods of constrained
optimization method include linear
programming
in reality you might not have seen these
methods to be followed in Project
selection
often personal relationship with the
sponsor may be more important than
anything else this is quite normal and
any organization worldwide works this
way however as a certified project
manager it is important for you to be
familiar with more scientific methods of
project selection
a typical question on the PMP exam could
be what type of project selection
technique is peer review and the right
answer is benefit measurement method you
need to understand the characteristics
of various project selection methods to
answer scenario-based questions in the
next screen we will focus on the project
selection methods
there are five project management
processes which are part of project
integration management knowledge area
they are the develop project Charter
done in the initiation process group
develop project management plan
undertaken in the planning process group
direct and manage work carried out in
the executing process group Monitor and
control project and perform integrated
Change Control undertaken in the
monitoring and controlling process group
and close project or phase done in the
closing process group
develop project Charter is an initiating
process a project Charter is essentially
a document that authorizes a project
once a project has received a charter it
means that the project manager can start
employing the organization's resources
for the project activities
let us look at the key inputs to be
considered in preparing the project
Charter
the first input is the project statement
of work this is created by project
sponsor or the customer describing their
needs project scope and how the project
fits into their strategic goal if the
project is taken up under a contract the
request for proposal that is RFP can be
considered as project statement of work
the next input is the business case this
document establishes whether the
investment in a project is worth from a
business point of view the business need
for the project and the cost benefit
analysis it provides important
information to the project manager about
the goals of the project and the
boundaries in terms of the desired
results cost Etc
if the project is being undertaken as
part of a contract or agreement the
agreement provides an important input
for the project manager that establishes
what must be done in the project
the next input to be considered for
project Charter is Enterprise
environmental factors
any project to be executed within the
organization has to deal with the
organization culture and existing
systems you can consider this as an
organization baggage that comes with the
project this is the reason a project
being executed in two different
organizations may be done differently
another factor to be considered is
organizational process assets
this is a broad term and includes all
the organizational processes procedures
and policies corporate knowledge base
and historical project information
every organization develops a set of
processes procedures and policies that
are based on the best practices learned
by the organization over time the
historical information includes past
project management plans risks Lessons
Learned Etc of similar projects executed
now let us look at the tools and
techniques used in this process
the first technique is expert judgment
expert judgment is an invaluable input
to the process of formally authorizing a
project because an expert can provide
insights into why a project makes
business sense or why it does not from
experience they may be able to shed
light about the validity of the business
drivers feasibility assumptions and
constraints that need to be considered
for the project
facilitation techniques is another
technique used the chartering process is
often a collaborative activity involving
many influential stakeholders in an
organization
facilitation techniques help bring all
these stakeholders together and engage
in fruitful discussions in order to
arrive at an informed decision whether
to go ahead with a project or not
the only output of this project is the
project Charter let us try to understand
what the project Charter might contain
the project Charter usually contains the
high-level project requirement and it
should be created by the project sponsor
and handed over to the project manager
the project manager can do the
groundwork to prepare the project
Charter but it must be signed by the
project sponsor or somebody in the
Performing organization who is higher in
Authority than the project manager
it is important to point out that a
project Charter is not a project
management plan the detailed risk
schedule cost analysis Etc is part of
the project management plan and should
be done during the project planning
phase when there is more detail on the
availability of the project to do so the
charter should be sufficiently high
level to accommodate the minor changes
that might arise in the project
in this lesson we will focus on project
management processes
project lifecycle addresses the question
what to do to get the work done
it varies industry-wise for example let
us look at a typical Project Life Cycle
in a software industry first you
understand what is required and analyze
it as part of the requirement analysis
phase then as part of the design phase
you figure out the implementation of it
and arrive with the approach next you
implement the functionality by writing
the code as part of the coding phase the
code is then verified to ensure it works
right as part of the testing phase the
tested and verified software is then
installed at the customer locations as
part of the installation phase after the
installation the system then moves into
operations and support phase
the project management process addresses
the question what to do to manage the
project
the process is for managing the projects
are likely to be the same across
Industries
for instance in the develop schedule
process one needs to develop the project
schedule irrespective of the industry or
domain you're working
in the next screen let us understand the
project management process groups
the project management processes are
divided into five process groups they
are initiating process group planning
process group executing process group
monitoring and controlling process group
and closing process group
the initiating process happens at the
beginning of the project or a phase the
planning executing ads monitoring and
controlling processes go together
therefore you plan execute and replan
based on the execution result
the project closing processes are
performed when the project work or a
phase within the project is completed
the typical project management process
and the closing phase releases resources
back to the resource pool so the team
members can be assigned to another
project
note the iteration of processes within
the phases is dependent on the scale of
the projects small projects may have
only one iteration whereas bigger
projects may have multiple iterations
before they enter a new phase
project management processes are
overlapping activities let us look at
the interaction between these activities
in the next screen
process groups have overlapping
activities that occur throughout the
Project Life Cycle
the output of one process group is
generally the input to another or a
deliverable of the project for example
project management plan is an output of
planning process group and an input to
execution process group
note that production of the plan is not
a one-time activity as the project
progresses the project management plan
may get updated as a result of the
monitoring and controlling processes the
updated project management plan once
again forms an input to the execution
process group
in the next screen we will discuss the
project management process group
knowledge area and project management
process mapping
given on the screen is the list of the
47 project management processes 10
knowledge areas and five process groups
the table shows how each of them is
interrelated you can see that the
project integration management processes
can be mapped back to all five process
groups while project scope management
processes are mapped back to only
planning and monitoring process group
study the table to identify processes
under project management and the
knowledge area they belong to all the 47
processes are described in detail in
this tutorial
each knowledge area is covered in detail
as a lesson it also covers how the
process is mapped to process groups to
help you understand the big picture
further the inputs and outputs of each
of these processes tools and techniques
that are used in these processes and
what exactly happens during these
processes are also discussed
earned value technique is an excellent
way to track the project progress
against the project plan it is a method
of measuring the project performance
objectively and comparing it against the
project Baseline results from an earned
value analysis indicate deviation of the
project from cost and schedule baselines
Baseline is the initial approved value
along with approved changes therefore
schedule Baseline is the first approved
project schedule along with approved
changes
there are various terms used in earned
value technique
planned value is the authorized budget
assigned to the scheduled work
earned value is the work performed in
terms of budget authorized for that work
actual cost is the cost incurred in work
performed budget at completion is the
budgeted amount for the total work
estimate at completion is the expected
total cost for the project
estimate to complete is the expected
cost to finish all the remaining Project
work
variance at completion is the projected
budget surplus or deficit at the end of
the project all the parameters displayed
on the screen are measured in terms of
cost you may come across business
scenario based questions on earned value
Management in the PMP exam so ensure
that you develop a clear understanding
of this topic let us look at an example
of a planned value in the next screen
planned value is the estimated value of
the work planned this value is measured
in terms of currency say dollar if the
plan value is three hundred forty
dollars then the work plan is worth
three hundred forty dollars
how do you calculate earned value the
solution is add the budget allocated to
each of the activities that have been
completed at the point of time the
resulting value is the earned value
in the next screen let us look at the
formula used to calculate earned value
in cost variance negative means the
project is over budget positive means
the project is under budget similarly in
schedule variance negative means the
project is behind schedule whereas
positive means the project is ahead of
schedule
the value of the next two parameters
cost performance index CPI and schedule
performance index SPI values vary
between 0 and 1. for example a CPI of
0.8 implies that 80 cents of work is
obtained for every dollar spent in the
project similarly if SPI is 0.9 it
implies that project is progressing at
only 90 percent of the speed originally
planned
the next parameter is estimate at
completion or EAC
there are different ways of calculating
the EAC value the method used depends on
how the cost and schedule variances are
expected to play for the rest of the
project BAC by CPI is used if you expect
that the current cost performance will
continue until the end of the project
AC plus BAC minus EV is used if you
expect that the rest of the project will
be managed at the budgeted rate
AC plus BAC minus EV by the product of
CPI and SPI is used if you want to
factor in the impact of the cost as well
as schedule variances
AC plus Etc is used if you want to
re-evaluate the Project based on a
forecast value for the estimated cost of
the remainder of the project
the next parameter is estimate to
complete or
Etc which is the cost of project from
this point to the end
this is calculated by subtracting the
actual cost from the estimate and
completion in addition variance at
completion can be calculated by
subtracting the estimate at completion
from the budget at completion variance
at completion is the cost estimation
whether it is over or under budget
another parameter is the to complete
performance index or tcpi this is the
cost performance needed to achieve a
desired outcome
for example if the project needs to be
managed to the original budget BAC then
tcpi that is the CPI that must be
maintained for the rest of the project
is calculated as BAC minus EV by BAC
minus AC
similarly if it has to be managed within
a revised Target say EAC then tcpi is
calculated as BAC minus EV by EAC minus
AC before the start of the PMP exam
please make a note of the formulas of
earned value technique in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer
let us take the example of a software
development project there are four
phases and each phase takes a month to
complete and is expected to cost ten
thousand dollars the phases are planned
to be completed one after the other the
status of the project at the end of the
month 3 is summarized in the table
requirements definition is completed and
actual spending on this is ten thousand
dollars
architecture and design is done and
actual spending on this is twelve
thousand dollars development and unit
testing is only fifty percent done
though it was supposed to be completed
by Third month it has cost nine thousand
dollars until date
system testing and go live has not yet
started
Note S indicates start time F indicates
finish time and PF indicates that it is
partly finished at the end of the month
based on the above information calculate
the CV SV CPI and SPI of the project
let us look at a solution in the next
screen
before we end this lesson let us also
look at a few definitions that might be
useful for your PMP examination
law of diminishing return this means the
more you put into something the less you
get out of it for example doubling the
number of resources working on a project
will not necessarily have the time
working capital the amount of money the
company has to invest on the project and
the day-to-day company operations
funding limit reconciliation the process
of comparing the planned expenditure in
a given period with the available
funding for that period
large assets purchased by the company
lose value over time this is called
depreciation there are two forms of
depreciation straight line and
accelerated
same amount of depreciation is taken
every year for instance a car with a
price tag of ten thousand dollars and
useful life of ten years is depreciated
one thousand dollars per year at the end
of the tenth year the value of the car
is considered zero for all accounting
purposes accelerated depreciation
depreciates faster than the
straight-line depreciation for instance
a car with a price tag of ten thousand
dollars depreciates three thousand
dollars the first year one thousand five
hundred the next year one thousand the
third year and so on
critical path is defined as the longest
duration path through a network diagram
which determines the shortest time to
complete the project
float can be considered as a buffer time
available to complete an activity
float is calculated once the network
diagram is ready
it is also called as slack there are
three kinds of float the first being the
total float which is the amount of time
an activity can be delayed without
delaying the project end date or an
intermediary milestone
the second type of float is free float
which is the amount of time an activity
can be delayed without delaying the
early start date of its successor or
successor's activities
the last type is independent flow which
is the amount of time an activity can be
delayed if all the predecessors finish
at their latest finish dates and you
want to start all the immediate
successors at their earliest start dates
the slack of the activities on the
critical path is zero because there is
no scope to delay activities on the
critical path
critical path actually represents the
project duration
delaying activities on the critical path
is as good as delaying the project
duration
concept-based questions on critical path
can be expected in the exam so it is
essential to have a clear understanding
of the concept
in the next screen let us learn how to
calculate float
let us look at an example for critical
path
there are five activities in this
project and two paths in the network
diagram start 1 2 4 5 and is One path
and start one three five and is the
second path
since the duration of the path start one
two four five and is 18 days which is
more than the duration of the path start
one three five and the critical path of
the project is start one two four five
end
let us take Activity three as an example
first calculate the early start and
early finish dates
Activity 3 can start only after Activity
one since the early finish of Activity 1
is 3 it becomes the early start of
Activity three
Activity 3 cannot start earlier than
three because Activity 1 can be
completed only by then
therefore early start of Activity three
is three since the duration of the
activity is four days
the early finish of Activity 3 is 3 plus
4 equals seven days
now let us calculate the late start and
late finish of activity 3.
late start of Activity 5 is 14 days the
Activity 3 happens just before activity
five so the late finish of Activity 3 is
14 days to calculate the late start you
can subtract the duration from late
finish therefore the late start of
Activity 3 is 14 minus four equals ten
in the next screen let us focus on
schedule compression
hi welcome to project management tools
tutorial from Simply learn I am CMR
Chandra Mr a certified project
management professional as part of this
tutorial we are going to look at about
project management tools essential
features of project management tools top
10 project management tools currently
used in the industry so what is project
management tools why should we use
project management tools while doing
project management so project management
tools help to keep a streamlining flow
in project management processes the
tools help the team or an individual to
carry out the steps of project
management in an effective and efficient
manner so project management tools
features and functionalities so
basically a project management tool
should have minimum fulfilling these
features and functionality they should
be simple to use customizable they
should have API for integration it
should help in collaboration it should
help in Risk analysis and real-time
reporting when we say simple use the
project management tools need to be
suitable for every project we do one
needs to find a tool that will have a
pleasant interface and increase work
productivity the project management tool
must be easy to configure according to
the organization needs every project
management approach every project
management templates every artifacts
needs tailoring and adaption before
adopting as part of the practice there
are business patterns that change every
day so having customizable tool is an
added Advantage API or application
programming interface enables the
sharing of data and application between
devices the tools with API integration
allow seamless connectivity amongst the
team the project management tools must
allow for collaboration so that whole
team can work together collaboration not
only makes the task easier but also
increases the productivity of the
project risk analysis helps to identify
analyze and respond to the risk quickly
and efficiently it needs to capture all
the details of the risks their impacts
the probability of occurrence of the
risk and risk responses and tracking
them throughout the Project Life Cycle
the real-time reporting enables the
access of data at different locations of
the project management one can assess or
Access Data at any time about the
Project's current status this will help
in having a real-time update about the
project status to the stakeholders of
the project the top 10 project
management tools what we have today in
the market are monday.com Rick jira
software Trello Asana teamwork Meister
task base camp oracles Primavera and
Microsoft project management tool so let
us look at these one by one so
monday.com was released during the year
2012 and it is known for providing
features to enable flexible planning and
monitoring capabilities the website
where you can find monday.com access the
tool is
www.myday.com so this tool is used by
more than 90 000 team across the globe
monday.com features and functionality
includes it is easy for collaboration

Xerox Etc hey guys
so without further Ado let's get started
with what exactly is Trello
so Trello is a simple and easy to use
collaboration tool that can enable you
to organize projects and everything
related to it into boards with Trello
you can find all kinds of information
like what's being worked on who's
working on what and what progress the
project is making now we'll learn about
that in a little bit while we're talking
about the Trello demo
now let's talk about the advantages of
Trello
now first off cholo can be used
immediately after signing up so Trello
offers you a free sign up after which
you get access to almost all of trello's
features now it does have a premium
service but most of Travelers important
features are available in the free
account
secondly it follows the kanban system so
the kanban system is a popular
methodology that can be used to achieve
lean so with Trello you can also achieve
lean
now Trello also has a very popular
mobile application which also has the
same features as the interface that you
see on the desktop that is very user
friendly
now the fourth Advantage is that all
project related items can be seen on one
page which means everything you need
about the project is available in one
place
next adding new members creating issues
and assigning them are very easy with
the help of Trello
now that we had a look at all the
advantages that are provided by Trello
let's have a look at a live demo
so first off let's go to trello.com
so here you can see two options to login
or sign up so first of all if you've
never used the website before go to sign
up
so here you can enter your email or you
can go through Google or Hotmail or
Outlook so it's very simple I already
have an account so I'll just log in
all right so I'm just going to log in
so if you're using shallow for the first
time this is what it would look like
so here you have personal boards
templates home and so on so let's go one
by one
firstly the most important thing that
you need to know about is boards which
is right here
so let's assume you're using this for a
team which means that you need people to
share the board along with
so first of all let's create a team
so here I'm just going to name a company
called company code
say we do engineering on t
this Write a brief team description and
continue so here say I have four members
so I have Bob
I'm adding them here so depending on
what your team is like you can add those
team members so this is important so
that you can connect with them while
you're on the board so this is
company.com so we'll just add them
so the team members that you're going to
invite will get an invite email very
soon as soon as you're done by clicking
the invite to team button
also add Bill who also works at my
company
this technique mission one
and this technician one who works at
company.com
we'll add anybody who's required later
so invite your team
and there you go there's some details
here about the team and all that let's
go back to home
and now let's create a new board under
Company Co so the difference here is
that for personal boards is that like
the name says it's personal you can also
add the team if you want later on but
here you have the option for creating a
team Port so I'll show you how you can
create a team board from personal board
so you got create board
here you can show as this is by default
selected is no team because it's under
personal change it to company
and you can write
what is this anything else like that
and then you create a board
and there you go the board has been set
up
so now
first things first it's that you can
make this team visible which is
either only board members can see it or
since it's a small team the entire team
can see it so it's up to you how you
want it there's the public option which
everyone can see which I don't think is
necessary but if you feel like it you
can do that too
first of all you can even write a
description of the board which is what
you want to achieve with this board for
example this is business or sales or
something like that you can change the
background into something more colorful
or less colorful like this
and then
there's search cards which we haven't
added anything so far so there's nothing
to search there's stickers
which again is I feel unnecessary at the
moment you can also see something called
Butler So based on your usage or how
you're using Trello Butler can provide
you suggestions like what you can add
here like you can see here
the tips haven't been added so far
because we haven't used cello so far
So based on your usage it will give you
suggestions
now let's go back
so here you see power ups so power-ups
are basically additional features that
you can add to your board
so there are features that are connected
to a number of different fields there's
analytics automation utilities tools and
so on
so as a free user you get access to one
power up but still we don't have to use
it so far because
we don't have anything on our board but
based on your requirement you can go
through these power ups and decide on
one of them
so now let's get back to business or
about so first you can see add a list so
this basically refers to the different
processes that you want to follow in
this board
so first of all we'll add a list title
I'm going to add 2 2
that's the first list
then that's in progress
on hold
and completed
so here we have four lists which
represent the processes in this business
so if you want you can even add another
list depending on your requirement so in
these lists there are things called
cards so which are like subtopics so
first of all let's add
a very simple
title for example
deliver product
company
a second very simple deliver product
to company
p
like this so on and so forth if you want
it
so here this is a card so this card can
be moved from each stage to another as
it progresses
so this is in the to-do stage since we
have not started with anything
so once you click on a card so this
pop-up shows up so here you can add a
description like conversed with company
a
ready to go
just some details that you want to add
you save
now one thing you can see add to cart so
there are a number of different things
you can add to this card
so members
now I have four team members I can add
Bob
here I want Bob in on this I want Bob to
see the activities as it happens I want
Bill to also see as things proceed
right so the Bob and Bill are in on this
right now
next you have labels so depending on
what you want to use this for for
example I want to use this to represent
that it's important or immediate
put it as red
so I can select this label to indicate
that this is now very important so
depending on your company's you know
style or depending on your requirements
you can add the labels then you have a
checklist so different steps can be
focused on with this checklist for
example I'm just going to write steps
so we're delivering a product for
example so let's just
use steps government Gathering I'm just
going to write the
software life cycle steps analysis
design
implementation
testing
employment
and maintenance
so yeah we have all the steps so one
thing is that once each of these steps
are done
you ticket
so a percentage increases so until
you're done with hundred percent you can
just keep taking finally it will show
100 and you're done
so another thing is a due date so this
is basically by when you want it
completed
so this is basically a reminder that we
need to complete it or for a particular
date is done so I'm not adding it to
your data as of now but that's up to you
next you have something called
attachment so say for example all your
requirements have been gathered into one
PDF so where all the requirements that
are required by the company are shown in
that PDF you can attach it here so that
everyone has access to it
then a coward can also be added to your
card which is just basically beautifying
it so we can find one
example this
and there you go there's a pretty good
looking cow here
now we have all the information so let's
get started
so to officially Mark the beginning of
the project we'll just go and put this
to in progress so at the same time you
can do the same thing with this card as
well about Company B so let's just focus
on company a now
so say the steps have already started
requirement Gathering is done designing
is done implementation is also done so
depending on the person you know the
technician so the technician could
respond that you know we already started
so before that we need to add the
technician he's already on this but if
you had to add him you search for main
bus
and you have board members who's already
in the board you can add the technician
now you can also you know add activity
details like technician one
how's it going how's the process going
now he could respond here with its
fine
so each time one of us you know adds the
other or says something to the other
they get notifications so that you know
they get to respond as well they get to
know what's happening
now
say for example the technician is not
able to complete the project or complete
his work so it's put on hold so here I
could say
so testing isn't done so we can say
by the delay or what's going on
and he would give an appropriate
response and once he's ready he can
finish the testing
and put it back to in progress then
eventually all of it is done deployment
and maintenance
so you here you have an option to hide
complete items that's up to you you can
also delete them if you feel like it you
can close this and then after everything
is done and you feel that everything of
the process is done you can put it on
completed so if this is a recurring
process you can you know make a copy of
this which you can find by doing this
copy or you could just put this on
archive
indicating that it's done you can even
get it back by just going
more
archived items and then there you have
it you can send it back to board that's
up to you
and there you go that's most of
everything you need to know about Trello
one another thing is that right now you
can only add 10 boards on this feed as
of now because you're using a free
membership also depending on the
intensity or the difficulty of the board
you can also have different
boards for different projects I've just
used one for multiple projects but it's
entirely possible for you to have one
board per project you can also you know
favorite this indicating that this is a
very important one that you need to
focus on every day so this is where you
get all the notifications that access
change there you go all kinds of
responses everything that you need is
available on this home screen which is
basically like a home feed you can also
find templates depending on your
requirement
so you can choose a template from a wide
variety of options so I'm just going to
show you the camera template
so here you have details about the
template you have an example of what the
template looks like and so on
and there you go that's everything you
need to know about Trello in this
session we will be talking about agile
project management and several other
things related to it before we begin
let's have a look at all the topics we
will be covering today first we will see
the basics of agile project management
then we will check the relevance and
principles of agile project management
we will then see necessary steps to
implement agile methodology along with
that we shall also see different
Frameworks involved in the process and
finally we shall see some companies that
use agile project management so without
any further Ado let's get started with
what is agile project management agile
project management as the name suggests
is a flexible approach to building a
project in agile project management the
project is broken down into several
stages or Sprints agile does not work on
the principle of delivering the final
product at the end of the project it
works on delivering sections of a
project or mini projects the process of
project management in the case of agile
is agile based so there won't be any
Center control of project manager as it
was there in the traditional way of
working before we move forward let's
have a look at the Agile development
cycle agile methodologies consist of
several small Cycles or Sprints at the
end of each stage we get a mini project
there's a product backlog that explains
new features changes in the existing
features and several other improvements
in the project then we have a Sprint
backlog which has a list of tasks that
are to be completed during each spread
the Sprint consists of planning
designing execution testing and
deployment stages and at the end of each
Sprint a mini project is delivered with
every Sprint new features are added to
the product which plays a significant
role in the overall project growth after
all the Sprints and early validation in
the development the final deliverable
has a fewer chances of failure let's now
have a look at some reasons why
Industries have started moving towards
agile project management the first
reason is high product quality when we
talk about high product quality we refer
to the build of the product as per
stakeholders demands testing is
performed at Short intervals of time
wherever needed to ensure high quality
of the product then another reason is
customer satisfaction whatever is done
in the project is known by the customer
the deliveries don't take longer
durations as they used to take in the
case of traditional ways the changes may
be provided by the customer in the
execution phase of the project third
reason is reduced risk since the project
is divided into Sprints suit the risk
affects one Sprint it doesn't mean whole
of the project will be at risk the
process of risk analysis continues to
take place with all the other processes
another significant reason for agile
project management is better and faster
return on investment the project is now
developed in several Sprints and each
Sprint has its own version therefore the
project becomes Market ready after a few
Sprints only since the projects can now
be released with ease and in shorter
duration this helps the organization to
stay ahead in competition with respect
to other organizations which are still
not moved to Agile methodology now we
shall check the principles of agile
project management there are 10
principles for successful agile project
management the first principle is the
satisfaction of the customer by
delivering the project fast and with
least number of Errors the next
principle refers to decreasing the
amount of time between the phase of
planning and delivery the third
principle states that the team of
managers and developers work together
and increase the productivity of their
work the next principle states that the
changes requested by the stakeholders
can be taken into consideration and
worked upon during the development phase
as well the fifth principle pays
attention to the factor of coordination
among the team members then the sixth
principle refers to the process of
monitoring and tracking the progress of
the project at the end of each Sprint
and making amendments wherever needed
moving on the next principle states that
there must be a feeling of trust and
support towards the team to complete the
Project's objectives the next principle
emphasizes are on face-to-face
conversations with the development team
the face-to-face conversation helps in
both solving problems and easy knowledge
sharing then the nine principle
emphasizes on finding Solutions and
maximizing the amount of work done with
Simplicity this ensures timely
completion of tasks by all the team
members the last principle states that
scrum tools like monday.com or Zoho
Sprints must be used to simplify the
complicated codes which further helps in
Saving Time We Shall now see the steps
in agile project management the goal of
agile methodology is to produce shorter
development life cycles and more
frequent product releases than
traditional waterfall project management
so we will now check six steps in agile
project methodology the first step in
the process is Project planning project
planning includes feasibility study
development of scope breaking the
project into executable tasks or Sprints
and then estimating the amount of time
needed to complete those Sprints the
second step is the step of roadmap
creation a road map is a plan of action
that shows how a project shall evolve
over time a list of all the features
that the final product should have is
created and the steps to achieve those
features are taken the next important
step is release planning since we are
doing the project keeping in mind the
agile project methodology the project
will complete in Sprints that means
there will be the release of features at
the end of each cycle and unlikely
traditional waterfall model the
development Cycles will be smaller the
fourth step in agile project management
is Sprint planning the Sprints are made
keeping in mind what all is to be
accomplished in that particular Step At
the beginning of each Sprint the goal of
that Sprint is decided and steps to
achieve that goal are taken the next
step in the process emphasizes on daily
meetings there are short meetings every
day to discuss if the team was able to
finish the task for each Sprint and
check if there are any amendments that
are required each team member talks
about what they achieved in the last
print and what are they going to work on
in the next print the last step is the
step of Sprint review in retrospective
there are two meetings after each Sprint
first meeting is for the Sprint review
this meeting is with the stakeholders to
show them the finished product this
helps both sides to build a relationship
and discuss if there are any issues in
the end product the second meeting is
for having a Sprint retrospective this
meeting involves the stakeholders to
discuss what went well and what went
wrong during the Sprint Sprint rate
perspective takes place after the Sprint
review and before the next print
planning now when we know the steps
needed for agile project methodology we
must understand some agile project
management Frameworks there are several
Frameworks available today here we will
be discussing some of the most popular
Frameworks the first framework we will
discuss is the kanban framework kanban
framework is a well-known framework for
implementing agile software development
in the case of kanban framework work
items are represented on the kanman
board which help helps all the team
members to see the state of every piece
of work at any time kanman board not
only helps in visualizing the work but
also optimizing the workflow among the
team the next framework we will discuss
today is the scrum framework scrum
framework is a popular framework for
managing complex knowledge work like in
the field of research and Advanced
Technologies scrum is a simple framework
that helps team work together and learn
through their experiences gained while
working on a problem the third framework
we will see today is the hybrid
framework the hybrid framework is a
combination of agile methodology and
non-agile methodology in the case of a
hybrid framework planning is done using
the traditional way of project
management while the execution and
delivery is done using the agile
methodology since the hybrid is a
combination of the two it handles the
requirement changes and delivers the
product in different stages the fourth
and the last framework we will see is
the lean framework the lean framework
works on the principle of providing
maximum customer value and creating zero
waste it focuses on optimizing the flow
of products all through the value stream
this helps in eliminating waste all
through the process and create processes
that requires less human efforts this
also simplifies the process of
information management and makes it more
accurate finally let's have a look at
some companies that have opted for agile
project management today around 22
percent of the organizations worldwide
have all their teams working on the
principle of agile project methodology
let's have a look at some of the most
prominent companies in the world that
use agile project management in the list
we have IBM Cisco atnt Microsoft
Phillips and Samsung welcome to simple

groups knowledge areas and processes so
now Imagining the world where you have a
project being done so and you are the
project manager and how best a project
can be conducted so to make a project
successful it is required to follow a
best practice
so if you have a certification just
imagine having a certification that lets
the world know that you know what you
are doing in project management so PMP
certification gives you all so what is
PMP certification
so the PMP the project management
professional certification is a
certification of PMI the project
management Institute which is at USA so
is an internationally recognized
credential for project managers see the
certification indicates that the
certified professional has a sufficient
experience education skills and
competency reason being before going for
PMP certification it asks for specific
prerequisites which involves experience
in project management as well as formal
education of project management and
demonstrated skills so that being a
prerequisite for project management
professional certifications it is very
essential that one need to understand
what it takes to become eligible for PMP
examination so that we will go through
in the subsequent slides so the moment
one has the PMP certification that
itself indicates the prerequises to take
a PMP certification is accomplished
already before going for certification
and then the individual will go for a
certification and become certified
professional so that way it concludes it
also in the indicates that person who
holds the PMP certification has
sufficient experience education skills
and competency moreover there are more
than 10 hundred thousand PMP
certification holders across the globe
so PMP certified individuals earn 25
percent more than non-certified
individuals so now PMP certification
also has the advantages which are given
here like helps the project manager to
practice the project management better
create the results better demonstrate
the project management capability better
so this also helps project manager to
show the commitment towards the project
management profession and having PMP
certification provides the recognition
across the globe which helps in getting
better salary compared with people the
professionals who are not certified and
also helps in increasing the network
project management Network who actually
practices project management the fellow
practice project managers who are
practicing the project management so
there are certain vocabularies jargons
which are used specifically while doing
the project management PMP helps to
understand those so now let us look at
what does the official guide which is
used
in PMP that can help to become a project
management professionals
so that is PMB okay which is referred as
project management body of knowledge or
PMB okay
which is the collection of processes
best practices terminologies and
guidelines accepted as standards within
the industry
so the latest edition of this is sixth
edition which was released in 2017. the
first edition of pmbuke guide was
published in 1996 and the sixth edition
as I mentioned was released in 2017 and
exam format was revised from 26th March
2018. so pmbok guide will become the
basic reference to appear in the PMP
examination so one needs to go through
the training based on pmbuk guidelines
so that will help them to pass the
examination easily so eligibility
criteria for appearing for PMP
certification examinations so you can
have two types of eligibilities which
PMI defines so option one includes
someone who has secondary degree should
have 7 500 hours of leading and
directing project that is an experience
what it is asking as a prerequisite
before the professional go for
examination plus touch 35 hours of
project management education formally
from a registered education provider
like simply learn option 2 someone who
has four year degree project management
experience leading and directing project
this experience will be 4500 hours
whereas as we saw in option one in
option 2 35 hours of project management
education is required and that is from
registered education provider like
simply learn as I mentioned earlier so
this training which is conducted by
registered education provider will have
their trainings aligned with PMB OK the
latest edition so simply learn enables
people to learn what are the topics in
PMP framework plus make the
professionals ready to appear the
examination and become successful
the project management framework which
is defined in PMB OK includes five
process groups 10 knowledge areas and 49
processes so when we say five process
groups this indicates the way the
project flows how each of these process
groups are connected while project
happens in the Project Life Cycle
whereas 10 knowledge areas are the one
which needs to be looked up to
demonstrated up to considered while
doing the project management and the 49
processes distributed across five
process groups and 10 knowledge areas
has the activities the objectives the
inputs outputs tools and techniques
clearly defined so that those can be
applied while doing the project
management so those are aligned the way
it is shown in the table so five process
group that is initiating planning
executing monitoring and control and
closing these are the process groups
whereas 10 knowledge areas includes
project integration management project
scope management project schedule
management project cost management
project quality management project
Resource Management project
communication management project risk
management project procurement
management and project stakeholder
management so each of these knowledge
areas and process groups are aligned in
such a way where the processes align
with a specific process group and
knowledge area can be demonstrated
accordingly if you look at a process
with which goes from initiating to
planning planning to executing and then
monitoring and control while you do
monitoring and control if there is
anything found as a deviation it may
come back to planning or executing for
necessary Corrections once the necessary
Corrections happens again it moves to
monitoring and control to check whether
it is completely done as expected or not
if it is confirmed everything is done as
per the requirements defined then it
moves to closing this is how the project
Flows In The Project Life Cycle whereas
all the 10 knowledge areas happens in
parallel so now if you look at
initiating process group you can see two
processes that is develop project
Charter and identify stakeholders so
develop project Charter and identifies
stakeholders basically defines project
Charter required for the project as well
as initial identified stakeholders who
are required to move forward in the
project similarly if you look at
planning process group you have 24
processes which are distributed across
all the 10 knowledge areas so these
processes creates a plan for the project
which involves scope Baseline schedule
Baseline cost Baseline quality
management approach then Resource
Management approach means the plan I'm
into 7s approach I'm speaking about the
plan similarly communication management
plan risk management plan procurement
management plan stakeholder management
plan and all of these will get
Consolidated into project management
plan in the integration management
knowledge area once this plan is done
and approved then it moves for execution
all that project manager do during
execution is detecting and managing
Project work and managing the project
knowledge at the same time project
manager would take responsibility of
managing quality acquiring resources
developing team managing team then
Communications which are planned as per
the communication management plan
communication should happen during
execution so similarly implementation of
risk responses defined while doing the
planning and conducting the procurements
as planned and then managing stakeholder
engagement so actual execution of those
work packages execution of those
deliverables happens from the team now
as those deliverables happens the
delivered products are checked monitored
and controlled you can see validate
scope control scope likewise for each
knowledge areas there is a Control
process which checks is that happened in
execution as it was planned in plan
planning process group so then that is
Consolidated here for monitoring and
controlling the project work in entirety
integrated similarly performing
integrated Change Control any deviations
found in any of these checks which is
being done in the control
now that deviations needs to be
corrected so change will be reached so
request for change will be raised and
that will be approved and controlled and
necessary directions are given approvals
are given and that moves towards
execution for implementation once it is
implemented again validation happens
once control checks if everything is
okay then it moves to the closure now
activities in closure a project or a
face involves just an activities of
closure the products or services or
results which are created from the
project does not go to closure until
those are validated checked confirmed
and signed off only then it goes to
closing project or phase and necessary
formalities which are required to be
completed before conclusion will happen
in closing project office this is how
the project flows second point which you
keep in mind is a project manager is
also called as an integrator so main
focus the umbrella view the bird's eye
view project manager should have from
Project integration management
so this layer project integration
management where project manager should
have an umbrella view total view about
entire project what is happening so
bigger picture only when project manager
has a bigger picture project manager can
come to the lower levels and see is are
they progressing the way it is supposed
to so then go back look at the words I
view again and see is it going in the
right direction which is very essential
so further I guess we will look at each
of these process groups and what happens
in each of the process groups similarly
knowledge areas so let us move forward
now project management process groups so
these process groups details the
necessary requirement that need to be
satisfied to ensure that project
resources are used efficiently and these
represents the chronological phases that
all projects go through during the
Project Life Cycle so starting from
initiating stage it moves to planning
once the plan is ready then it moves to
execution as the execution happens
validation checks happens in monitoring
and control and as you find some
deviation in monitoring and control for
correction of the deviation it comes
back to execution or if any necessary
changes needs to be done in planning
also while doing these Corrections then
it may move to plan then execution and
then monitoring and control so this Loop
continues until the confirmation yes it
is delivered as per the plan and then it
moves to close Usher so that's how the
project flows under Project Life Cycle
would be like that so initiating process
group so initiating process group
involves the processes activities and
skills needed to define the beginning of
the project as I mentioned earlier in
initiating process group the creation of
project Charter happens and
identification of the basic stakeholders
main stakeholders who are required to
understand the further requirements in
detail who needs to be engaged so those
are identified so setting up permits
authorization and initial work orders
which should be in place and are
important for Effective and logical
progress of the project and success
across all project faces so this clearly
sets up the phases for the work to be
completed initializing teams and having
a well thought out budget which is very
important so this gives that view in
totality but it may not give you the
full granular details but it sets the
directions provides that insight and
also one important thing we should keep
in mind is in initiation stage
appointment of project manager happens
the formal Declaration of appointment of
project manager happens and project
Charter will be formally handed over to
project manager and that formal
Declaration of assignment of project
manager happens from then project
manager takes over and first activity
project manager does is identification
of stakeholders so next process group is
planning process group where we have
around 24 processes to define the
project scope cost schedule quality
resource risk then procurement
stakeholder engagement so comprehensive
plan if it is waterfall approach or
basic skeleton plan which is required if
it is agile approach so it also
clarifies the goals and expectations
while putting in place infrastructures
to achieve the gold scheme
budgetary constraints the end-to-end
view of the project is provided in
planning so this acts as a basic
reference while the execution and
monitoring and control happens So based
on the planning the way it is done
execution will happen now next process
group is executing process group where
the role of project manager is to direct
and manage Project work and manage the
project knowledge main activities being
an integrator of a project secondly
acquiring resources it may be human
resource or technology resource or any
other resource required for the project
then if it is human resource there needs
to be necessary training development of
the team and then managing them so lot
of Team Dynamics are involved that needs
to be handled so this involves managing
teams while handling time expectations
and achieving Benchmark goals team
members delivers those results team
members does all the activities and then
creates that results so team concerns
needs to be addressed because as you see
the people together the team members
together it is quite obvious conflict
maker so conflict resolution should
happen the engagement with the team
member should happen so demonstration of
work which is done by the project team
that needs to be monitored and
controlled parallely which happens
during the execution monitoring and
control is also happening so project
manager should look at both so consensus
needs to be addressed execution is that
happening as per the plan has to be
checked as part of monitoring and
control while execution is happening so
birds are view an entirety which says
how the execution should happen that
needs to be directed and monitored
whereas coming on ground seeing is that
happening the way it is required that is
also very essential so next is
monitoring and Control process group now
as part of these process group as I
mentioned while execution happens it is
very essential to check validate it and
control so this process group involves
processing change orders any deviations
being found change requests are raised
and if that change request needs some
modification or changes in planning then
it goes to planning if no such planning
requirements simple change that straight
go to execution change get executed and
then again validation happens so
integrated change management which is
there in this particular process group
so this also focuses on addressing
ongoing budget considerations handling
unexpected circumstances that could
hamper the team's ability to meet the
initial project expectations so it goes
on throughout the Project Life Cycle so
two process groups if you closely
observe planning process groups and
monitoring and Control process groups
are the process groups where you see
processes in all the knowledge areas
otherwise if you see an initiating
process group it is only two process one
is an integration management other one
is stakeholder management if you look at
execution you don't see in scope time
cost and risk management similarly if
you see closing process group only one
process which is in initiating process
group so these are the only two process
groups planning process groups and
monitoring and Control process group
where you see the most of the processes
so next process group is closing process
group so closing process group closing
project or phase is a process what we
have in this process Group which
basically focuses on addressing the
culmination of project management skills
shown throughout the other
interconnected processes that guided the
projects so all the aspects of process
are closed and all the necessary
paperwork is submitted so it can lead to
great reviews and Word of Mouth
referrals in the future so all the
activities which is to be done for
formal closure and conclusion which is
done in the closing process group so
this is about all all the five process
group defined in the PMP framework so
now let us move towards understanding
each of the knowledge areas and the
different processes within it so how
many processes in each of the knowledge
areas aligning it with the process group
we just saw in the table but when we
look at it understand what are those
exactly so now knowledge areas are
necessary for Effective project
management which can take place during
any of the explained process groups so
they are 10 so those are project
integration management project scope
management project schedule management
project cost management project quality
management project Resource Management
project communication management then
project risk management project
procurement management project
stakeholder management so many people
ask me when I train the people they ask
me how do we remember all of this so
remembering process group will be easy
because it's the flow which if you can
remember then remembering the process
group will be easier but to remember the
knowledge areas
so one thing you should keep in mind is
initially when PMB okay were defined
mostly in until Third Edition or fourth
edition we used to focus on Triple
constraints so when we say triple
constraints we used to tell scope cost
and time now later when as the best
practices evolved as the pmbok walled so
it did not limit on Triple constraints
it actually said six constraints what
are the six constraints scope cost time
quality resources and risk so if you can
able to remember these six constraints
so each of associated with each of these
constraints there is a knowledge area
like you have project scope management
which is one of the area of constraints
similarly schedule management link to
time cost management quality management
resource management and risk management
so out of 10 easily you can able to
remember six further there are four now
integration management by the default
integrates all the nine knowledge areas
so remembering that may not be difficult
so to consolidate this to conduct the
project properly you need stakeholders
you need to procute something and you
need to communicate so other three
knowledge areas remembrance should
happen by linking to this so firstly
remember six constraints that is scope
time cost quality resource and risk then
you have communication which needs to
happen to communicate there should be
stakeholder and also there should be
Supply which needs to happen to the
project so if you can link like this
nine knowledge areas you can remember so
in all these nine knowledge areas you
will integrate and manage in integration
management so in fact all the plans
which are defined in rest of the nine
knowledge areas except integration
management so all those plans are called
as subsidiary plans so all these nine
subsidiary plans that is scope
management plan schedule management Plan
cost management plan quality management
plan Resource Management plan
communication management plan risk
management plan procurement management
plan and stakeholder management plan so
all these nine subsidiary plans are
integrated together and Consolidated in
project management plan so that happens
in Project integration management so
this we should keep in mind so project
integration management what does it do
so project integration management
basically includes plans to develop
project Charter a document that sets up
the project and assigns the project
manager created during the initiation
phase so a project management plan is
also created which is a roadmap for the
entire project to become a success so
the project plan once approved by
stakeholders and sponsor is monitored
and tracked through the change log it
also directs and manages the project
work this process is monitored analyzed
and reported to identify and control any
changes or problems that could be
encountered so one thing we should keep
in mind when we say project integration
management this is the only knowledge
area where we see processes in all the
process group so we have process in
initiating process group we have
processes in planning we have process in
execution process group we have
processes in monitoring and Control
process group and also in closing
process group so project integration
management is only knowledge area where
it has a processes in all the process
groups which we don't see in either
knowledge area now next we'll look at
the list of processes like develop
project Charter is in a initiation
process group develop project management
plan which consolidates all the nine
knowledge areas is in planning process
group direct and manage Project work
manage project knowledge these two
processes are in executing process group
Monitor and control project work perform
integrated Change Control these two
processes are in monitoring and Control
process group so close close project or
face is in the closing process group so
now we will move to project scope
management so when we use the term scope
the term scope refers to the boundary
within which we need to do something so
first thing we should keep in mind when
we say project scope two things one is
the scope of that product service or
results which we are creating which
comes out as a product or a service a
result out of a project which comes out
what is getting created so scoping that
part of it so other scope part of it the
processes the tools the resources what
is being used during the project so that
deliverables happen so two part of the
scope we should look at so project scope
management involves those areas deals
with the work of the project and
involves plan scope management an
important part of project management
plan the collection of requirements of
the product or service also takes place
in this process group and also project
scope management knowledge area deals
with work of the project which involves
plan scope management an important part
of the project management plan so the
collection of requirements of the
product or service also takes place in
this stage the scope of project is also
defined in the scope statement this is
expected to undergo change over the
course of project the scope is validated
during the project ensuring that the
deliverables are approved by sponsors or
stakeholders so as I mentioned earlier
it involves the scope of the results
what is being created and all the scope
of those processes resources tools which
are used during the project so processes
in Project scope management knowledge
area so plan scope management which is
in planning process group collect
requirements Define scope create W base
even these three processes are in
planning process group in total four
processes in planning process group
whereas validate scope and control scope
these two processes are in monitoring
and controlled process group So when you
say plan scope management it's about
defining how to collect the requirements
how to manage those entire scope
management planning and requirements
management plan also has to be defined
then requirements are collected from the
stakeholders who have been identified
and then scope will be defined now very
important thing here is about work
breakdown structure so we have a product
or a service or a result which we are
working on to create as a result of the
project so how will you understand all
the parts of it that needs breaking down
that particular product or services or
results which we are going to create
into multiple pieces in a structure
which would look like a tree so that you
will get it necessary Insight towards
what is being delivered
so firstly product breakdown structure
is made and for each of the layers of
this product breakdown structure you
will be assigning an activities
assigning resources effort estimation
cost estimation sequencing those all
this will will be done later basic thing
needed is work breakdown structure for
that so to create WBS the technique
called decomposition is used and this
approach is top down approach next
validate scope and control scope as WBS
provides that structure of various
things which needs to be delivered
referring to that as the execution
happens validation should happen whether
it is delivered accordingly or not and
is that scope management is being done
according to the plan control scope will
be checking that so next is the project
schedule management when we say schedule
it's quite obvious for us to understand
when what needs to be done
so what needs to be done is already told
in scope and when are we going to do
that for that you need to have a
specific schedule the timeline so the
project will have various different
activities tasks which is assigned to
the particular WBS element so these
activities will have a specific start
date end date and this will have a
specific output which is coming out as
part of those actions which happens so
the project is divided into tasks each
with their own start dates and deadlines
and budgets so these are revised as the
project moves forward depending on how
the project is progressing a schedule
for the project and determining who is
responsible for that so helps us to
understand which resource is required at
what point in time similarly the cash
flow requirement can also be understood
by having a defined schedule so the
tasks are placed in a sensible order and
the dependencies between each of them
are noted once sequence against the
resources required for the tasks are
estimated and assigned the time required
for each of these tasks are also
determined now when we say this we
require to understand and visualize
while doing a project the WBS structure
is defined and in what sequence each of
these elements are delivered and what
timeline start time end time and how
each of these are connected to other WBS
element in what sequence what activity
is required what resource required what
effort required what competency skill
required so all these are put in so
since we schedule and sequence it we
know when is that required so this
requires working with other knowledge
area very closely when I say w base
element it's quite obvious it comes from
scope management when I say allocation
of resources obviously it has to work
with Resource Management to create a
resource calendars if it's a cost
management to understand the flow money
flow cash flow so budget should be there
for the project so cash flow when what
amount is required to understand that it
cost is linked to schedule so all these
knowledge areas should work very closely
with coordinating with each other
interfacing with each other so project
schedule management also uses a very
important technique called network
analysis technique where we speak about
critical path then forward pass backward
pass then identification of floats so
when is a critical path critical path
refers to the longest path in the
established Network diagram of a project
and that will be the minimum time
required for project to complete so this
critical needs to be closely monitored
as the execution of the project happens
because any delay in this critical path
will delay the project itself so that's
about some summary about schedule
management now let us look at the
processes which are involved in schedule
management so plan schedule management
define activities sequence activities
estimate activity durations develop
schedule so all these five processes are
in planning process group so schedule
management how it has to be done needs
to be clearly planned as part of plan
schedule management then when to define
activities it is quite obvious we need
to know what needs to be delivered so
WBS element helps us when the scope
Baseline is provided as an input here so
taking that activities are defined then
the sequencing happens then when we say
estimate activity durations so we speak
about two terms like effort and duration
if I want to deliver something let me
assume to deliver X for a person it
requires one day or for a person it
requires 10 days if we say so to to
create that working piece of your
product it takes 10 man days we will say
that is an effort now if I have 100
pieces of such news to be created how
many mandies I need so 10 into 100 piece
10 days into 100 peso 1000 mandies now
how many resources I have I may have
around 25 resources now 1000 divided by
25 it will be around I guess 400 400
mind is no I think to a thousand divided
by it's about 4
40. so 40 Man days of effort means that
is duration whereas effort is one
thousand minus 40 days will become
duration
so likewise looking at how many
resources we have how many uh what is
that effort is actually required is
involved and then what is the duration
within which we need to complete it
either you look at how many resources I
have based on that I look at the
duration or I will look at the Target
date mainly Target date is given by
customers as you discuss when the
project needs to be completed
accordingly you are required to acquire
the resources so this itself is showing
us these knowledge areas now work very
closely now so without scope you cannot
define activities now without
understanding the activities you don't
know what is the effort so now once you
understood the effort you know what
resource what competency when so you
have to work with Resource Management so
to have those resources
onboarded or acquired you need to have
money cost so what cost it takes so
likewise it goes one by one elaborating
that's why you see 24 processes in the
planning process group distributed
across all that in knowledge areas so
this is about schedule management now I
look at
the cost management project cost
management so when we say cost it is
quite obvious it's all about money what
money the expenditure the outgoing money
so project incurs cost if any
individuals I keep getting these
questions in lot of trainings so is
checking the revenues the invoice
raising and collection of payment is
that a job of a project manager now when
we say the project management and look
at it as a project management activities
now it's all about delivering the
results of the project so when we say I
need to collect invoices and I submit
invoices collect payments when you say
that so that doesn't mean it is part of
a project management role no now if in
your organization if you have a
designation of project manager or sub
manager or something and invoice
submission and collection of payment is
also part of your job description you
have to do you don't have any choice so
designation is totally different when
compared with but the meaning of the
Roll Call project manager so any other
things which are associated with your
designation in the organization it may
be project manager also designation
possible depending on what job
description what job activities are
associated with it accordingly and to do
but when you do a project management
activity in specific when you involve in
the project so all these aspects what we
are defining that needs to be taken care
hundred percent along with it raising an
invoice collection of payment or
coordinating with some other department
to find out new opportunities in the
existing customer those are all
additional things which are given to you
as an individual with that designation
to justify many things so as a
professionals I have a position in
organization with some designations and
there is a CTC salary which is given and
that needs to be justified to justify
that various different roles are
attached to you for your designation so
that you need to look up to accordingly
and to deal with now let us come back to
project cost management so it's about
expending money what we're speaking
about which basically focuses on
estimating and allocation of budget to
the project that is first thing one is
to estimate approximate what cost it
takes for a project now what are those
cost components so where is it cost
incurred so cost is incurred
to the resources acquired cost is
incurred to the tools cost is incurred
in all that activity what we do right so
everywhere the one we create result for
raw material what you acquire the people
the technology resource what to occur
the facility what you have so all this
involves money the cost expenditure so
approximation of the cost needs to be
done what it takes to complete this
project and confirm budget it so this
involves project budgeting so good
estimation tools need to make sure that
the funds are within the need of the
project and stakeholder sponsors are
kept informed so estimation and
budgeting cannot happen in isolation
project manager cannot do alone that
requires to involve the experts the
Divine experts who can determine how the
budget can be established how it can
change how it can be controlled what are
The Regulators needs to be kept in mind
so it considers all those processes
required to do that
all the tasks which are involved like
cost and combining them will determine
project budget so firstly approximation
would happen based on that approximation
then the approximation of that will be
submitted then the budget is confirmed
after all location so this needs to be
monitored and controlled throughout the
Project Life Cycle so initially I also
mentioned earlier about triple
constraint scope time and cost so it is
very important to monitor these three
critically so for that there is a
technique which is used which is very
popular earned value management which
speaks about or provides you the Insight
towards how the project is progressing
in terms of scope time and cost
which are basically very important ones
then comes rest of the things quality
resource risk which complements to this
right so project cost management
involves four processes that is Plan
cost management estimate cost determine
budget which are part of planning
process group and control cost is part
of monitoring and Control process group
now next uh knowledge area is Project
quality management so when we say
quality it's all about ensuring that
grades are set requirements are clearly
defined and how are you going to ensure
that inner in characteristics what are
defined are accomplished so you need to
have a quality management approach
quality management plan in place now
what quality management I should follow
there are a lot of Standards lot of best
practices so that is based on the
project environment in which
organization are you doing in any given
organization there will be quality
management practices which are followed
an approach that may require to get
reflected in the projects which is being
done in that environment or if project
has a specific requirement that specific
quality management standard or practice
needs to be followed then that needs to
be defined accordingly the quality
management should happen so quality
management is a part of entire project
management plan which speaks about
quality specifications products or
service the artifacts which are used as
part of the project so when we say
quality management approach we speak
about many terms like acceptance
criteria quality criteria customer
quality expectations then quality
assurance quality control so all these
needs to be kept in mind and brought in
place and this in execution if you look
at there is a process called manage
quality when we looked at scope schedule
and cost there was no processes defined
in execution but since the
accountability of ensuring quality is
with project manager there is a process
now remember all these 49 processes
defined in PMP are project management
processes these are not the processes
which are for execution so these are all
project management processes if any any
team member is configuring something
creating something delivering something
none of those activities are defined as
part of these processes as planned when
you make a clear plan like uh when I
said create WBS where you have the
elements which needs to be delivered or
defined when you're putting an
activities into it adding activities
into it that anyway you have a domain
expert to do it accordingly execution
happens by team members but as a project
manager you are not involved in that in
entirety in execution I'm saying so
project quality management will have the
processes like plan quality management
manage quality and control quality so
plan quality management is part of
planning process group manage quality is
part of executing process group whereas
control quality is part of monitoring
and controlling process group so the
next knowledge area to look at is
Project Resource Management so when we
say resource by default we think about
human resources so that's how the
knowledge area was in the fifth edition
so it was called as project human
resource management but as the
discussions happen has the realization
happened it is not about just human
resource many resources involves
technology resources facility resources
so the renaming of that knowledge area
happened in sixth edition as project
Resource Management so project Resource
Management focuses on ensuring
identification of those roles
identification of those resources having
a plan in place so that resources can be
managed better so predominantly when we
say resource it's quite obvious we think
about human resources so which is very
very unpredictable kind of resource
whereas when it comes to technology
resource it is predictable the nature
the behavior the configuration
everything is predictable but only those
human resources are the one which
requires a special treatment
a special approach to engage with them
so this knowledge area helps to identify
roles within the project team as per the
project management team structure
defined so there should be project
management team structure defined and
what needs to be delivered from which of
the roles which also include how they
fit into overall structure of the
project so these team members or
resources need to be acquired if it is
human resources those needs to be
educated and induction needs to be done
about the project and they needs to
become fit into the project so when I
say people it's quite obvious conflict
occurs various different preferences
they come across with they have their
own experience backgrounds and Dynamics
associated with them so close monitoring
is required mentoring is required
demonstration of leadership skills are
required so generally we speak about
three main ways of demonstrating
leadership which involves authoritarian
leadership then lazy Fair leadership and
participative Leadership so
authoritarian is also called as
autocratic which means the project
manager will become hold that Authority
power with that power
the project manager demonstrate this is
how it should be makes the decision so
such power demonstration may be required
when something needs to be influenced
strongly and direction is to be set and
decisions needs to be made but when it
comes to participative leadership when
some problems needs to be resolved When
people's involvement is required that
needs to be encouraged that is very
essential reviewing or creating
solutions that approach leadership style
is required but when it comes to Lazy
Fair delegative approach so where there
are specific domain experts who will do
it so assign to them and then monitor
review with them that is delegative
approach so these three leadership
styles has to be demonstrated
effectively while doing doing project
resource management
so team will have their own Dynamics so
that needs to be understood and
accordingly dealt with so this knowledge
area has around six processes that is
plan Resource Management estimate
activity resources acquire resources
develop team manage team and control
resources so plan resource management
and estimate activity resources are part
of planning process group acquire
resources develop team and manage team
are part of executing process group
whereas control resource is part of
monitoring and Control process group so
next knowledge area we are going to look
at is Project communication management
so when we say project communication
firstly we need to understand what is
this communication is all about
so communication is used to convey
something to someone
so there should be two parties the
communicator and the one who receives it
means sender and receiver so very
important here is when sender sends
certain message at the receiver's end
how it is received is the meaning what
is actually perceived buy a receiver is
same as what is meant by the
communicator means sender so this will
become a big gap if what I told versus
what someone understood if there is a
gap then the communication is not
effective
so it is very essential to understand
this Dynamics communication should be
very effective and based on that
communication there is always a
resultant action so always communication
will have two parties minimum one is
sender and receiver and in the
receiver's perspective one is to
understand who would be the receiver
generally when I say project manager
project manager communicates with
sponsor project manager communicates
with team members project manager
communicates with customers project
manager communicates with other
functions within organization suppliers
who are external to the organization now
each of these communications will have a
specific objective and intention so
project manager should understand that
and what sorts of vocabularies and
jargons which needs to be used while
communicating the words the
communication methods which needs to be
used the communication channel the
language the syntax understanding all of
these will become very important while
doing the communication in the project
so project communication management is
the area that informs the team and
stakeholders about the project
so the communication management system
is determined along with how it is done
and how often it is done how frequently
the communication has to be made so
managing communication should also
involve reviewing how effective the
communication is
and how the regularly the modifications
are being done to ensure the
communication is actually fulfilling the
requirements of communication needs that
needs to be discussed regularly and
looked at is that helping so it is very
essential as the stakeholders are
identified that communication
requirement should also identified and
what communication why is that
communication how often how frequently
the communication has to be made what
channel what template which has to be
used and what language
so all these needs to be understood
signed off so when you go and inform or
sends a message to the sponsor it will
have specific objective of that
communication similarly when you send it
to team member specific objective here
in these two aspects the frequency will
change the language will change the
stakeholders to whom the communication
is made by changes and impact it has to
create in that communication will also
change so that needs to be understood
the project manager should be very
sensitive about it so communication
management plays very important role
whereas 90 of the time project manager
will be spending his effort and time in
communicating if that is not effective
it is difficult to become successful in
project management
now let us look at the processes in
Project communication management
so there are three processes that is
plan communication management
manage Communications and monitor
Communications
so plan communication management is part
of planning process group manage
communication is part of executing
process group
monitor communication is part of
monitoring and controlled process groups
the next knowledge area is Project risk
management
so when we use the term risk it's all
about an uncertainty what we're speaking
about so every assignment we take up
every initiative we do everything
involves risk similarly project also
involves risk so risk which is termed as
an uncertainty of certain occurrence are
both positive as well as negative the
positive risk we call it as
opportunities whereas negative risk we
call it as threats so each of these risk
has to be treated certain way so before
you treat or decide on certain treatment
of the risks identified risks needs to
be analyzed so qualitative analysis
quantitative analysis has to be done and
risk responses has to be planned so the
project risk management is the knowledge
area which will identify how the risks
are itemized categorized and prioritized
in the risk register similarly risks are
prioritized and qualitatively and
quantitative actively analyzed So based
on their impact on the project
the necessary response plan will be
defined so risk has to be controlled by
reviewing the risk register regularly
and removing the risk that no longer
impact the project now the risk once
identified mainly risks are identified
some set of risks are already identified
captured in Project Charter whereas in
detail risks are identified during the
planning associated with many different
aspects of the project the risk related
to scope schedule time cost quality
resources maybe procurement stakeholder
so risks are categorized accordingly and
identified now this is not the list
which is made it is not an exhaustive
list which is made in one go so this
acts as a basic list as the project
progresses all these identified risk
needs to be evaluated on continual basis
and also new risks needs to be
identified regularly so that what are
the kinds of risk which comes up on
understood and then response plans are
accordingly taken so this helps in
managing the risks effectively and
efficiently
the processes involved in Risk
Management knowledge area are plan risk
management identify risk perform
qualitative risk analysis perform
quantitative risk analysis and plan risk
response which are part of planning
process group
whereas Implement risk response will be
part of executing process group and
monitor risks this will be part of
monitoring and controlled process group
so when we say identify risk this is
when you identify the riskier and
captured in the risk register and as I
mentioned earlier this is not a list
which is exhaustive so at the moment
whatever the risks are being identified
so these risks are analyzed now as part
of this planning qualitatively as well
as quantitatively but the analysis of
the risk assessing those risks should
continue throughout the Project Life
Cycle because the impact level of the
risk would vary as it progresses
throughout the Project Life Cycle now as
we have a risk response plans defined
and for some it is already implemented
some you cannot Implement you need to
make yourself ready to tackle the
scenario of issues when it occurs when
risk occurs you need to handle those so
have that capability built or having
some contingency plans any of such
actions are taken and projects should be
ready means when risk occurs the impact
occurred and I'm just okay with it that
will not work so project will get
impacted it may escalate the cost it may
delay the project closure many things it
will happen
so proper analysis and then actions in
time right risk response plans can be
implemented so for positive risk for
opportunities generally acceptance or
exploit or taking advantage of that
would be the kind of response we will
see
for the negative risk the threats the
kind of responses what we would see is
like avoid or have a contingency plan or
mitigate the risk in terms of having
some measures implemented transfer risk
is another thought which is done so if
someone says avoid risk that behavior is
called as risk hours Behavior someone
who don't even take risk so if I take up
this I have the risk of so much so I
will not even take up that such
behaviors so those are the kinds of risk
responses may come across which needs to
be implemented as part of executing
process group then whatever the plan
whatever the implementation which has
happened that needs to be monitored as
part of monitoring and control so next
knowledge area for us is Project
procurement management
so when we say procurement so every
project involves procuring something
so a main decision which happens here is
make or buy decision so should I make it
myself should I create my myself within
within the organization or should I do
something or purchase something so make
or buy decision so when I decide I'm
going to buy certain things from outside
because we cannot make everything as
part of our organization because the
direction of the business is totally
different
if I'm a bank and I am doing an IT
project I need not go and sit and start
configuring a server so I need not hire
a people who configure and then they
come and sit here and I start managing
them so my entire focus of banking
services which I need to focus on
we'll go for toss I should not do that
so insert instead I'll give to an
experts so procurement of RIT services
from IIT service provider I will do so
to giving it to the experts rather than
doing myself which helps me to have that
expertise coming to me so procurement
management involves in identifying those
resources the products or Services which
needs to be procured to use in my
project so that I need not spend time on
that so this involves identification of
the suppliers having those
subcontractors right so they will have
an engagement through a contract and
monitoring and managing them and
establishing a relationship with them
and engaging with them in appropriate
way that is required it is very
essential to be done in every project so
that way project procurement management
would guide in terms of handling all the
procurements what we do from object
external to the organization so this
knowledge area handles outside
procurements like hiring subcontract
factors outside needs of projects are
identified and how much they are
determined this involves a statement of
work terms of reference request for
proposal and choosing a vendor so to do
this bidder conference happens floating
request for proposals can happen request
for quotation can happen so many such
actions are taken and the processes
involved here are three mainly so plan
procurement management which is part of
planning process group conduct
procurement which is part of executing
process group and control procurement
which is part of monitoring and Control
process group so the next knowledge is
Project stakeholder management so when
we say stakeholder who is the
stakeholder stakeholders are internal
stakeholders or external stakeholders
are the one who influence stakeholders
impact they will get impacted they are
influenced so likewise for every project
every initiative organization takes
there are stakeholders for me for my
project I need to identify all the
stakeholders so now identification of
stakeholder engaging with stakeholder
managing the stakeholders will become
very essential so as part of this
knowledge area after identification of
stakeholders the need of stakeholders
needs to be understood so not every
stakeholders are identified will have
very close to the project they are not
in very close proximity to the project
the distance of the stakeholder from the
project may be far still they may have
an impacted because of this we need to
understand that if I am building a
flyover construction of a flyover is
happening obviously people living in
that region will get impacted but they
have no direct involvement in the
project however their cooperation is
required so likewise as as you identify
the stakeholders we need to understand
what kind of impact or influence that
stakeholder will have
on them or on the project from them this
needs to be analyzed so stakeholders
needs to be identified their concerns
need to be identified and must be
managed some stakeholders would come up
with certain powers authorities so we
need to understand that as well
so each of the stakeholder needs to be
listed out their concerns prioritize
based on their impact on the project
then the stakeholders need to be engaged
and determine if their needs are being
addressed if not what can be done to
rectify those if at all any issues exist
so various stakeholders State also can
exist there is a stakeholder who should
be very supportive in the project
actively involved in the project but the
stakeholder may be in another state so
we may require to engage with a
stakeholder bring that Clarity explain
and then ensure that stakeholder is
supported to the project some
stakeholders may be resistive some
stakeholder may be neutral some
stakeholder will be very supportive
unaware so various different state of
stakeholders would exist but one needs
to analyze what kind of state that
stakeholder should be in this project
that needs to be discussed understood
and then decide
so accordingly engagement should happen
so stakeholder engagement plan is to be
defined very clearly so now here we have
four processes so one process in
initiating process group that is
identify stakeholder then plan
stakeholder engagement which happens in
planning manage stakeholder engagement
which is executing process group and
monitor stakeholder engagement is
monitoring and Control process group as
I mentioned in Risk Management in
stakeholder management also
identification of stakeholder analyzing
the way stakeholder engagement should
happen and deciding that engagement this
is very Dynamic which has to happen
throughout the Project Life Cycle and
this is not one time if you are looking
to get certified as a project management
professional then hey there you are at
the right place simply runs postgraduate
program in project management find the
course link mentioned in the description
box below but before we start if you
haven't subscribed to our Channel then
click on the Subscribe button and hit
the Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply learn
as towards the end of this session we'll
explain you which one is better for you
to consider so stick till the end and
take the important decision
let us take a look at the objectives of
our session
today we will start this session by
understanding what is the product and
what is a project following that we'll
understand what is product management
and its goals similarly you will
understand what is project management
and its goals then we will go through
the life cycle of product management and
project management moving forward we'll
understand the main difference between
product management and project
management
and we'll wrap up this session by
talking about which one should you
choose to start your career in product
management or project management
to know more about product management it
is very important to first understand
what is the product
so a product is something that is
offered to deliver its services to the
users by putting efforts to be produced
for example Google Maps for directional
services
it can be defined as a tangile item that
an alliance create to serve the
customers need for example Uber for taxi
services
a product is designed to create
customers value by solving their problem
with convenient evolution
it doesn't have any explicit life cycle
and has more prominence which means that
a product doesn't have any fixed ending
and it needs continuous Discovery and
development
we can differentiate products into six
categories the sex type of product that
we have are
differentiated products it consists of
vintage car smartphones shirt shoes and
a lot more
next are customized products customized
products holds on customized fragrance
customized shoes customized websites and
a lot more
the next are potential products
it includes luxurious chocolates protein
bars and other luxurious projects
the next are core products it consists
of laptop bulb mobile phones Etc
the next are actual products it holds on
maps books and a lot more
the last type of product that we have
are augmented programs it holds on Apple
TV e-commerce Telecom operators and
other similar products
now let us understand what is a project
so it is a fleeting effort comments to
be construct a remarkable product or a
service
it can also be defined as the process of
providing services to the user by
focusing on the scope resources and
quality of the output
all the projects have a team to work on
a budget to complete the task under a
specific amount are scheduled to follow
an expectation to meet the need of the
customers
we can also determine a project as a
process of executing a plan which
involves taking requirement of the
customers and building the solution
projects are the temporary efforts made
to need the business and to organize
best to the users
projects can also be differentiated into
five different categories the five type
of product
s are
production project it involved Grapevine
production or other production similar
to those objects
the next type of project that we have
are social project it involves blood
donation blood dry and a lot social
projects
the next are educational projects it
holds on presentation infographics
brochures and other educational projects
the next are Community projects it holds
on food collection cloth collection and
providing those to those people who
actually need those products
the next type of projects are research
projects it involves research work from
some platform or for some platform for
example social media
now that we have a clear idea of what is
a product and what is a project
here's a question for you we all are
aware like button functionality in the
Facebook
what do you think if it's a product or a
project put your answers in the comment
section below
now let us understand what is product
management
product management is managing the
process of the product throughout the
life cycle from strategizing to design
and development to branding of the
product
it involves strategizing products to
enhance business profit and create
customers value along with providing
benefits to the company
it involves building road maps
specifying functional requirements and
creating blueprints to develop the
product as per the requirement
it also involves taking customers
feedback and finalizing the price of the
product
the product management depends on the
organizational structure and size of the
company the management can vary from
company to company depending upon the
organizational relationships with the
industries
this also looks after The Branding and
launching of the product developed by
the company
the product management is divided into
three key areas product Discovery
product planning and product development
moving on to the goals of product
management
to get a perfect product product
management use a Smart system to enhance
the goals of product management and
manage the deliverables for the
customers
smart stand for
specific
the product management should work on
the specific idea to start the
production as per customer requirement
measurable there should be some matrices
and data to measure the requirement of
the product to get the desired goal
actionable the goals should be
attainable to the resources required for
the product
relevant the product must be appropriate
as per the product management goals
time bound even must be time bound so
that it could deliver the product to the
customers at a particular given time
period
now let us move ahead and understand
what is project management
project management is defined as the
process of planning and organizing the
resources of the company to complete a
specific task
project management plays the same roles
irrespective of the belonging industry
it is a rule that looks after the
specific product of an organization
the main objective of project management
is to determine the goals and objective
of the project
it also creates a quality assurance
check to ensure the standards of the
project
it is the approach of applying skills in
technique to complete a project as per
the customer's requirement
it also helps to get the predictable
project planning and execution process
the primary constraint of project
management are time scope quality and
cost
to understand more about project
management let us talk the goals of
project management
the primary goals of project management
are
optimize distributed potential intakes
to finish the project on time
to manage the performance of the team
to manage the proper communication and
coordination in the team
to achieve the goal and objective of the
project within the given time period
to meet the customers requirement and
make them happy
let us move further and have a look life
cycle of product management
so the life cycle of product management
has product framing
this phase involves creating a Visions
identifying problems and defining the
success of the product
the next phase is research
research means learn from the people
about the need and the values of the
product
the next phase is design
in this phase the team synthesizes
versions ideas and Research into the
Prototype of the product
the next phase is plotting
plotting means testing the solution in
the Real Time with real people
then the product is launched into the
market
launching means to send your product
into the wild and let it flourish
in the last phase when the product is
launched into the market it is important
to do some measurements measurements
means using matrices and data to measure
the success of the product and plan the
improvements
now let us learn the life cycle of
project management
the life cycle of project management has
following phases
the first phase is initiating
initiating is the first phase of project
management where the management is
initiated by determining the visions of
the project the next phase of project
management is planning this phase
involves planning for the project by
creating roadmaps for it this phase will
also communicate roles and
responsibility with the teammates and
assemble the workflow the next phase is
executing
this is the phase where execution of
major part of the project is done
the execution phase holds on following
plan roles communication and project
required tools
the next phase is monitoring and control
this space happens in pair with the
execution phase as both the phases occur
at the same time as the team starts the
execution of the plan the tasks are
constantly being monitored by the
managers
the last phase of project management is
closing
once the project is completed it is
delivered to the customers by
communicating with the stakeholders
once the project is delivered to the
customers the resources are allocated to
another project
in this stage the final project is
evaluated and the team finally moves on
to the other project
now let us understand the difference
between product management and project
management
the product management deals with the
planning of the product plotting
production and branding of the product
whereas the project management deals
with the process of applying techniques
Knowledge and Skills to complete a
particular project
the main focus of product management is
to build up the value of the product
on the other hand project management
focuses on the breaking down of the
efforts and working with multiple
functional tasks
the product manager must be good at
market research strategic thinking and
Business Service whereas a project
manager must be good at planning and
budget organizing
product management leads to the external
market operations whereas project
management leads to the management of
internal operations of an organization
product management sets a trajectory for
the product by creating visions and
goals for it on the other hand project
management brings this visions and goals
into the reality by working on the
projects to develop the product
product management focuses on a broader

quick question

program manager in an organization
option A is handling day-to-day project
tasks option b is handling multiple
projection aligning them options is
providing strategic planning for
long-term vision and option D is
focusing on resource allocation for a
single project you can pause this video
and answer in the comment section below
alright now let's understand what is
project management
so project management refers to the
process of planning organizing and
executing specific undertaking with
well-defined objectives timings and
resources
projects are temporary Endeavors aimed
at creating unique product service or
result
they have a defined beginning and end
and the success is measured by whether
they meet their objective within the
allocated constraints project managers
are the leaders responsible for managing
all aspects of a project from initiation
to closure they collaborate with
stakeholders set project goals create
detailed plans and ensure effective
communication among team members so this
was about the project managers now let's
understand about the program managers
so what is program management or what is
program manager so program management on
the other hand involves coordinating
multiple interrelated projects to
achieve a strategic business objectives
programs are often long-term initiatives
composed of various projects that
contribute to the overall organization
goals the coordination and alignment of
these projects are essential to achieve
optimal results program managers are
responsible for overseeing the
interconnected projects within a program
ensuring that integration and alignment
with organization objectives they focus
on Resource Management risk mitigation
and maintaining a holistic view of
programs progress now let's understand
the key differences between project
manager and program manager
so first is scope and complexity the
primary difference between a project
manager and a program manager lies in
the scope and complexity of the
responsibilities a project manager
focuses on a single project whereas a
program manager handles a group of
related projects with interconnected
objectives then there is objectives
project managers work to achieve
specific project goals which are usually
well defined and time-bound on the other
hand program managers are concerned with
achieving strategic business outcomes
aligning multiple projects to meet the
broader organizational objectives third
is time frames projects generally have
shorter time frames with a clear start
and end date program managers deal with
multiple projects work on longer
timelines sometimes spanning several
years fourth is resource management
so project managers concentrate on
managing resources dedicated to their
specific project in contrast program
managers are responsible for allocating
resources across various projects within
the program ensuring optimal utilization
and prioritization so these were the key
differences between a project manager
and a program manager now let's have a
look at the required skills and
competencies of both of them
so let's start with project manager
skills
so effective project managers possesses
a diverse skill set that enables them to
navigate the complexities of the
projects some key skills include first
one project initiation it involves
commencing a project and undertaking
comprehensive plane
during this phase specific and
attainable objectives are set a suitable
team is assembled resources are
allocated and a kick of meeting is
conducted next is leadership
project managers lead diverse teams and
Inspire them to achieve project
objectives then the next skill is
communication clear and open
communication is vital for managing
stakeholders and keeping the team
aligned then there is time management
meeting project deadlines and Milestones
is crucial for Success then the next
skill is budgeting and cost management
keeping projects within budget is
essential toward cost overruns so these
were some of the skills that the project
managers must have alright now let's
understand program manager skills
so program managers require additional
skills to manage multiple projects
simultaneously and align them with
broader Business Schools so first is
strategic Vision program managers must
understand the organization's strategic
Direction and align projects accordingly
second is stakeholder management
building and maintaining relationship
with stakeholders across projects is
critical
then the next one is change management
managing changes across multiple
projects requires a strategic approach
the next is conflict resolution
resolving conflicts between projects or
teams is essential for program success
and it is a duty of a program manager
then there is risk analysis identifying
potential risk and developing mitigation
plans for the entire program is another
skill of a program manager now let's
understand the Synergy between the
project management and program
management
so in successful organizations project
managers and program managers
collaborate to create a powerful Synergy
that derives achievements at both
project and program levels the
collaboration between these roles
enhances the overall efficiency and
effectiveness of project delivery
project managers feed valuable project
level data to program managers helping
them to make informed decisions for
resource allocation and risk management
on the other hand program managers
provide strategic guidance and support
to project managers ensuring their
projects aligned with organizational
objectives and today we will learn about
PMP certification before we begin let's
have a look at an incident where two
project managers John and Ted are
talking to each other John is a senior
project manager while Ted is a part of
his team John finds dead to be upset so
he asks him is there anything he can
help him with to which Ted replies that
his project failed Jon further asks him
what could be the possible reason for
the project failure Ted tells him that
it's because he was not able to manage
the time and budget now John asks him if
he is PMP certified to which debt says
he isn't then Jon suggested that he must
take the PMP certification which will
not only give his project better
performance but also help him upskill in
his career so today we will discuss

further we will look into the PMP basic
concepts the PMP basic concepts are the
five project management steps these
project management steps start from the
day we begin our project to the day we
end our project they begin from
initiation to closure the first step
that we have is initiation planning
execution monitoring and controlling and
closure now let's have a look at each of
them in detail the first step we have is
initiation initiation involves defining
the project scope this is the step where
we explain what our project will have
for whom we are making that project it
helps us to identify our stakeholders
who all will be the part of that project
and determine the project feasibility
after the step of initiation when we
have decided the scope of our project
the Second Step that comes is planning
in the planning phase we Define a flow
to all the activities of a project we
Define this flow keeping in mind all the
constraints of a project like time
resources and risk after we have defined
the flow of the these processes it is
time for us to look at the execution in
the execution phase we evaluate the plan
and the sequence of the task we have
made we finally put the plan in action
and the project tends to start after the
project building has started and the
process of execution has started it is
time for the monitoring and the
controlling phase in monitoring and
controlling phase the progress of the
project is tracked and important steps
for quality assurance are taken in
monitoring and controlling phase the
work being done is compared with the
work as defined in the project plan in
this phase the progress of the project
is tracked and important steps for
quality assurance are taken finally we
have the closure step in this step the
deliverables are delivered to the client
the documentation of all that took place
during the Project Life Cycle is done
and project is fully evaluated now when
we have seen reasons for getting PMP
certified and we know the basic concepts
of PMP it is time for us to know who can
get PMP certified for getting PMP
certified there can be two cases the
first case is you must have a secondary
degree a secondary degree means High

opportunity to apply my learnings
practically and this is very useful for
my current role

you are looking to get certified as a
project management professional then hey
there you are at the right place simply
runs postgraduate program in project
management find the course link
mentioned in the description box below
here as part of this video we are going
to look at few possible questions which
one would face while going through an
interview this will help them to prepare
for interview and also help to
understand what kind of questions would
come across when they face the interview
in addition to that these questions also
has an Insight towards the role of
project management itself
so let us look at one by one question
number one how do you define a project
so as per the pmis pmbok 6th edition a
project is a temporary Andover
undertaken to create a unique product
service or results
the temporary nature of projects
indicates that a project has a definite
beginning and end so when we say this
temporary and over undertaken to create
Unique Products service or results each
project will have a definite start date
and end date once the project team is
formed once the project objectives are
achieved so the team which is formed the
human resources which are onboarded to a
project so those are disseminated sent
backs to their respective functions or
departments and project will be
concluded as complete so project can be
simple or complex and may be managed by
a single person or a group of them so
every project will have a life cycle so
from beginning to end it starts and end
where it acquires lot of resources where
it will divide the Project Life Cycle
into multiple stages or phases where
project is being done and deliverables
will happen through the Milestones
during that lifestyle again so projects
are often broken into small tasks to
utilize team strengths and increase
productivity
question number two what is a project
Charter so project Charter is a short
document that explains the entire
project so this will become a basic
document which will be given to a
project manager so that a project
manager can understand what is a project
management is all about
so this document would include the
objectives of the project how will they
be carried out who are the stakeholders
identification of risks advantages of
the project and the budget so project
Charter plays an integral while planning
the project as a plan is something that
is used in all the phases of Project
Life Cycle it is very essential because
it provides all the necessary insights a
project manager is needed while taking
up the project
after getting the project Charter the
first job a project manager supposed to
do is to identify the stakeholders even
though project Charter will have a basic
list of stakeholders so project manager
has to contact those stakeholders
establish the list of stakeholders for
the project understand the requirements
in detail and further move towards
planning what is meant by scope of the
project
so project scope is most essential part
of project planning that helps in
determining the list of specific project
goals or deliverables so when we say
this project will have a definite unique
deliverable which has to be created so
this will have a specific description of
the specification as well as the
features functionalities of the
deliverable
so to accomplish that features
functionality of that output what we are
going to create as a result of a project
within a project lot of activities are
done the processes the tools the
resources which are utilized for the
project all falls under this scope so
when we say the term scope it is very
important for us to understand the scope
of a project versus scope of the product
the scope of the project involves all
those processes resources and activities
what we do to accomplish the result
whereas product scope is the one which
we speak about that result itself the
features functionalities of that result
itself so one needs to understand the
difference between this project scope
and product scope and Define accordingly
so this will help in identification of
the Project's output and why that output
is created and how this particular
product or services or results will help
organization or business to accomplish
their objectives this should be the
basic understanding a project manager
should have
so it includes everything that is to be
achieved by the project which means all
those results what needs to be achieved
all those value which has to be created
by the results so we need to keep in
mind the result itself is not the
ultimate objective of an organization it
is not instead the result will help
organization to accomplish their
objectives for example if you take in HR
department if they introduce an intranet
portal for claim processing so the
application what is created as part of
the exercise of initiative where my
employees should submit their claims
through a specific portal now that is to
reduce the time the processing duration
as well as the efficiency and
effectiveness of the processed claim
what is submitted so this is an outcome
so keeping that outcome the objective
this portal is created that portal
itself has the features and
functionalities which project will focus
and create that results so through that
result organization would accomplish
their objectives that should be kept in
mind so understanding the scope is
essential so while understanding the
scope also need to understand how this
particular output the product results is
going to add value to the business what
is the outcome of that that is also very
important to understand one is
understanding the scope ensuring the
project is delivered within that scope
and all that required to be done to
accomplish that scope has to be done and
only that not anything more than that
not anything lesser than that
what is Project Life Cycle as I was
mentioning during The Question three
there is a project scope so project
itself has a life cycle so this project
scope falls under this Project Life
Cycle so Project Life Cycle refers to
the beginning and end of the project
there is a life so you initiate a
project trigger a project project is
actually started and as it starts it
progresses creating the results and then
it ends project can end in various
different scenarios one is by
accomplishing the objective of the
project the ultimate results the
deliverable it creates and then ends our
project may also get closed prematurely
so we are not going to look at the why
the project is going to close
prematurely at the moment
our idea is to understand what is
Project Life Cycle and to visualize that
so this entire span of time the project
spends from the beginning to end it
involves various different stages or
phases whatever the term you want to
call it and in each of these stages or
phases there is a milestone deliverables
which are measured and that will be part
of the ultimate deliverable what is
going to be delivered as a result of a
project
so it involves all the activities all
the processes all the resources which
needs to be acquired managed and then
the results needs to be accomplished
ultimately
so here in a Project Life Cycle
it involves five process groups which
mainly focuses on different different
activities and dynamics of the project
which we call it as the initiation
process group planning process group
execution process group monitoring and
controlling process group and closure
process group
so during initiation process group the
creation of a project Charter
appointment of the project manager and
identification of this key stakeholder
will be done this can be initiation of
the project as a whole or as a part of a
specific stage or a face
now all these process group what I
mentioned initiation planning execution
monitoring closure all of these process
groups can be looked at their
involvement in the entire Project Life
Cycle at the same time it can also be
seen as part of a single fix so each of
the process groups are applicable like
initiation of a project if I say
similarly initiation of a stage or a
face
so the planning process group involves
the process of creating the plan for
achieving the Project's objectives so
this would create the detailed plan for
entire project or a skeleton plan for a
project if it is a agile or rolling wave
project
if that approach is taken like rolling
wave or Progressive elaboration or agile
approaches then the skeleton of the
project plan is created if waterfall
approach is taken it's quite obvious the
comprehensive the detailed project plan
will be created project management plan
is also involved in this
now in addition to this as you progress
in the project for each stage or a phase
there needs to be a plan which is
detailed further compared to the project
plan itself which will become ultimately
part of big plan of a project
the execution process groups involves
the project management processes for
identification allocation and management
of resources required for executing the
project deliverables
so here the actual execution happens
being a project manager the focus should
be on managing the project so many a
time I have seen project manager is
going and doing tasks looking at the
task level transaction level which was
not project management thought so one
needs to ensure the project management
is not about deliverables in terms of
doing the tasks it's about getting the
deliverables from the team
so active involvement in terms of
acquiring the resources checking whether
the accomplishment of results has
happened needs to be done throughout the
Project Life Cycle so it's all about
directing and manage project works and
at the same time managing the knowledge
which is acquired during the Project
Life Cycle
the monitoring and controlling process
groups involves the process for project
manager to monitoring and controlling
the project now this involves reviewing
this involves creation of reports this
involves concluding yes project has
delivered or not delivered
identification of the deviations and
initiating with the change request for
necessary Corrections so monitoring and
control will be done throughout the
Project Life Cycle and only with an
effective monitoring and control we can
see the success in a project
so the closer process group involves the
process which is required for formally
closing the project where everything
including what went wrong and what went
right all through the project is summed
up so here especially in the closing
process group we will not focus on
acceptance of the deliverable instead
we'll focus on sign off capturing
lessons learned all the formalities
which needs to be completed as part of a
closure then where are we going to
accept the deliverables this happens in
monitoring and controlling so while
doing the monitoring and controlling we
will validate validate against what is
planned comparing with what is being
delivered so when you compare both one
would understand what is delivered
versus what actually was planned so
their acceptance happens once the
acceptance happens there only then the
project moves towards closure
project or face either of that so when
we say closure process group it inverts
the process for a closure of that phase
whether accomplishment of all the
objectives all the deliverables of the
phase is done or not is checked if it is
a phase if it is a project in the
project perspective if everything is
complete is checked and then it moves to
closing process group where the lessons
learned the formal sign off everything
will be done as part of this closing
process group
what is the importance of process groups
so process groups are set of processes
that are applicable to various stages of
the project as I mentioned earlier each
of the processes has a defined set of
inputs and produced defined outputs by
applying a set of tools and techniques
on the input the initiation process
groups involves the processes needed to
initiate the project that is develop
project Charter and identify
stakeholders the two processes the
project Charter will be handed over to
the project manager and formal
Declaration of appointment of the
project manager will be done further
project manager has to identify the key
stakeholders and take forward the
project as per the direction set in the
project Charter so in this group in this
process group initiation process group
it is a formal Declaration of
appointment of project manager to the
project but one needs to remember should
not get confused in real time we see an
individual who is about to become a
project manager for a project sits and
create a project Charter we have seen
that in reality so does it mean that
what is told here is wrong compared to
what is practiced that is not the idea
many organization thinks if we involve
the project manager to be project
manager of a project while creating the
project Charter itself the level of
information the detail that person will
have about a project will be more
compared to a person who will become a
project manager after handing over the
project Charter so there is a difference
the person takes the project Charter and
become aware of the project that is one
scenario the person actively involved in
creating a project Charter and then
become a project manager that is better
scenario where the person will be more
informed But ultimately the
accountability of a project Charter lies
with the sponsor formal Declaration of
appointment of project manager
confirmation of that happens only when
project Charter is approved and handed
over to the person who is to be project
manager so that's where actual
initiation of project happens then
project manager can move at and start
identifying the stakeholders and start
collecting the details of the
stakeholders their request requirements
and stakeholders cannot give all the
requirements comes coming to their mind
they need to restrict to those project
detailing what needs to be provided the
planning process group defines the
detail plan of the project which
involves the planning for scope time
cost quality resource risk procurement
stakeholders communication and
integration of all the subsidiary plans
each of this plan like scope management
plan schedule management Plan cost
management plan quality management plan
Resource Management plan risk management
plan procurement management plan
stakeholder engagement plan
communication management plan so all
these plans are called as subsidiary
plans so all these plans are integrated
and detailed project management plan
will be created so this involves various
tools and techniques like expert
judgment meetings analogous estimation
parametric estimation decomposition pert
critical path method depending on the
specific area which has been focused on
while planning for example expert
judgment is a common technique used
across all the areas like scope time
cost quality all of these nine areas
knowledge areas which I was mentioning
expert judgment meetings are mostly seen
as a technique used during each of these
planning whereas when it comes to
critical path method so critical path
method is about scheduling so we will
see the technique only in mostly in
schedule management similarly if I speak
about decomposition we see that in scope
management so likewise there are
specific techniques which are specific
to a specific knowledge areas which we
need to identify as we go through the
entire framework itself similarly there
are common techniques used across the
knowledge areas which if you can
identify that common techniques which
are used across knowledge areas it is
easy for us to remember and recall those
similarly specific techniques for a
specific knowledge area
the execution process group involves the
processes to direct and manage the
project works the active involvement of
the members of the team is seen
performing their tasks to execute the
project Works although the project plan
is finalized there may be changes in
requirements that come from the
stakeholders which are considered for
further modifications so actual
involvement of Team delivering something
acquiring the team onboarding the team
onboarding the supplier identification
of them doing the bidder conference
engaging with stakeholders all this
action should happen sir because the
main focus of execution process group in
project management perspective is
directing and managing Project work and
managing the project knowledge which is
very very important
the monitoring and controlling process
group refers to tracking and reviewing
the progress and performance of the
project the process of monitoring and
controlling is continually performed
throughout the Project Life Cycle so
here I think as I mentioned earlier as
well so it is very essential for us to
understand whether project has delivered
all those required deliverables or not
are the deliverables are fulfilling all
the features and functionality which are
defined during the planning that
validation should happen any deviations
are found change requests arised and
these change requests are approved once
it is approved then it comes to
integrated Change Control process
through which changes are executed then
the closing process group involves
assembling a report of all procedures
throughout the Project Life Cycle the
closing process group marks the formal
closure of the project and completion of
its deliverables now let us move to the
next question
so question number six name 10 knowledge
areas as mentioned in the PM book so the
10 knowledge areas are project
integration management project scope
management project schedule management
project cost management project quality
management project Resource Management
project Communications management
project risk management project
procurement management and project
stakeholder manager the project
integration management basically focuses
on unification and integration of all
the project to manage it in an
integrated way a project manager is also
called as an integrator which means a
project manager should have a end-to-end
visibility of the project so all the
rest of the nine knowledge areas the
plan which is created as part of all the
next 109 knowledge areas those are
Consolidated and a comprehensive project
management plan will be created in
Project integration management so this
is the only knowledge area where we see
the processes in all the process groups
whereas in the rest of the knowledge
areas if you see we don't see any
processes in initiating process group
except stakeholder management
so integration management has one
process similarly stakeholder management
has one process in initiation process
group similarly in closing process group
only integration management has a
process no other knowledge areas has any
processes so this is the only knowledge
area where we find processes in all the
process groups which means it is very
important to look at a project in an
end-to-end view perspective a full view
of a project should be known to the
project management only the project
manager can become successful in doing
the project management the next
knowledge area project scope management
which focuses on ensuring collecting
requirements defining scope creating
work breakdown structures and scope
Baseline so scope management focuses on
ensuring the necessary scope is defined
and provided so that during execution
projects are delivered accordingly and
monitoring controlling of the scope the
validation of the scope will be based on
what is defined in the planning what is
planned as part of scope management
similar to scope Management in schedule
management once that work breakdown
structure is created it is very
essential to understand what it takes in
terms of efforts what it takes in terms
of duration and in what sequence project
deliverables are completed in what
sequence activities are done so schedule
management focuses on that the critical
the important technique what we use when
it comes to schedule management is
critical path method so in a given
project when we establish a network
diagram so we may see multiple paths
from beginning to end of the project so
some paths will be the longest path
which is called as critical path and
that will be the minimum time which is
required to complete the project so
schedule management plan provides us a
detailed schedule of a project along
with sequencing and duration and at the
same time that is considered as a
scheduled Baseline then the cost
management so when we say cost it is
very essential for us to understand it
is an outgoing money outgoing monetary
value so projects incurs cost when I say
project incurs cost their needs an
investment from the organization who is
actually doing this project
so the cost needs to be assessed means
an approximation of the cost needs to be
done a budget has to be allocated to the
project and within that budget the
project needs to be completed it cannot
go beyond that so budget is established
allocation of budget and confirmation of
budget happens and cost perspective
monitoring of the project happens based
on what is that specific budget it has
within that project has to done that
will become a baseline cost Baseline so
to measure the cost and schedule a
technique called earned value management
is used well the terminology like cost
performance index schedule performance
index actual cost earned value planned
value budgeted completion estimate to
complete so these are the terminologies
which are used as part of earned value
management now let us move to Quality
Management project quality management so
it is very essential for us to ensure
all the processes all the activities all
the templates defined by the project are
complied with that is first thing while
doing the project during the Project
Life Cycle similarly the deliverables
which comes out of a project at the end
of the project or at the end of the
specific phase or specific stage or
specific Milestone so those deliverables
should be according to the
specifications defined and agreed upon
so quality management focuses on
establishing that quality management
approach so that project compliance is
maintained at the same time the results
what is delivered is as per the
specification what is agreed the
resource management focuses on ensuring
all the resources which are required for
the project are acquired configured
installed if it is a technology
resources if it is a human resources the
necessary induction of the project the
brainstorming required for team to
understand what is the project is all
about is given and the necessary skills
and capabilities are there with those
human resources and these team members
execute the task of the project so
project Resource Management plays very
important role and now here when we say
Scope when we we say scheduled when we
say cost when we quality in each of this
in other knowledge areas as well the
involvement of each of these resources
are essential so what resources gets
into scope management what resources
gets into schedule management what into
cost likewise for each of the knowledge
areas we see various different resources
used when I say in schedule management
effort has to be established while we
establish an effort it is also required
to understand what is the skills and
capabilities required so schedule
management definitely work very close
with Resource Management similarly these
each of this resource comes with cost so
obviously cost management is involved
then quality yes so who is going to do
the quality management so roles and
responsibilities needs to be clearly
articulated defined if it is a human
resource in Resource Management coming
to communication management so
communication I think plays very
important role as we know 90 percent of
the time project manager spends on
Communications many attempts we see
project managers like look only
communicating many team members have
told me mentioning that project manager
only does communication project manager
only ask questions now this impression
to the team gets created because they
only see what project manager is doing
is communication because team comes in
when everything is done everything is
set right so there they see project
manager during the monitoring and
control mainly not during initiation not
during planning not during closure so
many team member comes and goes during
the project they only see project
managers reviewing and asking the
questions so because of this they assume
project manager only communicates
project manager only ask questions but
it is very important to ask questions
but there is a prospective and objective
behind it which already project manager
is involved and create a delicate plan
like signing off coordinating with
stakeholders understanding requirements
many things as done in all these areas
communication is involved so it plays
very vital role so then project risk
management every initiatives
organization Stakes every investment
organization does there is a risk so
already the identified risks are
evaluated and project is taken up by the
organization which means the business
has already understood what is the risk
associated with this particular project
considering that they have taken up a
project but while doing this project
while doing the project management lot
of risk comes across project manager
should keep identifying the risk
assessing the risk analyzing the risks
qualitatively and quantitatively
depending on the level of impact of the
risk so risk means we already know it is
uncertainty of certain occurrence an
outcome it may be positive or negative
positive you can take advantage of that
you'd exploit it you enhance it whereas
negative risk you mitigate you respond
you will have a response plans like
accepting those or transferring It
sharing it transferring means you
Outsource or you take an insurance so
that is negative risk responses next the
project procurement management the
projects would involve certain
procurement so we need to ensure for
this project what is that I am creating
myself and using it what is that I am
going to procure from external suppliers
so whichever we decided in make or buy
decisions whichever we have decided that
we need to procure from elsewhere so
procurement management plays a very
important role here so identification of
what needs to be procured what quantity
we need to procure who would be the best
supplier what are the criterias while
selecting the suppliers you may float an
RFP a proposal request will be a respond
which will come in you may float a bit
when you evaluate the best vendor or
supplier you onboard them then you start
issuing a PO formally for them to supply
then procurement happens so end to end
management of the supplier right from
automoting the suppliers doing the
better conference establishing an
agreement and then engaging with them
for reviewing their performance all
these are involved as part of
procurement management the 10th
knowledge area the projects stakeholder
management so stakeholder means any
entity or individual who in walls in the
project directly or indirectly they are
impacted they influence the project and
they get influenced so very importantly
if you think about the stakeholders we
can think about customers we can think
about sponsor we can think about team
members suppliers who plays very vital
role in the success of the project so
engaging with the stakeholders managing
the stakeholders plays very important
roles And if every nine knowledge areas
there is something which You've Done
Right but something wrong done with the
stakeholder management entire project
may go for toss so one is to be very
careful understanding the Dynamics
associated with each of these 10
knowledge areas and then dealt with them
accordingly and integration management
could integrate all of this as I
mentioned earlier so that end-to-end
visibility of the project can be seen so
that is about 10 knowledge areas
mentioned in PMB okay the next question
question number seven why is the project
planning considered as the most
significant step in Project Life Cycle
the project planning is more significant
this will provide all the Baseline plans
like as we saw in the previous question
scope Baseline cost Baseline schedule
Baseline so all the baselines required
which will be referred right each of the
baselines are considered based on these
baselines project needs to be executed
now any deviations to this Baseline
plans need to have a formal approval for
necessary Corrections so already we know
there are nine types of subsidiary plans
for all the nine knowledge areas scope
schedule cost quality resource risk
procurement communication and
stakeholder these are the nine knowledge
areas which will have a subsidiary
replies which will get integrated in
integration management so without having
a clear plan Clear Directions so
execution will not have any specific
direction to take so you cannot measure
the deliverables so what to do when to
do who will do all these are defined as
part of the planning and that plays a
very important thing so if you look at
the entire framework of PMP most of the
processes out of 49 processes we can see
in planning process group almost like 24
processes out of 49 50 percent of the
processes almost can be sealing planning
process Group which itself indicates how
important the planning process group and
planning activity for a project so why
the project plan is considered most
significant let us look at few more
points so one is it provides visibility
in terms of what project is all about
what is that we are going to deliver and
what kind of results are we going to
create what is that we're aiming for
we'll get a better visibility so next
increases employee satisfaction because
there is no confusion each team member
understand what needs to be delivered
and what is that performance of the team
members how it is measured is also
visible and that is happening in reality
because you cannot deviate on what is
being planned so that should happen in
actual execution as well so obviously
employees are not confused now the team
members are not confused they're
delivering it according to what is
planned and it is easy for them also
because it is a better visibility and
they have a clarity about it next is
quality assurance and control so as we
know quality management is one of the
knowledge areas so doing timely audits
testing all the deliverables compliance
checks so all these in shoots the
approach what we have selected covering
all of this ensures the project is
delivered as we planned then reduces
project risk because all the risks are
identified we have understood what other
risks are and we keep identifying the
risk and analyzing those and when we
share risk there is one unique nature of
risk where exactly the risk occurs
accordingly the impact of the projects
will be there for example when I start a
project if there is a risk associated
with human resources which I have not
even onboarded non-availability of a
specific resource very less impact but
when I have onboarded a resource and
then project execution is happening and
execution is at Peak now what happens it
is quite obvious risk impact will be
higher compared to the risk which would
have occurred in the beginning of the
project so meaning as we progress in in
the life cycle of a project the
identified risk will have an impact
differently at the different parts of
the life cycle depending on the nature
of the risk and state of the project so
since it is visible to us we have a risk
management knowledge area which
emphasizes us on doing all of this so
since we are doing it it will become
visible for us to have an effective risk
management so next question when is
stakeholder analysis performed already
nibino stakeholder means an entity or
individuals who involve directly or
indirectly who get influenced will get
impacted are all called as stakeholders
understanding who are those stakeholders
who are basically straight in terms of
having impact or impacted so we need to
identify them and manage them we may
have a stakeholder like competition to
our organization but do we really manage
them not required we may required to be
sensitive what competition is doing is
this project is unique so that the
details of this project the information
on about this project is not leaked to
the competition is not shared with
competition in that sensitivity you need
to ensure monitoring it you need not
manage the competition here but you need
to monitor what is happening relating to
computation similarly stakeholder like
team member so you are required to
manage them you cannot just keep
monitoring you need to manage them so
that there can be the results which is
required to be created has created now
next is customer if you say you need to
engage with them you know to discuss
with them you need to review with them
so that customer is getting what
customers asked for right so stakeholder
may be anyone who is affected because of
project stakeholder analysis plays an
important role to identify and analyze
their needs right so the analysis is
generally performed Whenever there is a
need of any clarifications over
quantitative and qualitative data the
clarification helps in understanding the
interest of the stakeholders which plays
a vital role in the success of the
project as I mentioned earlier
so next question for us what is the role
of stakeholder in project management
so stakeholder as we know refers to any
organization or entity that can have any
positive or negative effect due to
project because their interests are most
important their positive impact need to
be kept in mind while any negative
impact need to minimized while planning
for executing any activity during the
project
so it is very important to understand
the stakeholder perspective View
next question what are some essential
features to be kept in mind while
choosing a project management tool so
project management tools basically
assist the project manager and the
project team in doing the project
effectively
and I think efficient way of doing
project is also ensured because many
processes are automated and the
transaction will become easier the
collaboration becomes easier creation of
dashboards and reports which will
provide the visibility of the
performance of the project so let us
look at some of the essential features
required by project management tools so
risk management just now we discussed
about risk management and its importance
if a project management tool assist
while identifying and managing a risk
because when we identify risk we update
those in a risk register so if tool has
established risk register where we can
keep inputting this particular risks and
keep alerting the specific details about
wave service frequency of analyzing the
risk repeatedly the identified risk so
informing us reminding us telling that
this risk calendar is like this you may
require to analyze those that will help
in making it better right risk
assessment as well as updates in terms
of managing the risk or also Lessons
Learned earlier some risks which of
similar kind which are identified or
managed like this so Lessons Learned
recalling those coming to Resource
Management so tool can able to help us
in terms of calculating the expenditures
and distribute them among the tasks so
that it is helpful in terms of better
management of resources as well as the
cost associated with that then
dependencies milestones and critical
path
so most of the project management tools
what we have come across minimum they
will have this capability establishing a
Gantt chart helping in terms of
establishing a network diagram which
will provide us a visibility in terms of
what is that the project flow would be
how the project flow would go on and how
the project is going to complete what
are the activities dependent on each
other so what are the relationship
between each of the tasks what are the
Milestone deliverables duration of the
project what are those activities
happening in parallel so visually
graphical representation it would give
so it should also minimize simplify the
tool should have that capability it
should also have a minimal interfaces or
ease of doing things like drag and drop
interfaces so ease functionalities
maintaining smooth maintenance and
support which it can help us in terms of
doing a project management better
so basically tools helps us in terms of
assisting to have efficient and
effective project management
so all the information should be handy
so that it is there with us always so
third party integration like a tool must
be able to help us in terms of
collaborating with other tools which
would help us in sharing information it
would help us in terms of providing
better visibility any other tools which
are there in the organization if I am
speaking about documentation records
sharing or any of the reports or
creation of the dashboards these are the
capabilities which a tool can have at
the same time this can have an interface
with other tools like Dropbox Google
Drive which will help in have a better
visibility and better collaboration so
agile workflow system when we say the
functions features functionality of this
particular tool should help us becoming
agile so moving faster means quick
inputs and feedbacks given because when
we say agile we are moving faster when
we're moving faster there should be
quick feedbacks which should be coming
back so that necessary Corrections can
be made quickly so to do this if tool
can assist us in providing those details
of increased flexibility and
transparency so that would help in
becoming more productive then dashboards
to manage projects dashboards which will
provide what is complete what is not
complete what is the status of the
project how is the performance so this
would help in having a quick visibility
into the performance of the project and
also the progress of the project to
track them so that what is complete what
is not complete and how it is
progressing is it ahead of schedule
behind schedule is it within budget or
over budget the visibility to that will
always help in terms of getting better
project management done then
customizable workflows so the tool
should be able to adapt to the unique
process to track work progression so
then if it provides the mobile
application integration so better to
have team to know what is the status of
it anytime anywhere so that ease of
moving forward faster in the project
management and making decisions will
become easier because always having
right information in right time with the
right people is very essential so that
decision making can be more informed and
quicker
then collaborate easily the tool should
enable user to share documents files
status timelines and tasks with ease and
quickly with many people then delegating
task easily you should be able to
delegate tasks assign roles and then
ensure they have access to the right
information
so that's all about tools now we'll move
to the next question so what do you
think is the difference between projects
programs and portfolio so this looks
like a very uh generic question which is
asked by any uh individuals during the
interview but even though this question
doesn't focus on Project in specific it
is very essential for project manager to
understand the difference between these
three so that hope to ask for what will
be known to the project manager so the
definition of project is like a
temporary Andover it's an activity that
is used to create a unique product
service or results we saw that we
understood already whereas program is a
collection of related projects which are
managed as group to achieve better
Effectiveness and efficiency so when
which you don't get when you manage a
project individually if you group it and
manage you can share resources you can
optimize the resources and cost you can
standardize that you can achieve through
program management so portfolio
management is again a group of projects
and programs which may be related
unrelated but strategic objective
accomplishing strategic objectives of
the organization is very essential so
all these projects and programs and
other related works are grouped together
with a common strategic objective
organization so the project manager
versus program manager versus portfolio
managers what do they do so project
manager expects change and implements
processes to manage and control the
project in terms of accomplishing the
project objective whereas program
manager expects changes from inside and
outside the program to provide strategic
benefits as I mentioned earlier like
standardization optimization so
portfolio manager monitors changes in
the overall context of the Strategic
plan of the organization is this
projects or programs or whatever we do
in this organization are they aligned to
strategic objectives are they helping to
accomplish the Strategic objectives so
project managers manages and coordinate
the team to ensure access whereas
program manager manages the program
staff and the project manager providing
leadership and vision the portfolio
manager May coordinate or manage the
portfolio management staff
then monitoring part of it project
manager monitors and controls tasks to
produce the products results or Services
of the project whereas program manager
monitors the progress of components to
lead the program to success portfolio
manager manages the aggregated portfolio
performance and value indicators so
planning part of it project manager
develops monitors and controls project
plans throughout the Project Life Cycle
whereas program manager develops the
program plan and performs high level
planning to guide component level
planning whereas portfolio managers
perform plannings at a portfolio level
the scope the project manager will
develop Monitor and control throughout
the life cycle of the project whereas
program manager as a program which has a
wider scope aimed at meeting the
benefits and goals of the organization
whereas portfolio has a scope that
changes with change in the Strategic
plan and goals of the organization so
why the Strategic goals or plans would
change the directions would change that
has various different reasons maybe a
business scenario market conditions Etc
the success of the project is based on
time taken to finish the project the
budget within which it is completed the
scope the customer satisfaction the
quality defines the success whereas the
program success is measured in terms of
benefits it delivered as it expected
from a program then the portfolio
success is the aggregated performance of
all its components programs and projects
question number 12 what are the skills a
project manager must possess
typically a project manager would
require to have effective communication
skills so communication skills help in
terms of establishing better
relationship because it plays a vital
role there what do we communicate when
do we communicate how do we communicate
matters because it's not about just
verbal communication or return
communication there is non herbal
communication through body languages
through Expressions which individuals do
the communication so it is very
essential to have a right method and
right approach towards communication so
the project manager should possess that
skill code leadership skills so many
times the term leadership is confused
with the position of a leader no so
leadership is basically capability of an
individual so if you have specific
individual having that capability can
influence people can Inspire can
motivate project manager having a
leadership skills it's very essential it
is the most required skill only then
project manager can make the people
listen to him people will respect him
because the behavior will be guided
through that capability strong Team
Management skill which requires a an
engagement which requires a
communication and Leadership skills work
very closely with the steam management
skills so understanding the Team
Dynamics ensuring the right education
right skilled individuals are in place
and they are monitored and managed it is
very important so there should be a
little bit of mentoring which needs to
be done to the people regularly so that
team gets what is expected out of them
and they do accordingly then effective
negotiation skills a lot of scenarios
which comes in terms of negotiating in
various different scenarios negotiate to
ensure things are being in place or in
the interest of both the parties
involved in the negotiation it is very
important to involve and make a right
discussion right side of discussion so
that stakeholders are benefited now who
are these roles we are speaking about
who would involve in negotiation we can
think of customers while establishing an
agreement we can think of key teams
while having some conflict resolutions
which you take team will have a conflict
you may required to resolve so Supply is
related issues which needs to be
resolved so negotiation is very
important but always
negotiations would be in the interest of
both the involved parties then critical
thinking so critical thinking in the
sense not just seeing what is there it's
about how to set it right how to take it
forward in the right direction so what
could cause visualizing things is very
important risk management skills it's
quite obvious the most ignored area what
which I have seen throughout is risk
management so I don't know what is the
reason risk is ignored many of the
projects what I have seen almost like 80
to 85 percent people don't even look at
the risks so it is very essential to
look at the risk and manage the risk
only then project can become successful
so question 13 what will be involved in
Project scope management so we already
know project scope means it involves
both project scope as well as product
scope now scope management basically
ensures project includes all those
necessary things to be done in terms of
activities in terms of processes in
terms of resources that project
objectives can be accomplished so this
particular process project scope
management describes the project scope
on documents how it will be designed
validated and controlled throughout the
Project Life Cycle so it collects
requirement so collect requirement
process engages with stakeholders
discusses with them to understand what
is the requirement collect the
requirements document the requirements
and establish requirement management
plan then based on this requirement
established scope has to be defined
means the detailed description of the
project and product has to be developed
and a list has to be created that
includes all the requirements then
create getting the WBS work breakdown
structure once the scope is defined so
now the decomposition of that scope
definition what is given has to be taken
into the lowest possible level it has to
be like logically further it cannot be
subdivided right so decomposition
basically helps in terms of breaking
down those ultimate deliverable to
multiple lower level parts for example
if I consider a car I can think about
two broad categories like exteriors and
Interiors now in exteriors I can think
of a body of the car the rear view
mirror the wheel the Bonnet the glass so
I can just decompose like this now until
I decompose to the mirror further I
cannot decompose in the mirror what are
all the things we can think of mirror
cap mirror glass mirror Mount so further
can I subdivide this no so each of the
components involved in all the
perspective in the car perspective
broadly initially decomposed it to the
level interior exteriors and further
down the line we took to the next level
of components further down in the line
we gain decompose it now at the lowest
level we actually look at the effort
estimation activity resource required
all these we look at and we'll do bottom
up to consolidate to see what is the
scope so which will help us in becoming
scope Baseline so validate scope is a
process in monitoring and controlling
which involves reviewing the
deliverables with the customer or
sponsor to ensure successful completion
and formal acceptance of the
deliverables so formal acceptance is a
key requirement when we validate the
scope if it is not according to the plan
that is rejected and it is sent back for
Change and Nursery Corrections
then control scope so in this process
the status of the project and product
scope is monitored changes to the scope
Baseline which is actually defined as
part of the planning if anything is seen
in terms of deviation that needs to be
corrected the change request would be
raised then next question tell us about
some project management tools so some of
the most common and popular management
tools which have come across are listed
here like plutio Basecamp teamwork
projects Zoho projects Asana jira
software Trello I think details of this
you may required to go to individual
tool sections and then review those
better if you can able to create a
comparison seat always helps in terms of
understanding what is that features
function at each of this tool has so one
more tool which is not mentioned it is
Microsoft Project so which is also
another popular tool which is used and
similarly I can mention like Primavera
so each of this has its own advantages
disadvantages so you may require to list
out what you exactly want in terms of
when you take up a tool for project
management and what each of this tool
has if you can able to create a
comparison sheet that would help you in
terms of selecting the right tool for
your organization and projects question
number 15 what is the significance of
monitoring and controlling in the
Project Life Cycle so as we know
monitoring and controlling is a process
group so this involves tracking the
Project's performance alongside the
planned project management activities
this also focuses on comparing actual
and planned performance so we have
defined that in the planning so what
needs to be accomplished how it has to
be accomplished what templates are to be
used what needs to be delivered we have
defined it in planning so that needs to
be compared with actual thing what is
created and what is that how are we
doing this currently what it is done is
it complied with
assessing performance to determine any
corrective actions are identified their
status reported and appropriate
responses to risks are taken so ensuring
an accurate information base providing
information to support status reporting
measuring progress and forecasting
adding forecasts to update cost and
current schedule information making sure
approved changes are being implemented
upon successfully performing monitoring
and control the processes within
monitoring and controlling process group
so the possible outcomes would be like
the change request what performance
reports update to project management
plan and project documents maybe if
everything is okay well for example
validate scope which comes under this
process group so if when we validate if
everything is okay as per the plan then
it is accepted deliverable which will
move towards the closure if it is not
obviously it leads towards change
requests so question number 16 what's
the key difference in the roles of the
project and program manager so project
manager is basically focuses on projects
and its success of the project as we
know already whereas program manager
looks at all those projects which fall
under the program are managed together
and taken forward in the required
Direction so program manager plans
program level activities and the
schedule of projects so program managers
defines terms of reference for projects
it starts stops and monitor progress of
constituent projects manages program
level risks and issues they set up
policies and procedures for projects the
resolve conflicts they determine the
program standards similarly project
manager focuses on planning a Project
based on dependencies and interfaces
given by the project manager so Works
within the defined tar terms of
references given for the projects runs a
project reports to program manager
manage project risks and issues and
escalates them to program manager if
required if at all a project is part of
a program if it is not then that
escalation goes to sponsor so project
manager runs projects according to the
policies and procedures users resources
assigned to project manager and delivers
the products that satisfy the
requirements question number 17 what are
the types of risks involved in the
project so we know that one of the
knowledge areas in the project
management is risk management it is very
essential for us to identify assess and
analyze risk and have the risk response
plans so while doing it it is also very
important for us to understand
categorizing the risks depending on
where exactly what category this risk
falls into but depending on the impacts
for example some of the list which is
given common types of risk the risk
categories you can think of it may be
related to cost schedule performance
technology or technical strategic legal
Market risk risk related external
hazards and it goes on so these are the
minimum set of lists which we can think
of in any project the the kind of risk
are associated with which area so when I
say cost Associated risk it's all about
monetary related where we invest where
we actually monitor the budget in all
that budget incur that cost related to
that schedule in terms of doing it
faster doing it slower doing it as per
the plan so various different details
which are associated with the schedule
likewise each of these types what we
have mentioned will have a risk
accordingly associated with them so
question number 18 what is the
difference between the risk and a issue
in context of project management so when
we say risk is always we look at in the
future so it's an uncertainty of outcome
when we say we are looking at a future
it may be next moment in the future but
it is risk which is focused on the
future so risks may be positive or
negative any risk we identify may have
positive or negative impact whereas risk
response will be in accordance with the
risk response learning and this are
documented in Risk register so issue is
always the one which we have in front of
us to manage so it is focused on present
always negative it will have negative
impacts so response will be in
accordance to the issue workaround
provided and these are documented in the
issue register so next question question
number 19 how does project scheduling
help in Project execution project
scheduling makes sure there is a
sequence of how all the tasks will be
performed after the resources are
estimated and plan is made the schedule
plays a very important role because when
to do when it is planned it is very
essential to do accordingly so providing
the sequence what activity has to be
done in what sequence it's also very
important so this must be carried out
first and what should follow needs to be
clearly understood the optimized
scheduling of tasks provides the best
possible output with the allocated
resources and that has to be done within
the scheduled time within the deadline
question number 20 what do you
understand by quality control now
quality control refers to activities
needed to evaluate if the project meets
all the requirements with respect to the
scope of the project learning now when
we say a control we should think about
the output of a project the deliverable
it has a specifications so relating to
that specifications the features
functionalities what needs to be
delivered is it delivered accordingly so
project managers defines the standard
that the project must fulfill to be
successful quality control includes
validating the deliverables satisfying
the requirements of the stakeholders
identifying the cause of poor project
quality and taking necessary actions to
eliminate problems
all right question number 21 explain the
forming in Team Dynamics basically when
we say Team Dynamics it involves various
different stages like forming storming
norming performing and adjourning so
forming happens first now this happens
when the team first meets each other so
when they meet each other they get
introduced to each other and get to know
their backgrounds experience and areas
of expertise the team members discuss
about the project discuss the project
objectives and beginning to think their
role in the project they beginning to
understand they know what is this
project is all about so in detail what
is this project is all about will be
understood by them in storming which is
the next stage in the Team Dynamics
question number 22 so what is work
breakdown structure and how does it
affect the work estimates of tasks or
activities work breakdown structure is a
hierarchical replica of all the work in
the project for example if I take up a
specific object a specific products or
Services which we are bringing out as a
result for example if I take a car so
how will I visualize various different
parts of the car it's very difficult in
one go in in execution perspective in a
creation perspective we may require to
know every parts of it in detail so work
breakdown structure is established using
decomposition as a technique which means
for example if I take car as an example
car has a hole when you visualize
broadly I would classify that into
decompose it to the first level like
exteriors and Interiors after exteriors
I can further decompose the exterior
part of it similarly after Interiors I
will decompose it further in exteriors
what are the things I can think of like
exteriors in terms of glass in terms of
body in terms of tires in terms of wheel
Bonnet mirror rear mirror which is
outside so likewise I love various
different decompositions level that is a
second level of decomposition next third
level of decomposition I can go in each
of these parts what I said I can further
elaborate those if I take the rear view
mirror as an example so I can think
about mirror cap I can think about
mirror glass I can think about mirror
Mount so these are the various different
decomposed levels below mirror similarly
if I come to Interiors we can think
about Entertainment System you can think
about seeds we can think about AC
right so we can think about uh anything
is like dashboards now each of these
components further I can decompose so
the idea of decomposing is I am going to
understand what are the various product
parts are involved to make a bigger
product as a whole so once I
accomplished that I will have a details
at each of these levels and consolidate
upwards as shown in the picture here the
first level Task 1 task 2 task three
before I assign these tasks I will have
the product breakdown structure first
and from bottom level I start adding up
the activities effort estimation and
then I keep consolidating upwards
similarly I will put the cost components
to it I'll estimate the cost involved
the one which is required and then I go
upwards and consult it so WBS helps in
organizing the work in a manageable
sections so this would help in
establishing additional details which
would help in defining tasks helping in
estimation helps in when I say
estimation it is not just specific
estimation it's about cost estimate
Mission schedule estimation effort
estimation and then this will also help
us in terms of sequencing further so
what breakdown structure will also have
something called WBS dictionary which
gives a description of all the WBS
elements next question question number
23 what is meant by the term SPI now SPI
refers to schedule performance index so
schedule performance index is a measure
of schedule efficiency expressed as a
ratio of earned value to the plant value
so when I say earned value earned value
is the actual work which is completed
the value the budgeted value for the
actual work which is completed and
planned value is the budgeted value of
the work which is supposed to be
accomplished as per the plan now this
will help us in understanding how the
project is progressing in schedule
perspective if SPI is lesser than 1
means it is behind schedule SPI is more
than one it is head of schedule if Spa
is one it is as per the plan schedule is
as per the plan question number 24 what
is the significance of agile project
management so when we say agile the
terminology itself refers to Quick
Response flexible moving faster so while
we do Agile project management it is
very essential to look at the various
Dynamics around so it may be a quick
response what you need to give right so
predominantly agile methodologies are
today adopted in various types of
Industries So currently we see more and
more in it and software industry then
product development marketing campaigns
even in constructing companies some of
the reasons that encourage Industries to
take a bagel methodologies are high
product quality High customer
satisfaction reduced risk better and
faster Roi now let us look at the
question number 25 what is the
significance of agile project management
so the agile project management
Frameworks involves continuous planning
and testing so there are various
different Frameworks each of them having
their own unique qualities so it is very
essential for us to understand what are
those various different agile Frameworks
and how they are going to contribute to
become agile so the most popular agile
Frameworks some thoughts which actually
depicts and supports organization to
become agile or one of that is kanban
framework so kanban framework is used to
implement agile software development and
requires real-time communication so work
items are represented on a kanban board
allowing team members to see the state
of each work at any time so this means
on the board so work in progress work
which has to be done and who has to do
it all these details are captured in the
kanban board now very important Point
here is when these are captured is very
essential to understand it is a visual
board so when it is a visual board it's
quite obvious anyone who has actually
have a task against them they don't
hesitate they need to complete it it
forces them since it is visualized
system it works on their Consciousness
so it is also called as pool system so
because people pull the work from that
list whatever is given and then
accomplish it so this will also help in
tracking the progression of a project
how it is progressing so how the project
is progressing how the tasks are being
completed how quickly they are completed
so it is easily visible and that makes
things to more smoother and faster
so scrum framework so scrum framework
helps in dealing with complex problems
and making it possible to deliver high
quality products at the same time it
helps in managing complex advanced work
with little emphasis on software
development so it uses a terminologies
like Sprint product backlog Sprint
backlog daily scrum
retrospective meeting so three roles
predominantly we come across that is
product owner scrum master and then
self-organizing team
so next framework is hybrid framework
which you can think of so it is the
combination of agile methods with
non-agile methods hybrid can handle
requirement changes and it can deliver
products in stages so in hybrid model
planning is done using a waterfall
approach while the agile approach
handles execution and delivery so lean
framework so the lean framework works on
the concept of maximizing customer value
with fewer resources and zero waste
hence lean focuses on the flow of
products and services instead of
focusing on separate Technologies
companies can act upon with changing
customer needs and requirements so very
important points to observe here zero
waste means in the flow the way the
processes are connected to each other in
that flow we should identify what are
those which acts as a bottlenecks
resulting in waste so we should
eliminate such bottlenecks so these
elimination of bottlenecks helps in
reduction of waste at the same time
increasing the value to the customers so
in the downstream from the point where
bottleneck you have the entire capacity
will get limited to the downstream
capacity I'm speaking about will get
limited to the bottleneck where that
particular issue exists right that needs
to be resolved elimination of way should
happen so waste is a result of anything
which is an non-valuating activity right
so we need to identify as per the lean
perspective so the defects are not
allowed to move forward to the
downstream that is the whole idea behind
it so next question 26 why does a
project manager need to be proactive
okay so we always have this question
coming around proactiveness versus
reactiveness when should we be proactive
when should we be reactive that we need
to understand now more proactive in
nature the project manager or any
manager who is more proactive will
basically visualize the future so they
act today so that tomorrow something
negative impact will not happen so a
proactive project manager is actively
able to determine the several
communication needs of the stakeholders
so a proactive project manager is able
to identify the risks in the early stage
of the project it is very essential so
what is that going to happen in future
that needs to be visualized act today so
that that occurrences can be handled
better or eliminated question number 27
what does a critical path method imply
so firstly let us understand what is
critical path means so critical path is
basically a longest path in a given
project Network diagram so that would be
the minimum time required for a project
to complete so any delay in any of the
activities or tasks in critical path
delays the project duration so in
critical path method so it is a crucial
tool for determining the progress of the
project to ensure that project is on
schedule so as I mentioned any delay in
any of the activities or tasks in the
critical path delays the project itself
so monitoring on these activities in a
critical path will become more important
so that project can happen as per the
Lan as per the date what is given so
critical path method helps in
determining the essential or critical
path by finding out the longest stretch
of dependent tasks so that each
dependencies each flow from left to
right from beginning to end as to a
visual placed and monitored very closely
so that project finished it is not
delayed it happens according to the plan
so next question defined planned value
actual cost and earned value so when we
say planned value planned value is the
approved value of the work that needs to
be completed within a given period it
serves as a Baseline and needs to be
calculated before work can be started it
is also known as budgeted cost of work
schedule so formula to calculate planned
values planned percentage of work
completed into project budget assume
your project budget is 10 000 whatsoever
the currencies let us assume 10 000 is
my project budget so my project duration
is five months each month I have a plan
to complete the work worth of 2000 so
which means that 2000 is my planned
value the work which is supposed to be
accomplished within the end of that
first month is work worth of 2000 so if
I do the work which is lesser than work
worth of maybe lesser than 2000 I am
behind schedule if I complete the work
worth more than 2000 then I'm ahead of
schedule so planned value will become
that reference the 2000 what I mentioned
as a planned value the work worth of
2000 I'm supposed to complete before the
end of the month one if I say any work
which is completed according to the
budgeted value I will make this land
value as a reference to decide whether I
am behind schedule or ahead of schedule
actual cost actual cost refer to the
value of total expenses that you have
incurred for the work done till date for
example in the previous discussion
relating to the plant value at the end
of month one the planned value was 2000
so that is the work worth which we're
supposed to complete now let us assume
that we have completed the work where
the work worth relating to that actual
work completed is around 1800 means I'm
behind schedule for sure but at the same
time to come complete the work worth of
1800 how much I incurred actually so if
I have incurred actual cost also 1800
then cost twice I'm according to the
plan but behind schedule because I have
only completed the work worth of 1800
against the work worth of 2000 which is
a planned value and behind schedule but
to complete it the actual cost I
incurred is eighteen hundred so cost
wise I'm according to the plan if my
actual cost is lesser than 1800 then I'm
doing very good in cost perspective if
my actual cost is more than 1800 then I
am using more money means over budget so
actual cost helps us in relating to
plant value defined whether cost wise
how am I doing so it is also known as
actual cost of work performed so this
will be used to calculate cost variance
and cost performance index earned value
earned value represents the value
produced by a project it is also known
as budgeted cost of work performed in
our example the earned value is 1800.
meaning I have completed the work worth
of 1800 that is the earned value which
says behind schedule when I compare
earned value with the planned value it
it will tell me whether I'm behind
schedule ahead of schedule or according
to the plan now for this earned value of
1800 if I anchor the actual cost of 1800
then cost wise I'm doing good if my
actual cost is lesser than earned value
then cost wise I'm very good right if I
incurred more than earned value for
example to complete the work worth of
1800 I incur the cost of 2000 then I'm
not doing good I'm over budget so the
combination of earned value and planned
value helps us to know the scheduled
perspective whether project is behind or
ahead or according to the plan schedule
perspective whereas the combination of
earned value and actual cost helps us to
understand whether project is within the
budget over budget or according to the
plan question number 29. what is the
purpose of procurement management plan
the procurement management plan defines
the procurement requirements and how it
can be managed from developing a
procurement documentation through to
contract closure the plan identifies and
defines the items that need to be
procured the contracts that need to be
used for supporting the project how the
contract is approved and criteria for
decisions to be made as to be looked at
the plan also includes other items
including considerations for procurement
risks and procurement risk management
deciding how Cost needs to be determined
standard procurement documentation usage
and constraints to procurement
question number 30 when is postmortem
analysis performed in the project
management a postmortem in a project or
project retrospective refers to process
that's performed at the conclusion of
the phase for a multi-stage project this
aim to help identify process
improvements that can prevent future
risks and to ensure best practices are
repeated
postmortems involve a combination of
quantitative and qualitative data it
also includes qualitative data like end
user stakeholder and team satisfaction
potential for reuse and the quality of
end deliverable that is perceived
question number 31 what is the purpose
of risk register risk register is
basically a tool that is used to
document risks and the actions to handle
each of those risks the management of
risk is an ongoing process that has the
project team raising risks with the risk
manager or a project manager who then
locks the risks and determines an
appropriate course of action to handle
the risk risk register also needs to be
reviewed regularly to ensure the
appropriate actions are performed it
could be reviewed in every project team
meeting or at the end of each phase of
the Project Life Cycle question number
32 when do we use a gun chart so as we
are discussing about critical paths
Network diagram critical path method so
by using a project tools we first
establish a Gantt chart so Gantt chart
is basically a visual view of tasks
scheduled over a period a Gantt chart is
useful for outlining all the tasks
involved in the project along with their
order shown against the time scales so
since it gives the pictorial
representation it helps us in
understanding what tasks will be
completed after which tasks and how the
dependencies of each task will be can be
easily understood it provides an
overview of a project its Associated
tasks and then when they need to be
finished or clearly understood a Gantt
chart is helpful because it provides a
detailed view of all tasks and in shorts
one can create a workable schedule and
the right people are assigned to right
task it can be used to determine the
Practical aspect of the project it
enables to keep the team and sponsors
informed about the progress of the
project
question number 33 what is the
significance of the critical path method
so critical path method or CPM is a tool
that is used to schedule project
activities so CPM is used to create a
model that includes tasks required to
complete the project dependencies
between the tasks the durations required
to complete an activity the critical
path is the longest path in all the
available Parts in the project and the
duration of the critical path will be
the minimum time required by the project
to complete it question number 34 what
are some tools required for arriving at
Improvement in processes so process
Improvement comprises a set of actions
implemented by a company to enhance
performance cost reduction increasing
profits Etc so some of the tools some
organization can use to implement a
successful process Improvement strategy
can be comparing and baselining a
project so with this we can get an
overview of how the process is
performing in comparison with other
similar processes flowcharting which
helps them segregating the processes
activities events Etc value stream
mapping it helps clearly understand the
workflow and helps organizations
identify waste cause and effect analysis
these help organizations determine the
root cause of any problem hypothesis
testing which helps in testing to
determine whether a hypothesis would be
favorable to the organization or not
question 35 how do you work with three
point estimation method so the three
point estimation method is also called
as per decimation which is a tool that
can be used to help increase the
accuracy of cost and time estimates
there are three parts with the different
estimates that is optimistic pessimistic
and most likely the optimistic estimate
is the amount of time required to
complete the project assuming everything
in the project goes according to the
plan pessimistic estimation is the
estimation considering the worst case
scenario and is an estimation given in
everything goes wrong that is the
Assumption so most likely estimation so
this is most likely to happen and falls
under the pessimistic and optimistic
estimates it falls in between that
pessimistic and optimistic so the
formula to calculate three point
estimate would be pessimistic plus
optimistic plus 4 most likely divided by
6 will provide the three point
estimation
what do you understand by the term raid
red log is a project management tool
that tracks risks actions issues and
decisions it provides a simple way to
organize the information so the main
advantages of raid log is to enable you
to think in organized and strategy quick
The Raid log has all the questions that
could be asked by stakeholders the data
is easily accessible and acts as a
measure for how well the plans are being
carried out the raid locks makes the
process of decision making more
consistent it provides a place where all
decisions made can be compared question
number 37 what are some techniques used
for defining scope so here are some
tools and techniques to Define scope
that is expert judgment it which
requires to bring in experts on domain
product analysis which needs to break
down the final deliverable into smaller
components to ensure all the steps are
being taken alternative generation so in
our alternative generation its need to
brainstorm for the best and most
effective way to create it for the
product facilitated workshops which
allow different people with different
ideas to find common ground for a
project question number 38 what is
waterfall model waterfall model is a
project management approach in which a
project is completed in several phases a
big plan is executed linearly expecting
there would not be any changes in the
plan waterfall model is in contrast to
jail model does not respond well to
frequent changes any changes which comes
in between while following the waterfall
methodologies making that changes will
be difficult and bit complex
question 39 and what basis would you
decide if a particular risk should be
avoided or mitigated the risks which are
having high impact negative to the
business are awarded by the
organizations usually so awarding is the
first decision what organization makes
for sure but however there may be some
discussions which are made before the
decision of being made relating to
avoiding that risk instead having some
work around for that risk or making
certain arrangements so that impact of
the risk can be reduced or bringing down
the probability of occurrence of the
risks considering something which will
have higher negative impact they may not
be worthwhile to take up so in that case
I think awarding is the best decision
once the organizations consider to take
up after identifying and analyzing the
risks then organization would work on
risk response plan for all the risks
which are identified
so what is evm the earned value
management so earned value management is
a project management technique that is
used to measure the project progress if
you recall the terminologies like earned
value planned value actual cost
scheduled performance index cost
performance index these are the
terminologies which comes as part of and
value management it calculates the
project performance and progress by
combining constraints like time scope
and costs so question 41 what is the
difference in product life cycle and
Project Life Cycle so Project Life Cycle
refers to the sequence of stages or
phases the project undergoes from the
time it is initiated till it is closed
so this project life cycle involves five
process groups which is initiating
process group learning process group
executing process group monitoring and
controlling process group closure
process Group which should be there
throughout the Project Life Cycle along
with the 10 knowledge areas and 49
processes product lifecycle includes all
that phases that Define the growth of a
product so creation of the product till
expiry of the product So within a
product life cycle we may have multiple
project life cycles so one Project Life
Cycle for introduction of product one
Project Life Cycle for modifying or
updating the existing product one
project lifecycle may be for improvement
one Project Life Cycle may be for
removing the product from the production
so in product lifecycle there are four
phases that is Market introduction
market growth Market maturity and
Decline and saturation stage
question 42 Define capability maturity
model so capability maturity model is an
approach to improve or refine
development process in an organization
so it is an elaborator structure of
elements that helps in defining the
features of an effective process next
question 43 what do you know about
triple constraint the triangle in
project management so basically the
triple constraint refers to scope
schedule and cost right so it helps in
actually analyzing the project status
the way a project is progressing and
these are the three critical
considerations mainly which needs to be
made so further to these triple
constraints scope time and cost quality
resource and risks are also considered
as a constraints so any change in any of
the constraints would have an impact on
other constraints question 44 what is a
decision support system decision support
system is an information system used in
decision making activities in an
organization or a business it analyzes
data sets and extracts information that
may be used to solve complex problems
and take decisions how many types of DSs
are there so there are several types of
DSs that is data driven model driven
knowledge driven and document driven
question 46 what are some general
metrics that are used to calculate if a
project is progressing on track so if a
project is progressing on track it is
very essential to consider the
productivity which means units of input
units of output actual cost that is
total cost per time period to time
period cost variance which refers to
budgeted cost of work versus actual cost
of work schedule variance which is the
difference between budgeted cost of work
perform and budget cost of work
scheduled cost performance index which
is earned value to actual Cost question
47 1 what is meant by a milestone in a
project a project Milestone provides a
way to observe measure and monitor the
performance progress of the project
these represents intermediate stages
that needs to be fulfilled before
getting to the final objective or goal
Milestones can provide a basis on which
progress can be monitored they can also
proof for explanation while reporting on
project status it can be used to provide
course Corrections and learning
experiences it can also be used to
maintain accountability and motivate
staff question 48 how can you estimate
the activity time of a project the
activity time or duration refers to the
process of evaluating the number of work
periods required to finish individual
activities with the resources available
these help achieve the project
objectives on set dates and delivery
schedules decided by project management
team and key stakeholders here are some
tools and Tech to calculate activity
durations so those are expert judgment
analogous estimation part method three
point estimates parametric estimating
alternative analysis published
estimating data vendor bid analysis Etc
question 49 what do you think about CSF
critical success factor in a project
management so CSF or critical success
factor are found in the project
management plan and can Define what can
be defined as success for the project
some characteristics of critical success
factor involved for example time was the
project completed within the given time
period cost did it stay within the
budgeted cost quality did it meet the
specification level stakeholder was the
result accepted by the end user project
changes where scope changes are minimal
and are agreed upon performing
organization did it affect the corporate
culture commitment is required from team
members clients top management and all
stakeholders which is very essential and
it is one of the main critical success
factors goals must be specific
measurable attainable relevant and
time-bound there must be process for
quick identification resolution of
conflict good project leadership is to
be established risk management policies
have to be established there must be
proper project planning that needs to be
done then best practices need to be
applied at all stages proper
Communications might takes place to
ensure information is passed across
question number 50 what do you
understand by the term sow so sow or
statement of work is a document that
includes and defines each aspects of the
project it is a foundation for the
project plan so before planning and
executing the sow lays down the entire
landscape of the project so it consists
of introduction the purpose of the
project the scope of the project when it
is done where it is done the tasks
Milestones deliverables schedule
standards success how are you going to
determine the success means how do you
know the project is Success what is that
you are going to measure or consider for
measurement requirements than any other
things which needs to be considered as
part of sow as part of that specific
project and then closing so srw can be
of three categories which will have
design details level of effort time and
materials which defines an hourly
service and the materials required to
perform the tasks which may be
Performance Based focuses on purpose of
the project resources and quality
expected from the output question 51
what is a fishbone diagram and when is
it used so fishbone diagram which is
also called as Ishikawa diagram is a
visualization tool that used to
categorize potential causes that is
problems for an issue to identify the
root causes so fishbone diagram is used
in product development and
troubleshooting processes it helps in
team brainstorming for potential causes
and then represents them in a diagram
based on their degree of importance so
when this diagram is used it helps us in
identifying the possible causes of an
issue to develop a product that can
address issue with current market
offerings to several areas of weakness
or bottlenecks in the business process
to handle recurring issues or employees
burnout to ensure any correction will
resolve the issue so question 52 what is
the Pareto Principle or 80 20 principle
so as the name itself indicates the
Pareto Principle states that 80 percent
of consequences come from 20 percent of
causes indicating an unequal
relationship between inputs and outputs
it can be applied to range of areas like
manufacturing management and Human
Resources it is usually focused on
businesses that are claim based some of
the advantages of parital principles are
increased productivity increased
profitability identifying and fixing
problems and improved customer service
question 53 can you tell us about your
past project so now while answering
these type of questions firstly we need
to understand this question is open and
generic in nature so while answering
such questions following points has to
be considered so identify what is that
project you have done so State the
objective of the project project
deliverables your roles and
responsibility in the project and what
have you achieved in that project what
was accomplished what went well what did
not go well then project duration
project budget and actual cost incurred
in the project question 54 if customer
is not happy with the project what will
you do as a project manager so in any
given project customer satisfaction is
very important to ensure success of a
project in the scenario where customer
expresses their dissatisfaction one has
to ensure understanding the reason for
dissatisfaction so all the requirement
fulfilled or not project manager has to
confirm that first was customer involved
in all decision making activities Etc to
confirm that his customer is informed
about everything so before customer is
dissatisfied it is always good and
important that customer is satisfied
that needs to be insured so it is very
important to be customer to understand
and customers pulse is understood and
handling the customers accordingly so
allowing customer to become a
dissatisfied customer is not a choice to
have so one needs to ensure customer is
not at all dissatisfied in the first
place beyond your control if customer is
still dissatisfied better you work on it
to understand why the customer is
dissatisfied what is the cause of it and
address it question 55 what are the
different kinds of project you have
worked upon so these type of questions
are again generic in nature while
answering those questions please ensure
you speak about various different
domains of the project which you have
and that's the variation in different
say different domains of the project
what were the deliverables of those
projects projects nature and complexity
unique challenges in each different type
of projects then project duration budget
and actual cost
question 56 did you ever face the
situations where the project team was
demotivated and what did you do to bring
them back on track so as we know project
team plays very important role in
success of any project it is very
critical to keep them motivated the
demotivation may happen for various
reasons so one is to keep the following
points in mind while dealing with the
team that is team engagement so
engagement may be both formal and
informal so rewards and recognitions for
the team for the good job they have done
Conflict Management wherever the
conflict occurs it is quite obvious
whenever the team is involved conflict
occurs performance evaluation and
monitoring mentoring is very key so
wherever it is required to Mentor
wherever it is required to give them a
good perspective of the project and
their learning and capability so
mentoring and coaching is very essential
and also providing opportunities for
Education and Training so that they will
have a better learning and accomplish or
acquire the required right skills
question 57 if you get your dream job
and I assume this is your dream job what
value you think you will be adding to
the organization so this question is
very tricky one and also a generic
question so one is to ensure while
answering this question to discuss the
following points why the job is your
dream job whatever the job you're
speaking about why do you say that that
is your dream job what is the reason why
what would be your motivation point in
this dream job what exactly is
motivating you there in this particular
job how this dream job can link to
objectives of organization and the
profession and road map of the job rule
so what is that you are going to become
while you become this in future what
could be the roadmap of this role
question 58 what challenges have you
encountered while dealing with other
team members as already mentioned
project team plays very important role
in success of a project each team member
comes with the different skills maturity
mindsets and background which put across
many challenges some of the important
changing scenarios means challenging
scenarios is team not collaborating
individuals performance and motivation
levels in each of the projects role
preferences and the allocated roles
performance appraisals communication
gaps various things which actually
brings the challenges and also motivates
people to behave certain way they are
behaving question 59 share from your
experience the challenges you faced
while using project management tools so
we all know that tool spray is very
important role in our management
activity similarly the effective
management of project requires an
efficient tool every tools has its own
uniqueness and has its own advantages
and disadvantages so some of the
challenges one would face while using
the tools would be selection of right
tools for the given project tools
features and functionality is
customization of tools the dashboards
and reports teams ability to work with
tool their skills and capabilities
matters question 60 can you tell me
about the most difficult complex project
you have worked on this question is open
and generic in nature again while
answering such questions please ensure
to discuss the following points what was
the complexity in the project whichever
the project reference you are taking why
do you consider that project as a
complex or difficult what was the size
of the project in terms of deliverables
budget geography Team Tools and
techniques Etc was the project
successful or not and why question 61
when do you know the project is off
track so it is very essential for every
project manager to ensure project is
going as per the plan so there should
not be any deviations from the actual
plan so every project will have a set
plans based on which project have to be
completed successfully due to various
different scenarios project go off track
recognizing and correcting those is very
critical and crucial so one needs to
follow a specific approach to ensure
project will not go off track so but we
need to understand whether project is
going off track or not so one of the key
thing which we need to know is SPI and
CPI so SPI is the scheduled performance
index the CPI the cost performance index
so when SPI is lesser than 1 which means
project is behind schedule when a space
one then it's as per the schedule if a
space is greater than 1 which means
project is Aid of schedule similarly for
CPI if CPI is lesser than one project is
over widget CPI is more than one project
is under budget a cpay is one project
budget is as per the plan so similarly
the results of audits and testing done
as part of quality management also
reveals the details related to
compliance and of specifications which
needs to be corrected if they are not
expected
next question have you manage remote
teams and Outsource resources so these
questions come from the scenario where
you have to manage the team not
reporting to you directly and they are
managed by different individuals while
having such resources the Dynamics will
be different so while managing such
resources one has to ensure the engaging
with them is different than the way the
individuals are engaged the internal
teams so it is required to engage with
that team more often the performance of
the team members has to be well known to
the reporting management and that needs
to be communicated regularly the next
question if you could go to the past and
do one thing differently as a project
manager what would you do and why so
every project manager who has managed
several projects earlier will think of
doing better which they have done
already so this is because of the
experience they had while doing the
project and the insights there today
compared to the day they did that
project so while answering this question
following points has to be kept in mind
what went well and what did not go well
why do you think they happened and what
would have been the better solution why
do you think it could have been done
better why did you not do it earlier the
way you're thinking the right way of
doing it today so what was the course
were you not informed about it or there
was some Force which was working on you
to take it in that way what made you to
do that so why are you thinking that
this is this the better way to do it
what are the reasons that you need to
mention so next question as a project
manager what is the most common
challenge that you face so obviously
when we say take up a project as a
project manager every project manager
will come across various different
challenges every project will have
various challenges to deal with project
managers has to prepare themselves to
handle those they should not shy away
from those so typical challenges which
project manager would come across would
be the scope perspective not clearly
defined so not having proper sign off
between customer and project
organization then the deadline dates or
schedules which are given are not
realistic low budget are located low
cost allocated capabilities and skills
of the team then project environment
Etc
