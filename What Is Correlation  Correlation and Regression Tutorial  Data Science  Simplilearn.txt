hello everyone
welcome to Simply learns YouTube channel
in this session
we will discuss a very widely used term
in statistics that is correlation and we
will see what is the significance of
correlation and where it is used so
let's discuss the agenda for today's
session
we'll start this tutorial by
understanding what is correlation
then we'll move on to discuss the two
types of correlation
and correlation coefficient after that
we'll see the limitations of correlation
and some real life applications of
correlation
so let's get started
what is correlation
correlation refers to a statistical
relationship between the two entities
it measures the extent to which the two
variables are linearly related
for example the price and demand of a
product is in correlation they are
linearly related
the value of correlation always lies
between minus one two plus one
there are mainly two types of
correlation the first one is positive
correlation
a positive correlation means that the
linear relationship is positive
and the two variables increases or
decreases in the same direction
the number of trees cut down and the
probability of erosion are in
correlation when one increases other
also increases and vice versa
negative correlation
a negative correlation is just the
opposite the relationship line has a
negative slope and the variables change
in opposite directions
for example if you decrease the speed of
the car the time taken to reach the
destination increases this is a negative
correlation
correlation coefficient
the correlation coefficient which is
denoted by R gives us a measure of the
strength of the linear relationship
between the two variables
the values denoted by the letter R and
it ranges from minus 1 to plus one
if it is less than 0 it implies that
there is a negative correlation the
minus 1 indicates there is a strong
negative correlation between the
variables
if R is greater than 0 it implies there
is a positive correlation and plus one
is the strongest point of a positive
correlation
when R is equal to 0 we can say that
there is no correlation between the
variables
there are also some limitations of
correlation
the first one is correlation does not
give you every Insight on the data mean
and standard deviation are still the
important parameters to get the Insight
of a data
the second one is the data will not
produce a straight line every time and
it will be difficult to predict the
value of R just with the straight line
or the slope of the graph
now let's see some real life
applications of correlation
if you take any e-commerce company whose
website is accessed by millions of users
all over the world the company can look
at all the data and they can measure how
much time was spent by the customer and
the respective money spent by the
customer
we can also predict the unique users
that visited the website and how it
affected the sales in a day
the third application can be the patient
blood pressure and the medication used
the level of patient blood pressure and
the effect of medication on it can be in
a correlation now let's jump on to excel
workbook to see how you can calculate
the correlation coefficient
so here we are on Excel workbook if you
see we have the temperature in degree
celsius such as 20 25 30 40 50 and 60
and the corresponding sales of ice cream
in the units to calculate the
correlation we'll use the Corel function
now we have array 1 and array 2 so we'll
select the array one that is temperature
in degree celsius and the array 2 will
be our sales of ice cream
so you can see there is a very strong
correlation between the temperature of a
day and the sales of ice cream unit
if the temperature increases the sales
of ice cream unit increases and if the
temperature decreases the sales of ice
cream and it decreases there are many
three categories of correlation
the first one is positive correlation
and negative correlation
the second one is linear and non-linear
correlation
and the third one is simple multiple and
partial correlation
let's discuss each of them one by one
positive correlation
a positive correlation means that a
linear relationship is positive and the
two variables increases or decreases in
the same direction as you can see from
the graph
for example
the calories you burn is directly
proportional to the amount of time you
run on a treadmill on the other hand a
negative correlation is just the
opposite
the relationship line has a negative
slope and the variable changes in the
opposite direction that is one variable
decreases while the other increases
an example can be a student who has many
absence has a decrease in grades now
let's move on to discuss linear and
non-linear correlation
when we change the value of a variable
which leads to a constant ratio change
in other variable then that relation is
said to be linear
for example
the factory doubles its output by
doubling the number of workers on the
other hand correlation is said to be
non-linear when the amount of change in
one variable is not in constant ratio to
the change in the other variable
for example
the change in radius of the sphere and
the change in volume of the sales sphere
does not happen to be in the same ratio
now let's discuss simple multiple and
partial correlation when studying the
relationship between the variables well
only two variables are involved the
correlation is said to be simple
in the multiple correlation we measure
the degree of association between one
variable on the one side and all the
variables together on the other side
and for the partial correlation we study
the relationship of one variable with
one of the other variables presuming
that all the variables remains constant
now that we know all the types of
correlation
let's discuss the two major types to
calculate the correlation coefficient
the first one is PSS correlation PSS
correlation coefficient is the test
statistics that measures the statistical
relationship between the two continuous
variables the PSS coercion coefficient
is often denoted by R and the formula to
calculate the Pearson's relation
coefficient is Sigma x i minus X bar
into y i minus y bar divided by under
root Sigma x i minus X bar whole square
and y i minus y bar whole Square
but R is the coefficient of correlation
XY is the mean of X variable and Y Bar
is the mean of Y variable and x i and y
y denotes the samples of variable X and
Y respectively
the PSS coefficient coefficient is the
best method to measure the association
between two variables
of interest because it gives information
about the magnitude of the association
or correlation shape as well as the
direction of the relationship between
the two variables
the second best method is PS1 rank
correlation
this Pearson Ram correlation is used to
discover the strength of a link between
the two sets of data
the formula to calculate this prison
rank correlation coefficient is rho is
equal to 1 minus 6 Sigma d i whole
Square divided by n bracket n Square
minus 1. where rho is this P has been
rank correlation coefficient d i has a
difference between the two ranks of each
observations what is regression
regression analysis like most
multivariate statistics allows you to
infer that there is a relationship
between two or more variables
these relationships are seldom exact
because there's a variation caused by
many variables not just the variables
being studied
in regression analysis there are two
types of variable one is dependent
variable and other is the independent
variable
let's discuss what the boot variable
represents a dependent variable is a
variable whose values influenced or to
be predicted the dependent variable is
often denoted by Y and is also known as
a predicted variable
whereas independent variable which is
denoted by X is a variable which
influences the value or is used for
prediction
the independent variable is also known
as a predictive variable the line of
regression the regression line is a line
which is used to describe the behavior
of a set of data in other words it gives
the best trend of the given data
regression lines are useful in
forecasting procedures its purpose is to
describe their interrelationship between
the dependent variable and independent
variable
the regression equation of Y and X
describes a change in the value of y for
given changes in the value of x and vice
versa
in the regression line equation X and Y
are the variables of interest in our
data with Y the unknown or dependent
variable and X the known or the
independent variable
let's discuss the two key terms in this
graph the first one is slope slope is
the ratio of the vertical and horizontal
distances between the two points on a
line
and you can see y-intercept which is the
coordinate of the point at which the
curve intersects an axis
there are some assumptions we take to
create the regression model the first
one is the dependent variable is assumed
to be normally distributed
the values of the dependent variable are
statistically independent
this means that when we select the
sample of a particular X it does not
depend on any other value of y
and the third one is error values are
statistically independent
now let's discuss a simple regression
model
a simple regression model is used to
depict a relationship between variables
which are proportional to each other
meaning the dependent variable increases
decreases with the independent variable
the equation of a simple regression
model is y is equal to B naught plus b
One X Plus e
where Y is dependent variable X is
independent variable B naught and B1
represents y-intercept and the slope of
the line respectively and E is the error
variable
now let's move on to excel to calculate
the regression coefficient of a given
data
VR on our Excel workbook
in front of us we have the data of
temperature of the day and sales of the
ice cream on that day
let's try to understand this regression
analysis and summary output using this
data
so the first step is to
go to the data Tab and select data
analysis
then select regression and click ok
we'll get this table select the Y range
as the ice cream sales
this y range is predictable variable
also called as dependent variable
for the input X range
we'll select the temperature in degree
Celsius
this is the explanatory variable also
called as the independent variable
one thing you should keep in mind
is that both the X and Y column must be
adjacent to each other
we have the label so we'll check the
label and we'll select the output range
from G5
check the residuals and click ok
Excel produces the following output
let's analyze some key data
we got the asker value to be 0.9676
which is very good this shows that a 96
percent of the variation in ice cream
sales is explained by the temperature of
the day
closer to the one the better the
regression line fits the data
now let's move little more and analyze
this coefficient
if you look at the coefficient you will
get the equation of the regression line
in our case it is minus
176.33 plus 27.68 into temperature of
the day
substituting the temperature of the day
for any given day we can find the sales
of the ice cream
with our discussion we can conclude that
there is a big difference between the
correlation and regression although
these are studied together
correlation is used to study whether the
variables under study are correlated
whereas
regression is used to establish the
functional relationship between the two
variables
the equation of the regression line is a
form Y is equal to f x plus c
correlation is used to stabulate the
strength of the association between the
two variables that are being studied
whereas regression is used to make the
future predictions on the any given
event
monotonic function
the term monotonic relationship is a
statistical definition that is used to
describe a scenario in which the size of
one variable increases as the other
variable also increases or where the
size of one variable increases as the
other variable also decreases
the rate at which an increase or
decrease occurs does not necessarily
have to be the same for both the
variables that is to say that a
monotonic relationship can be a linear
relationship such that it increases or
decreases for both the variables
now let's discuss three types of
monotonic function
monotonically increasing in this
function as the variable X increases the
variable y never decreases as seen in
the graph
monotonically decreasing function here
as a variable X increases the variable y
number increases
and the last one is non-monotonic as the
variable X increases the Y variable
sometimes decrease or sometime increases
now we'll discuss previous rank
correlation
this placement rank correlation is
calculated to check the agreement on the
ranking of the results between the two
groups
without the consideration of normality
or equal variance of data the spearm and
rank correlation coefficient focuses on
the differences in the rank orders of
data rather than the differences in the
means
the formula to calculate the rank
coefficient is shown here where rho is
this placement rank correlation
coefficient d i is the difference
between the two ranks of each
observations and N is the number of
observations
the value of the coefficient will always
be in the range of plus 1 to minus 1
where the Plus One will show the perfect
Association of the rank and a minus in
will show the negative association of
the rank if the value comes out to be 0
it means that there is no association
between the ranks
now let's move on to an example to
understand this concept better
consider the height and weight of the
sample of 5 students as shown here
the first step would be to rank the data
in the descending order the highest one
will get a rank of 1 and the lowest Mark
will get a rank of 5.
now we'll calculate difference between
the ranks as you can see the student a
has a difference of minus 2 which is
calculated by subtracting 5 from 3.
similarly you can calculate the value of
all the D and then Square the D value to
obtain the positive value of the
differences
the 16 here is the sum of the value of
the D Square
now that we have all the required value
we'll substitute the values in this
formula where rho is equal to 1 minus 6
Sigma d i Square divided by n n Square
minus 1. where d i is the summation of D
Square value
and N is the number of observation
so substituting this value
we'll get the value
to be 0.2 which shows that there is no
association between the ranks
using the same formula you can calculate
the association between the ranks of the
any given data
