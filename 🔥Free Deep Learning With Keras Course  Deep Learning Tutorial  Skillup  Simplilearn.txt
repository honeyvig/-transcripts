hey everyone we all are aware of the
fact that deep learning is a type of
machine learning that trains computers
to accomplish things that humans do
instinctively for example deep learning
is a critical component of self-driving
automobiles allowing them to detect a
stop sign or discriminate between a
pedestrian and a lamppost it enabled
voice control in consumers electronics
such as phones tablets televisions and
hand-free speakers
so considering its popularity and demand
to learn basic technology we have
brought you deep learning with kerala
skill of course keras is a deep learning
api developed by google for implementing
neutral networks deployment and
evaluation of your detailing model
many commercial companies like netflix
uber square yelp etc have deployed their
products we would get us this skill of
course will help you enhance your
knowledge of deep learning and its
working principles and models
so now you must be wondering what is the
skill of course about so let me give you
an overview of what you are going to
explore in this course first you will
come across the basics of tensorflow
which allows creating data flow graphs
to build your model then it will cover
the implementation of neural networks
and then will finally move towards
working with sequential models
and all of this for free
yes you heard it right it's free of cost
by the end of this course you'll know
how to use keras to evaluate and
optimize neural networks as well as how
to pre-process your data now if you're
wondering about the eligibility or
prerequisites let me tell you there are
none
this course is designed to cater to
beginners the course basically comprises
of four hours of self-paced video
