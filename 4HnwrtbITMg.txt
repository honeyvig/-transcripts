1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,359
hi there t back for another SQL Server

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,519
2012 tutorial so here we are um as I

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,719
said in the last video we're doing

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,240
insert into now um we're starting to get

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,719
a little bit more advanced into the SQL

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,039
Server commands not just there yet

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
though so um let's say you had this

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,720
table in your

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,960
database sorry

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,280
and there's nothing in

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,039
it and you wanted to add let's say a few

12
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,960
rows

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,160
now uh let's say you had some example

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
information it's not very simple

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,920
actually what you can do is insert

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
into and then the table name so mine

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,480
would be test table

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,399
then what you're going to do is if you

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,600
just uh want to um insert into all these

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,640
rows just go

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,080
values and then start typing in what the

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,360
values are one by one so my ID let's say

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,759
um

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,880
13 or just

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,840
three fet first name

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,479
t last name

27
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,920
actuallyy um

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,280
email

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
gmail.com there we

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,240
are so we just made this little sample

31
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,079
and it said one row is affected now

32
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,880
let's select sorry U select star from

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,840
test

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,960
table let's execute

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,759
this what if

36
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,200
um now what if you just wanted to enter

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,319
let's say first name last name then the

38
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,400
ID and email you can update if you

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,160
didn't see my update command video

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
please surely do uh the link will be in

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,879
the description as a reference to that

42
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,720
command what you do then is you don't

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,760
just not put this in and then not put

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,599
this in what will happen then is it'll

45
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,800
think this will be the first one this is

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,440
uh uh first name and then it just

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,159
glitches very badly what you do then is

48
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,480
you'd specifically

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,800
say okay I'm just going to copy this uh

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,760
to save some

51
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,280
time before

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,120
this make some brackets and then go f

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
name and L

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,080
name so I just want to enter those two

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,799
and

56
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,239
then just

57
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,760
remove so let's say I want to add

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,760
in watch

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,519
this

60
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,480
execute

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,159
select null and

62
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,080
null now again um watch the update video

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,480
if you didn't update to

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,599
oh wait sorry we don't need that update

65
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,000
um test

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,760
table set uh ID equals let's say six and

67
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,040
uh email

68
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,599
equals uh the

69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,360
email

70
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,840
where F

71
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,720
name

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
equals

73
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,120
Andals right

74
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,359
there I'm just going to execute the

75
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,040
select statement at the same time so

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,919
that um it updates and then shows us

77
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,720
what just

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
happened

79
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,800
uh

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,560
sorry um I'm a little okay so then here

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,400
we

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,759
are and as you

83
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,680
see it took backi two times so it

84
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,199
duplicated that's why I always say to be

85
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,639
careful with update and delete

86
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,160
so

87
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
uh then you can just revert that by

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,600
deleting two of

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,520
these so that was the insert into um I

90
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,720
guess

91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,360
tutorial uh make sure to check out the

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,600
update video if you haven't

93
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,800

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,080
