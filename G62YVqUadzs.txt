1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,520
tutorial my name is tanray bakshi and

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,200
today i'm really glad to get to talk

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,240
about the new m1 max with an x macbook

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,719
pro and specifically running minecraft

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,480
on it as you know a little while ago i

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,240
released a tutorial on how you can run

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,160
minecraft natively on apple silicon for

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,400
the very first time uh to the best of my

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,920
knowledge it was the first tutorial on

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
the internet telling you how to run

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,240
minecraft natively on apple silicon back

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,599
when they had released the m1 with the

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,000
macbook air and the 13-inch macbook pro

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,920
as a matter of fact i'm linking to my

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
tutorial the first ever resource to run

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
minecraft natively on apple silicon down

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
in the description below so make sure

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,559
you take a look at that if you want to

20
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,320
understand a little bit more about what

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,239
went behind actually getting minecraft

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,680
to run natively and some of the

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,520
advantages of apple silicon in general

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
and now here's the thing after that not

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
much progress was made on minecraft or

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,280
microsoft's end on getting it to run

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,280
natively on apple silicon and still my

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,800
tutorial is pretty much the only way for

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,559
you to actually run it natively i

30
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,239
released a github gist telling you

31
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,920
exactly how to do it i've pre-compiled

32
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,879
all the dependencies like lwjgl and so

33
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,480
on and so forth there have been lots of

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
different folks on the github just

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
contributing different you know ideas to

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
how you can make it better like for

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
example integrating multi-mc integrating

38
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,520
forge and fabric and optiflying and all

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
these other great ideas in fact there

40
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,280
are also some workarounds to enable you

41
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,000
to log in with microsoft accounts like

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
for example using the minecraft native

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
launcher and then using that to launch

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
an intel version of minecraft closing it

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
finding the json where it stores the

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,439
access token and then using that access

47
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
token in my script in order to log you

48
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,759
into minecraft but here's the problem

49
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,240
that's really inconvenient and it seems

50
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,400
like minecraft and microsoft really want

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
to push people to using microsoft

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
accounts to log into minecraft

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
so today i want to do two things first

54
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,479
of all there's a link in the description

55
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,040
to a newer version of the same github

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,680
gist that enables microsoft account

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
based authentication completely within

58
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,119
the terminal meaning you no longer need

59
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
to use any weird hacks or workarounds to

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
use microsoft accounts for your

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,159
minecraft installation to run natively

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,240
on apple silicon second i want to show

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,439
you some benchmarks and show you the

64
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,200
kind of performance you can expect with

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
a 32 core gpu m1 max macbook pro

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,640
specifically the 16 inch running in high

67
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,920
performance mode although the high

68
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,760
performance mode doesn't matter as much

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
for minecraft because it doesn't require

70
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
as much sustained performance and that

71
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
much of a thermal envelope as a matter

72
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,560
of fact running minecraft barely ever in

73
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
fact i've never heard the fans running

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,520
on this computer running minecraft if

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
you go back to the intel max running

76
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
minecraft like a good 30fps would bring

77
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,480
you

78
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
to an extremely loud laptop but now we

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
can be running at like

80
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,519
fps with barely any heat generated it

81
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,080
truly is incredible now if you'd like to

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
skip ahead to the part where i actually

83
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,000
show you how to use the system click on

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
the box on screen right now or skip to

85
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,879
that chapter

86
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,239
however

87
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,680
if you'd like to go ahead and understand

88
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,480
a little bit more about how this

89
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,160
authentication works let me give you a

90
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
brief overview previously the way

91
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,680
authentication would work is you would

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,519
pass my script your username or email

93
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
address as well as a password and given

94
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
the email address and password i would

95
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,599
go to the minecraft servers run a rest

96
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
request to get an access token and your

97
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
user's uuid which i would then pass to

98
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
the minecraft client which would then

99
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,080
log you into minecraft and enable you to

100
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,840
join servers that were in online mode

101
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,360
and so on and so forth

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,519
however microsoft after they bought

103
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,560
mojang

104
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,159
is switching them over to microsoft

105
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,080
account-based authentication meaning in

106
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,599
order to authenticate against minecraft

107
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,200
there's actually a three-step procedure

108
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
you need to follow now first you have to

109
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
make an oauth request against microsoft

110
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
to log you into your microsoft account

111
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
then once you're logged into the

112
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
microsoft account you need to send a

113
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,040
request against the xbox live servers

114
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
the xbox live servers give you another

115
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
token that you then go ahead and pass to

116
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
the mojang servers saying here's my xbox

117
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
live token can you please log me into

118
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
minecraft then that gives you an access

119
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,159
token and if you send another request

120
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,319
you can get the uuid through the profile

121
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,439
endpoint

122
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,000
that is a lot of steps and sometimes it

123
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,879
requires weird ways of using azure and

124
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,959
other sorts of apis in order to work

125
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,480
however i managed to find a way to

126
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
encapsulate all of that into a single

127
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,799
javascript script and integrate that

128
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,920
into the launcher script that i had

129
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
built last time so now without any

130
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
further ado let's take a look at how you

131
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,920
can actually well run minecraft natively

132
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,760
on apple silicon

133
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
microsoft accounts as well this time

134
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,199
let's take a look running minecraft

135
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,560
using this new launcher script is

136
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
incredibly simple all you have to do is

137
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
provide it well your email and password

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
same as before except this time this is

139
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,919
the email and password associated with

140
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,840
the microsoft account that is associated

141
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,160
with the xbox live account that you use

142
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,720
for minecraft once you provide the email

143
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,479
and password through environment

144
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,919
variables in your shell using these

145
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,280
export commands simply run sh launch.sh

146
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
and just like that it will run node run

147
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
the request it needs to do get the

148
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
access token and launch minecraft for

149
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,680
you now by default without using

150
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
optifine or any other kind of mods using

151
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
just normal vanilla minecraft and

152
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
running entirely natively on the m1 max

153
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,960
i'm usually getting much over a hundred

154
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,400
frames per second i'm usually getting

155
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
about between 120 and 180 on average

156
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,600
using a render distance of 12 chunks of

157
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
course i have options like vsync off and

158
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,320
of course unlimited frame rate set now

159
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
here's what's really interesting with

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
previous macs even if you were getting

161
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,960
for example a 120 fps frame rate it

162
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,880
didn't really matter because your screen

163
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
wasn't refreshing that quickly anything

164
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
beyond 16 it no longer really matters

165
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
because once again your screen isn't

166
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,479
updating fast enough to show you all

167
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,160
those extra frames that your gpu is

168
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,919
calculating however what's really

169
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,280
interesting is on these brand new

170
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,440
macbook pros the monitors well they're

171
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,360
promotion and what that means is that

172
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
you get 120 hertz refresh rate when

173
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,039
you're playing minecraft and that means

174
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,560
when you get a higher frame rate you're

175
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
actually getting a much smoother

176
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
experience and that's running minecraft

177
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,880
natively on the m1 max which will also

178
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
work for the m1 pro as well as the m1 if

179
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
you'd like to use the m1
