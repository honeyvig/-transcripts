hello everyone and welcome to this
amazing tutorial video on SQL delete
drop and alter command along with an
amazing demo on how to remove duplicates
from a database which in our case is a
SQL table so without any further Ado
let's get started how to delete a column
in SQL but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple Technologies and if you're a
tech gck in a continuous hunt for latest
technological Trends then consider
getting subscribed to our YouTube
channel and don't forget to hit that
Bell icon to never miss an update from
Simply done now without further Ado
let's get started so how do you delete a
column in SQL now let's quickly take a
look on the syntax we will be using
today so we will be using the alter
table keyword then the table name the
drop keyword to drop a particular column
name and followed by the drop keyword we
have the column name which we are
supposed to be dropping off now that we
have a clear idea about the syntax let's
get back to the my SQL workbench to
execute this particular command so far
we tried to create a database create a
table add some data onto the table using
the insert command and update a
particular tle and try to eliminate a
single row now we're trying to eliminate
a complete column here so let's not
eliminate the existing columns let's try
to create a new column and then try to
eliminate it so for that we will be
using the alter table command so this is
the alter table command and the employee
table which is the employee table name
then we are trying to use the add
keyword and we are trying to add a new
column that is the PIN code which is a
work or character data type and not null
we're not keeping it as null and in case
if we did not add any value into the PIN
code the default value will be na a
which is a text type so we are encoding
it using single codes now let's try to
run this
code and let's quickly try to check the
table
Table and there you go now we have pin
code here and the null values in the PIN
code so we don't want this pin code over
here so we will eliminate this pin code
column using the same alter command so
alter
table then the table
name
and then the column we want to drop
using the drop keyword which is pin code
so let's execute this command and see
the output so there you go the PIN code
column has been successfully eliminated
so so that's how you completely
eliminate a column in SQL we will try to
delete a row in SQL how do you delete a
row in SQL let's quickly take a look at
the
syntax so we will be using the delete
keyword and the from keyword adding the
table name and giving a work Clause with
a user defined condition so this will be
a basic Syntax for the process of
deleting a single Row in the SQL table
now to understand in a much better way
let's get back to the SQL workbench so
now we are on the SQL workbench and
previously we tried to create a table
add some data using the insert command
and update a value using the update
command now let's say we have to delete
the last row which is one6 Jeremy hyra
let's say Jeremy found a new job in a
new organization and now you need to
eliminate his credentials from your
database so we will be using the
following code that is
delete from table name is
employee
table and the V
Closs now the
condition which is e MP
ID is equals to
106 now let's try to run the code there
you go the employee is being eliminated
from that particular database now let's
try to recheck the table so
select star from
EMP l o y e
e table
run the code and there you go the last
ID which was one6 has been eliminated
from your database and that's how you
delete a row in SQL and we will learn
how to eliminate duplicate rows in SQL
how to eliminate duplicate records in
SQL table now we can eliminate the
duplicate records in SQL by a few
methods so we will use the most simplest
ones the first one is using the inner
joint along with a W loss and the second
one is a simple and the humble distant
command now we have a brief idea on the
methods let's understand them in a much
more detailed way through a practical
demonstration now let's get back to the
MySQL workbench to understand the codes
in a much better way so now we are on
the MySQL workbench and we will get
access to our simply learn database and
we are in the simply learn database so
previously we used to work on employee
table so let's not work on the same
employee table since we have actual data
there let's try to duplicate that table
so that we will have some duplicate
entries in between so we will be
changing the employee ID numbers and we
will also be using the same employee ID
numbers so the employee ID has some
details to it so we'll be understanding
that in a much more detail while we are
executing the commands and uh we will
also try to remove the primary key from
the table so I'll also explain why we
are going to include the primary table
and also will explain the usage of
eliminating it so when you have the
primary key in the table SQL workbench
or any SQL will automatically stop you
from adding duplicated values but let's
say if you add a duplicate entry with a
new primary key right then it will not
stop you so we'll also have a
demonstration about what to do in such
scenarios so now let's try to quickly
create a duplicate employ table which
will be employe table 2 and then we will
try to add some duplicate entries into
it remember we will not use the primary
key here the code will be
create
table EMP l y e e
table
to
and everything will be same which is
from the previous table which will be
the employee ID integer type employee
name character type this character type
pin code will be integer and normally we
include the primary key in this
way primary key brackets open
em so this is the way how we add the
primary key but we are not going to add
it since we want to know what happens if
we enter data which also has the
duplication of the primary key right so
we will not give any primary key over
here let's quickly run this there you go
the new duplicated table of employee
table has been created let's try to
insert the same values with some
duplication there you go I have pasted
the command for inserting the values and
if You observe clearly at the end I have
repeated the values of Tony ktie Sama
Jun and Gloria so these five will be the
duplicate values and also we are trying
to enter the duplicated primary key
since we did not declare the ID as the
primary key it will accept all these
values let's quickly run this and there
you go the values have been successfully
entered into the table let's quickly see
if we have the
duplication select star
from
employee
table control enter there you go so you
can see the duplicate values are also
added onto the table now how do you
remove these duplications remember we
discussed the distinct one distinct
method which is the second one so that
happens to be the most simplest one
let's see how it works so here we we
will write a simple select
command
select
distinct
star from the employ table
to now this will give us the distinct
values right but again when you run this
particular command which is Select star
you will have all the details back again
right our job is to eliminate them so
what we will do is we'll create a
duplicate table so let's name it as dup
table so create
table and duplicate table will be the
name
Now quickly execute this command there
you go now we have the
data which we obtain from the distant
command is stored into the table named
as duplicate table now let's quickly
drop the employee table
to
okay the table has been successfully
dropped so when we run the same command
once again it says simply learn that we
did not find any table by the name
employe table to that means it's been
eliminated now the next thing we need to
do is rename
it so what we trying to do is we are
trying to use the alter table and we are
trying to rename duplicate copy to
employ table 2 so that we have the
actual table here after eliminating the
duplicated values it's not dup copy it's
actually dup
table
right there you go now let's execute
this successfully done now if we execute
this particular select command you can
see we have the cleaned data without any
duplicate entries this was one of the
simp ways of eliminating duplicates in a
SQL table now let's try to get a step
ahead and try to use some joint commands
and where commands and where conditions
and using those we will try to eliminate
the duplications in a table now we are
talking about a table which does have
the you know primary
key and the datas will be duplicated let
me explain you how now let us must
declare
the primary key as employee
ID
b p s EMP
ID right now we do have a primary key
now there is no way okay let's try to
create this uh before that let's try to
truncate employee table
two so we can use the
not drop table we can use the truncate
so let's replace drop with truncate so
that the data which we have in employ
table will be removed there you go
now we will or let's quickly drop the
table because we are trying to create
the new table right so let's create the
new
table so once we have executed the drop
table command the table has been
successful sucessfully remov now let's
try to create this particular
table control enter there you go the
table got successfully created now let's
try to duplicate the same entries
remember I'm not changing the primary
key
here now when I run this command I will
get an error which says primary key
cannot be
duplicated so here you can see duplicate
entry for nine and you cannot have the
duplicate entries right this is one way
about duplications but what if someone
comes up with a brilliant idea to
replace the primary key now if I change
the primary
key at 17
18 let's say we
also have this data
copy let's duplicate
this right this will be
R 19 and this will be R 20 now we have
unique primary keys for all our data and
we also know there are some duplications
let's try to execute this command and
see the
output so somewhere something is not
correct
yet okay this
one so Tony has been repeated so we can
have a different ID for Tony let's say
we have Tony as
21 by to execute the command once again
it should be clear
now okay it still has some duplication
somewhere yes it's right here let's keep
this as
22 okay I think we made a lot of
duplications
somehow let's quickly take a look if uh
all the major keywords are duplicated or
not so we copied from Gloria so after
Gloria
we we will remove these so Gloria so we
just make we're trying to make sure that
the primary keys are unique here so 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20
20
22 there you go so now we believe that
all the primary keys are unique let's
try to run this command and see if we
get the same error or not no so now all
the data has been inserted into the
duplicate table which is employee table
2 and we also have some duplicate
entries now how would you
recognize that we don't have any duplic
case or how would you recognize which
data has been exactly duplicated and how
do you even remove it now the old
distinct command is not going to work
anyhow let's see if it works by any
chance so when I try to run the distinct
command it will give me all 22 rows with
all the duplicate entries right in this
case we can use the first method which
was the join and where condition method
right let's try to do that so we going
to use the delete
command delete
T1 from
employee
table
to
T1 in a
join
in a join employee table 2 as T2 so we
are declaring two different tables so we
are considering T1 as one table and T2
as the next or second table so T1 and T2
are the copies of the same existing
employee table two right now we joining
these two tables and we are having a
Vare condition over here so from table
T1 we're going to eliminate table one
from table two where we have an
intersection and where we have the
employee IDs greater than employ ID in
EMP okay let's not confuse so let's
execute the command first okay let's
execute this to understand what I mean
here so here when we we go a little down
you can see 14 for Tony right actual
employee ID of Tony is n but we have 14
for Tony and Gloria we have 18 19 20 and
again for KT we have 22 the actual
number of KD is 10 right so now it will
try to recognize the highest number of
employee ID so it will recognize the
highest employee ID number and it will
retain it and rest all the numbers will
be eliminated so this is the first ver
condition and we're also giving a string
comparision function where SQL will try
to identify if there is a similarity
between the employee name of the first
table and the employee name of the
second table and we know that when you
give the string comparison operation if
it results in zero it means the strings
are equal if it results in one it means
the strings are not matching
now that we understood the logic of this
particular statement let's try to
execute it so there you go so we have
executed the command now let's try to
see what's left in the table there you
go now we should be having the usual 13
number of employees in our table and you
can see that the records are retained
where the employee ID number is the
highest remember we had the number but
10 as employee ID for KD and we have
that over here in case if you want the
actual numbers to be placed however they
were you can make a small change to your
command all you need to do is keep this
particular or change this particular
greater than symbol to lower than symbol
and you will retain the actual numbers
of the employee records so that's how
you can eliminate the duplicate entries
in the table and if you ask me hey only
two conditions are enough don't you
think the PIN code and you know we also
have PIN code and the address of the
employees don't you think that is also
important yes you can also do that you
can make some minor modifications to
your code and try to include all those
remaining things and again you can do
the same right now let's try to
eliminate the data in our table let's
truncate it and we should be having no
data left in our table and let's try to
insert the duplicate entries once again
and okay before that let's try to do
this particular execution remember we
try to keep the employee ID let's try to
execute that and try to print it and we
should be having the actual numbers over
here right as
expected now let's again trunk it the
data and try to compare the conditions
or will be using the where condition and
we'll have all the parameters included
in our condition let's truncate the
table and now let's try to add the
duplicate entries once
again there you go we have all the
duplicate entries entered now what we
will be doing is we will be using the
same command but the only change will be
the string comparison or the we
condition right so you can keep this
string comparison if you want or if you
can change that let me change that
actually so instead of
this we will use this particular command
where we are trying to compare the
employee ID so let's keep the employee
ID as lesser than so that we have the
actual employee ID numbers and we are
using an and condition over here so that
uh this particular condition should be
valid and the employee name should be
equal to the employee name in T1 and
T2 yeah and uh the next one is here we
have the employee address so the
employee address in T1 and T2 should
also be same and pin code from both the
table should also be seen so what we are
trying to compare here is we are trying
to keep the employee ID with the least
number or the least value and the names
of the employee should be same the
address of the employee should be same
and the PIN code of the employee should
be SE in that particular condition you
can try to delete the record let's try
to execute this and there you go the
command got executed and now let's try
to execute the select command which
would give us the final result so here
you go control enter and you have the
data here so now we have successfully
eliminated all the duplicates by
comparing the values in each and every
single column and we also have retain
the original ID of each and every
employee now that's how you try to to
eliminate duplicates in SQL
