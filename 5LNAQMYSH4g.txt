1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,580
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,770
tutorial my name is Tannen Bakshi and

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,879
this time we're gonna be going over

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,680
something really interesting I know

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,660
you're all gonna love it so this is

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,190
another video for my general education

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,110
series sorry I haven't done one in a few

8
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,260
weeks but now I will be doing them so

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,650
regularly like my iOS apps and though

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,090
it's excerpts playlists that I just

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,850
started so now I'm going to be talking

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,490
about the science the site I'm going to

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,930
be talking about science under that

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,390
biology under that evolution now not

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,669
just any type of evolution fruit

16
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,030
evolution must be thinking why is it

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,219
called fruit evolution well it's because

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,780
not just animals fruits of all as well

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,770
so I don't know you

20
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,170
if this doesn't seem very natural at all

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,050
to you but as you can see this is really

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,059
a thing even though it's not the most

23
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,829
natural things which I will explain in

24
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,860
just a minute it is true so let's get

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,570
started I have created a little keynote

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,460
presentation which will be for download

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,280
in the description below so let's get

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,240
started shall we okay as you can see I

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,909
have a little food evolution slideshow

30
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,250
prepared for you and so let's get

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,760
started

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,010
as you can see we just start off with

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,159
food evolution and now I'm going to be

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,250
talking about what evolution actually is

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,110
now before we actually get into

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,390
evolution I know what you know I'm

37
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,909
almost 100% sure that you know what

38
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,909
evolution is but I'm just going to tell

39
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,560
you anyway just in case you don't know

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,659
now I got this rule dictionary and the

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,880
definition is the process by which

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,390
different kinds of living organisms are

43
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,159
thought to have developed and diversify

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,680
from earlier forms during the history of

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
the earth so I got the flugel dictionary

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,079
and the link to this will be down in the

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,229
description below so now what is

48
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,979
evolution why would a species evolve in

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,890
the first place now there's three things

50
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,329
that could have factors in evolution

51
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,979
first of all it could be by chance just

52
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,829
it their DNA mutates and they become an

53
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,590
evolved species or it could be on

54
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,690
purpose for the benefit of that species

55
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,000
now there's one more thing if you think

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,640
about it the evolved species have a new

57
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,739
trait that helps them live in the wild

58
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,080
now it's these traits that will help

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,060
them survive and the ones who survive

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,520
will continue passing on their genes and

61
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,380
the ones that continue passing on their

62
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,580
genes are the ones that it will

63
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,709
eventually survive those will be the

64
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,680
only remaining species of that species

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,220
making an evolved species so that's how

66
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,319
that works and so that's why a specie to

67
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,170
a species will evolve but I'm not going

68
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,850
to be explaining how a species were

69
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,850
evolved but I might make a different

70
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,580
video on that later so for example we

71
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,380
evolved from apes into humans like we

72
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,140
are today and for example we actually

73
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,730
evolved into three different types of

74
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,209
main humans first of the us Homo sapiens

75
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,430
and then two other species

76
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,739
now those species first of all weren't

77
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:09,260
as intelligent so we were intelligent

78
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,209
enough to know how to live and since we

79
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,830
were intelligent we were the ones that

80
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,140
survived and now we're the only human or

81
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,680
homo species currently alive so we're

82
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,190
from that why would fruit need to evolve

83
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,290
there's nothing that it has there's no

84
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,320
aim for fruiting life the plant could

85
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,930
have a name though to continue with

86
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,720
seeds to make sure they get to places

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,540
and actually make new trees or make new

88
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,209
plans for that but why would a fruit

89
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,060
need to evolve well let's take a look at

90
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,200
some examples

91
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,709
and you'll see exactly why I say that

92
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,590
fruits cannot evolve but they're forced

93
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,680
to let's take a look at an example now

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,269
let's look at a natural peach from 4000

95
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,450
BC this is the natural peach I know it

96
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,739
doesn't look like a peach it looks more

97
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,530
like a grape and cherry mixed together

98
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,040
but it is a peach genetically it's only

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,549
25 millimeters big it has 64% edible

100
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,739
flesh as a very waxy skin

101
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,299
it's 36% stone and tastes earthy sweet

102
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,260
sour and a little bit salty sometimes so

103
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,550
as you can see this will not be at all

104
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,210
very pleasant to eat

105
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,100
and though there's only three known

106
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,810
varieties and they're only found in

107
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,100
China that's it

108
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,280
these things are 71 percent water eight

109
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,320
percent sugars and twenty nine or

110
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,030
twenty-one percent other substances this

111
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,430
is the artificial peach with which we

112
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,830
all know the reason I say artificial is

113
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,720
because first of all species I mean a

114
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,560
fruit cannot evolve so what as humans

115
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,440
and farmers did is we actually created a

116
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,630
special type of peach which is the peach

117
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,789
that we see right here this is the

118
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,620
classic peach that we all see in

119
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,860
supermarkets right now so it has nine

120
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,710
percent edible flesh it has soft edible

121
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,979
skin it has around 10 percent stone in

122
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,410
the middle it's 100 millimeters big

123
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,039
which is 64 times larger then its

124
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,510
ancient ancestor and so this is the

125
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,220
modern version and if we look at its

126
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,500
ancestor this has three known varieties

127
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,949
however this peach has over 200 known

128
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,430
varieties which is a 67 fold increase in

129
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,979
the amount of varieties that a fruit

130
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,740
that this fruit has and this is now

131
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,560
known in 13 different countries that's a

132
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,780
lot more countries that it can be grown

133
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,070
in than just one China okay so these are

134
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,810
90% water 8.5% shoulders and around 2%

135
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,169
other substances so again these are

136
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,729
called artificial because these are

137
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,590
created by artificial breeding meaning

138
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,460
they aren't a national yeah I mean

139
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,060
natural breed of peach they're actually

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,710
artificially created but they're not

141
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,690
unhealthy at all if you think that's

142
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,789
what I'm saying now let's take a look at

143
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,479
another example the watermelon yeah it

144
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,710
doesn't look like a watermelon at all

145
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,510
not not even visit to me

146
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,880
this is very nutty it's around 50

147
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,430
millimeters big you have to only open

148
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,409
this with a hammer or a sharp object you

149
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,580
have to just keep hitting it or

150
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,680
peeterman repeatedly and it has an

151
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,110
extremely bitter taste you could

152
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,610
sometimes find ones that are bitter

153
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,380
sweet but they're always going to be

154
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,960
bitter and these things actually cause

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,599
inflammation and they're only found in

156
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:37,100
the Maine

157
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,280
and also bought Sueno sorry I'm not

158
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,190
pronouncing those right there was only

159
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,470
six known varieties there 80% water

160
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,170
there 1.9% sugars and 18% others now

161
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,080
let's look at our artificial watermelon

162
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,080
our official watermelon has quite a few

163
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,960
different shapes it's much bigger it

164
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,390
reduces inflammation summarize our

165
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,570
seedless and just to compare how much

166
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,430
softer these things are this is a

167
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,110
natural watermelon which has to be

168
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,550
opened with a hammer or a sharp object

169
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,550
this is our artificial watermelon that

170
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,380
has to be opened by dropping it from one

171
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,620
meter that's how soft it is and these

172
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,130
are very like actually sweet and juicy

173
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,090
and I'm just not dry and they're not

174
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,850
nutty at all if you think about it and

175
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,990
these things are available in four

176
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,850
different colors and if we go back here

177
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,130
we see that the National watermelon only

178
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,920
has six known varieties however now we

179
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,160
have over 100 I mean one thousand twelve

180
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,590
hundred varieties this is a two hundred

181
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,610
fold increase in the amount of varieties

182
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,070
that we have for watermelon and you will

183
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,630
know this because when you go into a

184
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,430
store you only see one or two different

185
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,380
varieties of watermelon mainly only

186
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,620
seated and seedless but these are

187
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,410
actually 1200 different varieties of

188
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,330
watermelon compared to the traditional

189
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,700
six so now watermelons before we're only

190
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,900
long only in two countries now they are

191
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,360
in fifteen countries and these things

192
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,830
are 91.5% water 6.2% sugars and 2.3

193
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,350
percent other substances now I'm going

194
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,760
to show you something that you really

195
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,010
won't believe this is the hardest one to

196
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,260
believe yet you you won't even believe

197
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,599
that this exists at all this tiny thing

198
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,550
this is only 19 millimeters big you have

199
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,979
to peel it by hammering repeatedly by a

200
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,380
hard object and it tastes like a draw

201
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,800
dry and raw potato that's how bad it is

202
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,010
and this has 5 to 10 very hard kernels

203
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,270
and that might have just given it away

204
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,030
to you this is natural corn found in

205
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,510
seven

206
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,510
BC so there's eight known varieties of

207
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,460
this it's only found in Central America

208
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,850
it's 75% water 1.9 percent sugars on

209
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,410
23.1% other mostly starch now if we look

210
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,590
at our artificial core and of course as

211
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,410
always we have it this thing Steen cooks

212
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,840
in just minutes it's sweet refreshing

213
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,700
and juicy it's available in five

214
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,040
different colors it's 190 millimeters

215
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,220
it's around 1,000 times larger than its

216
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,070
predecessor and it's also very easy to

217
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,130
peel you there's no slamming required

218
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,670
you just use your hands and you're on

219
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,040
your way so as you can see there's 8

220
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,600
known varieties for the natural corn

221
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,840
however here we have over 200 different

222
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,350
varieties of artificial corn so that's

223
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,950
like a 70 767 fold increase in the

224
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,970
amount of varieties and these this corn

225
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,860
was only found in one country now

226
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,440
they're fine found in 69 different

227
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,250
countries these things are seventy three

228
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,950
point two percent water 6.6 percent

229
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,200
sugars and twenty two point two percent

230
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,250
other and yeah that was it for this

231
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,950
presentation and this is a fun fact

232
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,500
before I stop now I did you know there's

233
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,910
actually something that scientists are

234
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,080
trying their best to do they've been

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,780
working on this for five years now

236
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,210
reverse evolution yeah you heard me

237
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,480
right a reverse evolution I don't know

238
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,820
how this is possible why they're doing

239
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,430
it at all and how dangerous this is but

240
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,580
they're doing so what their goal the

241
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,290
project is and this before I continue

242
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,390
you must know that the bird is the

243
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,480
closest and I ancestor I mean dinosaur

244
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,510
if you take a bird it's closest ancestor

245
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,570
would be a dinosaur but that's wrong

246
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,140
completely wrong they actually are

247
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,960
dinosaurs so that's why that fact is

248
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,270
wrong if you think about it birds are

249
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,520
dinosaurs not their closest living

250
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,540
relative but if you take chickens they

251
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,760
are dinosaurs closest real living

252
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,160
relative

253
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,830
so what they're trying to do is make

254
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,750
chickens bigger have them bigger teeth

255
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,680
have bigger legs make them actually walk

256
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,050
a little bit better and also give them

257
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,210
tails so that they look more like a

258
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,490
dinosaur so that's what they're trying

259
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,160
to do they're trying to reverse-engineer

260
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,540
the genes they're trying to activate

261
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,960
those genes that make a chicken more

262
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,090
dinosaur like so that's just a fun fact

263
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,580
about evolution and yeah that was it
