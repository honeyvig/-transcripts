it's the dotnet community round up with
Scott Hanselman in John Galloway hello
guys hello hey wow I'm afraid to push
any buttons now I know I bored it's all
good well fortunately we have just one
laptop between us yes we all know the
budget for one laptop we've been using
most of our budget on things like
apparently the folks during the dotnet
coffe party getting drunk on peeps if
you're not from America you can learn
about peeps candy they're just a trash
candy they're not good for you but you
can't stop eating a 21 then you're like
maybe another one would make it better
it's an addictive chemical it's not good
cool so we've got a couple of different
things to share with you we've got a lot
so a community roundup it's kind of like
a roundup of a bunch of stuff one thing
is we've got these amazing we've got
it's so cool watching these things that
we had some added like today and
yesterday so 217 worldwide it's great
looking around the world it's fun like
we're noticing like a lot through Africa
I mean like all around the world is cool
watching them pop getting a lot more
dotnet user groups a lot more dotnet
Kampf local viewing parties yeah and we
point out South America Africa all over
Asia we're getting a lot more folks
getting involved we want to make it as
easy as possible for you to put together
a user group yep so there's a couple
things going on here of course these are
dotnet coffee
local viewing parties local
get-togethers but you can put together a
user group we've set up the dotnet
Foundation paperwork here for you to
make your own user group right yeah yes
so this um we've got these dotnet
meetups and then meetup has this thing
with a whole meetup pro and what's cool
with that is it's an organization where
you can join that will pay your fees and
then also we can send messages out to
all the meetups and we can say hey we
got this thing coming up we've got
dotnet conf local you want in you know
fill out this little form and we'll send
you swag so we sent all these hundreds
of events worldwide we sent them stuff
around the world which is pretty neat
so this is I mean this is we're up to 62
countries now almost a quarter of a
million members so if there is not a
meet-up near you mmm-hmm why not make
one write a meet-up doesn't have to be
300 people that meets every week right
it could be a couple of dozen people who
came you know and some cool ones are
ones like in a company so you know it's
just
you work in a dev shop and maybe there's
you know 50 devs or whatever start a
meet-up there you know so yeah there's a
link over here on the side where it says
add dotnet meetup or you can just ping
me or paint and ping dotnet foundation
on Twitter and look at you at it and
there's a lot of value in this you hear
people saying well maybe this is a good
opportunity for you to become a
technical speaker in fact I think it's
actually a really good opportunity to
learn because when you can speak about a
topic you actually learn more about it
because you prepare for the talk so to
your point about giving presentations to
your local and/or your internal company
and having a brown bag and just
presenting on what you're doing is a
great opportunity to kind of flex that
muscle inside of you about how to
explain a topic clearly how to build a
story arc yeah it makes you a better
engineer absolutely I mean that's that's
how I got started with technology and
presentations was gone to my local user
group watching some and then signing up
for a little 10-minute lightning talk
and and my machine crashed and I got
through it and then I just kept
practicing you know and I mean it's
really fun to it and and then you know
just to be able to once we've got these
local events to be able to do cool stuff
like this yeah so definitely reach out
there's anything that any of us can do
at the tought net cough hashtag at the
foundation at Microsoft to get you
started with a user group whether it be
an internal or an external one you let
us know
yeah we'll do the best we can to support
you and one thing that we do as part of
that is we have this presentations in a
box thing so you'll see today we've been
as the speakers leave after they finish
their presentation because you know
presentation the the they're updating
their there's stuff right up to the last
minute right so we've been dropping them
all in here their new conf
2019 these are all the the ones from
there we also have some workshops and
you can see like the SP net core for
beginners was updated today all of these
the Blazer and the SP net core app
workshop have updates for dotnet core 3
on different branches so those are those
are actively updated by the product
teams and when we say presentations in a
box we're literally saying here it is
ready to go you could go and present a
full week on asp.net and structure that
week you wanted to do it you could do
this at an afternoon it just depends on
how you want to stress that out if you
are a university professor or if you're
teaching you can certainly go in and put
this into your curriculum and for as far
as dotnet cough is concerned if you
wanted to present some of the content
that we've just done
in your local language do that grab the
slides we'll try to give you all the
slides we'll give you all the code and
all the support and then you could go
and present that to maybe two people who
didn't get a chance to see da dead car
yeah and if people do that in their own
like their own language like let us know
and we can help like get the word out
for you all right now a little trick
that I do is all these kinds of things
if like for instance Netcom you've seen
blazer talks presented by like Dan Roth
or you know you've seen the keynote
presented by Scott hunter you can grab
these slides you can watch the video in
practice and that I do that like I'll
say hey I'm giving a blazer talk let me
see you know what I mean it's great
structure it's a great place to start
with and then make it your own you can
feel free to take any of these fork them
change them update them and then if you
have a workshop if you created something
share it with us because they also put
in ebooks and third-party workshops yep
and we have some community some
workshops like this a cadet workshop
this one Dodie is built 250 plus I think
it's almost 300 now is peanut core
samples and he just shares those out and
and regularly lets us know as he updates
um this one here this this ebook here
Ahead's built this out and this was
built out of weekly blog posts and he
wrote an entire book and he's just given
it away as PDF and we had him on the asp
net community stand up to talk about it
and it's just really cool to see you
know how so so we try and share out what
the community is doing and the these
different you know links they make of it
and one thing i want to point out as
well is it just because you're maybe not
an expert a you're just learning I'm
still learning you're still learning
even though we're making the product
we're still learning don't feel like you
can't blog or write any book or get
involved because you don't necessarily
know the topic fully you know your
experience you know how you have found
it so blog about your feelings about it
and talked about how it you know this is
how we implemented asp.net in our
company this is how our migration to
dotnet core went down here's what worked
here's what didn't because your story
your unique experience is worth blogging
about and if you turn it into something
like an e-book we will definitely try to
get the word out about it and some of
the best learning I've done is when I
blogged here's something I think I've
learned and someone says that's pretty
good but did you know about this and
then it's like oh wow I could you know
what I mean and it's a great way to
reveal ways where you can improve
absolutely so one thing speaking of
learning this is amazing yeah so this is
something we've been working on very
very hard and we're very proud of this
you can actually get to this from a
short URL which is dot dot net so do t
dot net slash videos that's our short
URL and it'll redirect redirect you here
you can also go to dot dot net and click
on learning it's under videos and what
this is is a series of videos
exclusively for beginners so you have to
ask yourself what does that mean how
beginner is beginner are we talking
about 10 year olds are we talking about
people with some understanding we try to
go right down the middle because we feel
that there are people who are learning
software in college and there are people
who are learning software in boot camps
and sometimes they don't necessarily get
the big picture they'll get the full
picture so what we tried to do is put
together a kind of a mr. mrs. Rogers
neighborhood style slow-moving friendly
on-ramp into net a lot of times we find
ourselves speeding through file new
project right click deploy look at work
ok ready go go go
this is one on one content I think a lot
of our previous 101 content was really
too old one contest yeah if you're not
familiar with that nomenclature in
universities in the u.s. of course you
have first year of universities second
year of university this is very much
first year so I want you to check it out
c-sharp
101 really just talks about the language
like literally down to the key word not
even thinking about dotnet I really
liked watching these the the way that
you built them up in a friendly way and
you it takes a conscious effort to do
that right because it's very easy to
focus on here's what I know I want to
show off the scent this new thing but
stepping back to the level of explaining
a concept and doing now is the right
time let's talk about what is this using
thing here or what is that so I really
feel like the approach you did here was
they're fun to watch I appreciate that
and what was great was that we every we
partnered everybody up here we pardoned
everyone up to get a different
perspective on what was going on so if I
use an acronym that maybe someone
doesn't know that my partner goes and
says whoa hang on what does that mean
there were a couple of times in the
dotnet one where Kendra said well wait
what's this mean or I said hang on let's
do a whole video on just hello world and
we had a lot of fun and these are I
think there's about 80 or 90 videos that
we did they're very short they're you
know how they say that that you could
make one nine hour
or you could make 90 10 minute videos
these are the ones that you can binge on
they're actually up on YouTube they are
also on channel 9 so if YouTube is not
available at your work or in your
country I want to make sure that we're
gonna we we do recognize that we will
have alternative downloads for everybody
as well as being able to download them
all offline yeah so check those out
those are our 101 videos dot dot net
slash videos
so speaking of the.net things that are
new we also added dotnet stand up so
this is the asp net and dotnet community
stand up we used to have it was live dot
s p net and we didn't have a good kind
of central place for doing for seeing
all the different stand ups what we do
because we've added in like xamarin
we've had it in desktop all these all
these things because part of the
advantage of dotnet is you can build all
kinds of stuff with it right and some of
these are really really important
because you get to talk to people that
you don't always see you get to talk to
the actual designer so here we've got
Kathleen dollar sitting with emo and
they're talking about you know the
language and the runtime and the
low-level stuff so whatever topic you're
into whether it be building a web
framework and the asp.net stand up yeah
or doing xamarin and making a mobile
application or some of the internal
details about actually designing the
next version of c-sharp yep we've got to
stand up for you these are the real
people that are actually doing the work
which is really really cool part of this
too is we added support in here for
these community links so we're using the
URL list which which Burke and sessile
built and and so this is a way where we
can go in and share out because we want
to show off things that communities
building and as part of that we list all
these links here so that you can go and
get them so we don't want to just the
links to fly by in the video and you say
that's neat we actually want you to go
and subscribe to the blogs or what you
know learn more try out if you're doing
something cool send me a tweet send John
it yep send anyone on the team of tweet
will collect those and if we feel that
it's interesting and of general interest
we'll share it on the stand up and we'll
continue to promote your your content or
your project or whatever it is that
you're working on and you're excited
about small little shout-out to you this
is actually for people that were
watching James Monta Meghna and I were
building this live streamed on twitch
over the past several months and so we
built this prototype out and it actually
ended up this we were able to transfer
this over to the tea
that's fine cool so yep cool all right
well so just along with dotnet
foundation stuff we've talked about it
we mentioned some some we had some
announcements today we talked about AWS
joining as a corporate sponsor we also
talked about this this maturity model
and it's kind of involved there's some
blog posts and some some Doc's and stuff
so you can go read through it but the
best thing is if you want to get more
involved in how the dotnet Foundation
works in you know new policies programs
and stuff we're building out you can go
and check out on the dotnet Foundation
website and click on memberships and is
it hard to be a member do I need to pay
lots out no and this is something where
I think I haven't communicated as well
credit card okay first of all as you
join you have an opportunity to pay dues
and the like default amount is $100 are
you paying Microsoft to do no no okay so
Microsoft does not touch this money it
goes directly dotnet foundation is
separate nonprofit so it's a nonprofit
there's not money that Microsoft
announced for stuff not at all so it
goes to things like sponsoring projects
we have we have some set aside we're
looking at doing things like sponsoring
local events and stuff in the future so
so this is money that's actually
available to the board of directors
which is community elected one of those
out of seven is Microsoft the rest are
community elected okay yeah so um I'll
just and pay dues you said but you don't
if you don't have to the student you
don't have to student you don't have to
if you are just somebody and you're
applying you're like I'm not sure about
this I don't know if I want to apply
because I don't want to pay any money or
I'm a little tight this week or whatever
it is don't pay any or pay five dollars
like it's a sliding it's it's and nobody
will look at it so you go through and no
one will see it nobody will see it so
basically if you go and you say ten
dollars is what I'm able to pay then it
checks off the thing in the neg screen
that says hey did you look at the dues
that goes away forever nice or if you
say opt-out it sounds great you've seen
it we're done so and what do you get
from membership what is being and that's
a great question so some of the main
things are you can vote in the elections
we have annual elections so that is I
mean the Board of Directors runs the
dotnet foundation that is they are in
charge they say exactly what happens
what projects join what we're going to
focus on what we do also so you can both
vote in and run
the elections another thing is we have
these action groups and this is a way
that you can become involved in things
so say you're interested in outreach and
you would like to see more you know more
diversity and dotnet ecosystem we have
an outreach group led by Sara Chipps and
and they're actively like working on
things what do we want to focus on how
can we get more people involved so and
then there's other ones there's this
technical this technical steering group
yeah there's outreach ones there could
be something around education if they
have one that doesn't exist that you
want to potentially we call it a run we
could create one absolutely yeah so
there we go I was I need to make sure at
the end of this we talked about the
virtual attendee parties but did you
want to so yeah there's a bunch of stuff
going on i wanted to point a couple of
things that may i take yeah yeah take
your laptop over here and just don't
brush the protective layer of dust off
it is just a filthy filthy laptop um one
of the things that i mentioned a little
bit i just want to talk about which was
that was super fun because i casually
mentioned it during one of the Q&A was I
took this application it was a
PlayStation emulator someone had
basically asked the question I don't
know if dot Nets you know fast enough or
whatever enough to do it to emulate
another computer and this very nice
student went and created a emulator in
c-sharp and it's up at github and you
can go and check it out it's called
project PSX and what I thought was
interesting about it was not just a ton
it could go and emulate something like
this was very very fast but I opened it
up individual studio community and it's
important to remember that Visual Studio
community is free yep that's free for
open source free for students free for
small businesses or a certain size check
out the license and I wanted to convert
this from dotnet four point seven point
two it's a Windows Pacific dotnet over
to dotnet core using WinForms right
because don''t core you can now swap
done at net out from underneath win form
and put done at corner Neath and see if
I could get more perf yeah well because
you've got a different runtime you know
done it course it's almost like a brain
transplant it's it's like yeah it's on
the outside it's the same thing but the
brain is all sudden like super smart and
it brought up a lot of really
interesting questions so first because
dotnet core 3 now supports WinForms you
might think yourself
means it's gonna be a lot larger a
WinForms is a nougat package so it's
optional right it's not necessarily
gonna come along for the ride unless you
want it to be so all I did was make a
new project dragged all of these over
into the new project then fixed up the
references and immediately got the thing
running it took about 20 minutes now
everyone's different but it shows that
this particular individuals code was
extremely clean they were just using
file streams and binary readers to open
up the different things that they wanted
to open up again this is all just an
educational thing you know certainly if
you're gonna be doing anything with an
emulator make sure that you own licenses
to all the things you want to use but
it's really really interesting that
folks are going and doing this work when
I put it on dotnet core it was about 30%
faster 30% more for like basically 20
minutes or yeah basically 20 minutes for
you know that's just one fun example but
there's a bunch of examples you know
there's so much stuff that doesn't even
get talked about but with dotnet core
all this all the work that goes into
optimizing the low-level internals like
string performance and and hardware
intrinsics and they're kind of span of T
all those things and so it's like you
can just by moving to the newer versions
all of a sudden your code runs way
faster yes like for friend that brings
up a really important point that there's
lots of different things but what does
it mean to be fast right is it to start
up fast well there's things that you can
do you know to make sure that your code
starts fast is it steady state speed do
you want your code to be really really
small we try to make it so dotnet core
is as flexible as possible to fit these
scenarios that you want whether it be on
a Raspberry Pi or with some of our
community projects like wilderness labs
on a microcontroller or whether it be on
an Android device or an iPhone you know
it's everywhere you want to be speaking
of which I think if there is an update
on the schedule and you're gonna be
showing off wilderness labs tomorrow
morning yeah so tomorrow at 7:30 towards
the end of the evening on twitch I've
got a brand new beta of wilderness labs
wilderness labs meadow they got their
beta 3 and this is a really really
interesting connected things platform
again not associated with us but just
from the community but it's not net it
is running net so what it does if you're
familiar with there you go it's the full
dotnet standard on a microcontroller not
on a micro processor that I got a full
computer you
kind of like a single tasked device it's
real IOT so instead of a Raspberry Pi
which runs a full version of raspbian or
a full version of Windows 10 this is
just gonna run your library integrates
with your cloud however you want it to
integrate with and they gave me one of
these here it looks in like that and I'm
gonna try to get some some holo in its
very early days I got beta 3 ok but it's
got a lovely deployment experience you
just plug it in over USB you hit f5 it
deploys and you're basically flashing
the firmware of the device and it
basically boots into dotnet what's doing
that compilation up front
using mono so you can do something like
this say a temperature sensor go and
look at a threshold for that and then
look a nice dotnet event temperature
change with a anonymous lamda there and
you go and say alright when the
temperature changes update the LCD and
tell me the temperature so what's
exciting about that is that for everyone
who's watching this right now and you
say oh I'm a c-sharp developer and I do
wind forms or I'm a c-sharp developer
and I do you know MVC you just became an
embedded systems developer yeah or if
you watch Shane boy a boy years thing he
just became a kubernetes developer right
that's what I a male developer that's
what I think so exciting about dotnet
right now is that we're all being able
to take our existing knowledge and our
existing experience so if you learn
c-sharp today you learned that today you
learned some of these great languages
and great libraries you can go and apply
that anywhere from 64 K to 64
I don't know terabytes you know what
other thing we mentioned talking about
was the tri-dot net and that kind of
learning experience huh did you want to
show some of that yeah so try not net is
interesting and I just you know when I
Google with Bing for stuff I just put
Hanselman all the time it just makes it
easier to find what you want so try not
net global tool is this thing that
powers the documentation as you go
around to Docs Microsoft comm and you
can go and get this global tool and
check it out it's really really cool in
fact you can just go and say dotnet tool
install and it's install try dotnet and
then you can say in fact dotnet try demo
which is pretty cool that allows you to
run basically interactive documentation
it'll say local Howe
mmm-hmm and you'll have your own docks
locally writing down it in the browser
that's a key thing I think a lot of
people have seen tried out net in the
browser in the docks and they're like
okay that's need you know Microsoft runs
it or whatever but it's are not aware
that you can actually run it like
locally on your own machine it can work
with with gist or whatever and exactly
and what's exciting about it is that
once you've got that unknown in your
machine you've done your restores and
you've got all the new get packages that
you need you can go to airplane mode you
can take it home where you might have
slow internet or no internet and
potentially run your workshop on your
you know a USB key the other thing
that's really cool about it if you just
go to dotnet and you hit getting started
you can see of course we've got our
video series on the side there and you
say alright let's go try dotnet in your
browser see what it says code editor is
loading on the right-hand side there
that is tried out net that's going to
show up look and now I can go and say
hello John hit run code and it shows up
down here and it is tried out net that
is allowing it to happen that my
daughter is taking a computer class
right now and she was struggling with
you know reading definitions in a book
and it wasn't really clicking and I just
went directly to this code or some of
this stuff and I'm like look here this
is a constant this is it you know what I
was like oh it's like interactive you
can totally see it now some of you might
be saying well is that running blazer is
that running it really depends on the
scenario right and that's the great
thing about both blazer and things like
try dotnet is it in some instances you
can go and compile it and run that
entirely with web assembly and in other
instances if you were going to do
something that required more power you
can go and do that on the server yeah
and remote the result I love that about
blazer right you've got both those
options you've definitely got a lot of
choices so I want to make sure that
people all do that and also if we go
over to Docs Microsoft comm which we
really can't say enough nice things
about Docs has just really come into its
own in the last few years just
completely joke about how the docs were
accurate but not helpful you know it's
like this is the first place to go if
they go over there and they go and click
on learn c-sharp they can go and see
this introduction to c-sharp and will
actually walk them through hello world
numbers branches and loops all of that
will be done in the browser now here's
the fun part and here's where we get
into the inception part of things right
if I go in here and I say
learn about numbers and floating-point
and things like that this tutorial is in
fact the same tutorial that we run
through so so go to c-sharp 101 go to
dotnet core 101 and we'll walk through
them with you interactively and learn
along with you that's the best I love it
I love that because it's like hey I can
do this and then if I want to read more
it's in the dogs yep and it's not just
101 for c-sharp Anette I want to point
out we've got dotted core versus the
dotnet framework what do you want to
choose what about xamarin 101 this isn't
one video these are video series there's
a hundred videos there 85 videos some
huge number of videos a member keeps
going I'm gonna just raise the number
every time I see here's intro to visual
studio there's five videos intro to
containers and darker was Shane and Lisa
machine learning lots of those what we
got here like eight videos on machine
learning I'm going to just raise the
numbers there's cam on any framework
there's Bridget on a Pat done it for a
patchy spark and we're gonna have even
more videos coming soon as well so all
of this free please check it out there's
stuff indeed so as we wrap up I think
it's this party what are we doing this
yeah so there was a part there is a code
party so so you can follow the first I
got to find I've got a tab here for it
so I've got a tab for everything their
virtual attendee parties today on
tomorrow so you follow on Twitter the
the dotnet Kampf hash tag you can watch
