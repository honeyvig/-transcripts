from the third party and ships them
directly to the customer
so now let's understand drop shipping
with an example rahul wanted to start
his own business of chairs but he didn't
have space to maintain the stock and
neither had a lot of money to buy chair
stock in advance

with this kind of situation and find out
about the drop dropshipping business
model
he found that interesting and decided to
start his own drop shipping business
he created his own e-commerce store to
sell chairs and tie up with one of the
chair vendors and now when someone
orders a chair on his website he simply
purchases the goods from that vendor and
ships them directly to the customer
by doing this he solved his two problems
one is he saved a lot of money as he
didn't need to purchase goods in advance
and the second is the space problem now
he doesn't require any space to maintain
the stock
myths about drop shipping the drop

extremely popular in recent years it
simply means that you never handle a
product yourself instead you place
orders for items that your customers
want and have them shipped directly to

mark up the item price beyond what you
paid it is still common for dropshippers
to be misunderstood however below are
