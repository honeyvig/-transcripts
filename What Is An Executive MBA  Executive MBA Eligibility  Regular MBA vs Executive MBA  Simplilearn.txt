further
if you look at the student profile for
both mba programs you'll find
significant differences
according to the executive mba council
that is embsc the average executive mba
student is 38 years old and has around
14 years of professional experience
including about 7 years of managerial
experience
since this program is designed for those

professionals advance their business
expertise within the context of their

few benefits of an executive mba
career advancement is the first benefit
that we have on our list
the opportunity to set one's career
trajectory on fast forward track is one
of the most significant benefits of
enrolling in an executive mba program
those that enroll in such programs are
already well known inside their
organizations

old thus their experience has quite a
substantial edge in determining how they

their entrepreneurial spirit
that is why the students of this course
end up creating startups with
collaborative efforts
moving forward we'll look into a few
differences between the executive mba
program and the regular full-time mba
program
the first parameter which differentiates
emba from full-time mba is the expected
student profile
the executive mba is intended for
seasoned individuals with extensive work
experience who want to advance their
careers within the same field a regular
mba on the other hand is for
professionals with only a few years of
experience who want to enter business
management roles or alter their career
paths
the average age of students who apply
for an emba program is 38 years
while the average age for students who
apply for standard full-time mba is 28
years
the next parameter is nature of course
students in traditional mba program have
to quit their jobs to obtain an mba
degree whereas the emba program allows
students to learn on weekends while
continuing their jobs that is why the
emba program is preparable option for
individuals who do not want to step out
from their c-suite positions
the next topic is admission selectivity
an emba is not as rigorous as full-time
mba the intake capacity is lower for
this course additionally the acceptance
standards are less stringent including
low gmat scores averages being one
example
regular mba programs on the other hand
are incredibly competitive with
acceptance rates of less than 10 percent
you need to have very high gmat score in
order to get selected into this mba
program
the last factor on our list is post mba
aspirations

changer program for young professionals
in contrast the emba program is aimed to
develop leaders or vice presidents of
particular departments
emba graduates are more likely to be
promoted and given more responsibilities
and furthermore they are also paid
considerably more than the regular mba
graduates because of their extensive
past experience
