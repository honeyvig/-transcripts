1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,279
hello and welcome today I'm going to be

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,719
showing you how to install any app or

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,160
get an IPA file of your excode project

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,240
either one um without going through the

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,880
entire process so first of all I'd like

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,000
to announce that um first of all using

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,480
my technique that I'm going to show you

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,760
in this video you will be able to put

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,239
test an yours on your device or somebody

10
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,879
else's device wireless about connecting

11
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,079
it to your computer and doing all that

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,160
stuff and you'll also be able to convert

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,280
yourx code project files to an IPA very

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,960
quickly so to get started I will just

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
quickly show

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,800
you uh I have my

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,640
Mac and I have actually an xcode project

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
I know those 15 glider puzzles so I'm

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
just going to open that up quickly as

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
you can see I'm going to xcode and turn

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,360
on my 15 number G let me just take my

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,720
iPhone out of the screen for the for a

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,320
while so you can

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,520
see and so here I am in the code and

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,640
let's say I wanted to make some changes

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,360
okay so maybe in my

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,680
storyboard I want the name to be T15

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,479
slider okay then I'll Center that

29
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,000
25 slider

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,439
again perfect now I want to get this to

31
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,360
my device number one wirelessly and I do

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,399
not want to go through xcode's archiving

33
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,439
process so what I'm going to do is I'm

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,759
going to go to the

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,119
top and I'm going to go product

36
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,590
clean and then product build for

37
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,840
[Music]

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,880
running what this is going to do is just

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,399
make sure that all the files are updated

40
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,320
I know it automatically does that I'm

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,920
just making sure so the program runs

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,160
well now I've made a few things first uh

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,080
the first one is actually an app and

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,280
what it basically does is it takes any

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,519
xcode

46
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,480
project and it will convert it to an IPA

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,519
for you uh with a GUI interface uh but

48
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,319
there's another method that uses a shell

49
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,319
script which is basically what the app

50
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,920
is using uh but in a GUI form but

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
there's the other way the terminal way

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,480
using terminal which I don't recommend

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,519
for advanced users but I'll show you

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,239
both methods let's start off with the

55
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,720
method of the

56
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,480
terminal so now I have this 15 number

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,840
game and I want to convert this to an

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,920
IPA and I don't want to go to the

59
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,560
through that all archive and stuff so

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,159
I'm going to right click on 50 number

61
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,760
game and Sh and

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,080
finder now what you have to do is you

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,720
have to make a debug folder on your

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,200
desktop for the GUI to work um and then

65
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
put the files and there will be a

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
download link to these in the

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,280
description um in it but if you're using

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,040
the terminal interface you don't really

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
need to have it in a specific folder but

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
this file and this file must be together

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,599
in the same

72
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,799
folder so what we're going to do is

73
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
we're going to search terminal in Sp

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,319
light and we're going to open up

75
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,319
terminal what we want to do is we want

76
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,120
to browse to our desktop and the debug

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
folder which is where I've stored all

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,159
these files and then what I'm going to

79
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,120
do is I'm going to run sh archive. sh

80
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,720
and then I'm going to drag in 15 number

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,799
game this get this gives it the path to

82
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,200
your xcode project if we click enter now

83
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,480
you'll see there's a new IPA folder on

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,239
the desktop and it's going to say it's

85
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,920
starting to build the IPA file for the

86
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,840
15 number game app so now we just wait

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
and see our result as you can see it

88
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
says archiving succeeded IPA created and

89
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,079
it says completed building IPA 415

90
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,079
number game which is the actual app's

91
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,440
name find it in the IPA folder on the

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
desktop so we go to our desktop and we

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,360
see an IPA folder we're going to open it

94
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,840
and boom that's where our IPA is but

95
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,800
let's say you don't know all this sh you

96
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,280
don't want to do all this tracking and

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,880
stuff there's another method

98
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,240
now there will be a download link to

99
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
this app also in the

100
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,560
description uh what this essentially

101
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,360
is is I've made another

102
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,840
app where all you do I'm going to delete

103
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,440
this other

104
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,600
IPA is you give it the you make sure

105
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,160
first of all that there's a folder on

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,960
your desktop named debug and the files

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
that I give you to download are inside

108
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,240
of that folder okay that must be on the

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,039
desktop and there so now it asks you for

110
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,560
the path to your xcode project file now

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,639
what you need to do is again you just

112
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,560
drag it in instead of writing the entire

113
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,080
path you convert it and then you wait

114
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,280
might load a little might look like it's

115
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,639
crashing or it's frozen but it's

116
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,919
actually from the inside not it's

117
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,400
actually doing work

118
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,720
inside um uh just converting it to an

119
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,720
IPA so as you can see gives us a result

120
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,280
zero and this means it succeeded in

121
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,240
creating it and so now we can go into

122
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,280
our IPA folder and you find

123
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,600
this and so this is I think this is much

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,759
more convenient than going through the

125
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,160
entire um archiving process and yeah so

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,400
now what I'm going to do is as you can

127
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,880
see my iPhone here is not connected Ed

128
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,160
to my

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
computer Wi-Fi sync is off nothing is

130
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,240
it's not able to communicate with my

131
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,680
computer I'm going to set this right

132
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,960
here so you can see this and just in

133
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,639
case you can't I will mirror this

134
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,280
on so okay what I'm going to do now is

135
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm actually going to go to

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,960
Safari and I'm going to go to a website

137
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
this website is

138
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,840
dii

139
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,960
dii what this is it's um development iOS

140
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,000
apps Wireless

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
installation what the basically you drag

142
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,080
in your IPA file you click Send it'll

143
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,440
give you a link you put this link in a

144
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,400
tiny URL you put that tiny URL link onto

145
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,240
your Safari on your actual device and

146
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,879
then on your actual device using Safari

147
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,160
you actually uh download and install the

148
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,160
app so this is actually pretty neat uh

149
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,960
as you can see I'm going to go to my

150
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,160
desktop I use the

151
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
gesture um and I'm going to go into the

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
IPA folder I'm going to take this drag

153
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,919
it into Safari and drag it into where it

154
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,000
says add files

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,599
here drag files here and then basically

156
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:29,599
this is going to upload to the the

157
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,960
servers and then going to click

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,639
Send now you can see that this create

159
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,360
gives you a link now I bet you don't

160
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
want to type that out in your iOS device

161
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,720
and you're too lazy to send it through

162
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,159
email so all you need to do is go to

163
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:50,319
tinyurl.com problem solved what you do

164
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
is you enter this URL and I'm going to

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
give it a good name U what's SEC here

166
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,599
I'm going to give it a good name 15 game

167
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,120
beta 5

168
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,759
this is the fifth bait of it and I'm

169
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,319
going to click make tiny

170
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,360
URL what it's going to do is it's going

171
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,080
to shorten this link here into this link

172
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,000
so now uh if it would give me a moment

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
what I'm going to do

174
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,280
is I'm going to show you my iPhone

175
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,159
screen and at the same time mirror it

176
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,000
onto this monitor so that you can see

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,680
what's happening

178
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,360
as you can

179
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:40,440
see I'm going to mirror this to my

180
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,680
Mac and so just as proof this is

181
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,440
actually

182
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,640
mirroring and I'll keep this in front of

183
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,240
you at the same

184
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,800
time so what we want to do first is you

185
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,399
want to go to Safari inside of safari

186
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,760
you want to go to that tiny URL that you

187
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,880
just

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
created tiny

189
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,560
url.com

190
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
slash and then the 15

191
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,000
game beta 5 so I'm going to click

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
go and as you can see it brings up this

193
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,279
screen which is incredibly amazing and

194
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,839
it lets you install the application

195
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,640
straight from the website

196
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,160
and then you just click the install

197
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,360
application button it's going to say

198
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,640
install. the.com would it like to

199
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,120
install whatever your app name is in my

200
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,680
case 15 number game and I'm going to

201
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,760
click install because I want it to

202
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,320
install I'm going to close

203
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,720
Safari as you can see it's installing it

204
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,440
again now I already had this so I'm

205
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,399
going to delete this and install it

206
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,320
again sorry uh remember don't do the

207
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,680
same mistake um make sure you delete any

208
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,839
old versions that you have of this app

209
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,360
and then install it so I've deleted the

210
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,399
old version it's installing I'm going to

211
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,480
go in and as you can see it gives me the

212
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,040
T15 slide with all the changes we made

213
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,959
and now I can actually play this game I

214
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,920
can go to my about page I can do

215
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680
whatever I want and just this proof that

216
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,279
this works I'll do the first two numbers

217
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,040
for you boom so that's basically how you

218
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,760
would uh first of all convert an xcode

219
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,440
project to an IPA um without going

220
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,000
through xcodes

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,120
interface and also second how you would

222
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,639
distribute your apps um uh Apple would

223
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,560
call this uh ad hoc

224
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,720
development uh distribution sorry

225
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,240
deployment um for free and that's it

226
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,760
thank you and goodbye and also one more

227
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,240
thing I'd like to give a a little credit

228
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,519
to some person on GitHub his name is

229
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,839
gilam

230
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,880
squant and he made the xcode archive

231
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,959
script uh and if you go to his GitHub

232
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,200
page you can get the xcode archive uh

233
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,600
Ruby script of which I have built off in

234
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,399
another file AR archive. sh which

235
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,079
basically um lets the other script work

236
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,000
so his script is basically the Bare

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,560
Bones of which I have built off and I've

238
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,800
actually been able to um create this um

239
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,839
excode archiver for you thank you and

240
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,680
now officially goodbye
