about what's new with the new angular 13
version I'm sure you're aware that
angular rolled out their new version
that is angular 13 on November 3rd
20121 this video brings you all the
updates you need to know but before we
begin if if you haven't subscribed to
our Channel already make sure you hit
that subscribe button and Bell icon to

before understanding what's new let's
have a quick look at what is angular
angular is an open- Source JavaScript
framework written in typescript Google
maintains it and its primary purpose is
to develop single page applications as a
framework angular has clear advantages
while also providing a standard
structure for developers on a team to
work with
it enables users to develop large
applications in a maintainable
manner angular has released several
versions over the past few years with
every release it has seen significant
improvements making it a popular choice
amongst developers today so let's look
at what's new with angular 13 so the
first one is it's completely Ivy
followed by that we have a new update
that is API component update next we
have modifications in the angular
package format followed by that we have
bye-bye to Internet Explorer next is the
framework modifications and dependency
updates next we have improved testing
and debugging followed by that we have
some performance improvements and
finally we have improvements in angular
CLI now let's look at each one of them
in detail the first one it's completely
Ivy the view engine is no longer
available with the angular 13 update and
the framework is now 100% Ivy these will
help to speed up the compilation and
boost platform efficiency for your
projects next the API component update
before the changes in angular version 13
the namically creating components
required a lot of boilerplate code the
new API removes the need for component
Factory resolver being injected into the
Constructor IV creates the opportunity
to instantiate the component with View
container ref. create component without
creating an Associated
Factory followed by that we have the
modifications in the angular package
format the angular package format APF
has been streamlined and modernized to
better serve developers to streamline
the APF in version 13 the team removed
older output formats including view
engine specific metadata to modernize it
they have standardized on more modern
JavaScript formats such as
es2020 libraries built with the latest
version of the APF will no longer
require the use of ngcc as a result of
these changes Library developers can
expect leaner package outputs and faster
execution now the fourth update bye-bye
to Internet Explorer 11 removing ie1
support allows angular to leverage
modern browser features such as CSS
variables and web animations via native
web apis what's more the apps will be
smaller and load faster because we can
remove I specific polyfills and code
paths it also removes the need for
differential loading developers will
benefit from improved apis and build
infrastructure while application users
will benefit from faster loading and an
improved user
experience now the fifth update
framework modifications and dependency
updates angular version 13 also features
some helpful updates and important
changes first up our rxjs 7.4 is the
default for apps created with NG new
existing apps using rxjs version 6 will
have to manually update using the npm
install rxjs at 7.4
command now let's look at the sixth
update improve testing and debugging
there are important improvements to test
bit that now do a better job of tearing
down test modules and environments after
each test the Dom is now cleaned after
every test and developers can expect
faster less memory intensive less
independent and more optimized tests now
let's jump into the seventh update that
is the performance
improvements these recent updates in
angular 13 have undoubtedly resulted in
major improvements by introducing
unusual modifications such as the opin
feature is enabled by default Global
scripts and bundles have been optimized
in Union type templates autoc completion
is supported now let's look at the final
update that is improvements in the
angular command line interface angular
now supports the use of persistent buil
cach by default for new version 13
projects the valuable feedback from RFC
persistent build cache by default led to
this tooling update that results in up
to 68% Improvement in build speed and
more ergonomic options and so with that
we have come to an end of this short
