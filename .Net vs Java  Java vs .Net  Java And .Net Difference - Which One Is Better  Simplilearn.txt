hey everyone welcome to another session
by simply learn in this session we will
understand the difference between java
and dot net
let's look at today's agenda
we'll first begin with understanding
what is java
following which we will understand what
is dot net
then we will look at the comparison
between dot dotnet and java
on the following parameters that is
fundamentals languages operating systems
ides libraries performance versions
licensing and jobs and salaries
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our youtube channel and
clicked on the bell like so you never
miss an update from simply learn so
without wasting any further time let's
get started
what is java
java is a programming language and
computing platform
there are lots of applications and
websites that will not work unless you
have java installed in it
java was first released by sun
microsystems in 1995 and the oracle
corporation later acquired it
java software platform runs on the
billions of devices including notebook
computers mobiles devices gaming
consoles medical devices and many others
java is widely used object oriented
programming language the rules and
syntax of java are based on the c and c
plus plus languages
java is fast secure and reliable from
laptops to data centers game consoles to
scientific super computers cell phones
to the internet java is everywhere
java is a multi-platform object oriented
and network centric language it is among
the most used programming language
now let us understand what is dot net
dotnet is a free cross-platform open
source developer framework for building
many different types of applications
dotnet core is a cross-platform that
supports windows linux and mac os
microsoft began developing.net framework
in the late 1990s
by early 2000 the first beta version of
dotnet 1.0 were released
with dotnet you can use multiple
languages editors libraries to build web
mobile desktop games and iot
applications
we can write dotnet apps in c sharp f
sharp or visual basic
whether you're working in c sharp f
sharp or visual basic
the code will run natively on any
compatible os
dot net standard is a base set of apis
that are common to all dotnet
implementations
nugget is a package manager built
specifically for dotnet that contains
over 90 000 packages
now let us look at the comparison
between java and dot net
the first parameter is the fundamentals
java is a programming language and
computing platform that was first
released by sun microsystems in 1995.
java is widely used object-oriented
programming language and software
platform that runs on billions of
devices including computers mobiles
medical devices and many others
whereas net framework is free
cross-platform open source framework for
building different applications
by early 2000 the first beta version of
dotnet 1.0 was released
the next parameter is languages
java itself is a programming language
however java virtual machine supports
other programming languages like python
r and ruby
with dotnet we can use multiple
languages we can write dotnet apps in c
sharp f sharp and visual basic
operating system
java can work on different operating
systems like microsoft windows the
solaris operating system linux or mac os
whereas dot networks only on windows
operating system that is windows 98 or
later windows nt 4.0 or later
integrated development environment
java uses ides like eclipse
j
intellij idea j grasp j creator netbeans
green foot and jdevelop
and in dot net id is like autumn bracket
sublime text
ecmas and vim are used but the most
common one is visual studio
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free

the link in the description to know more
the next parameter is libraries
the java class library is set of
dynamically loaded libraries the java
virtual machine languages can call at
runtime
a java library is just a collection of
classes that have been written by
somebody else
some of the libraries used in java are
apache commons google guava and jax
whereas in dotnet framework class
library is the collection of classes
namespaces interfaces and value types
that are used for dotnet applications
class libraries are shared
libraryconceptfor.net
some of the dotnet libraries are
swashbuckle poly automapper and saskate
performance
java's efficiency is from just in time
compiler and concurrency capabilities
the just in time compiler is a part of
the java runtime environment
the compile code is immediately called
by java virtual machine compiling does
not require processing time or memory
use because the code is not interpreted
as a result java program is as quick as
native application
whereas in dot net dot net uses natively
compiled languages like c sharp and c
plus plus
they are faster and less memory
consuming than java
dot net also enables optimizing the code
and writing less code which increases
the performance
the shorter the code also means less
effort spent on the code maintenance and
easier debugging
versions
in java the first beta version was
released in 1995 following which the
version 1.0 was released in jan 1996 and
so on
the most recent versions was java sc 16
released in march 2021
and five months later java sc 17 was
released on september 2021 and it's
likely that on march 2022 java sc 18
will be released
in.net the first version 1.0 was
released on 15 jan 2002
and the most recent version released is
version 4.8 on 18 april 2019.
now let us look at the licensing of java
and dotnet
since the java 8 update on april 16 2019
all versions an update for java above 8
has no cost for personal use and
development purposes
but any other use needs a commercial
license
whereas in dotnet dotnet is free open
source developer platform with no
licensing cost and free development
tools for linux mac os and windows
there are no licensing cost including
commercial use
lastly we will look at jobs and salaries
there are over 3 lakh 16
715 java developers currently employed
in united states
whereas in dotnet there are over 2 lakh
54
189.net developers currently employed in
united states
the average salary for a java developer
in india is 4 lakh 61 000
whereas the average salary for a.net
developer in india is 4 lakh 14 000.
the average salary for java developer in
united states is 76 000
whereas the average salary for a.net
developer in united states is 72 000
dollars
now let us see when to use java and
dotnet
java is suitable for web projects big
data and gui applications
java is used as server side language for
back-end development
java is also used for embedded systems
android applications and web
applications
because java is portable you may choose
which operating system you want to work
on this adaptability allows to select
tools without having to worry about
compatibility difficulties
dotnet is used to build for web mobile
desktop games and iot dotnet is also
used for web applications client
applications and enterprise development
dotnet has taken over for web services
and apis
it is mostly preferred for windows api
service
