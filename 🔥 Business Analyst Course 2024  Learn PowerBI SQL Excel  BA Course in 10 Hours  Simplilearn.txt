areas of Interest now without further
delay let's get started Excel Excel is a
ubic software that acts as the Workhorse
of business analysis its versatility
allows for data organization cleaning
manipulation and initial exploration
through formulas and pivot tables it's
the goto tool for quick calculations
basic data analysis and creating reports
for smaller data sets so in this session
we will now get started with Excel
Basics and later to the advanced Excel
Concepts down the line what is Microsoft
Excel so Microsoft Excel is a software
product designed and developed by
Microsoft is storing data in an
organized way that is rows and columns
and Microsoft Excel is also capable to
manipulate data through some
mathematical
operations followed by that Microsoft
Excel is also used to extract the
insights from the data and represent it
in the form of visually appealing graphs
and charts now we have a basic
understanding or an overview of what a
Microsoft Excel software product is now
moving ahead we will understand the
fundamental fals of Microsoft Excel so
following are some fundamentals that you
need to know before getting started with
Microsoft Excel so basically when you
install the Microsoft Office in your
computer you will have various Microsoft
products out of which Microsoft Excel is
one of the product so we will be dealing
exactly with that particular product
that is Microsoft Excel so when you get
started with Microsoft Excel this is
what you will see in the first page so
this particular page is called as
Microsoft Excel homepage where you will
be having having various varieties of
sheets Microsoft Excel will give you
some suggestions based on the type of
sheet you want to work with we will see
this in a better way through the
Practical session so once you get
started with the sheet you will have
some more options so this particular
option is called as the toolbar menu you
will have the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so these are the tools that you
will be using to work on your data using
Microsoft Excel furthermore we have a
tool bar bar ribbon so when you select
some of the other option from the file
home insert draw page layout formulas
data review View and help buttons you
will have a ribbon so for example you
can see that I have selected the Home
Tool here so when I press on the Home
Tool this is the ribbon which Microsoft
Excel gives me so this ribbon has some
options in it which can perform various
operations now in a further more
detailed way we will have toolbar groups
so when you see in the previous slide we
have a complete toolbar ribbon so this
particular ribbon is segmented into
groups so you can see the first group as
paste Cut Copy format painter etc etc
and the second group is the font the
size of the font and to increase the
size of the font to decrease the size of
the font bold italic underline etc etc
and here you can see the text alignment
so each and every group has separate
functions so each set is called as a
group and I think you can see a small
Arrow option over here so this Arrow
option is used into the toolbar groups
when the group is not able to fit all
the operations or all the
functionalities in one single provided
section so when you click on this
particular Arrow Mark you will have
another dialogue box so this is called
toolbar more options so you can see that
when I clicked on this icon you can see
a new dialogue box which opens me a new
set of operations which are are not able
to be fit in this particular group so we
will also see more about this in a
better way in the Practical session now
moving forward we have cell and address
so when you open a Microsoft Excel sheet
you can find boxes so each and every box
is named as a cell and each cell has its
own address for example the highlighted
cell over here has an address B3 so B is
the column name and three is the row
name and apart from that you can have
the sheet sheet tracker in the bottom
left corner of the Excel sheet where you
can navigate through different sheets
and in the bottom right corner you have
an option of increasing or decreasing
the sheet size so these are the basic
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel that you
need to keep in mind before getting
started so we will have more on this in
the Practical session so now we enter
the demo inventory in Microsoft Excel so
we will be using Microsoft Excel to
create a sheet of the employees in a
company so basically an employee in a
company has employee ID name and
designation salary etc etc so we will be
trying to create the same table using
Microsoft Excel but before that let us
understand the fundamentals of Microsoft
Excel through the Practical demo first
so I have started my Microsoft Excel and
this is how the homepage of Microsoft
Excel looks like so you have a blank
workbook over here if you want to create
a new workbook you can select new Option
so Excel will provide you with various
variety of sheets you can see money in
Excel adjustable meeting agenda
streaming showers small business cash
flow and many more if you're not able to
find what you're looking for then you
always have an option of selecting the
particular type of sheet what you're
looking for so you have various options
if it's business if it's personal if
it's planners and trackers list budgets
charts etc etc so let's imagine that you
wanted something from business so just
by clicking at business option the Excel
will load a variety of sheets related to
business options so this might take a
while so you can see that the Excel is
loading few types of
sheets so you can see that Excel has
provided us with some online varieties
of sheets for example any calendar
business expenses Channel marketing
budget budget summary report blue
product list etc etc you can see
construction proposal envo your name it
Excel has got it so Excel will provide
you with some variety of options based
on your requirement now for this session
let's get started with a blank workbook
which looks something like this since
this tutorial is based on the
fundamentals we go with the blank
workbook now over here you can see the
toolbar that we discussed earlier that
has the file home insert draw page
layout formulas data review View and
help so this is the toolbar and under
the toolbar I have selected home and you
can see this is the particular ribbon
what we discussed about this particular
ribbon belongs to homepage and when you
select file option you'll get back to
home and if you select insert option
you'll have another different ribbon
with different groups etc etc so every
particular tool has different ribbons in
them and remember the extra options that
we discussed when you press over this
Arrow key this is it so when you press
the arrow key you'll have few more
settings which cannot be fit in this
particular section of groups so you can
have some variety of options over here
of changing the font changing some
effects to the text font size and font
style etc etc apart from this we have
also discussed about the cells in every
sheet so this particular cell has an
address so you can see the address over
here which is B3 three so B happens to
be the column name and three happens to
be the row name now we also had a
discussion about the sheet tracker right
now we just have one sheet if you want
multiple sheets you can just feel free
to select on the plus option which will
always create you some extra sheets and
you can navigate through sheets just by
pressing on the sheet
name and when you get back to the bottom
right corner you have an option of
increasing and decreasing the cell size
or the sheet size now let's keep it
default with 100% now these are the few
fundamentals that you need to keep in
mind before getting started with
Microsoft Excel now that we know the
fundamentals of Microsoft Excel let's
get started with a practical session
which is about the employees details in
a company now let's select this
particular cell and let's type in
employe
details
yeah we have the cell now an employee
details table will have the information
related to employees so the information
will be about name it will be about
employee
number it will be the
designation and maybe
salary
and maybe blood group as
well and uh let's take another one which
is phone
number
yeah so so far so good and uh you can
see that we have some problem with this
particular column the designation the
name of the the name of the designation
is practically good but it is not
visible so when you uh when you're not
on that particular cell you can see that
the name is incomplete over here so you
can always fix that you can just you
know manually change the size of the row
or cell or you can also feel free to you
know double click on that cell which
will automatically you know set the size
of that particular cell and same goes to
the blood group just let's try to double
click on that and same goes to phone
number
great so you can see that the employees
details are just confined to the first
two cells it's supposed to be somewhere
in the middle right so no problem we can
do that as well we can select all the
cells and we have an option of merging
them you can just select this one which
will help you with merging and centering
that particular data to the center part
so that's how we do it now let's get
started by adding the names of the
employes uh let's add the names
Joe John
uh Mary
Mark
Susan and
then
Jennifer let's type in
Mike let's type in
them cheff
Jeffrey yeah we have a couple of
employees now let's type in the employee
numbers
yeah we have the employee numbers now
let's type in the designation okay let's
choose uh Joe to be the CEO of the
company and John as the software
developer and maras
tester Mark in
finance Susan also in
finance and Jennifer in
testing and mik in uh
marketing
same goes for
Tim and again Jeffrey into software
development and
uh Morgan into testing
again
now let's click on C so that it gets you
know resized according to the length of
the text now it's done so let's get into
salary uh
$10,000 and
$15,000
$199,000 let's increase the salary of a
CEO so let's keep it $1
lakh and finance again 20
90,000 so yeah the salaries are
allocated again the blood
group
yeah we have the blood groups now let's
type in the mobile
[Music]
numbers
yeah now we have typed in some random
mobile numbers as well so uh yeah this
is how you can add in some data into
your table and now let us imagine that
you forgot to add or
remove a column so let's imagine that we
wanted to add a serial number as well
but somehow we forgot to add it now you
can always add a new row or column for
example here we wanted to add a new
column so we just have to right click on
a select the insert option yeah we have
a new row now now let's type in serial
number and let's type
one now can you see these small box
option over here if you just drag it you
can you know copy paste all those over
here and now let's right
click and fill series now we have the
employee number starting from 1 to 10
that's how you do it and apart from this
you you can also uh you know change the
font of the entire row you can change
the font to say uh AR onlyi and you can
always also change the font and same
goes goes to the employee table you can
select it bold it and you can also
increase the size and again select a
color for the text maybe a different
color green would be
better and uh you can also select the
entire cells and align them to the
center looks more good and you can
select or double click the row names so
you'll have the proper spacing between
all the rows and columns so we have
double click on the column right yeah so
basically that's how you make things
happen now let's save this so I'd like
to go to the save option and
uhp
data let me save this in my local
location and just save it's done so
that's how you work on your Excel file
with some basic data and to learn more
don't forget to get subscribed to Simply
learns YouTube channel and don't forget
to hit that Bell icon to stay updated so
you are the first person to get an
update on any technology not just Excel
now to get started with filters in Excel
we might have to switch to the Practical
mode so we are on the Excel spreadsheet
right now so we have some employe table
and we have some another table in here
which is about department and
designation and we also have and or
right so remember the symbols and is for
star and or is for plus now we have
converted our data set into a table by
control V option and now just select all
the data and by default table will give
you the filter option here but let's say
let's try to remove this filter and now
let's say we just have a simple table
now we want to add the filter option so
the shortcut way is just selecting the
entire table going to the Home tab and
selecting the editing group and inside
that you have the filter and sort option
just select that and done you also have
the functionalities where you can can
select your own departments let's say I
want only admin analytics and
development I have the table result here
or if say I wanted some other filter and
I can get it but what if you wanted to
filter your data based on formula
without using any kind of tools let's
say it's your interview question and
your interviewer asks you give me a
filter data set without using the filter
tool how can you do that now here comes
a tricky part it's simple just use equal
to filter and there you go you have
selected the filter and now you have
three parameters array include if mty so
these particular parameters stay for a
different meaning array is the return
array what values you want to return so
your your uh manager ask or your
interviewer asked you to give you only
the employee names which are working in
Department then your return value will
be employe column which is B which is
employee name right and if you wanted
the entire table give Give me the give
me all the details of all the employees
who working in development team then
you'll be selecting the entire table
right now let's select the entire table
let's go with the second uh use case
I'll select the entire hitten area as
the entire table now include this is the
condition include parameters for
condition now I wanted employees working
in development team right so I'll select
the department table and Department I
mean Department column and the
department column value should be equals
to what this develop right so get me the
values of Department table where the
value is equals to development this is
my condition and the last one is ifm
this is just a written value in case if
the values are not found right so I'll
give it as not found itself and now
close the bracket enter now you have all
the employee details who are working in
development team now let's say you
wanted employees who are working in in a
development team as well as testing team
now it is similar to an or condition
right so that's when you use the organ
condition over here and you get the
values it's like you're giving multiple
parameters now it's not possible to add
a comma and add another condition
because this particular filter function
goes with only three parameters now if
you are adding a comma and adding
another condition it will be considered
as a fourth parameter now we won't uh
now we won't uh want that we have
happening right so we don't want that to
be happening so how do you modify the
existing condition that is the second
paramet it's really simple just use make
use you know you can just make use of
some brackets so close the bracket and
now we are looking for employees who are
working in both I mean who are either in
development or in testing right so it's
like an or condition so for or condition
The Logical symbol is plus right so
similarly again you will be selecting
the department and the value should be
equal to let's say testing so I'll add
that testing part over here in L2 and
close the bracket there you go you have
added the second condition now next copy
this testing value and add it in cell L2
which was our second condition I mean
second part of the condition there you
go now you have all the employees for
working in development or testing right
and and that's how you use filters in
Excel let's say you wanted to extract
details of employees who are working in
both uh you know there there might be
situations where you want uh to use and
condition so in those particular
situations just replace that plus with
the and symbol that is star symbol and
that should work we have started the
Microsoft Excel on my screen you can see
a small data set the data set is about
students and their marks in the sixth
semesters right now we should be
creating a new heat map to describe
their rankings Now to create a heat map
the procedure is really simple just
contr a select the entire data go to the
Home tab and there you can see the
Styles group and in the Styles group
click on the conditional formatting now
out of all the options go to the color
scales and when you open the color
scales you can see some types of maps
select the green yellow red Scale map
which should show Green for highest
yellow for mediate and red for low right
this is how you create a heat map just
select the first option and there you go
the heat map has been successfully
generated the green colored cells
indicate the highest marks orange and
yellow color indicate the intermediate
marks or the average marks and the red
color indicates the lowest marks that's
how you create heat maps in Excel
demonstration for today's session which
is based on creating a dependent drop
down list in Excel so now we landed onto
our Excel spreadsheet so what exactly
are you trying to do you ask so I am
trying to get this straight okay now we
have Team employee name and count right
let's say you wanted to add the team
details in the First Column employee
name in the second column right so I
have three teams so t e a
m
d and uh te am
Ops right so this is how beginners do
right and uh if you want to automate
this we can do this using data
validation similarly let's say I am
adding details of Team developer and
employee name is let's say
Ivan okay uh so I want to add something
like this into this particular data set
or table so let's uh erase the column B
let's try to figure out column a first
so quickly go to yeah select the cell
first quickly go to data validation go
to the data options and here you can see
data tools select this particular data
validation option and here go to
list and the source so select this
particular Source this is a source of
our list so press
okay and there you go Excel has
automatically fixed the data for us
now the operat has been automated and I
can directly select whatever the team I
want and let's try to expand this to all
the sets that we have in our table so
whichever you select whichever the cell
you select and you can have the options
there you select the team now let's say
I select team testing right and now here
I want a similar data validation option
which will give me the list of employees
from the testing team right let's say
you give me a solution which tells me to
create a new data validation option uh
that suggests me to take the list from
this particular cell or column okay now
let's say all of a sudden I change the
cell let's say um Chris ctis let's say I
add Chris cus to employee name here and
he is not attending the team meeting now
or let's say he got a better opportunity
and he left the organization is with a
different organization now I want to
eliminate this particular cell and all
of a sudden I get team developer in the
first row now does ctis belong to this
particular selection development right
no he doesn't belong to team development
he used to belong to testing right so
similarly if I swap the rules if not
eliminate an employee if I swap the
rules then I should be getting this
particular options not from testing So
based on this particular cell my data
validation which is present in the
column B should change so that is
exactly the meaning of dependent
drop-down menu in Excel so that is what
we're going to do here today now for
that you might want to use something
called as an offset so before you create
a data validation formula for this let's
go to the here so here you will be
choosing list so instead of just giving
a routine list we will give a form
formula over here which will select the
list based on the offset or based on the
cell which is present over here so we
will be using the help of offset
function over here so equals to offset
so the reference this is the reference
of the table of the end you know the
entire data table which has the teams
options the employee options right so
this is the offset reference or the
beginning cell which I will be giving to
my option that formula let's fix that uh
cell by using the function code function
key f4 on the menu uh keyboard so we
have fixed it now the rowes now you want
to extract cells from one row I mean you
will be giving one option over here so
give one and now the columns so so far
so good we don't know from which column
do we select the data right we have
three columns over here so we don't know
from which column do we have to select
the data so for that you might remember
the index match function which is one of
our tutorials in the Excel playlist so
you will be using the part of that index
match function that is the match
function to recognize which uh column we
have to select so type in match and
press T to select the function and now
is your lookup value So based on this
particular selection which is over the
A2 right whichever uh data is present
here whichever team is present here
based on on that lookup value you will
be selecting the column from these
sections right if I give Ops you should
be selecting this column if I give
testing should be selecting this
particular column right now fix that um
column and cell using the function key
F4 you can fix the column but the row
number might change let's say A2 A3 A4
So based on the uh position of the cell
and the column you can change you know
you can select it so look at Valu is
there now the lookup array so this is
your lookup array let's fix it using
function key F4 comma you need the exact
match it's done so before getting on to
the columns and the height and width Etc
you need to understand offset takes
things differently so index match and
look up they will count the columns as s
1 2 3 but in case of uh offset function
it will uh you know you know uh count
number starting from zero so team devops
or team Dev it counts as column number
zero team Ops as column number one and
team testing as column number three so
you need to subtract one value from the
number which match function gives you
let's say the match function gives you 1
then 1 - 1 0 so the offset function will
understand I need to select the column
zero which is team de right now the next
part of the formula fight and width so
what do you mean by height
basically uh F column 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so
here we are we have we are having 15
number of employees in the developer
team and uh 1 2 3 4 18 number of
employees in Ops Team and 12 number of
employees in testing team so basically
the height of the uh column is nothing
but the number of employees which are
present in that particular column right
so you can see we have um colored a few
cells and orange color which means that
those positions are vacant or that
particular team is populated with only
limited number of employees now let's
say I give the height of 15 here in the
formula then the employees from opam
Sean Susan and Mick are not going to be
present when I select the Ops right so
in those scenarios what you want to do
is you might you know just add the whole
you know the height of the uh largest
column the highest number of columns
right so I have 19 as the highest right
so I'll give 19 here and uh how many
number of what's the width you want to
select so I want to select one cell so
my input for that particular cell will
be one but now this creates a chaotic
experience to us what is that let's see
now before we enter the cell let's
select all cut and we have the formula
in our hand now go to I select the cell
first now go to data validation tools
and here you will be selecting list and
here you'll be pasting the formula and
press okay now okay let's not drag the
formula at once we have a few more
modifications to do so now here we have
developer team develop Vel ER so we have
the list from developers right we have
Aaron LS etc etc and when you go to the
last one we have Tob as the last one but
wait a minute we have another selection
an empty cell which is these we don't
want this right so let's say you wanted
to select Toby and by mistake you end up
selecting the Mt cell and now you don't
have data right that is not supposed to
be happening so how do you change it now
basically what you're trying to do is
you want to count the number of uh
employees present in that particular
department and you want to give that
particular exact count to the position
where you have the column height so that
your formula doesn't make a mistake
right so that's exactly the thing what
we want to do let's say we use count a
function over
here and select this and what you get is
and let's say I use another count equals
to count a and I count the Ops team
members and it will give me 18 and now
another
count and count the number of employees
in testing that that will give me 12 so
these are the numbers which I want to
pass onto my offset function and that
particular number should be present in
the height so I can't can't uh you know
do it every single time it's again a
manual task I want to automate it so how
do I do it simple integrate the count a
function along with the offset function
that we just created so the offset
function will tell the count function
which team am I pointing to and how many
number of employees are there in that
particular column will be counted by the
count function so that's what we are
basically trying to do now so uh let's
go back to the data validation okay
Escape let's go back to the data
validation menu over
here edit your data validation formula
copy
it equals
to count a paste the formula you have
now close the
function remember copy the formula only
until C don't copy equals to else you'll
be finding an error Now erase it
completely now go back to your data
validation
menu and here where where you have the
19 which indicates the column height PR
paste that formula you just copied and
now it's
okay right
now when you uh when you are on uh data
team developer and press on data
validation option over here you can see
the last Toby is the last one and you
don't have any more blank cells so
that's how you create a dependent data
validation or dependent drop down list
in Excel now the main task is to copy so
uh remember you just dragged the formula
or data validation and there you have it
right so
will the same thing apply for this
particular formula no it will
not okay it did but anyways uh let's say
we don't have a team developer over here
then how do you do
it so you can select the formula press
copy and now select a new cell in the
same column
B just expand that selection to all the
cells now right click go to paste
special and now here select the
validation and press okay so you have
that validation selected over here now I
have the people from developer let's say
I'll select Kelly Kelly here and in this
particular option I'll select Ops now
here in my dropdown I can see team
members from Ops Thomas Mark Ivan right
so all the employees
from the Ops Team and here let's say I
select testing team and and uh I will
have employees from the testing column
Kathy Michael Tim Bobby Chris right so
that's how you basically create the
dependent drop down menu in Excel and
now I have started my Microsoft Excel
and you can see I have a really small
data set so let's get started by the
simple F function as we know it let's
say we want to find out the result of
the following students and there is a
criteria let's say less than or above
some number they pass and less than or
above some number they are fail right
now let's get started with the IF
function equals to if and the
cell if this number is less than 35 then
the result is fail else result is pass
now enter the answer is passed and now
if you drag the same formula across all
the cells you have the results so this
is how we basically know the function
now let's advance to a higher level
where we have multiple criteria we also
want the result like we got in the first
sheet which is pass or fail and along
with the result we also want the grade
in one single F function let's try to do
that so let's revise the simple F IF
function less than
35 then p
else
has now I have multiple level of f so F
the same cell okay we missed equals to
if the max cell is greater than equal to
80 so here we have the criteria so if it
is greater than equal to 80 then it
should be an 80
CMA another if it's similar to an ested
if which you use in programming so
another if select the IF function by
using Tab Key and then the same cell
which is E8 if it is greater than or
equal
to 65 according to the criteria then you
should be printing
B comma another nested F function if the
same cell
E8 is greater than or equal to 55 it
should be C Comm if
E8 is greater than or equal to 45 then
you must be printing
D if
E8 is greater than or equal to 35 then
we must be printing e else it should be
an F now close the bracket just ensure
that you get the black one which means
that all the brackets are in the right
place just press enter and drag the same
formula across all the rowes and you
will have the grades and to make life
easier you can also choose if s or ifs
method so let's also try to explore that
drag the same SEL Ross here and add
lines and equals to instead of a simple
if you can go to the last one which says
ifs right now ifs will make things
easier instead of using IF inside un
nested if you can just write your
conditions and your GRS so the same cell
which is E8 should be greater than or
equals to 80 then in such scenario you
can just print a comma the second
condition which is the same E8 should be
greater than or equal to 65 then you can
get a B comma if the same marks is
greater than or equals to 55 then you
can print me c comma if the same E8 is
greater than or equal to 45 then you can
print me
D just make sure that you're placing the
commas in in the right
pleas if the same E8 cell is than or
equals to 35 then you can print me e and
if it is none of those then if it is
none of those so you're indicating that
with a number one then you can print me
f
okay Enter there you
go the same formula address all the rows
and you have your grades and with that
we have covered two three methods the
simple F multiple nested F and Fs now
let's go to the next sheet where we have
another one so so far we have
concentrated on one particular cell
let's say if E8 is greater than a number
then pass or fail now let's say we have
multiple criterias the marks should be
above certain number and also along with
it you should also have attendance let's
say we have a
rock in the last section and uh we want
we if we consider the result only by
number is past but if you have a
condition that let's say if you're an
engineering student you already know
that you have a minimum criteria of 60%
of attendance right so let's say we are
judging the result of frog based on both
numers as well as ATT tendance then R is
a failure candidate right so how do you
decide based on two conditions so that's
our condition here that's our criteria
here so let's try to investigate with
the same IF function so equals to if
select the function by using Tab and
before you get ahead with the condition
try to include an and function press St
to select and now select the
cell for Marks which should be greater
than let's say 35 and also comma the
attendance cell which is f8 here to be
greater than percentage so we have the
percentage in the F column so give the
decimal numbers so what's the minimum
number what which we are looking at is
0.6 so
0.6 if both these conditions are
satisfied then print me pass else print
me fail
bracket enter now drag the same formula
across all the cells and here you have
the results so you should be getting
both numbers above 35 and the attendance
should be above 60 now this was the next
type of condition or tip for using
advanced level F conditions now coming
here so we will be using the next tip we
using F conditions so the only
difference is in place of f we will be
using the function choose so here we
have list of professors and days of a
week so let's say we need to find out
which Professor will be scheduled to
your class on a specified date right so
here we have dates and based on this
particular calendar you will be
receiving professors chenny Albert St
Gilbert Swati John and Ken now let's try
to use the choose function so first we
need to extract the week date so equals
to week date of the date comma and here
you have numbers so number one Sunday
which means it is considering Sunday as
the first day of a week according to our
calendar we have Monday as the first day
of a week so we need to select the
second one press time to select there
you go if you close the bracket you will
be receiving the number for right so on
1st of February 2020 4 we have a
Thursday right now this is not what we
need we need which Professor is going to
come here so Professor Gilbert is
expected to arrive on 1 of February so
we need to make minor changes to this so
you need we need to be using choose a
function over here press have to select
and
comma if it is first then it should be
Prof
Jenny second one is Prof
Albert so
on there you go now enter so some type
of mistake here we missed double Cod
here and now try once again there you go
now if you drag the same formula across
all the cells you have your particular
professors for the TS then and to make
things a little more easier instead of
using choose you can use index match
because we are getting the address here
right a cell address so you can use
index match equals to index of week day
press upop to select of this particular
cell comma second option choose
that so far we have the match function
and now we need to give the index for
this particular one so the index is from
K7 to k30 so this is our index and the
match we already have now press enter if
you drag the same formula across all the
cells you have your results yeah so a
small mistake here just quickly undo it
and if you double click the formula here
you can see we have not fixed the range
so let's fix the range using function
key F4 now enter now drag the same
formula across all the sales now you
should be having no errors now we are on
the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and here
I have some sales state so we have Ru ID
order ID ship date ship mode Etc so what
we are up to is to create a funnel chart
so before we create a funnel chart let's
try to get some data right so let's
create a pivot table and you know we
have a row or column named as region so
let's create five different rowes which
have the data related to NorthEast
Southwest and Central regions and let's
try to find out the highest number of
sales from a particular region that is
why we are going to sort and then let's
copy the data from the pivot table to a
new sheet because pivot table will not
allow you to create a final chart so
let's try to add those data into a new
spread sheet and let's create a funnel
chart of it so basically funnel chart
looks like a bar chart and the only
difference is the shape of the bars if
you see them vertically or horizontally
the way you're putting it then you can
find out it takes a shape of a funnel so
with that briefing let's get started now
just select any C cell on the
spreadsheet go to the insert menu and
there click on the pivot table from the
stable range so Excel will automatically
select the range and you can see the
range got highlighted with lot lines and
select the new version sheet option and
there you go and now you have the pivot
table ready and now you might want to
add some data on your pivot table
right so here is the field list so in
case if you don't find the field list
you can find it in the pivot table
analyze show button and now we want two
sections the first one is region let's
pull the region to rules the next one
can be anything it could be profit
discount quantity sales so let's go with
the sales according to our initial plan
finding out the sale and the regions so
you can uh check if the aggregation is
some not basically sometimes you might
get count or average so we wanted sum so
it's exactly the sum and now you can you
know select any cell and right click to
sorted largest to smallest now you have
the sorted list now select your data
copy and go to the new sheet past this
Here and Now go to the insert option
once again and now expand the charts
option and automatically you have
recommended charts on the front and here
the final chart is one of the
recommendations just click on that press
okay and now you have the funel chart
you can uh you know change the title to
region
wise you can also edit your chart so
let's say this is currency right so you
can go to the data types and here go to
currency and change rupees to dollars
since the data set has dollars United
States English dollars okay and if you
want to get rid of the decimal points
you can also do that and uh yeah you can
also change the colors by getting into
the colors option you can fill different
colors to different regions and uh yeah
so far so good so you can see central
region has the highest number of sales
so I have opened my data set on
Microsoft Excel now here we will
understand what exactly pivot tables are
and how to create them let's say you
wanted one single dashport on your data
set about which company or which dealer
had made how many number of orders and
price of each order sales total number
of Sales Country Etc all the details in
one single table which is dynamic just
one click or just one change or just one
new entry or you remove an entry
whatever you make changes to your data
set and and it reflects on real time so
that can be made with the help of pivot
tables so pivot tables is just a single
or process which can be done in few
clicks and you have that so the process
is really simple just select all the
data you have on your data set go to the
insert option and there you have the
pivot charts and pivot table so pivot
chart is something which will give you
the visual representation of the data
and the pivot table is something which
will also give you the visual
representation but it is regarding only
numbers but pivot chart on the other
hand is pictorial representation now we
are discussing about the pivot table now
so let's try to insert a pivot table
from the range here itself now we will
create a new worksheet for the pivot
table or you can also have it in the
same place so now let's have dealer in
the filters and uh what are the columns
you want let's say I want sales column I
want uh
country
column and I want price of each sale or
product line or let's say I want orders
number of orders now in the rows I want
okay I want a dealer in rows not in
filters we can have uh filters later you
can filter out the required you know
details now let's have sales and values
as well so we will have some of sales
and if you add country to filters you
can filter based on the country you're
looking at great right so here you have
all the required data now if I give
country as let's say I want USA press
okay and you want dealers for Luxury
Motors there you go right with the S and
you want to to check in Japan and not in
USA just click okay and there you go so
there are no sales in Japan so
similarly if you want uh in
Australia that's you get the real time
and if you wanted multiple or all just
select all and there you go so that's
how you use pivot tables in Excel V
lookup in
Excel so what exactly is vlookup
function basically V lookup function is
a lookup method involving to fetch the
data from a tabular data set Now vup
function is a pre-made function in Excel
which allows searches across columns so
basically we have three type of lookup
functions and V lookup is one of those
we have V lookup H lookup and X lookup V
lookup is vertical lookup H lookup is
horizontal lookup and X is a combination
of both V and H lookup so the syntax for
V lookup is as follows so we will have a
lookup value that is the address or the
value which you are looking for and the
table array which is the range of
elements that you want to look out for
and the column is the resultant column
from which you want the result and the
match is it supposed to be an exact
match or the nearest match so I believe
the theoretical explanation of the
syntax is incomplete without having a
practical demonstration so let's get
back to Excel and try to execute some
view lookup functions so that you have a
a lookup function and especially a
vlookup function Works in Excel right we
are on the Excel spreadsheet right now
so let's start with our simple one right
so here I will have car and price so
here I will give up a drop- down menu
using data validation so that you can
simply choose the data right so we will
go to data data
validation this
and the source will be these are the
ones for the source and press okay you
don't have to enter any error messages
Etc to know error messages and more
details on data validation in Excel
please go through the data validation in
Excel tutorial by simp down and now in
the price section we will have the V
lookup function right now the first one
lookup value which is this particular
cell right so we lookup function will
look for the value here here so let's
say I give Lamborghini and then it will
fetch the cost of Lamborghini from the
table so where is it looking for the
value first look at Value is Lamborghini
which is right in front of car in the
cell E5 so that is the first parameter
we need to provide or attribute we need
to send out then the table array which
table array should it look for this is
the table array it looks for and I'm
eliminating the header over here we need
to eliminate the header and the colum
index number right now now we are giving
the car name and now we want the price
so in the table car is column one price
is column two right even if this
particular car price is around anywhere
in the table car is still considered as
column one price is still considered as
column two so we need the value from
column two right so we will provide
column number two and the last one exact
match we want the exact match not
appropriate match so select that press
on tap to select now close the value
right close the bracket now let's get
back to card and now select any one of
the cars let's select BMW right now when
you select BMW what lookup is doing is
it is first checking the value here look
up value sbmw so since we got the value
sbmw it will go back to this particular
table and fetch for the name BMW right
and now it has the BMW data and now the
third parameters that is column two
right so it will check column two and
see the exact match what is the value of
the car 75 or 750 uh million right $7.5
million so that will give you the data
over here that's it so that's how V
lookup works now this is still a
fundamental understanding of V lookup
let's elaborate a little more to
understand it in a much better way right
now I I have here the flight data right
and here you can see when I select the
source and uh
destination and uh
flight which I want to fly in then it
it's giving me the price of the flight
and the route in which it is going how
did I do it so let's do it practically
right so we will get back
here and uh here we'll do some
changes okay it's okay fine
now here we have
everything
the source and
destination airline price on
Route and let's also
provide
route
Source will be again data validation go
to data data
validation will be a
list this is the list press okay and
destination is again data validation
select
list and now the list of
destinations and
Airline is again a data validation
operation where you will give the set of
or the list of airlines which you are
offering and okay now comes the price
equals to we look
up passing these three
values and table array which is again
the
same the entire table except the
headers next will be the column number
so 1 2 3 4 and five price is in the
fifth column so I will pass column
number five and I want exact match not
appropriate match press tab to select
close the bracket and enter
right and same applies to Route so
equals to or you can just copy the
formula and paste it here and make a
minor change that is instead of column
number five you want column number four
which has the route data right so column
number four has the route data enter and
there you go now out of the dropdown
when you select source as any U location
here let's select Mumbai and destination
as Bangalore and Airline as let's fly in
air India and you have the price details
and the rout so these particular ones
you can you know hide because the data
is coming over here so you can copy
paste it to this
place and let's hide these
things and you can also hide this one as
well
there you go now the data is visually a
little more appealing and you can kind
of have a complete you know dashboard
where you have uh the data of we lookup
results right so whenever you select any
source and give any
destination from the dropdown and choose
any of the flights you want to fly with
and you will have the data over here
right the price of the flight and the
root of the flight and that's how you
use be lookup in Excel hi welcome to
simply done YouTube channel on the
tutorial on Excel X lookup xlup was
released by Microsoft 365 in 2019 and is
meant to replace V lookup H lookup and
index match functions it enables user to
search a specific value value in table
or range in this tutorial we will show
you how to use x lookup to locate
specific values in a column or a row or
how to use filter the search result and
how to use x lookup with other function
like V lookup and if by the end of this
tutorial you will have all the tools you
need to X lookup to automate repetitive
task and improve your data analysis
skills so whether you are an Excel
beginner or a Season Pro join us as we
explore the power of XL X lookup before
we begin let me tell you guys if you are
an aspiring data analyst looking for
online training and certification from
prestigious universities and in
collaboration with leading expert you
have the most robust function skills
knowledge and what it takes to be the
best then search no more simply learn
postgraduation program in data analytics
from P University in collaboration with
IBM should be your right choice for more
details use the link in the description
box below also want to to get access to
more informative content like this one
get subscribed to our YouTube channel
and hit the Bell icon so that you are
the first to know when we host with that
mind let's get started so this is our
data set for the X lookup on Excel you
can download this data set from the
description box below so here let's
start with X lookup so here I will like
equals to
X lookup braet so first we have to write
this this is the formul for the X lookup
X lookup value X lookup lookup array
return array and these three are the
optionals okay if not found match model
and the search mode these three are the
optional so the lookup value for me is
the this stock number okay because only
only the stock number are the common on
the both you know sheets you can say so
B2 comma so now we have to see the
lookup array so lookup array will be
over this I will press the shift down
arrow okay then
enter
okay so here the next thing is return
return array so what we want to return
return in this particular column okay
that will be the price I want to print
the
price
yes ENT so before that what I will do I
will add you can add the dollar sign
using F4 I'm here adding
manually okay then dollar J dollar 12
why we are adding the dollar sign for
the
range
okay then press enter yeah so when I
will drag from here to here all the
price value will
become okay
why NA because this stock number is not
present in the particular this
sheet okay so this is how you can get
the price
but if you want if you want particular
like the size brand and price all three
what you can do you can simply drag here
okay and you can add the dollar
here and or using you can add the dollar
using F4 for um adding the manually
pres okay so as you can see we have the
size we have the brand name and we have
the price what I will do I will drag
down okay so this is how you can you
know fast the particular value using X
lookup from the different different
sheets this is how you can select the
particular
range what what if you don't
want all the three columns but you want
the size and the price and you don't
want the
brand for that what you will do you will
here
write
choose then
bracket here you get will start with the
curly
brackets here you will write the how
many columns do you need 1 2 3 4 5 6
okay so here I will write the I need the
two
columns okay then what will be your
first column uh I want My First Column
should be the
price so here I will
select I will select the
price as my first column
okay okay my
bad I
want my first
column
here I will add the dollar sign you can
use the
F4 and I want my second column should be
the
size okay here I will add the dollar
sign why we are adding dollar sign for
the particular range for the full range
of the size
okay so here I will
enter so I will drag
down okay this
is so as you can see here in the First
Column we have the price and the second
column we have the particular
size okay so this is how you can select
the particular cell for the X
lookup okay not dragging and dropping
what you want to this and this size okay
how this is you can select so now as you
can see we are getting this na value
here okay for that what you can do
double click here
so
here I will give here
comma so here as you can see if not
found okay for that what I can give the
double thises and hit that
enter and I will drag
down so as you can see the blank space
because we haven't wrote here something
okay so here I will write the
no
match
enter okay I will write here no
match
enter then I will drag it down then as
you can see here we have the custom
value now no match so this is how you
can fill the plank space or the not
matching values from your custom
values so this is how you can use the X
lookup but here we are using in a
particular single sheet you can add the
multiple sheet and you can same way you
can use the xlup as we did in the this
sheet some product in Excel so some
product in Excel so It's a combination
of both sum and product function so for
this let's imagine you in a store and
you are supposed to calculate the price
tax of certain products for the overall
products let's say a customer or a
client come to your store and he
purchased like 10 items and you have to
calculate the rate and price and the
total price right so individual item
might have its individual rate and into
number of quantity of products he per
and the sum total so you're conducting
two different operations here right so
sum product is a replacement for those
two so I have the same example here so
these are the clients these are the
products and quantity rate and you need
to calculate the price and total sum
right so ideally what you would do is
you would multiply this with
this and you will get a number and uh
similarly you would drag it all to the
end and here you would summarize
this that's how you usually do it but
what if I said you there is a shortcut
where you can do this all the way in
just one click all you have to do is
just some
product select that by pressing Tab and
now give the
Aries this one and this one you will get
the same number now some product is a
little brilliant so what I mean to say
is let's say if you wanted to calculate
for only product one quantity of product
one or the price of product one can you
do that yes absolutely just Min a change
in the formula select the same some
product and ensure that you are giving
the products column as well but ensure
that is encapsulated inside of bracket
so get the entire column close the Brack
bracket and now the
quantity ideally it should work but it
will not because we are providing a
comma here because okay let's see it so
you get zero which is not the right
answer but why because we are giving two
different parameters and out of the
first two the first one where we have B3
to B8 this particular parameter is
acting or it is returning a Boolean
value so to make sure that the Boolean
value yields into an actual value
instead of comma you should be providing
a star now it will work okay we forgot
to encapsulate this one inside a bracket
as
well here it's really
simple we have to give a referencing
cell so let's say I'm adding the
referencing cell over here and this
particular value should be equals to to
this cell and now I think it should work
there you go so that's how you can use
some product in Excel and if you want to
calculate the price tag the value or the
formula is a little
similar again D
product press tab to select the function
and um the array should be equals to
this particular value make sure to
encapsulate that
within a bracket and then you finish the
formula by giving a star and the rate I
think we also need the quantity
here enter yeah that's the
value yeah and that's how we use some
product in Excel so average if is
basically an average function but with
an F condition let's say if you have
multiple departments in your industry or
or in your office and your HR asked you
to find the average salary of all the
employees who are present in a certain
Department let's say development team
then you might have to create a new
table with all the employees in the
development team and then find out the
average but what if I say there is one
such average formula which comes with a
condition called if and using a
combination of average and if you can
find out that average number just within
a few clicks yeah that's exactly what we
are going to do today so for that let's
get back to Excel spreadsheet where we
have the data set ready so this is our
employee data set and here we have the
same use case we have a lot of people
from a lot of designations or a lot of
departments now let's try to find out
the average salary of all the employees
who are present in development team so
the formula is really simple equals to
average F and range
comma you want the value as to be
present as department so we will be
adding it in between double codes so
development closing it now the salary
range select the salary column press
enter there you go so the average value
of or average salary of the employees
present in development team is around
38333 per per month if you're
considering this in rupees this could be
per month if you're considering this in
terms of dollars it can be per anom and
that's how you use average F in Excel
now let's quickly get onto the Practical
mode where we will have some data sets
over which we will be trying to apply
the charts now there are various types
of charts in table and those are the pie
chart the column chart the bar chart
column versus line pavier chart and
Spark line charts so so we will discuss
one after the other first let us discuss
about the pie chart so as you can see we
have a small data set on my screen which
I have personally created and uh this
deals with the companies and this deals
with the shares of the automobile
industry so now for this let's create a
pie
chart select all the data and then get
into the toolbar and inside the toolbar
you can see various options and inside
that we're going to use the insert
option and when you select the insert
option you will have a ribbon here and
inside the ribbon you can see groups
tables illustrations addin and here you
go these are the charts so now we needed
a pie chart so select on that icon and
you have various types of pie charts you
have two dimensional pie charts three
dimensional pie charts donut type of
charts Etc right so I would like to go
with the three-dimensional pie chart as
it looks a little more appealing and
easy to understand and now there you go
this is the title of the chart and these
are the legends of the chart and this is
the chart area and these are the values
now we can uh you know kind of add the
data labels as well so you can just have
to press the plus icon over here and
you'll have the options you can add the
data labels which will give you a lot
more interesting
values and uh you can also turn this
around as you can see we on double
clicking any part of the pie chart
you'll get this option which is called
as format data point and uh let's
imagine that you wanted to show the
information related to this particular
one which is Volvo which has the biggest
share so this is in front right now now
what if you wanted to show the
information related to data which is
over here right for that you can select
this particular Arrow key and you can
just twist it and there you go it is
coming in front this this will be a a
great way of presenting your data to
your clients
right yeah and there is another option
where you can directly explode this like
you can pick it out you can see this
right Point explosion where you can
split it out and you can show that
especially like you can highlight it and
show it so that's the you know a great
way of presenting your data so that's
how you can work with pie charts in
Excel now let's quickly move to the next
one that is the column chart and in the
column chart we have the data related to
some company and uh the profits of that
company based on a year so you can see
that the year has started from 2008 and
it has gone until
2021 and these are the profits of that
company year after year so since we are
dealing with column chat I'll tell you
the simplest way to create a column chat
there is a shortcut key for that which
is alt f F1 and there you go you have
the chart right on your
screen now you can uh expand the chart
just by dragging it like that and you
can see that there is some problem with
this chart that is we have numbers here
instead of years right you can see that
the First Column is the years which is
2008 to 2021 but here you can see we
have 1 2 3 4 which is not proper right
so to change the axis that is you can
see the axis which is 1 2 3 4 from 1 2 3
4 to the years 2008 2009 2010 11 Etc you
just have to make one change here and
also you can see I have pressed the plus
icon over here which will open the
option where you can include the access
titles if you have and data labels
everything right so for now I think I'll
keep it as it is so you can include the
data table as well as it is here and you
can include that in the chart there are
various options that Excel provides you
so now let's uh focus on changing the
axis from 1 2 3 4 to the ears for that
you need to select the chart design and
inside the chart design you have an
option called select data press that and
here you have various set of options you
can see profits you can see ears now
we'll select ears and we will remove
that and now you can see the edit option
here right select that and now it will
ask you which column to be selected for
the access range for that let's select
this and now let's select the ears
here and press okay and there you go
again press okay so there you go you
have the ears over here instead of the
numbers which you had in the first place
so that's how you create the column
chart and we have the next type of chart
which is really simple
now you know you kind of change this
chart directly into bar chart there is
no big deal in
that so uh for that you just need to
select the change chart type option over
here you're just changing the chart type
and you can get the bar graph over here
column and bar graphs are completely
same to each other only that you can see
these uh bars in the horizontal way
rather than in the vertical way let's do
that let's not create a new thing for
that so uh yeah there you go when you
select the change chart type option you
have various set of chart type options
on the menu bar over here so what we
needed was the bar chart now let's
select that and there you go let's
select okay and you have the bar
chart right and you if you want you can
include the data labels which look a
little bit more interesting you can also
include the data table as
well okay for now I think we have to
expand the chart chart to get the Clear
View yeah that's how you do
it right now let's move into the next
type of one yeah we dealt with the bar
chart so we'll directly enter into the
column versus line chart so we have
similar kind of data we just had year
and profits in the previous part now we
also have included the expenses right we
needed another column to showcase the
line chart compared to the columns right
so for that I've included a new column
that is expenses Al as well now just
let's select the
data and let's select the option alt F1
to create our
chart right now
automatically uh Excel has provided us
the column chat we have The Columns of
expanses we have the column of profits
and we also have ears now let's change
the data as we did before for select uh
here and remove it and then
edit select edit and select the year
that is from here to
2021 select okay and we have the ears
over here now what we needed to do is
change the chart type right select the
change chart type option and since we
wanted to create a column versus line
chart it is a combination whenever you
want one or two types of charts included
in one single chart window then it is a
combo option so here we need to select
the combo option and inside that we have
various types of combination charts we
have clustered column we have clustered
line on secondary axis we have clustered
stat areas clustered column and the
other one is custom combination so let's
go with the first one that is clustered
line let's select that and there you go
we have the the line graph with the
column so that's how we create the
column versus line and if you want you
can include the data labels and you can
include the data table as well yeah okay
I think uh we need to expand the can was
a little more to get a clear
view
yeah so you have Legends over here you
have the data labels and accesses
everything and chart title you can
always change the chart title so for now
let's uh rename it as profits versus
expenses yeah that's that's how it
goes done okay I think I made a spelling
mistake
here yeah it's clear
now now the next type of chart we're
going to deal with is the P
chart so uh we have dealt with P chart
column chart bar chart and column versus
line now P chart is a little bit
different it's like you're going to
create some active chart which responds
to the variations you're making to your
data so to understand that better let's
create a practical chart over here I
select all the
data
okay yeah I have selected the data now
to create a pivot
chart let's
select the insert option from the
toolbar and inside the ribbon we have
charts group and inside that we have PIV
chart now let's select the PIV chart
option and there you go now it's asking
for range and we have selected the range
over there and uh we are not going to
create a new worksheet for the entire
chart we are going to create the uh
chart inside the existing worksheet
itself so for that let's select the uh
area where we want to select the uh
chart to be present now for that let's
select this
and yeah select
okay okay there is some
error let's cancel this and try
again let's select the data
and previous chart
again we have selected the
range
yeah that's how you select the range and
now select the position where you want
to create it existing worksheet we have
selected that and press okay yeah that's
that's the way we've got our P chart
over here and you can see our P chart is
completely blank right now it will
respond to the changes you make to your
P chat for now we have uh serial numbers
and U these are the names of the guys
who
have okay so these are the names of the
guys who have some dealerships for
various car makes such as Ford Ferrari
Honda Kia Alpha Romeo BMW etc etc so uh
we're going to change or we're going to
see um you know we're going to make some
charts of the persons who own the cars
or the car brands or dealerships in
various regions so we're going to work
on that now let's drag in the
name and uh let's drag
region and
cards and
units yep so we have our uh chart over
here column chart which has the
different different names and the
dealerships and some of cars over there
right so you can see that we can also
change some values over here what if we
wanted to know only uh the details
regarding Jennifer you can do that you
can unselect everything and you can just
select Jennifer and press okay now
you'll have the details of only Jennifer
of having the car brands so we have the
regions as well so Jennifer owns
dealerships in two different regions
that is South and West and uh the sum of
units and count of cars as well so
that's how the PV charts are used in
real
time and now let's select sales and drag
the sales as
well yeah it's been dragged and you have
the sales of U Jif
for the details of her sales and let's
move the chart a little bit and you have
the plus icon where you can include the
data labels for a better
information yeah so that's how you use
the P charts so we are on the last type
of charts which is the spark line chart
Now to create a spark line chart we need
to get into the insert option and insert
we have the ribbon and inside the ribbon
we have the group that is spark lines
now
to generate a spark line chart we need
to select this particular column and
then select the type of spark line you
want to create for now let's create the
column type of spark line chart yep we
have to Club these cells together first
we forgot that because we're going to
insert the spark line chart right above
here now for that let's merge the
cells
[Music]
for
yeah so uh we wanted to create
the spark line chart of column type and
now it's asking for the location where
we want to create the sparkk line chart
so this is the location now let's select
okay and there you go we have the spark
line chart right over here now you can
see that we have a negative Point here
so if you want you can change that from
negative to positive and it will
automatically update that and if you
want to add the access to this
particular chart you can select the
options spark line and there go you have
certain options like High Point low
point and if you wanted to add some
mares and you can also do
that add the data type access and there
you go you have the
access
show access yeah you have the access now
and you can have the high point and low
point for that as well which is the you
know the biggest change and the smallest
change in this particular segment that
is few Furniture yeah Furniture had the
highest sales in January and uh Home
Appliance had the lowest sale and you
can also change the
color and uh let's type of change the
color again yeah we have a different
color over here which resembles a little
bit more better or you can also go with
this one and if you wanted to add the
same to all these tables you can do that
just by dragging it and you have it for
all the 6
months now if we wanted to add some new
data in this row or you wanted to add a
new complete row then you can do that as
well and change that and bring that
change implemented in these charts as
well now let us try to add a new row
here which includes the miscellaneous we
have have that data right over here
let's select that copy and uh let's
paste it over here so there you go we
have the extra row here so yeah now we
have added the miscellaneous row and
right now we have the spark line chart
for only four columns or four rows that
is Furniture technology home appliances
and office needs and miscellaneous is
missing now to add that as well let's
select spark line and inside spark line
just select edit Group location and data
and now let's select the entire
data and now select
okay there's something wrong
again spot line edit
data select
range
this should be helping yeah there you go
we have all the five rows now including
Furniture technology home appliances
office needs and
miscellaneous now for this particular
example we going to use the employees
data now let's quickly get back to the
Practical mode and enter into
Excel now you can see that we are on
Excel sheet right right now so let me
expand my screen a little
bit so that the data is a little more
visible yeah so here on my screen you
can see that we have employees data so
the First Column is the name of the
employees and the second column is the
start dates of the employees that when
have they started working with the
organization and when they have ended or
resigned to their position in that
particular organization and the duration
gives us the number of days they have
worked in that particular or
organization so to create a gan chart is
really simple you just have to select
the data and then go to the insert
option and in there you can see the
charts icon and select all charts and in
that select the bar chart and here you
can see the Stacked bar chart select
that and press okay and there you go you
have the Stacked bar chart right on your
screen let's expand this a little more
so that we have the clear visualization
of the dates as well now you can if you
want you can change the title as org
data or employe
data and now we are partially done with
our chart now the next thing we have to
do is select the bar chart right click
on it select data and here select the
add icon now you need to select the
series name so the series name is
duration for our Gant chot and series
values are or let's select this and
select let's move a
little yeah so these are the data series
let's select okay and you can see the
Gan chat on my screen right here select
okay and it's done and still now it's
not complete yet so to finish it you
need to select the blue colored bars
here and write click on them and select
format data
series go to the fill icon and select
nol and it's done for now and you can
see that there is a difference in this
particular arrangement we had Joe at the
first place and Susan at the last place
but here you can see Joe is in the last
place and Susan is in the first place so
we need to make some arrangements here
for that right click select format
access and then here you can see
categorize in reverse
order and there you go you have your
Gant chart right on your screen right on
my screen you can see a circular
progress tracker so it is tracking the
percentage of the first student that is
Stacy now let's try to change the marks
of Stacy from engineering subject from
55 to
75 and uh engineering subject 4 from 68
to 84 then you can see the percentage is
getting changed and also the same is
getting implemented on the progress
tracker interesting right would you like
to create a similar circular progress
tracker yes that can be done that's
exactly what we discussing today so
let's get started with our onepoint
agenda that is circular progress tracker
in Excel now let's get back to the
Practical mode so let us enter into a
duplicate sheet which has all the marks
of the students so now we are on the
duplicate sheet we have all the students
names and the marks list and also the
percentage now let us create a new
column which states the actual
percentage minus the overall percentage
so the overall percentage is 100 and the
actual percentage is uh 75 76 and so on
let's try to calculate this or let's try
to convert it into the percentage
format
now let's try to change some
values
yeah
good now let's try to change this yeah
we were supposed to add the percentage
symbol which we forgot now it's
implemented there now let's drag it
again so there you go we have the
remaining percentage as well so we have
the actual percentage and the remaining
percentage so we need both of them to
apply the donut chart so we have
selected both the percentages and now
we'll enter into insert menu
then you can see um pie chart icon over
here click that and you have a donut
chart over here select that and you have
the Donate chart so now let's remove the
symbols which we don't need so we have
removed the uh details of one and two
there and uh let's change this to
Circular
progress tracker so we have removed the
Legends and we have renamed the chart
name as circular progress tracker and
now let's try to insert the percentage
icon or the text chart so we have the
text chart or text box option over here
select that drag and drop it
here yeah we have the text box here
select that go to the formula bar select
equals to and now select the address
cell there you go you have it now we
have the percentage in the text box now
you can make your edits I'll bring it to
Center alignment to Center text color to
Blue as we have it on the Outer Circle
and you can change the font you can make
it bold increase the font
size there go so we have the progress
tracker okay let's try to group the text
box with the chart so that we can move
them all
together
fine so now you can make some changes
and see if that's working or not so
let's make the change to the engineering
subject one from 32 to 68 and press
enter there you go the changes have been
applied the percentage got changed to 78
from 72 and the same has been
implemented here and even the progress
chart is also working on the same way so
so that's how you create the circular
progress charts in Excel so how to
create a PIV chart you ask it is really
simple all you need to do is just follow
few steps and you have your PIV chart
ready which is completely interactive
now all you have to do is select any
cell in the data set you have and rush
into the insert toolbar then in the
group of charts you have an option
called pivot chart select on it now
you'll be asked to select the data range
and you you can see Excel has
automatically select all the range that
you want to include in your PIV chart
then you have another option which is
asking you to either create the PIV
chart in the current worksheet or a new
worksheet for now let's select a new
worksheet and there you go voila the
pivot chart is completely ready you
might ask me this is completely empty
yes the default pivot chart what you get
from Excel will be completely empty but
you can add the Legends and all the that
you want to add onto your PIV chart just
by dragging and dropping the data from
the right hand side of your Excel sheet
that is from the P chart Fields so you
can see we have various options region
category state subcategory sales
quantity Etc now I'll add
region I'll add region to
access and comparatively we will see the
sales that are happening in those
particular regions by by dragging sales
into values now you have all the data in
the form of pivot chart which is
completely interactive which represents
the sales happening in those regions now
you can also select a particular region
right by default all the regions are
selected but if you want to select only
Central then you can do that by
deselecting everything and select only
Central and select okay and there you go
you have all the data related to the
sales happening in the central region
now if you want to you know kind of see
all the uh categories of sales happening
in all the regions you can drag the
category into values again and uh in the
region part okay I think we have to add
category into Legends yes now select uh
regions that that is all regions and
select okay and you can see the category
wise sales in all regions at one single
goal and I hope you did not observe it
clearly uh the Excel also gives you the
completely prepared pivot table as well
right which is also interactive you can
also get to choose the data from here as
well and select okay and you'll see that
being reflected on the pivot chart so
here you can see both pivot table and
pivot charts are completely interactive
on my screen you can see a small data
set the data set is about students and
their marks in the sixth semesters
right now we should be creating a new
heat map to describe their rankings Now
to create a heat map the procedure is
really simple just contr a select the
entire data go to the Home tab and there
you can see the Styles group and in the
Styles group click on the conditional
formatting now out of all the options go
to the color scales and when you open
the color scales you can see some types
of maps select the green yellow red
Scale map which should show green for
highest yellow for mediate and red for
low right this is how you create a heat
map just select the first option and
there you go the heat map has been
successfully generated the green colored
cells indicate the highest marks orange
and yellow color indicate the
intermediate marks or the average marks
and the red color indicates the lowest
marks that's how you create heat maps in
Excel welcome to this video tutorial and
dashboards in Excel in this video we'll
be creating two dashboards using the
Sample Sales data set so if you want to
get the data and the dashboard file that
we'll be creating in this demo then
please put your email IDs in the comment
section of the video our team will share
the files via
email now let's begin by understanding
what is a dashboard in
Excel a dashboard is a visual interface
that provides an overview of key
measures relevant to a particular
objective with the help of charts and
graphs dashboard reports allow managers
to get a high level overview of the
business and help them make quick
decisions there are different types of
dashboards such as strategic dashboards
analytical dashboards and operational
dashboards an advantage of dashboards is
the quick detection of outliers and
correlations with Comprehensive data
visualization it is time-saving as
compared to running multiple
reports with this understanding let's
jump into our demo for creating our
dashboards we'll be using a sample sales
data set let me show you the data set
first
so here is the sales data set that we'll
be using for our demo so this data set
was actually generated using a simulator
and is completely random it was not
validated though we have applied certain
transformations to the data using power
query features so this data as you can
see has thousand rows so using the
simulator we had generated thousand rows
of
data similarly if I go on top you can
see this data set has has 17 columns now
let me give you a brief about each of
the columns so first we have the region
column so we have Middle East and North
Africa there's North America Asia
subsaharan Africa and others similarly
we have the country names from which the
item was ordered the third column is the
item type so we have different items
Cosmetics vegetables there's baby food
cereal fruits Etc then we have the
representatives name or you can say this
as the customer name who ordered the
product then we have a sales Channel
column so there are basically two
channels whether the item was sold
offline or online next we have the order
priority column now here C stands for
critical then we have H which is for
high priority orders then we have M for
medium priority orders and finally we
have L which is for low priority orders
you can see the order date column then
we have the order ID the ship date next
we have units sold which is basically
the total number of units sold for each
item then we have the unit price column
this is the price at which each product
was sold then we have the unit cost
column which is basically the production
cost for each of the items next we have
the total revenue the total revenue is
actually the the product of unit sold
and unit price then we have the total
cost column now the total cost column is
actually the product of unit sold and
the unit cost similarly we have the
total profit column so total profit is
the difference between total revenue and
the total cost and finally we have
created two more columns that is order
year and then we have order month now
these two columns were actually
generated using the power query features
so we use the order date column which is
this column and extracted order year and
Order
month so first we are going to create a
revenue dashboard where we'll focus on
generating reports for Revenue by order
year Revenue by year and region Revenue
by order priority and much more we'll
create separate po tables and po charts
and format them to make them look more
interesting and presentable We'll add
slices and timeline to our dashboards in
order to filter it based on specific
fields
now let's create our first report to see
the total revenue generated each year so
we need to create a p table for this
I'll click on a cell in my data set and
then I'll go to the insert tab here we
have the option to select the pivote
table I click on this you can
see my table range is
selected next I want to place my pivote
table in a new worksheet and let's just
just click on okay there you go so we
have a new sheet where I can place my P
table so first I need to find the total
revenue generated by each year so what
I'll do is I'll drag my order year
column under rows and then I'll select
the total revenue column under
values you can see I have my puot chart
ready now if you want you can sort this
so from the data you can see we have
order Year from 2010 to
2017 now based on this data let's create
our pivote chart so I'll click on any
cell go to insert and here you have the
option to select recommended charts I
click on this now actually I want a line
chart so I'll click on line here and
select
okay there you go so we have
successfully created our first pivot
chart now let me show you how you can
format this chart to make it more
readable so first let me delete these so
I'll right click and select hide all
field buttons on the chart so this will
delete the buttons present on the chart
now let me go ahead and edit the chart
title so the title I want is total
revenue I'll type it
down by
Year all right next let's do a few more
Transformations so if I click on this
plus sign which is actually for chart
elements we have some options like to
add access access titles chart title
data labels this grid lines Legend and
others okay so let's remove the legend
now you can see the total Legend is gone
now let me add access titles so we label
our x- axis and y axis so here under x
axis I can write it
as
year similarly on the y axis I'll put
Revenue okay now you can move a bit all
right now
let me select this chart Style option
and go to Colors
first here I'll select yellow color okay
and then let me go back to style let's
select a new style from this
list I
want this style okay now you can also
add data labels so I'll just click on
Dat data labels you can see we have the
revenue for each of the years now this
is not readable at all so we'll format
this a
bit if I click on this Arrow here I have
more
options if I scroll down you can see we
have something called as number here
I'll expand this and under category I'll
select
custom now here
will give a format
code which is a bit
different so this is actually a kind of
a formula so I'll write if my Revenue
value is greater than let's say 9 lakh
999,000 let me make sure there are six
nines here so 1 2 3 4 5 and six okay we
are good to go go I'll close the
bracket I'll give a
hash give to
commas so if the revenue is greater than
999,000 I'll put it in the format of
millions So within double quotes I'll
write
M I'll give a
semicolon followed by another
hash and if the value is less than
the desired
number it should be 0 million let me
click on
add all right you can see how nicely we
have formatted our data and you see here
we
have added the new format which is in
millions all right now if you want you
can go ahead and adjust
the boxes let me move this a bit up I'll
delete this
now if you notice this line chart you
can make a few conclusions for example
if you see here in
2010 the total revenue generated was
nearly 175 million now this came down to
150 million in
2011 then the revenue constantly grew
from 2011 till
2014 it reached 195 million and after
2014 it again came down to 188 million
and the revenue dropped significantly
between 2016 and
2017 in 2017 the revenue was just 96
million now before moving ahead to my
next chart let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write it as
Revenue by Year all
right
now let's analyze the revenue generated
each each year in different regions so
for this we'll create another peot table
let me close this I'll click on any cell
go to insert and select pivote table I
just click okay so that my pivote table
is placed on a new sheet all right now
this time we want the revenue by each
year and region so first of all let's
drag region to
columns then
let's drag the order ear column under
row and then I'll select total revenue
onto values so here you can see we have
the pivote table ready so for 2010 you
can see in Asia this was the revenue
generated similarly if you see for
2013 this was the total revenue
generated in Europe and we have for
other years as well now let's create a
line chart based on this pivote table so
I'll select any cell in the pivote table
I'll go to insert and I'll click on
recommended charts from this list I'll
select my line chart and click on okay
there you go so we have our next pivote
chart
ready so on the right you see the
different regions that are present in
different colors let me just expand it
so that you can see all the regions we
have have so in total we
have seven
regions and each of the regions have
been represented in different
colors so if you notice this
graph for the subsaharan African region
in
2012 subsaharan Africa made the highest
amount of
sales now from the sample data you can
also tell that the revenue for North
America has been significantly low
compared to other regions similarly if
you
see for
Europe This was the revenue Trend
between 2010 and
2017 so if you see here in 2011 the
sales were at this level then it
significantly dropped in
2012 then in
2013 there was a huge Spike and then in
again came down in 2015 and so on so you
can make your own conclusions by looking
at these line charts now let's format
this chart so first of all let's delete
the field buttons present on the chart
and we'll
also delete the Legend all right now let
me just reduce the size of the
chart next we'll add a chart tiple title
so
we'll give the title as
Revenue by year and
region
okay you can also format the y axis in
terms of
millions so I'll right click on this
access and I'll select format
access I'll scroll down and here we have
the number drop down let me scroll again
under category I'll select custom and
will use this format that we created for
our previous chart there you go you can
see our access labels have been changed
in terms of millions now so let's close
this and let me save it now you can
reduce the font size or increase the
font size let me just show you suppose
you want to increase the font size of
the chart title so you just select it
and from here you can either reduce or
you can increase you can see now it's 12
if you want you can make it 16 similarly
you can also edit the access labels also
by selecting the chart title you can
also move it to left or right or you can
place it in the center as well for the
time being let me just keep it to the
left all right now we'll see the revenue
and total cost first by each region and
we'll create a combo chart for this so
let me show you how to do it I'll go to
my data sheet I have my cell
selected go to insert and click on
pivote table let me just click on okay
all right so for this I'll select my
region on two
rows and
then I'll have two two columns under
values the first one is going to be
total revenue and the next column will
be the total cost column all right so
here we have the pivote table ready now
based on this pivote table let's create
our pivote chart so I'll go to
recommended charts and if you see below
at the bottom we have combo chart so
this is the preview of the combo
chart all right now let me just click on
okay
there you go so we have a nice combo
chart ready here now the way to look at
it is the bars represent the total
revenue which is this
column now the line
represents the total cost so let me go
ahead and edit this chart a bit so first
of all let's delete the field buttons
all right and let's also remove the
legend from here
next we'll add data labels so I'll click
on data labels here okay so these are
the data labels
for the bars or the revenue column now
let's format the data labels in terms of
millions so I'll click on this Arrow go
to more options if I scroll down I have
number from here I'll select custom
and I'll choose my type that is in
millions all right so you can see we
have formatted our data next thing we'll
add a chart title so here I'll write
as
Revenue
by
region it's actually revenue and total
cost by
region before moving ahead let me rename
the sheets as well I'll write revenue
and total
cost
similarly sheet three also I'm going to
rename it as
Revenue
by year and
region so this makes your sheet more
readable all right now moving
ahead next we are interested to get the
revenue generated by order priority and
for this we are going to create a pie
chart so let's go to the data sheet and
create our P table first and click on
okay now I'll select order priority
under rows and under value values I'll
select total
revenue so this is a very simple pivote
table so you have your order priority so
C is for critical H is for high L is for
low and M is for medium now based on
this let's create a pie chart so I'll go
to recommended charts and here you have
pie chart I want to select this 3D type
of pie chart and I'll click on okay all
right so we have our pie chart ready let
me just resize it and from here I'll
remove the field buttons and I also
don't need the legend so I'll delete
this as well all right now let's give a
chart title so this is going to be
Revenue
by order
priority now let's add our data labels
I'll check this option okay now let's
again format this in terms of
millions so
here I'll click on the last option I'll
go to numbers under category I'll select
custom and my type is going to be in
terms of millions there you go let me
close
this I will just move this to the
center all
right
now if you want you can change the color
of the text as well so let's have it in
white color and see how it looks okay so
this looks pretty decent
cool
now moving to our next report so this
time we are going to find the total
revenue by countries so we have multiple
countries present in our data set we
want to visualize the revenue gen
generated in each country so for this we
are going to create a horizontal bar
chart so let me show you how to do it
but before moving ahead let me just
rename this sheet so I'll write
Revenue
by I'll just put op which stands for
order priority all right now let's
create our horizontal bar chart I'll go
to insert click on pivote table and
select
okay so I want want my Revenue based on
different countries so I'll select
country and put it under row and then
I'll choose total revenue and place it
under values so here you have the
different country names we have
Afghanistan this Albania let me scroll
down you have
Bangladesh there
are a number of countries you have Czech
Republic there's Estonia France Gabon
similarly if you scroll down we have
India there Jamaica Italy and all the
way to the bottom if you go we have New
Zealand this Netherlands Philippines
Portugal we also
have
Singapore lots and lots of
countries we have the UAE United States
of America Zimbabwe and
others all right let me go up so based
on this pivote table let's create our
pivote chart so I'll go to insert and
select recommended charts from here I'm
going to select the column chart you can
see the preview here and let me click on
okay all right so here you can
see the different country names at the
bottom and the revenue for each of the
countries let's go ahead and edit this
chart so first of all I'll
delete the field buttons okay and let me
also remove the
legend here here I'll write
Revenue
by
countries this is going to be my chart
title
okay let's format this chart a little
more so I'll click on this option and
we'll select a new style let's
say I'll
select style six okay and let me now go
under colors and we'll select the color
of the bars so let's choose this color
okay so you have a horizontal column
chart ready and at the bottom you can
see the different country names and we
have
the
revenue
cool
now let me go ahead and rename this
sheet so I'll write Revenue
by
countries and hit enter
okay and finally we'll create another
report which is going to be part of our
Revenue dashboard and this is revenue by
items so we'll visualize our revenue for
different items present in the table so
if you see this we have Cosmetics
vegetables cereal fruits there's cloths
snacks households and other products as
well so let's check the revenue for each
of these
items so we'll continue the same drill
I'll create my P table on a new
worksheet and this time I'm going to
drag item type under row and we'll have
the total revenue under
values so here on the left of the table
you can see we have the different item
names and then we have the total revenue
so let me just s this total
revenue from largest to smallest so you
can see here office supplies meet the
highest amount of Revenue followed by
household then cosmetics and fruits meet
the lowest amount of Revenue
I'll click on this go to insert and
select recommended charts this time I'm
going to create a bar chart so this is
how my bar chart is going to look like
I'll select okay all right now let's
format this chart a
bit I'll delete the field buttons and
I'll delete the legend as
well
and let's edit the chart title so this
is going to
be
Revenue by items
cool we also want to change
the color of the bars so I've have
selected all the bars I'll go to my home
Tab and here let's say I want to select
green color all
right I've edited my chart a bit now
let's make
it
14 and I'll remove the
Bold okay here if you want you can
change the font Also let's keep it in
blue color all
right finally let's rename this sheet so
I'll write Revenue by
items cool finally now it's time for us
to merge all the charts that we have
created to our dashboard so let me show
you how you can create the dashboard
I'll create a new sheet and first thing
I'm going to do is I'll click on The
View Tab and uncheck grid lines so this
will remove the grid lines present in
the worksheet next I'm going to insert
an image so we'll have background image
on our dashboard so the way to do is
I'll go to the insert Tab and under
illustrations I have the option to
select pictures or insert pictures so
I'm going to insert picture present on
the device that is my
computer I'll go to desktop and here I
have a folder called Excel dashboard
files and I'll select this dashboard
background and hit
insert so this is going to insert an
image now let me just drag this image so
it covers a fairen of
portion so I'll hit shift and I'll drag
it all
right so you can see I have successfully
added a background image if you want you
can still will expand this background
image a bit to the right
cool now the next
thing is going to be the title of the
dashboard so I'll click on insert and
here I have the option to select a text
box so I'll click on a text box
and I'm going to place a text box in the
middle
and I'm going to name this text box as
Excel Revenue
dashboard on
sales
I'll centrer line
it let's do some more formatting so I'll
select this text box on the top you can
see
shape
format here I'm going to expand this
shape fill and I'll select no fill so my
text box is transparent now and I'll
also remove the outline all right now
let me just double click on the title of
my dashboard and I'm going to
select a font you can select whichever
font you
want let me stick to britanica
bold and I'll increase the size to let's
say 30 all right I'll just drag the text
box I'll make the text as white instead
of black all right so we have
our title of the dashboard ready now if
you want you can also insert some icons
to this dashboard so I'll go to insert
and I'll click on illustrations again
and select
pictures I'm going to
add this two pictures which is of a
store and a
cart to make it
look visually appealing so I'll place
the
icons here and similarly let me just
copy
it and I'll place the
cart and the
store to the right as
well all
right
next the idea is
to bring in all the charts that we have
created and place it on the
dashboard so let me
copy each of the charts and place it on
on the dashboard so I'll hit crl V to
paste
it and we'll resize this as
well all
right similarly let me bring in all the
other charts as
well all right so now you can see I have
added all my charts and graphs to this
dashboard so you can see here we have
our line charts are are column charts
the combo charts the Spy chart and
others now let me go ahead and format
these charts a little more so you can
see this looks a bit cluttered so let's
adjust the labels let me bring this down
similarly I'll bring 190
million a little
below all right this looks fine now
one more thing we are going to do
is we'll remove the white background
from each of the charts and make it
transparent so let me show you how to do
it so I'll select this chart then I'll
right click and go to format chart
area here on the right you see we have
an option called No fill so if I select
no fill you can see the white background
is gone now similarly let me also remove
the grid lines so I'll select the grid
lines and hit delete so you have also
removed the grid lines from here now
let's also remove the white outline that
we have so I'll select this chart go to
format and here I'll go to shape outline
and I'll select no outline you see this
so we have our total revenue by year
which is a line chart and this is
completely transparent now now what I'm
going to do is I'll place this chart
over a box
so I'll go to insert and in insert we
have the option to create a shape so
I'll click on illustrations and here
I'll choose a shape and let me select a
rectangle so I'll just create a
rectangle
here all right and now what I'll do is
I'll select this and bring this to front
I'll right click and choose
bring to front and I'll place this
shape below it all right now the next
thing is to edit the shape so first I'll
change the color of this box so let me
select this blue color and and let me
increase the transparency so I'll right
click and go to format shape here I'll
increase the transparency let's keep it
to
25% or let's say 20% all right next
thing we'll just convert all the font to
white
color including the axis labels the
chart
title will
also convert all
the access labels to white color so it
looks better now we'll just just adjust
our chart over
here next thing let's just remove the
outline so I'll go to shape outline and
I'll select no outline you see we have
now formatted our chart let's just pull
this a little
up all right now we'll add this blue
background to all the other charts so
we'll first add the background make it
transparent and then we'll convert the
font text to white color to make it more
readable and visible so for the time
being I'll just pause the video and come
back
again all right so now you can see on
your screens we have nicely formatted
our dashboard so I have added a few
logos for each of the charts you can see
the logos here so for Revenue by
countries we have a globe then then if
you see here this is kind of a map or a
location similarly we have all formatted
the color of the bars then we have also
formatted the labels in terms of
millions if you look on the y axis even
the revenue for year in region are all
formatted in terms of
millions if you want this you can also
format the total year by Revenue in
terms of Millions so the way to do is
you can select this graph right click
and go to format
access here if I scroll down you have
numbers and under category I'll select
custom then I'll select my type as this
format which is in
millions and you see here we have
successfully formatted our y- AIS
labels all right
so the next thing is to add slicers and
timelines to our dashboard now slicers
are used to format your data based on a
particular column suppose if you want to
see Revenue by certain items you can add
item as a slicer and you can view the
entire dashboard similarly for timelines
you can add date columns so if you want
to see what was the amount of sales or
revenue generated on a particular year
or a particular month you can do that
using a timeline so I'll select one of
the charts and then either you can go to
the insert Tab and here you can see
under filters we have slices and
timeline or if you go to the pivote
Chart analyze tab here also you have
insert slicer and timeline option so I
select insert slicer here first now it's
giving me the list of fields present in
the data set so I'll select country
region and let's say we want to know by
item type and sales channel so these are
going to be my four slicers I'll click
on
okay you can see it here we have our
four slicers here and these are the list
of values under region we have Asia this
Europe North America and others
similarly we have the different country
names for Country slicers and then for
item type also we have all the items
that were present in our data set
now moving ahead we need to connect all
the slicers to a dashboard so what I'll
do is I'll right
click on this option and I'll go to
report
connections okay so under report
connections you have all the pivote
tables that we
created currently see only one of the
pivote table is selected so we need to
select all the pivot tables so let me
check all the P tables present in this
workbook and click on okay all right now
that we have connected one of our
slicers we'll now connect the other
remaining slicers so I'll right click on
this go to report connections and I'll
check all the pivote tables present in
this worksheet click on okay similarly
let's do it for the country slicer I'll
go to report connections and let me
select all the pivote
tables and finally we have the item type
so I'll right click go to report
connections and then I'll select all my
Pivot
tables and let's hit okay all right now
let me just organize this a bit bit so
I'll place my Pivot
tables to the
right I'll just reduce the
size let me scroll
down I'll
add my region slicer
here
similarly I'll add my f Min slicer that
is sales Channel now in our next
dashboard which is going to be the
profit dashboard I'll show you how to
add a
timeline all right now I have arranged
all my
slicers so let's say you want to find
the revenue that was generated for an
item type let's say beverages so you can
just select beverages here and all your
charts show the respective revenues so
you have the total revenue by year for
beverages
only similarly here you can see the
revenue by year and region only for
beverages item type if I scroll
down now this chart represents the
revenue that was generated in each of
the countries only for item type
beverages let me just uncheck it
all
right let's say you want to
see the revenue generated for a country
like India so I have selected India here
and now you can
see my graph has changed only for
country
India you can see here it is showing
only for India
now now similarly you can also filter
your revenues based on the different
regions let's say you want to know the
revenue generated based on sales channel
so we have two sales channel that is
offline and online suppose you want to
know the revenue generated offline so
I'll just select offline you can see the
values have changed so these were the
revenues generated for each of the items
only for
offline if you see here now these were
all the offline sales for the different
regions
so this is our entire Excel Revenue
dashboard on sales we created multiple
charts and graphs then we applied
different formatting we added different
icons then we formatted the labels also
next we added slicers and finally we saw
how we could filter our data based on
these
slicers likewise now we are going to
create a profit dashboard based on the
same data so before moving ahead let me
rename this sheet as Revenue dashboard
I'll write
R dashboard
okay now we'll move to our data sheet
and start creating our P tables and po
charts for the profit
dashboard all right so let me go ahead
and create my first pivote table
so I'll create a new
worksheet this time I'm going to create
a line chart to visualize the profit for
each year so I'll drag my total profit
column to values and my order year to
rows so here you can see we have
our pivote table ready now you can s s
this data to get an idea as to
which year had the highest profit and
which year had the lowest profit so from
this pivot table you can see since I've
sorted this data in descending order
so4 had the maximum amount of profit and
2017 had the least amount of profit I'll
just do contrl Z to undo it all right
now based on this pivot table let me go
ahead and and create my P chart so I'll
go to recommended charts and click on a
line chart so this is the preview of the
chart I'll click on okay let me close
this
similarly we are going
to edit this chart now so first I'll
hide all the field buttons present on
the chart and I'll rename the chart
title as
total
profit by
year next I'm going to remove the legend
so I'll delete
this let's do some more
formatting so I'll go to
style
and this
time I'm going to
select my style type okay and if you
want you can choose the colors as well
for the time being let's have this
yellow color next let me add the data
labels so again if you see here this is
not formatted properly so let's go ahead
and format
the data labels so I'll click on
number and I'll select custom
here and the type I'm going to select is
in millions and I'll click on close so
here you can see we have
our line chart ready which shows total
profit by year let's
rename this sheet as
profit
by Year all right now let's move back to
our data sheet
again next we are going to show the
total profit by countries for this I'm
going to create a map so let me first
create my pivote table so I'll go to
insert and I'll click on pivote
table let me click on okay
okay since I want the country names so
I'll select country under rules and then
I
have my total profit under
values the next thing I'm going to do is
I'll just rename the r labels as
countries and
then I'm going to delete the grand total
which you can see at the bottom so here
we have the grand total let me just
delete the grand total so I'm going to
to select this P table go to the design
tab here we have sub totals and Grand
totals I'll switch off the grand total
let me just verify it again I'll scroll
down you see the grand total has gone
now all right now we want to create a
map out of this the way to do is I'm
going to select my
data copy it I'll go on top and I'll
paste it here
using this data I can create my field
map now so I'll go to insert here we
have the option to create a field map
there you go you can see we have our map
ready I can expand this as you can see
our map has a color scale which comes
from light gray color to dark blue color
so the countries that are in Gray or you
can say light blue have the lowest
amount of profit while the regions or
the the countries that have been shaded
in dark color or dark blue color have
highest amount of profit I will go ahead
and delete this
scale okay next we need to connect this
map to the original data source so what
I'll do is I'll right click on this map
and I'll go to select data here instead
of the previous range I'll give my new
Range now so my new Range will be my
original P table that I had created I'll
go on top and click on okay so we have
our map ready now now if you want you
can change the color of the shade so
I'll just go to colors and let's say
we'll keep green
color so the countries that are shaded
in dark green have the highest amount of
profit while those which are highlighted
in light light green color are are the
countries that made least amount of
profit okay now moving
on next we want to create a pivote table
that will show us the profit by year and
sales channel so for this we are going
to create another line chart so I'll go
to insert and click on pivote table so
I'll select new worksheet here since I
want to know the profit by year first of
all I'll drag my order year column to
rows and then I'll choose my total
profit column under values next I'm
going to select my sales Channel under
columns there you go so we have our P
table here based on this P table let me
create my P chart so I'll go to
recommended charts and I'm going to
create a line
chart I close
this you see here
based on this chart you can tell the
profit generated with online sales were
actually lower than that of offline so
here the Blue Line represents offline
profit and the Orange Line represents
Online Profit if you Mark Clearly in
year 2012 the Online Profit was actually
higher than the offline profit so let me
go ahead and edit this chart a bit so
we'll delete the field buttons I'll also
delete the legend for now let me go
ahead and add a chart title so I'll
write
profit
by year
and sales
Channel
okay so this is my second report before
moving ahead let let me just rename this
sheet so I'll write
profit
by
countries similarly let me rename this
sheet as
profit by year and let's say SC for
sales
Channel
okay moving
ahead now I want to create a pie chart
based on a pivote table that will show
The Profit by sales Channel only so this
is going to be a simple pie chart so
I'll first go to insert click on pivote
table and click on okay so I'll drag my
sales Channel under rows and then we'll
have the total profit column under
values so this is my simple pivote table
now let's create our pivote chart which
is going to be a pie chart let me
explore the other other types of pie
charts we have okay so I'm going to
select a donut chart here I click on
okay let's edit this chart I'll remove
the field buttons let me now remove the
legend as well I'll just resize it and
this is going to
be
profit
by sales
Channel
okay
let's also
add data
labels and here again I'm going
to format this
label I'll select the category as custom
and my type will be in millions okay let
me just move
this to the
left and this to the right okay
let's also delete the lines
cool now let me just rename this sheet
so I'll write profit
by let's say C which stands for sales
Channel cool finally I'm going to create
a report that will show the revenue and
profit by items so I'll go ahead and
create my pivote table first this time
I'll choose my
total profit under
values and we'll also have the revenue
column so I'll put my Revenue at the top
then I'm going to
select item type under row so here is my
pivote table based on this pivote table
let me now create a combo chart so you
can see the preview of the chart the
blue bars represent the total revenue
and the Orange Line represents the total
profit I'll click on okay let me close
this first let's remove the field
buttons let's also
remove the legend
here then we'll add a chart title I'll
name it
as
revenue
and
profit
buy
items okay if you want you can also go
ahead and change the color of the
bars so let me just
select one of these colors
okay all right so we have our five
reports ready that we are going to use
for our profit
dashboard next let's create a new sheet
and we'll get started with building our
dashboard
so I'll click on a new sheet let me just
rename this as profit
dashboard all right we'll continue with
the previous drill so first of all let's
go to the view Tab and remove the grid
lines now we'll insert a background
image like we did for our Revenue
dashboard so I'll go to insert under
illustrations I'll click on on pictures
and select this device I'm going to have
the same background I'll click on
insert all right so you can see we have
a picture of a company or you can say an
organization let's just drag
this a bit to the
right we'll adjust the size
also all
right
now let's copy the title of my profit
dashboard so here you can see I have
brought my Revenue
dashboard and I'll copy the title and
the logos that we used for the revenue
dashboard I'll paste it on my new
dashboard let's just align
it in the
center all right the next step let me
now go ahead and edit the title so this
is actually going to be
Excel profit dashboard instead of
Revenue now we'll copy each of the
charts that we just created for example
the revenue and profit by items then we
had profit by sales
Channel all this we are going to copy
one by one and put it on the profit
dashboard so let me just copy a few
now I'll paste it here
and later on we can make the
adjustment copy this as
well similarly I'll bring the other
three charts onto my sales
dashboard okay so here on my profit
dashboard I have added all the
charts and I have aligned and reshaped
it so that it looks good I've also made
some formatting for example I have
reduced the size of the chart
title now let me go ahead and show you a
few more formatting that we also did for
the revenue dashboard first let's remove
the white background from all the charts
so I'll select the first chart I'll
right click and I'll click on format
chart area here under fill I'll select
no fill now next I'm going to remove the
grid lines so I'll just delete it let me
close this now we also have a outline so
I'll go to
design actually format and I'll remove
the
outline next I'm going to
add a blue box at the back like how we
did for the revenue dashboard so let me
select a blue box from here and I'm
going to paste it here
okay let me just select the chart and
I'll bring this to front and I'll move
this to the
back next I'm going to change the font
color all to White so that it's clearly
visible and it's more
readable I'll do it for the x-axis as
well okay so here I have my first chart
ready this same I'm going to do for the
rest of the
charts okay so now you can see here I
have formatted all my charts I have also
added a blue
background you see here I have also
formatted the Y labels in terms of
millions which is actually the profit
similarly here I have added the data
labels this is for
Revenue some of the charts also have the
data Legends so here you can see the
blue color represents
offline and the red represents online
similarly here you have the Legends I've
also formatted the map as well okay now
the next thing is to make this dashboard
more interactive so we'll add our
slicers as well as timeline first let me
show you how to add a timeline so I'll
select one of the charts and I'll go to
insert under insert but I have the
option to create a timeline so I'll
just click on
timelines so timeline is actually based
on date columns so since in our data set
we only have two date columns one is
order date and one is ship date so Excel
has only shown us two columns so I'm
going to create my timeline based on
order date so I'll select my order date
column and I'll click on okay you can
see here this is called a timeline I can
expand this now this timeline is based
on months now and if I scroll this
timeline you can see here I have my
order year 2010 and I have all the 12
months similarly we have for 2011 then
we have for 2012 all the way till
2017 now you can filter this in terms of
years quarters months or days let me
just select year now so I have years
from 2010 till 2017 let me just squiz
this and I'll place it somewhere here on
the
right now let me go ahead and create a
few slicers for my profit dashboard so I
have selected one of the charts under
insert I'll click on
slicer you can see it gives me the list
of columns from which I want to create
slicers so I'll create region let me
also select country
let's say I
want the representatives name or the
customer's name and I'll click on okay
so here I have created three
slicers let
me first resize it and I'll place
it on the
right similarly I'll place the country
column
also then we have the region SCE
sir I'll resize this and I'll bring it
here okay the next thing we need to do
is I have to connect all the slicers and
the timeline to the P tables for the
profit dashboard so I'm going to click
on the multiple select option and go to
report connections here I'm going to
select all the pivote tables that are
related to
profit so here I have selected four and
I need one more which is po table number
10 I click on okay similarly let's
create or connect my region filter to
all the P tables so I right click go to
report connections here I'll choose all
my pivote tables which are based on
profit I'll click on okay let's do it
for the country slicer as well
click on okay and similarly I'll connect
my timeline as well I'll go to report
connections and I'll
select all the pivote tables related to
profit then I'll click on okay let me
now go ahead and create another slicer
based on sales channel so I'm selecting
one of the P charts I'll go to insert
click on slicer and I'll select sales
Channel and hit
okay so I have my sales Channel slicer
now let me connect it to all the
respective pivote
tables that are based on
profit click on
okay now let me just bring it here all
right the next thing I want to show is
how are we going to use the timeline
first so you see we have all
the years here from 2010 to
2017 now suppose you want to know the
profit that was generated in the year
2012 so I'll just click on this range
and now you can see our charts only show
information for 2012 so this dot
represents that was 51 million profit in
the year 2012 similarly you can see
here the profit by sales channel for
2012 from the map you can see the
different countries and the profit each
of these countries made in
2012 if I scroll down you can see the
revenue and profit by items now if I
select another year let's say
2013 I can just drag this to the right
and now you can see
are profit by year and sales channel for
offline and online you can see the map
or the line chart for total profit by
year so in 2012 it was 51 million and
then it went up to 54 million in
2013
similarly our map has also changed now
this is a sort of an information that we
have you can click on this
and check the information that Excel has
prompted
all right so this is how you can use a
timeline now as I said we checked by
years you can also see it for months and
quarters as well let me just uncheck
it I'll send it back to the place where
it was and I'll reduce the
size okay now suppose you want to check
the profit made by different
Representatives you can select them one
by one let's say Adam Churchill this is
the profit generated by Adam
Churchill similarly you can select
multiple persons as well suppose you
want to see the profit by different
countries so you can use the country
slicer let me just bring this to the
middle and let's expand our chart a
bit okay so here you you have
the profit by different countries chart
I'll just bring this to the front so
that you can see it clearly okay now
here suppose you want to see the profit
generated in let's say United Kingdom
you can select United Kingdom so this is
the map of United Kingdom and it tells
you the total profit that was generated
in United Kingdom and Below you can see
the revenue and profit for all the items
that was sold in United Kingdom so you
had beverages clothes household office
supplies you can see clearly office
supplies item meet the highest amount of
profit in United Kingdom now you can
also select multiple countries let's say
I want to know for France as well so
my map will change accordingly so now I
have United Kingdom and France selected
and the other charts present in my
dashboard change accordingly now I have
my country selected as India you can see
the map of India
here and these were the respective
profit values now one thing to note here
is this is actually not millions that
should be in K that is Thousands so
please mark this as
thousand and not in
millions even for this this is actually
K and not
million all right so we have
successfully created our second
dashboard that is on profit let me just
resize this a bit and we'll place it
where it was
earlier
cool so we saw how to create different
people tables and poot charts and then
we formatted our poot charts based on
our requirement we saw how to edit the
colors now let me show you one more
thing you can also change the look and
feel of the dashboard by going to the
page layout tab under page layout you
have themes so here you can select
different themes currently we are with
the office theme now let me just select
another theme let's say faet you see the
colors have have changed and it
looks really
beautiful similarly let me try out
another theme let's say organic you see
our chart has changed let me just delete
this okay so now once you change the
theme the text also change a bit you can
see the slicers are in a different
font let me explore One More theme let's
say this time I'm going to choose
depth and this is more of a green type
of
color you can play around and select
whatever theme suits the best all
right now let me just move back to my
Revenue dashboard and see how it looks
there you go so since we changed our
theme even our Revenue dashboard is also
impacted
so this is how it looks
now you can always go ahead and play
with different themes colors fonts and
effects all right so in this demo we saw
how to create a revenue dashboard so we
created line charts this combo chart pie
chart horizontal and vertical bar charts
and then we learned how to add slicers
and
connected to different P tables and we
filtered our data to see Revenue as well
as profit by items by countries by
different regions sales Channel we
learned how to create a map and lots
more so for today we will deal with this
particular data set which is New York
Airbnb open data 2024 so this happens to
be the latest Airbnb data set uploaded
to kagle on June 5th
2024 so we will download this particular
data set and uh let's presume that we're
going to conduct some data analysis
using this particular data set and we
find some errors or in discrepancies in
this particular data set and we'll try
to clean it right so I have already
downloaded this data set and I've
already extracted that particular Z file
and here we have it let's try to open
it
following data conversions in this file
convert large number of scientific
notations do you want to permanently
keep this
conversions uh you can just um you know
you can just convert if you want and you
cannot convert if you don't want it but
I'll go with the convert option which
might be recommended in few situations
anyhow we will be cleaning the data set
right so no worries on that part now if
I expand the second column which happens
to be the name column we already have
some irregular discrepancies in the data
if you go back to the website you can
see it is a combination of okay let's
scroll a little so you can see it's a
combination of name rating and uh the
configuration of that particular switch
room all right so it happens to be the
name of the hotel rating and the number
of rooms you have in there or the
configuration of that particular Hotel
tell right by some error or by some way
Excel is enable to recognize what
exactly was there in the data set and it
converted that particular data into a
special symbol and remember you cannot
work on this particular column you might
think I'll use text to columns right you
can uh say let's try it okay let's try
it you might wonder I can go with text
to columns uh solution and I'll use the
D limiter as other and paste that
particular symbol here but it's it's not
going to recognize it okay even if you
copy it let's say I copy this value and
try the option of text to columns by
selecting the entire column and I'll
give the Del limiter as other it's not
going to paste it you don't have it
right in such scenarios you might go you
might go crazy and you might not even
have a solution for it right but what if
I tell you a simple substitute function
can help you here right seriously there
are endless possibilities when it comes
to data cleaning and the solutions are
really simple and you cannot believe uh
how easy it was right so uh this is the
First Column and uh again if we go down
to a little bit if you dig down a little
bit you can see here the review date
and uh you have neighborhood Hotel names
and uh the latitude and longitude that
means the location data and room type is
it is it a private Suite or you know the
types of rooms I try to understand your
data try to read your data right that's
when you understand what are the
possibilities or what are the insights
you can build using this particular data
set right so radi your data properly and
uh here you have ratings right ratings
is something which we can work with the
cleaning process and um yeah so here you
can find a few places where there is no
rating right the rating is not provided
here and if you come to the same row
right if you go across the same row and
if you come to the column B you can see
we have rental unit in New York and all
of a sudden we have one bedroom one bed
one bat right so we don't have a
combination of rating here and if you
check out the cell uh B3 30 you have the
rating and the configuration right in
such scenarios if you try to split the
cell you might end up with having
discrepancies in the data set right so
what you can do is wherever we have
the rating as no rating or let's say no
rating is equals to zero or a blank cell
right we can replace these particular no
rating with blank cell and imagine that
these are the blank cells that you might
encounter in real life scenario and you
wanted to eliminate those particular
blank cells and rows because they might
cause some discrepancy and you might end
up getting a wrong report right so let's
try to also work on that particular
solution where we have blank cells in
the data set and we remove the entire
room or blank cells okay we can have a
use case on that part as well and uh
here we have another column that says
license and uh we go down we have the
configurations
here right so that's it with the data
okay and uh here if you check out we
have a column called price right so it
gives you the pricing details let's say
uh I come from a different country right
um let's say I come from India and I pay
in terms of rupees or I come from UK and
I pay in terms of let's say pounds right
and you come from United States of
America and you pay in um terms of
English dollars United States all right
this causes a lot of discrepancies and
for a report where you are trying to
convert or where you're trying to
generate an exact report what you want
and you have some discrepancies in the
data set it might end up giving you a
wrong result but for now it's correctly
formatted in terms of whole numbers no
decimal places no special symbols no
currency symbols right so it's just
plain numbers so uh let's say I don't
want those symbols and we have the exact
number over here and let's say in case
we have some decimal values you can also
add and remove those decimal vales so
you can change the um so in case if
you're facing that issue with the
currency format you can change or remove
the currency format and change the
decimal values to the whole number and
uh yeah so let's get started so that was
the brief overview of the data set and
let's get started with uh working or
data cleaning right coming with the
first one which happens to be the name
column column B we have a new
column let's try to add a few more you
might want
that there you go
now since we are you know uh
creating a new column and trying to
eliminate the special character let's
okay let's not name this we have
multiple symbols right so let's try to
use them first let's copy
it the we want to
eliminate and here let's use the
substitute equals to substitute
function text box let's try to fix it
with f
column B is fixed and the cell numbers
will change and old is this particular
text so we're going to insert a text
right so let's try to insert that s in
double codes and what you want to
replace this with nothing just two
double codes
enter
now it across all the cells and we have
eliminated this particular symbol which
was capital A now we have another type
of symbol right so if you clearly check
the entire data set we just have one
more special symbol which happens to be
the lower case a alphabet a and followed
by that we have few full stops right now
let's try to replace that as well we are
going to use the same substitute
function cell address let's try to fix
it with function key
F4 column C is fixed the cell numbers
will change 2 3 4 5 6 comma the old text
since we are keeping text so double
Cotes inside that we have the text close
the double codes and what you want to
replace it with nothing two double Cotes
close the bracket and enter now we have
the name of the hotel rating and the
bedroom right the configuration of that
particular hotel rooms now drag this
across all the cells and there you go
now you have the data in the way you
wanted it right now you can just simply
copy the entire
[Music]
column new column Al
together copy the entire column let's
try that once again go to the new column
and here go to the p special you just
need to paste the values over here and
there you go you can copy this
particular column name paste it right
here where we have the cleaned data and
you can eliminate all the remaining
columns delete them right now you have
another catch you want to split this
particular data cell into the name of
the hotel rating and and hotel
configuration but in few scenarios we
don't have a rating right in this
particular column B 15th cell we have
the name and configuration but there is
no rating right this might end up in the
wrong data and again another catch is
you have spaces right rental unit in New
York it has space space rating space one
bedroom right so we have spaces in
between and we have a full stop for
reading now how could you
recognize and how could you split this
particular data set we have no idea on
this right now uh let's say we want one
two three uh columns right so we want
one column for the name of the hotel and
one column for the ratings and one
column for the configuration right we
have created this particular um you know
configuration but we don't know how to
split it right how do you split this
particular cell into three different
columns now comes help from chat
gbd just copy any of the cell I'll copy
this particular cell and go to chat GPD
which is in my tab over here start chat
GPD and explain your problem to chat GP
I have a
cell with
data double codes enter the
data I want Excel
formula that can
split the given
cell
into as shown Bel
right now paste the same data and split
it first one name of the hotel second
one the rating and third one the
configuration right clear just be more
specific about what you want uh chat GPT
to help you with right so I want Excel
formula that can split the given cell
into uh three different
print columns as shown below right just
enter and chat gbt should be able to
help you so it is telling you to use the
mid and search functions and it has
already given you three different
formulas for three different occurrences
let's try the first one which is with
the name of the hotel right just place
it over here and obviously you will get
the value because the cell address is
different so we are supposed to give B2
as the cell address let's try to fix the
cell address so the column B will be
fixed and cell numbers will be changing
copy that part particular cell address
and paste it over here and press enter
now you have the name now drag this
across all the cells and you have the
cell names I mean Hotel names right now
let's go with the second code copy that
paste it over here
and same process you will have to change
the address to
B2 let's try to fix it using function
key
F4 column is fixed cell numbers will
change copy that replace A1 everywere in
the
formula now you will have ratings in a
few cells and in a few cell we have the
configuration which happens to be an
irrelevant data because there was no
rating provided by the user in that
instant so we will remove that don't
worry we will have a separate process
for that and again equals to so we will
replace A1 with
B2 try to fix the column using function
key F4 there you go copy the cell
address replace all the a ons in the
formula and get to thank your chat gbd
which help you with a beautiful formula
right so places where get stuck you can
use some AI there right so there must be
some mistake that we
did undo it and I think we messed up the
formula somewhere so let's try to copy
the code AS provided by CH GPD and place
it exactly where it's supposed to be
going and replace
B2 to fix the formula
paste paste paste it here paste it
everywhere it's supposed to be press
enter okay there must be some mistake
let's check the formula properly once
again I have a reference dat set of this
let's try to open the reference data and
check the
formula so I think it's with the prompt
so we gave the prompt in this way so it
has double spes somewh so I think let's
check the formula once again go back to
the original data set contrl Z and
here I think we have single space no we
have double space that's the
problem okay so we can ask chat GPT for
a different formula and try a different
formula in this particular location in
case if it's not working then equals to
the form
formula so in place of A1 we will have
B2 we can fix the address
F4 Cy place it right over here and this
over here enter
right okay it's not working
properly okay we changed the formula a
little bit it with addition of mid sech
and length now if we enter this
particular formula I think it's it's a
it's going to work just replace a1's
with b2s
everywhere with
fixing and enter there you go now you
can drag the same D set across the same
formula across all the cells and you
should be having it now
this is
done let's try to copy all the
data you have copied it now deleted and
now you will be pasting the values
only as
required okay let's try to insert three
new
columns okay so I think we have the
option
of selecting the entire column and then
deleting it and then then let's try to
copy and
now right click insert copy cells now we
still have the formula right so we don't
want the formulas
anymore let's try to work around it copy
the
cells insert three different new
columns here and copy these three fghh
columns and go back to here and now try
to paste the values only values and this
in this scenario you don't have any
formulas embedded in this particular
data now what you can do is just quickly
delete these um cells which you don't
want anymore in your data
set so I think you don't want EFG hi j k
so I think we U mistakenly uh inserted
the data twice so let's check the
original data just for
reference so I would always recommend
you to keep a copy of the data set that
you're working with so that anytime you
have a problem just go back to the
original dat set and have a look at it
right now I think we don't even want
this particular column over here so we
have the name of the
hotel creting
and now if we come back to the rating
section remember the blank cell
elimination process we were discussing
about that's the one so you can quickly
uh select the entire data set go to sort
and filter option and filter and here
you can select the rating section and
deselect everything and go with the last
one new and rating okay now you have
only the new and no rating options over
here you can just quickly select the
entire uh column and delete it which
will end up giving
you the approach of having blank cells
Now quickly remove the filter
option now you have some blank cells
right now what to do with the blank
cells simple contrl a go to contrl g go
to special and here you have planks
select that and there you go now all the
blank cells are
selected it might take a little while
because we have around some thousands of
rows the blank CS are selected now press
control and hold it there and then press
it the minus symbol right now you have
different options just select the entire
row you know you can just eliminate
entire with any discrepancies it might
take a while again just give Excel it's
time to delete the unnecessary uh blank
cells and rows in the data set so that
we have a completely formatted data set
there you go I think we good and now for
verification if you check the
configuration section or the rating
section you will not have any
discrepancies which fall into or they
are spilling into the um rating section
you know the configuration section
should not be spilling into the rating
section and that's how we do it so far
it's good enough and I think there is
one problem over here right so I think
it uh this particular uh you know row is
having some errors with this particular
spell cell splitting function okay
that's not a problem so we can quickly
check for that discrepancy and uh you
know we did the filters option right so
quickly filter up
and uh it should add a new
filter so if it has anything else than
numbers you should be having in the end
so yeah I think we have a couple of
cells with some irrelevant entries you
can just quickly select those cells and
eliminate them as
well um I'm selecting everything and
selecting only the cells that have some
Text data so that you can have those few
rows maybe around 7 to eight rows and
eliminate those
rows there go and now if you quickly
remove the sort filter options we have
the DAT set ready and now uh we will
also learn the trim function before we
go any ahead okay in some scenarios we
might need that let's say I have okay
let let me insert a new
column let's say I have some irrelevant
blank
spaces and the spaces in between here
which will cause a new problem for us
while we are performing our data
analysis jobs right in these scenarios
if you use the trim function it will
eliminate any improper spacings just try
trim T to select and enter and if you
drag the same formula across all the
cells you can eliminate any Extra Spaces
here you see there are no spaces for the
data that you have entered you have
trimed out any excess spaces in between
the text in the beginning of the text
and at the end of the text right so this
is again a good option for us you can
just quickly undo everything so that you
don't have to worry about the Extra
Spaces right there you go and that's one
way of removing extra space is from your
data set and uh let's say if you want to
keep this in the form of uh uppercase
let me insert a new
column let us remove this and uh let's
say I want an
uppercase just tap to select there you
go and you have it an uppercase right
just drag the same formula across all
the cells you have it and let's say you
want it the same in lower case you can
just type in lower tap to select and
there you go and in case if you had the
same problem uh let's say the name is
all in upper or lower and you want it in
proper case you can just press proper
and select the function proper and there
you go you have the proper case right
that's another way of you know doing
things or okay in the text ke
and uh now so far we have dealt with um
splitting text into columns and uh
converting the uppercase to lower case
and also trimming the Extra Spaces and
uh also using the substitute function
and U yeah we have also dealt with the
currency format and uh we have a few
let's say we wanted to work with data
okay I think this particular data set
does not have the date column okay we do
have it
here last
review okay so I think it's uniquely
formatted it does not have discrepancies
with date with Am Pm right okay we'll
we'll try to look at that from a
different perspective different dat set
Al together don't worry about it now
another common factor let's say I have
some duplicate entries let's go back to
the bottom section and let's see I have
a duplicate entry of these three uh you
know rows
copy and paste it over here now we have
some duplicate data entry now you can
select the entire data set go to data
option and here we have something called
remove duplicates option right if you
click on that it will remove it will
first it will select all the columns
okay uh and remember to check this
particular function check on my data has
headers select all the uh columns don't
forget any of the columns okay what it
does is it will check all the columns
and if there is an entry which is
similar to all the columns right all the
column headers are same to same and all
the entries in each and set every cell
are uh under the column header are same
to same then it considered it considers
it as a duplicate entry and eliminates
it so far according to our knowledge we
should be having at least three
duplicate entries let's see when you
click on okay duplicate I think so it
has already eliminated it so I think we
did past it properly but that's how you
can eliminate the duplicate entries in
your data set let's try to do that once
again and select all remove
duplicates yeah one did not past the
Valu properly previously but that's how
you can remove the duplicates one
duplicate value is found and removed so
that's how you can eliminate duplicate
entries in your dat set and uh here so
far so good we have learned the
formatting thing we have learned the
split to cells we have used chat GP to
get our formulas we have formatted the
cells from upper lower proper and we did
substitute functions we did currency
formatting and yeah what remains is
about the date formatting so let's work
on a different data set all together if
we go to file and
open this particular T set I think that
should be beneficial for us or let's go
to yeah yes this is the one I was
talking about right now let's close all
the previous data sets don't save
anything and this I think you might want
to save let's save this for reference
now we have this particular data set
right in front of us and you can see we
have um date and time formatting in 24
hours
and if you scroll a bit to the bottom
you can find we have the same data in
terms of date time that is 12 hour
timing and AM and PM right now you might
wonder you can just directly split the
data set into space You Know by giving
the Del limit as space and I can
eliminate the timing but if you see the
data set title it's about crime right so
if you are going to perform some proper
data analysis based on time location and
and date you might require the date in
the form of date time am and p.m right
you might want that time section you
don't want to miss that right so in such
scenarios you can take the help of
custom formatting see here we have date
month time and hours and minutes and a
and PM just select the entire column go
to this particular formatting and go to
custom and here remove ch and paste the
data set formatting you want in terms of
date month year hours minutes amm and
p.m select okay and there you go 0000
got replaced with 12 a.m. which is the
beginning of the day and the entire
column is been now having a uniform
datetime format so these were the few
tips and tricks about data cleaning for
data analysis you might have wondered
that Microsoft Excel is just another
data storage tool which saves your data
in terms of rows and columns but what if
I tell you it's a lot more than that it
cannot just only save your data but also
perform some exploratory data analysis
on your data set and create some
impressive charts graphs and interactive
dashboards exactly we going to discuss
that data visualization part in Excel so
without further ad let's get started
with the data on Excel and perform our
data visualization with Excel so right
now we are on the Microsoft Excel so if
we go to the insert option in the panel
here you can see we have a wide range of
charts available right so here you have
all the charts so all these individual
charts are based on data visualization
you just have to give the data set that
you want to work on and here you can see
the recommended charts option here what
Excel does is it will read your data set
and it will understand and which of the
following charts that are available here
will be the most recommended ones or
which are the ones which can help you
with the best data visualization right
it can automatically read your data set
and it will give you the recommended
charts and you can choose one of them
for example here we have a list of
charts right so we have column line pie
chart bar chart area right all these
charts so today we will be working on
the most important ones or most of these
available charts here so I've got a list
of uh charts lined up here so I've got a
small data set for each and every one of
these so that we have a brief
understanding of how exactly these
charts work right now we'll get started
with the waterfall chart over here right
let's quickly close this and let me
select the entire data set what's
present on the sheet here so if you kind
of zoom in a little you can see this is
just uh another business data which is
dealing with Revenue new investment
gross margin admin expenses net income
right so um if I select the data and go
back to charts over here you can
automatically see it is recommending me
different types of charts here right
it's giving me a cluster chart it's
giving me a pie chart it's giving me
some other type of chart which is here
clustered bar right it's also giving me
a funnel type of chart right so right
now we want to create a waterfall chart
so if we click on this particular one it
will give me the waterall chart which
looks something like this if I click on
okay there you go you have your waterall
chart so here you can see the increase
and decrease so if there is an increase
it will be represented in terms of blue
color and if it's decrease or decline in
terms of you know profit or loss it will
highlight in terms of orange color so
it's called The Legend which gives you
the total briefing of what exactly is
going on with your chart so uh this is
the first first type of chart that we
worked on you can ignore the chart title
and in case if you want to modify this
you can go to this particular option
which gives you all the edit access to
your charts you can you know do some uh
background edits and you can also change
some fonts Etc and if you want to do
some more of that you can see you can
eliminate access lines you can add some
Legends grid lines Etc right so you can
also do that so with that we have uh
done with the first type of chart but
just the Bold chart let's go back to the
spark lines so so you might wonder what
do you mean by spark lines right now we
have a list of uh business data with the
regions we have North Region South
Region East West Central now let's say
your manager wants a brief uh you know
uh result or report which will uh tell
about the performance of the individual
zones right and uh if you give him
numbers he might not understand what
exactly is going on with your business
but what if there was a way which could
visually represent the performance right
and uh you might wonder uh how can I
create um you know you you might have to
create five different charts for all
these and you have to add them onto a
you know five different pages and this
might be complicated no that's not the
way you just you know create one single
bar graph or a line graph right over the
sales of your n zone right right in
front of your n Zone from q1 Q2 Q3 and
Q4 and you can give them the performance
report right next to the numbers over
here so that's what I'm talking about
these spark line charts so if you click
you know if you select all the data over
here and go to insert option and the
recommended charts then you can find
smar lines over here you can just go to
the line type of spark line or you can
also go through the column right you can
select any one of those I'll try to
select the column one so it's asking me
for the data range give the data range
right over here and press okay now you
can also drag this across all the cells
it will take the you know cell uh data
from this particular cells Accord you
know based on it will reference the
cells right over here and it'll give you
a report and in case if you don't want
uh the bar type of graph you can change
it directly to a line graph which will
be a little more easier to understand if
there is a growth or di or drop right so
here you can see see the East sales are
going down and every other sale except
for the central every other sale has
seen a depth and now it's slowly growing
right so that's how you can create a
spark line chart and the next type of
visualization that we will be dealing in
Excel is about the uh heat map so heat
maps are another good way of
representing the performance of your
data whichever let's say uh you wanted
to calculate the revenue or if you
wanted to visually represent the growth
of Revenue or the drop of Revenue of
your sales uh through a visual
representation then heat maps are the
best you can find out which is the
highest performing month or which is the
highest performing year and uh you can
also identify which was the lowest
performing year just by looking at the
colors right now we can either select
the entire data set right so we have the
2013 over here so you can either select
the entire data and perform the heat map
analysis or you can just individually
select a row I mean a column or you can
select an individual row and find out
which particular month or which
particular year perform best so now we
will be trying to calculate or we'll be
trying to generate a heat map for
individual years so let's get started
with 2013 and you can just go to data or
you can just go to home to conditional
formatting and here you have
uh databas right you can go yeah we have
the color scales so here we have the
heat Maps right so you can go with the
first one which will say green is the
best performing and red is the worst
performing so click on that and you can
see in 2013 we have July as the best
performing month right and the worst
performing must be the
June right so similarly let's try to
create a heat map for 2014 it's same
color skills
HMA just take a little
while
so here you can see we have created a
heat map for individual years to find
out the best performing month and the
worst performing month right so apart
from generating colors as heat map what
you can do is you can go through the
conditional formatting once again and
here you can see we have color scales
but apart from that if you want to uh
you know uh change these into a data bar
you can find out so that you can find
out the best performing uh you know sale
you can also do that you have databas
over here and if you're not happy with
the databas or colors you can also go
through some icons so here if you see we
have directional icons which will
directly tell you you know which will
indicate the best performing month in
terms of uh an arrow Mark so the one uh
the one which is pointing towards
upwards in green color will show that
it's the highest and best performing
month and the yellow color which is uh
you know pointing towards right it will
indicate that was it it was a medium
performance month and the one with the
lower side and red indicates the worst
performing month right so you can also
do that to enhance your visibility right
so here you can see we have the best
performing months in terms of green
colors and arrow Mark is pointing
towards up and the ones with the burst
performance are you know indicated with
lower arrow keys and red color you can
also do that right and uh with that we
will go to the next type of uh chart
which is a funnel chart if you
highlight the data set a little you can
see this is again the business data
which will tell you about the expenses
that you spent on your company which are
part operational expenses technology
expenses employee training development
expenses you know so if you want to
represent this in form of U funnel let's
say then you can also do that by going
through the insert option data
visualization charts and here you have
one of the recommendations as funnel you
can just select that and there you go
now you have a detailed funnel type
chart which will explain the operational
expenses technology expenses basically
all the expenses that you spend on your
company and uh the numbers that you
spent right you can expand this so that
you have the complete you can also edit
this if you go to the edit option you
can uh you know what you can do is you
can indentation you can you can keep the
indentation towards the left and or if
you want you can keep the indentation in
the in terms of metal that can be done
right so now we moving forward we will
look at tree chart so tree chart is
similar to a heat map which will
basically uh instead of representing
them in terms of colors it will
represent them in terms of shapes right
the highest spent or the highest pricing
will be represented in the terms of the
biggest box and the lowest ones will be
represented in terms of the smaller
boxes so here we have another
um business data what we have here so we
might have a small store which works on
electronic items and uh it might be a
build kind of data which you have over
here which will represent what type of
device uh you are selling spares and
what type of spare that you have sold
what's the rate of each and every spare
item and how many number of units you
have sold and what's the price that you
made as Revenue right so if you select
all this data and go to insert option
and go to to charts so you have a lot of
charts over here and the and you can see
treat chart is one of the recommended
chart you can also go with sunburst type
of chart you can go through bar graph
column uh graphs everything so here we
are focusing on three type of charts so
select that and okay there you go so you
have three categories which is PC Mobile
and a computer you know you can consider
them as laptop so um if you minimize a
little so here we can see we have the
highest number of revenue generated from
laptop so laptop LCDs have given you
highest uh Revenue next one is the
hinges and then you have laptop keypads
mobile displays at the fifth position
right so that's how you can create a
three type of data visualization chart
using Excel next one is area chart so uh
area chart and line charts are similar
to each other the only difference is if
you are going with the area chart okay
let's go with the line chart first so
that you have a brief or better
understanding so we'll deal with the
same data set here let me expand this a
little so again this is a sales state of
North West East South and Central So
based on yes so select all the data go
to uh insert and uh the number of charts
over here so if you see both line graph
and area graphs are one of the
recommendations over here so the area
graph looks something like this and line
graph looks something like this so the
only difference is in a line graph the
lines will be used to represent your
profits and gains and in area graph the
lines what used to represent that
particular profit or drop will be
covered with some color a dedicated
color and it will represent that in
terms of an area right that's the only
difference so if you click on this line
chart it will give you a line chart and
here if you click lines you will have
the color filled so individual colors
will be filled for individual types of
um data set that you have so you have
five different data sets so five
different colors will be representing
five different zones and you will have
an area for that so that's how line
chart and area chart works the next one
is a bar graph right bar and column
graph so um the difference is here we
have the same southeast west know it's a
summation of the total sales that happen
in terms of these zones and if you want
to identify which of the zones performed
best and the best way to do that is
using a par graph or a column graph so
if you go through this here you have you
already have the best recommendation
right away here which is the column
chart and if you want that in terms of
bar you can also do that there you go
you have the bar charts and column chart
is no different it's also completely
similar to that instead of a bar graph
you will be selecting a column graph
which will show the data in terms of
vertical
that's the column graph and apart from
that you might have got clustered and
combination charts Etc now the next one
is boxes and whiskers so boxes and
whiskers will show you the individual
performance variations of a student
right we have uh okay here we dealing
with uh student data set so we have five
different students and three different
subjects physics chemistry and math
so we will find the variation between
the marks of every student which is the
lowest marks obtained by a student in a
particular subject and the highest Mark
obtained by the same student in that
particular subject let's say we have
student one in physics he has Cod
8075
92 78 and 88 so we will have Bar Boxes
and viscus chart which will explain the
highest Mark as 92 and the lowest will
be as 75 so so uh we have five different
students and we will understand the
variations of each and every student in
each and every subject select all the
data set and go to insert option over
here and uh drop down and go to all
charts and here we have boxes and bers
so this is what I was talking about the
highest number of marks scored by a
student in individual subject and the
lowest number of marks Cod by student in
individual subjects so each and every
color will represent one of the students
blue for student one
orange first two and uh the hash color
for student three so on right just click
on okay and you have the box discus
charts right over here so the next type
of chart is the maps chart where you can
physically create a map which shows you
a physical map how exactly is going on
with the right so here we have the
countries as or you know the state as
the First Column and the population as
the second column so we can basically
select the entire data and create a
physical map which will show the density
of population in that particular state
so the highest or darkest color will
represent the highest population and the
lowest or the lightest color will uh
represent the lowest density of
population so how you can create as that
simply select the entire data go to
insert option and here you can see the
maps option just select that particular
map and here we have the first
recommendation as fi map so we'll go
with that and we have a map which will
show the population of that particular
state so here we have U California as
the highest densely populated uh State
and here we
have Montana as one of the lowest or
less densely populated uh state so here
we have the uh Legend which will
describe the highest populated area and
the lowest populated area there you go
so with that you can create the uh maps
and next going ahead we have Scatter
Plots so you must be well aware of the
scatter plot which will show you the you
know uh graph in terms of uh scattered
uh nature and you have the highest uh
you know rainfall and so here we're
dealing with the uh rainfall data so the
highly the the serial numbers which will
describe the location you know so the
location which has the highest rainfall
and particul so you can basically create
that using U scatter plot just select
the entire data go to the insert option
and here you have these Scatter Plots
just click on that you can try to select
the type of plot you want so I'm go with
the first option there you go we have
these catter plots which will show you
the rainfall and vertically a and now
the next type of chart we have is combo
which will be the last for this
particular tutorial and if you want us
to create a few more data visualization
you know you have a lot of charts over
here so we have line graphs py graph and
uh if you expand the selection the
entire data and if you expand the
selection you have a lot of charts over
here we have Sunburst we have histogram
we have combo right so we will be going
with the combo chart over here right so
if you click on this you can either go
with the first one clustered com column
and line or you know you can do any one
of those I'll select
both press okay there you go so we have
the combo chart and uh that was the last
chart for this tutorial on data
visualization with Excel and if you want
to work us on a first chart please to
let us know in the comment section below
and we will come up with a new tutorial
on that one as well so descriptive
statistics in Excel so firstly what
exactly is descriptive statistics in
Excel so some of the functions like
central tendency me median measure of
variability mode range box plot Etc such
kind of functions are called as
descriptive statistics functions now
let's say you find a data set in which
you are supposed to find the descriptive
statistic values of that particular dat
set and you have to write down all the
functions manually right if you want to
eliminate that big task that huge task
then there is a simple shortcut method
in Excel but how can we do that that's
exactly what we're going to discuss
today in this session so let's get back
to the Practical mode I will open
Microsoft Excel so this particular file
is my input file for today's session so
I have about 10 to 15 decimal values
like whole numbers you know complete uh
let's say this is the not the whole
numbers these are the decimal values
which we are going to discuss for today
so let's say these are the input values
for us for today and we are supposed to
find out the uh descriptive statistics
for all these numbers like right which
is a mean value average value etc etc
and which is a simple shortcut method to
do that right now let's select the value
and go to data and here okay we have
water of analysis so by default we will
not have that here so go to developer
options and in this developer options go
to Excel addit and here you can see
analysis tool pack let's click okay on
that and I think I'll be able to add it
now so when you go back to data again
here you can find some option called
Data analysis right word of analysis is
being pushed a little to the left so now
you have data analysis click on that
and uh in a moment you have the options
here click on descriptive statistics
press okay there you go now you have the
input range give this particular input
range to your file and uh now you have
the data in columns so columns by
default and uh yeah you can either
create a new worksheet you can either
create a new workbook right I will go
with new worksheet or you can click the
output range over here and here you can
get the value I'll give a cell value
here I'll give
D1 and I think everything else is good
to go in case if you want the summary
statistics confidence level right and K
the largest K smallest you can also give
that and press okay and there you go you
will have all the values here just
expand the rows I mean yeah expand the
columns and you will have all the values
here we have some data set so we have
row ID order ID order date ship date Etc
so these are the rows over here let's
quickly select the entire data set and
remove any filters that we have so the
filters is gone and uh at the last you
can see country region product category
subcategory and extending further we
have sales data quantity ordered
discount and profit so now let's proceed
and try to build one single dashboard
okay now imagine yourself in a situation
where you're working for for this
particular you know um store or a
company which sells products and you
have a team meeting with leadership and
you are supposed to be hunting for
simplicities in complexities and you
need to present an interactive dashboard
which gives a visual representation of
what exactly is happening with the
company the sales the quantity order
profit Etc right and if you show this
particular data set as it is in the form
of named with rows and columns your
leadership might not be able to
understand it or they might not be able
to justify what exactly needs to be done
in the future to keep the numbers same
or improve the sales right so in that
scenario an interactive dashboard could
be beneficial so in today's session
we're going to create the scene and
creating a chart that is an interactive
chart or a dashboard which is
interactive everything lies on one
single point that is the pivot tables
and pivot charts if you're good with
pivot tables and pivot charts you can
create interactive charts you can create
interact dashboards and much more so the
process is simple but in case if you
need a quick overview of how exactly a
pivot table is created or performed then
you can check out the link in the
description box below which will give
you a complete detailed description and
to understand how to create a pivot
table and a pivot chart in real time and
move further right now we will continue
with this particular topic for today
which is creating a dashboard now click
anywhere in the cell select the entire
data set using control a and go to
insert option over here and choose pivot
table right from the table range should
be the option here you can see the table
range has been selected and uh you also
have two more options which will help
you understand and where exactly to
create your paper table so we will be
creating that in a new worksheet so
click on a new worksheet and press okay
there you go you have the Pu you know
table here and let's say we want a few
charts so here we have region wise sales
country wise sales and shipment majorly
used
subcategory uh category segment and
let's say we also want Quant wise
country and quantity
right or let's say Okay country and
quantity so how many number of orders
basically you receive from each country
right so let's say we want all these
charts now how many number of charts do
we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 remember
creating a chart which is interactive
relies on pivot table now so far we have
created one pivot table or one pivot
pivot chart or one pivot sheet but we
want seven pivot charts how to do that
it's really simple just hold control and
drag that sheet and you have a new pivot
chart right you can do that few more
times seven so we have seven pivot
tables as we required there you go and
now let's get back to the first sheet
and let's see the first option we are
looking for so we want region wise sales
right we have five different regions
north south east west and Central and we
want region y sales in a pictorial way
for that let's go to the options over
here we have the row uh names or the
metadata you can drag region into either
columns or rows whever you want I'll Cho
just drag and drop it in the columns and
now go back to sales and you can drag
sales to row values sorry in h region
right now you can go back to this
particular pivot table go to home
eliminate any and go to pivot table
analyze and here you can see pivot chart
click on that and now you have a old
charts window on your uh desktop I mean
screen you can choose the one which you
uh feel is good right so I'll prefer a
bar chart column chart here click on
okay and there you go now you can edit
this particular data set and chart and
you can also remove any of the things
you don't want so for for example I
don't want Legends so I'll remove
Legends and uh this is what I have here
you can also edit for few more things
right now I can simply copy this
particular chart and go to the dashboard
so let's create a new sheet and name it
as
dashboard mergin Center can add a
color now here you can paste the first
chart now you can rename
this chart title so you can rename this
as region
wise SES so therefore you have the first
chart we have you can also increase or
decrease the size of the chart by just
dragging the corner points and uh let's
go to the second pivot
table we have the second pivot table
right here what was our second
request the second request was country
wise right now close this the
country and drag it to columns or rows
let's go with rows this time and
sales so go to pivot table analyze pivot
table chart and here you can choose a
pie chart since you're going with the
country wise and click
okay now you have
the P chart over here you can rename
that as country
wise you can copy
this and paste it onto the dashboard
in case you want to you know uh keep the
size of the pie chart and the column
chart in the same uh you know width and
height you can do that just go to uh
format here you can 5.6 and it can be
9.9 and similarly you can go with
5.6 this can be
9.9 just so that you can accommodate a a
few more chats in the uh dashboard you
can align them like go right now our
next request is subcategory shipment
sorry so go to shipment so this is the
fifth the sheet so we need to go to the
third spreadsheet where where is where
we have the pivot table so close the
format shape and we have shipment here
ship mode so select the ship mode track
get to rows or columns sales to here and
we have uh or you can count it right you
can change it to count okay so you have
standard class with the highest number
of um you know sales happening so many
sales which are happening in your store
choose the standard class of shipment
right so very least people choose first
class where or same day shipment which
is highly expensive and standard
shipment will take minimum pricing and
most of the customers have chosen that
now you can choose the same data here go
to pivot table analyze and here we have
pivot charts and out of this you can
select anyone let's say if you want to
go with the tree map or if you want to
go with the bar or anyone you can go
with
that so let's go with the bar graph
press okay and here you created now
rename this particular chart as ship
mode now you can copy the same chart and
press paste it onto the
dashboard can close that if you go to
format you can do the same
setting 5.9 and
9.96 and 9.9 there you go we have
everything lined up and this space that
we have over here we can add a few more
things which will come under slicers and
filters so we'll have to wait for that
until we can finish the rest of the
charts now we will go to the fourth
sheet so what was the fourth request
let's check our list here so subcategory
wise sales now we can check the category
subcategories over here yeah we have the
subcategory select that and track to
rows or columns and sales to
values okay and there you go and if you
want to sort you can also sort by right
clicking and uh sort it to minimum
smallest to lar largest to smallest
there you go so the highest number of
sales are happening through mobile
phones next comes the book cases next
come copers etc etc now select this and
go to pivot table analyze pivot chart
and you can choose any one of those we
can go bar chart or the column chart and
you can also rename this as subcategory
Dev you can copy
it based it on the dashboard and you can
also make few Arrangements if you want
you can resize
it 5.6 and this will be
9.9
the next request is about the category
wise sales and
segment so we have the category here
drag it to rows and sales here you can
keep it the way it is or you can go to
Pivot analyze and here go to
charts choose the one you want and
proceed copy it and go to dashboard you
can paste it over
here
there you
go country wise and segment
quantity so now you have country over
here country to rows and sales to
columns or you can yeah let's go with
sales since this is a sales dashboard
this should be beneficial now we have uh
we can also sort it again sort to
largest smallest and we have France with
the highest number of sales now I can
copy that or go to pivot table analyze
and here pivot chart you can go
with by
chart you can rename it as country
wise there you go and copy this based it
on the
dashboard I think we already did a
country wise sales so I think we can
proceed with the next type of uh
chart which is segment
wise let's go to the same sheet where we
created the country wise sales and close
the format delete the chart instead of
country we can select segment so which
segment has the highest number of
sales past it over here for format to
adjust the size of the
chart there you
go so we have region wise sales
country-wise sales ship mode subcategory
wise category wise and segment wise
sales now we have a dashboard but to
make it a little more interactive we
might require a few filter like options
which are also called as slices so when
you add slices onto the sheet or the the
dashboard what you can do is you can
select the options you want let's say I
want the region wise sales in Belgium
then you can identify that let's say you
want Australia's or Austria's shipment
modes what kind of shipment mode is most
used in Austria you can you can find out
it and let's say you want to find out
the Finland segment wise sales then you
can find out this is only possible when
you try to include a slicer into the
dashboard now let's go ahead with it now
if you select any of the charts let's
say I want to go with the first one now
go to insert and here you can see filter
options right so here you want to insert
slices now here you have a slices right
now okay so you can select the slicer
you want so I want the slicer for region
I want the slicer for country
I want the slicer for ship mode which is
right here and I want sub category wise
slicer I want country or category wise
slicer so category and segment wise
which is here so I want six slices there
you go I've got the six slices created
let's minimize to make it look a little
more better there you go and uh we will
paste the slices right here you can also
you know modify the size of the slices
let's try to make them fit here and uh
the next one should be right
here there you
go now let's drag this
here
the last Slicer in the last
section there you go now we have an
dashboard but is it interactive I guess
not so how to make it completely
interactive so you might have a doubt
let's say I want to click on machines
now only one out of the six charts is
you know uh reacting let's say I want to
click on papers it is giving me the data
for phones and Etc and if I click for
Belgium you can see only one chart is
being interactive right now what should
I do so that every chart which is on the
dashboard gets completely interactive
and shows all the data in real time that
can be done all you have to do is select
any of the uh slices right click and go
to the option which says report
connections so select all the pivot
tables pivot table which which are
present in your uh chart right now sheet
one sheet two sheet three sheet four
sheet Five sheet six and Sheet seven
press okay now all the charts are
interconnected with each other and now
if you click on any one of the options
let's say I want the data for Austria
country and every data
changes
correct report connections we need to do
that with all the
slices
press okay there you go now if you
select
Finland Denmark Austria you can see the
charts are changing right every chart is
now interactive so that's exactly how
you create an interactive dashboard now
you might be having a doubt okay it's
working for the existing data but what
if I add some new data so here we have
data until 2022 and this is the new data
until 2023 now if I add this particular
data to the end of this particular data
set right here and remove the row
heads and go back to dashboard go to
Pivot
chart yeah on data dashboard we need to
go to data and here click on refresh all
then you will get the updated data set
and now you have the updated results as
well now let's open an Excel document
let's also try to open a new termal in
chat GPD okay we have a new chat now
right now let's go back to the Excel
spreadsheet and here you can see we have
a CSV file which is a little longer so
let's try to eliminate a few rows let's
try to work with only 50 rows for now
select the first
cell delete right now I want an Excel
formula to separate all these comma
separated values into separate columns
now we have some automated solutions for
it right but now let's try to create a
formula using chart
GPD now let's ask chart GPD to give a
formula
separate
let's edit
this
copy the code and now go back to the
spreadsheet so initially it was trying
to give me a solution which is automated
but we wanted a form anyways so I'm now
try to drag the same formula across all
the cells until we get the last column
header so it is quite lengthy so I think
the last column header is somewhere over
here here with the current manager if
you drag the same
formula to all the rules all the 50
rules that we initially working with we
will also get the data set separated
right now if we go back there you can
see the CSV has been successfully
separated into different columns right
now if you want to work on some uh let's
say some some functions or mathematical
functions which you work with day-to-day
life right let's copy 10 random values
paste them in a new sheet calculate the
sum of these values right sum of 10
values say charity for the
same all the mathematical statistical
functions like average mean median mode
subtract differentiation everything now
let's try to ask it for the summation
give
me a formula an Excel
formula to find out sum of 10
numbers in
Excel there you go that's our formula
copy the code and paste it in this
particular cell it had 10 right so we
need to add
10 so let's add the 10th value here and
now let's space the formula which is
equals to sum of this was the formula
right A1 to A10 11 okay no worries enter
I think this is with the data type right
so I think the data type is okay it is
carrying the formula so we were supposed
to uh paste the values only right now
let's try to delete this particular
column and control shift to
V Let's copy the values once
again copy and go to the new sheet paste
special paste values only right now it's
not carrying any of the functions with
it so if we implement the same function
which Char gave us which is from sum A1
to A10
enter okay it's still not taking I think
it is carrying the formula but again no
worries let's enter some random values
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 now
we have 10 values and if you use the
same formula sum of A1 to A10 which chat
gbt initially gave
us we have the summation similarly you
can also ask Char to give you any of the
mathematical and statistical functions
now let's say we want to uh do some
macro level functions right let's say uh
we want an interest
calculator right so before that we need
to save this file
as currently this is CSP right we need
to save it as macro enabled workbook so
that whenever we write a macro the macro
will be accepted by the workbook right
now let's
say uh
okay to insert a macro we need to go to
macros from developer options let's name
our uh macro
as okay let's ask
uh okay
I right let's create this and now let's
ask Char for the
code give me a macro
for
calculating
interest in
Excel it should be giv me the code there
you
go simply calculate the uh simply copy
the code go to your macro is whatever
you have here erase this because the
some you know the function name we
giving a new function name here
calculate interest right instead of
interest just save it it'll ask for a
small
change I think it's done now you can
close this macro and in the same
developer options go to interest create
a button create it somewhere over here
and uh click on the function that you
just created the mro just you created
press okay and if you want to change it
you know you can also change it uh
instead of button one just uh type in
interest there you go done now whenever
you click on this button it will ask the
amount right let's give some principal
amount let's say $10,000 annual interest
rate may be 6% as decimal and term
period let's me let let's think it's uh
one year should be good right so that's
how you create macros using Excel I
think I give one like instead of 60,000
right
uh there go and let's say you want to
take it to a Next Level let's say
advanced level you want it to you know
split the first name and second name or
let's say you wanted to do a vlookup
function to calculate the performance
right now let's say we don't have this
okay uh we don't have a what say display
username we don't have a username in our
current sheet let's imagine we don't
have a username right now I want a we
look a function from Excel or you know
just a syntax also will do give me a v
lookup
function so it will give you the
required formula you can just use it
right and type in the v looker function
here and it's really simple equals to
the lookup value you're looking
for which is let's say here you're
trying to add the lookup formula lookup
value and uh the table array which is
this one right here you have given the
table array comma the column index you
are looking for you wanted the username
right so you need to give these two
columns and the value you wanted is okay
so
uh
now you wanted column index
3 and you wanted exact
match press T to select
enter so I think it required only until
C300 value okay did not give the lookup
value that's my bad uh the lookup range
you are giving is the first two three
you wanted third
column enter and now let's give me a
value add it here and there you go you
have the answer right you have the user
ID and usern name and that's how you use
uh lookup function in Excel now let's
say I wanted to uh okay let's remove
these two here and let's also remove
these two here and let's imagine the
display name itself is your username
here I want to split them into first
name and second name so go back to chat
gbt and ask for a formula give me a
formula to split the name into first
name and second
name an Excel
formula split name into first
name and last
name it will give you the formula
shortly copy
code okay go back to excel paste it
write there okay I think we copied two
codes we just needed one so chat gbt
will give you multiple codes here so you
can just copy the first
one
and erase
these give me a simpler
code okay so I think that was for two
different call columns right so now
let's add it here let's remove this and
add it here now if you drag the same
formula you should be getting the first
names and if you take the second formula
here and paste it in the last name
position you should be getting all the
last
names right if there is no second name
you will be getting a value eror and in
case if you have a value you will be
getting the second name if you can also
wrap this inside if
error
right
say not
available single codes since we're
giving a text value and enter so that's
how you use chat GPD for Excel so now
you can see some data on my spreadsheet
so we have row ID order ID audit date
and ship date ship mod Etc so this means
that this particular data set belongs to
a a sales data set for a store or
something so what I have done is if you
look out the videos on our Channel we
already have created one of the
interactive dashboards using the same
data set so we try to extract month-
on-month sales region category
subcategory Sales Country wise sales
shipment type sales Etc right so I have
uh you know kept the data as it is and
all the pivot tables as it is now let's
say we do not know how to create all
these pivot tables and pivot charts and
slicers Etc we just know that we have
the data and you're new to this and you
want to analyze your data how do you do
that chat GPD is here for the rescue so
before we get on to chat GPD let's
quickly remove all our reference pivot
tables about pivot table I'm quickly
deleting all these left out with only
the data right and again you can do this
dashboard using chat gbd 3.5 or in case
if you have a premium version which is
chat gbt 4 you can directly attach your
data set onto the chat GPD prompt and
chat GPT will do all the analysis you
need right but for now let's experiment
using the chat GPD 3.5 version which is
basically open source and free to use
now let's quickly hop on to chat
GPT so there you go we have chat GPD
version 3.5 we are not switching to
four so now let's quickly um explain
what we are up
to high chart GPT just keep it simple as
if you're talking to your
friend
the D set belongs to
super store
sales or is
about the data set is about uh
Superstore sales
report and I need to
create a
dashboard
for month on
month
SE
so this is the prompt and basically I
just explained in a brief way I'm not uh
giving the detailed information but hope
this works so basically uh what you
supposed to do is uh give U the
requirement one by one but I'm giving it
in a single prom so that I'll get the
results in one single PR let's hope for
that so what you're trying to explain CH
GPD is that you have a sales dat data
set and you're using Excel for for
storing it and for manipulating the data
and trying to build some Innovative
interactive visually appealing charts
and you don't know how to do it so you
explain that to your chat jpd and uh
what are the uh things you are looking
to build what are the charts you're
looking to build so I'm looking to build
a month- on-month sales report which can
be a quarteron quarter month on month
year on Year date wise however the way
you like it right so uh make sure that
your data is properly formatted first so
here let's check out that your date
column is form mattered to date data
type right sometimes what happens is the
representation of date uh changes to
user by user let's say this particular
data set or this particular inventory
has been allocated to five different
people to entry the data right somebody
might use this type of you know here you
have uh let's create a new sheet and try
to let me elaborate what I'm trying to
explain so let's say U person
one person three so let's say I use this
type of uh
formatting 15th December 2025 something
like that and somebody else uses 15 12
2025 and another one uses 15
December
2025 and also sometimes few people also
uh intend or you know may u follow uh a
date pattern which looks something like
this December the 31st
2025 right and it's not wrong so many
people will have different uh
conventions of writing their dates so
you need to make some data cleaning and
okay if you are coming back to data
cleaning we have listed a video in our
descriptions for data cleaning and Excel
and uh that would help you in various uh
data cleaning operations that are um you
know used in dat to-day lives of a data
analyst so that should help so basically
what you are looking for is so instead
of General go back to the DAT types and
here you can check out the data type
options and you can either give a short
date long date or in the case you want
to go for some additional formatting you
can also go to more formatting and here
you can check out the custom formatting
options here you can give a customized
option for now I want to go with date
and the date I want to go with is this
particular one which gives me date month
and yeah click on that and he should be
good to go right so make sure that all
the uh uh dates in your spreadsheet are
following one single single date pattern
so that when it comes to uh month on
month quarter on quarter and EBY sales
that will help you a lot okay it will
just give you a filtered option it will
give you year on year first then quarter
on quarter next and if you expand the
option of quarter on quarter you will
have month on month and if you expand
the month then you will have date wise
so you will have a you know better
understanding when we perform this
operation in a practical Way in real
time and then we have the next type of
chart where we want to identify
country-wise sales then we have
regionwise sales so let's say I have one
country here let's say I want sales from
France and uh I want to know what are
the uh sales happening in central region
of France North region of France so
you'll have region wise sales there and
category wise which category is giving
you the maximum profits or the maximum
sales and inside the category which is
that subcategory or which product is
that that's which is giving you the
highest number of sales you can identify
that and based on that you can plan a
business uh you know you can get up with
a business strategy there and shipment
modes so which type of shipment mode
which should you invest in much so that
you can you know offer better services
to your customers so everything comes so
this is what I want to um you know um
extract from my D set so this is my
requirement you have explained this to
your chat GPT through the prompt and
just
enter now chat GPT should help you break
down the requirements and chat gbt
should help you uh how to you know it'll
get tell you how to uh do the process so
here it will tell you the line chart so
basically it's um it's a it's a rule
that month- on- Monon sales or quote on
quote sales basically wherever the time
is involved the line chart is the best
to represent your numbers
so now it basically tells you how to uh
represent your charts in what I or how
what type of chart to be selected that's
good but now uh can you help
me
create the first
chart in
Excel
there you go so it tells you uh how to
create it and sure you have a column for
dates and other corresponding value so
basically it is telling you to have a
properly mentioned or properly defined
metadata or column headers then select
the data go to the insert tab choose the
line chart okay and let's say uh you
wanted to create an interactive
dashboard right so to create an
interactive dashboard or to basically
basically create a dashboard you need
pivot tables and you don't know how to
create a pivot table you can ask chat
GPD to help you create uh a pivot
table help me create a pivot
table
for the first
type for all the types okay or for the
data set
certainly so it'll mention you the steps
to follow to create a pivot
table there you go so what's the first
step highlight the range of cells that
contain your data set and including
headers and go back to Excel and you can
just click on any cell and control a all
your data set has been selected or these
days you can just select one of the
cells and go to insert menu and pivot
table and now from the table range Excel
will automatically select the entire
range of the table you're looking for or
you're working on and in case if you are
having any doubts on that you can just
select all the range and go to the same
insert option and select the pit table
click on okay in a new worksheet and
there you go you have your new uh say um
pivot table let's delete this now
remember we wanted to create the
month-on-month sale for the first uh
pivot table and pivot chart so and
remember about the uh date formatting so
we'll be looking on that now we will
drag odd date onto row here and you can
see here so this is what I was talking
about so Excel has automatically
segmented your dates we we have about
10,000 rows in this particular data set
and it has segregated all the 10,000
grows into four different years 2020 21
22 and 23 and if you expand the
selection of air it has segregated again
into pter 1 two three and four right and
if you expand quter one you have
month-on-month sales in quarter one
month-on-month sales in quarter two and
month- on month sales in quarter three
and so on right so this is why I was
requesting you to have a proper data
formatting for all your dates right
which could be really helpful when you
want to extract the quarter on quarter
sales and date wise sales and year wise
sales right so now we wanted to find out
month- on-month sales right or year
on-ear sales so where is the sales yeah
here we have the sales parameter just
drag that onto the values and there you
go now format this into the currency
type so the currency is dollar American
dollars and you can eliminate the
leading zeros here if you don't want
them there you go now you have the whole
number here you can also do the same for
this you can select the entire
table go to pivot table okay let's check
the uh options provided by chat gbd
so basically we have created a pivot
table now we want to create a pivot
chart how do I create a pivot
chat so again it's making really clear
statements and really clear steps so
it's again making sure that you create a
pivot table first right so we have a
pivot table and uh highlight pivot table
data click anywhere on your pivot table
to highlight the entire range insert
pivot chart with the pivot table
selected go to the insert tab on the
ribbon and then click on pivot chart and
uh open the insert chart dialogue box
choose the type you want and uh
customize the chart select the chart so
customizing the chart we look onto it
and Fields if you want to keep a few
Fields you can and if you want to
eliminate a few Fields you can you can
also do that refresh data let's say why
refresh data see chat gbt is so
brilliant right so let's say uh I have
the sales data until 2023 and now we are
in 2024 let's say we update 2024 onto
this particular spreadsheet and now we
have that particular data in the
original spreadsheet but that is missing
here in that scenario what you can do is
just go to data and here you will find
the refresh all option once you click on
this you can find the 2024 data updated
here for now we have not added yet but
in case if it's added all you can do is
just refresh your sheet and everything
will change so brilliant suggestion from
chat jpd and save and share in case if
you want to share so let's follow the
same steps select any cell in the pivot
table select all the sheets go to insert
Tab and here recommended charts or go to
the charts option and select the chart
that you are looking for so we are
dealing with uh time so I would go with
the line chart just click okay but in
case if you want to create an
interactive dashboard just go to pivot
table analyze and here you have the
pivot charts and again it'll give you
the same option just select the line
chart here and press okay so you have
your line chart over here so again if
you are editing this so you can remove
the Legends if you want remove U
anything else or you can customize that
okay there you
go and if you want to edit the name of
the chart you can also do that so I will
do this as M Sales
report okay accordingly I'll change the
sheet
name there you go right
now quickly we will create the other
charts as well so the process is same
you can hold control and drag this
particular sheet and you have the next
sheet so the next uh requirement that we
had that we requested chat jpd was the
country wise
sales so everything will remain the same
what changes is okay let's close this
and here instead of order data we will
have okay let's remove this from rows
and quarters
months right country so we will drag
country into rules and there you go now
we have countries now country wise so
you can uh select the cell go to pivot
table analyze pivot chart and you can
select the bar graph so it automatically
gave you the first suggestion as bar
graph click on that and you have the bar
graph over here and you can also edit
the chart you don't want you don't want
the Legends you can remove them and edit
the name of the chart to
country wise
sales so and uh quickly drag and drop
the sheet again new pivot table and here
you wanted category wise
sales or segment wise
sales uh close this
particular thing be this and instead of
country
you're going to add segment to the row
and remove country and you have segment
wise sales select any cell on the pivot
table go to pivot table analyze pivot
chart and here you can use any of the
available um charts here let me use the
finnal chart or
histogram bar chart will be better press
okay and there you go you have the B
chart same
edit your you know customize your uh
chart change the name
to segment wise
sales hold control and drag the sheet
now you have subcategory wise
sales instead of segment you will be
selecting the
subcategory
you can remove
segment and you can see the chart also
changed here and again you can do the
category wise sales so this was segment
wise
sales you can quickly change the segment
to
category and you have it we quick
quickly go back to yeah so we have done
the category Wise subcategory Wise
region wise is remaining and shipment
modes so quickly drag or drop the region
remove subcategory from the
list there you have the region wise
sales edit the
name
and the last one which is about the
shipment
modes remove region and there you
go I can create a new dashboard over
here and name it as dashboard
you can do some customization to your
dashboard like selecting these
cells giving it a
color
there you go now you can quickly copy
and paste all these uh charts to the
dashboard starting from the
month-on-month
sales
copy
paste
so I'll quickly do all the uh pas
thingss as soon as
possible
there you go you can also manage the
size of these charts so that everything
fits onto one sheet so for now let's try
to unpen
this so that we have a little better
visual appearance
okay not a
problem and now uh we need some filter
right so something which can make it a
little more interactive that's when you
add slices and let's say you don't know
how to add slices back to chat gbd and
ask chat gbd how do I add
slices to my
dashboard
there you go so is telling you to
uh add everything in a stepbystep way
and it also is talking about the
interactivity right it's it is asking
you to connect all the slices it it's
telling you to report the connections
right if you just add the slices based
on one single okay basically you need to
select one of your charts here and
select a pivot table or pivot chart go
to the pivot table or chart associated
with the slicer and insert and go to the
insert Tab and insert a slicer I I'll
tell you that so basically it it's
telling you in a very beautiful way
stepbystep manner right and even after
adding the slicer it it is telling you
to connect all the uh basically all the
charts or all the um you know chart
dashboards and charts you created at
this particular tutorial and connect all
the charts to that particular slicer
using the report connections option
and you can get the interactivity right
so in in a very beautiful manner it has
explained you let's try the way it has
explained to us go to the dashboard
select any one of it and go to the
insert option and here you have the
slicer right so now you have all the
slices over here so basically we wanted
what type of slices so I have created a
month- on Monon uh chart so I'll go with
order date SL slicer which is here then
I have created segment wise sales so I
want segment slicer country wise slicer
category and subcategory wise
slicers region wise so region slicer and
do I have anything else let's scroll
down that's the last one so where is the
shipment
here yeah shift mode country region
category subcategory segment order dates
and shift mode
so I will have multiple slices in one go
right now you have to arrange your
slices in such a way that they are
interactive and they they look like they
are sorted in one place so let me do
that quickly we have some space left
here in the bottom place of the
dashboard you can also keep your slices
there so what basically chat gbd meant
was if you try to use the slices here it
will you know the changes will reflect
only in one of the pivot charts not on
all the pivot charts so to get that
interactivity to get that connectivity
between all the charts you need to do a
small setting which is called as report
connections so select one of the slices
over here right click and here you have
something called report connections so
when you report connections you have all
the pivot charts and pivot tables that
you just created you can just select all
those pivot tables that you created and
press on okay so that all these pivot
tables are connected to that particular
slicer uh you can just expand this and
check if all the pivot tables are
selected press okay do the same for all
the slices I'll quickly do
that
so there you go we have interconnected
all the charts now let's say I want to
find out the sales that happened in the
latest year just go to the filters
select any of the dates
2023 and you have the data and if you
want to select any particular country
then you can also do that I want to go
with United Kingdom and in United
Kingdom we have all the data
here let's say I want to check out only
for the
phones there you go now you have an
interactive dashboard which will tell
you the sales that happened on the date
of 16th of November 2023 in the region
United Kingdom for phones all right and
uh segment is home or office ship and
mode with standard class and major sales
that happen are from nor region and the
category is from tech technology right
right and that's how you create an
interactive dashboard using chat GPD in
Excel so each and every step has been
mentioned very clearly by chat GPD and
you have all the data in one place so
let's quickly remove all the
filters and there you have the entire
dashboard with that we have crossed the
first Milestone on Excel proceeding
ahead we have SQL SQL acts as the
gatekeeper to data Kingdom SQL is a
powerful query language used to
communicate with relational databases it
allows you to extract manipulate and
transform data stored in databases
making it essential for preparing data
for further analysis in Excel or powerbi
by writing SQL queries you can retrieve
specific information filter large data
sets and join data from different
sources ensuring the data used for
analysis is accurate and relevant that
said let's begin with SQL so to install
SQL server in Windows you will need two
different software packages the first
one being the SQL Server itself and the
second one is a SQL Server management
tool let's download these let's go back
to
Google Now type
in
SQL
Server
download now you can choose the first
option SQL Server downloads from
Microsoft ensure that you're choosing
the software from the service provider
which is Microsoft itself not the third
party software
files now if you scroll down you can see
two different versions of the SQL s the
first one being the developer and the
second one being the express if you are
a learner then I would recommend you to
go with the express version because it
has more features than the developer
version and also it is open source now
let's go with the express version
download now the software file should be
downloaded
shortly so the express the XE file has
been downloaded successfully click on it
and it should be run now it is asking
for the admin permission give the admin
rights and then you should be good to
go once you provide the admin rights the
SQL Server installation will begin so
here you can see the window or the
dialogue box which will give you three
different options basic custom and
download Media I would recommend you to
go with the basic version select that
and now read all the terms and
agreements post that accept
cep and check the location where the SQL
Server is being installed if you're
comfortable with it you can click on
install or if you want to change go to
browse and select your folder I'm
comfortable with this particular
location which is program files so I'll
click on install it should be installing
in a
while there you go the download is
successful the installation phase might
take a little
while
so the download has been successfully
done and the installation has also
completed successfully now only the
first phase of the installation process
is done right the SQL Server is done but
we need another tool which is SS SMS or
SQL Server management Studio that you
can get right over here just click on
install ssmv and it will redirect you to
a different web page this just click on
the web page you want to go or the web
browser you want to
choose and this is the web page that I
was talking about scroll a little
towards down and you can see the option
saying free download for SQL Server
management studio version
19.02 so you might be having the latest
versions in the future as well let's go
with the current version click on
it and there you go the system setup is
being downloaded here
it's 629 MV so it might take a
while there you go the Microsoft SQL
Server management Studio has already
downloaded and is being installed right
now so now you can see there is one
bottleneck you need to restart the
system or you can close and start it
anyways but let's choose the restart
option so so after the restart the SQL
Server management studio is downloading
a few more packages and the installation
should be done in a
while there you go the installation has
been complete and you have the server
management Studio ready to execute you
open
that so here you have the server type
server name and authentication if you
want to change them you can but I'm
comfortable with these and just press
connect and you should be good to go and
get started with your query
editor then you can start writing your
queries on your SQL Server so now we're
on the open to operating system let's
quickly start our terminal the shortcut
key for that is control alt D so now we
have the terminal opened so we might
have to um run a few couple of commands
so the first one would be sud sudo appt
upgrade or
update it will ask for the host
password now you have the
update
so usually what happens is when you try
with the default method or when you try
with the default codes or the commands
you might miss a couple of updates or to
your files right so what happens when
you try with the default codes or
default commands say you might miss a
file or two so when you update the open
to you will get the missing files as
well now if in case if you find I've got
all the updates but in case if you find
some files are missing uh you might
receive a message from abundo saying
can't update or not fetched right in
that case you can try upgrade
command even then if you miss a couple
of files there is another similar
command which says sudo AP full upgrade
we should also try that as
well so basically what happens is you
might have one single command which say
sudo app install my SQL right so that
particular command will run but
unfortunately sometimes it misses to
face complete get I mean it misses to
get all the files So to avoid that we
will try the brute force method which
will get all the files all the updates
on all the executable files you require
to run my SQL and open to right just a
couple of minutes
yes so similar to upgrade we have full
upgrade it's
done and in case if you wanted to remove
some unnecessary files you have a
command for that as well so let's take a
look at
that so the pseudo app Auto remove will
remove any of those older packages which
you no longer need after the complete
full upgrade let's run
that
there you go so now we are done with the
open to update let's clear the screen by
pressing control plus C shortcut key the
shortcut key control L has been pressed
and the screen has been cleared now now
we're good to go with our SQL
installation command which is sud sudo
APD get
install my SQL
yeah so again we Face some issues
regarding the
installation so this means that we might
have some files which we might not need
related to mySQL so my suggestion would
be to eliminate those particular files
using the Pudo appt get remove Purge my
SQL Server my SQL client my SQL common
yes that is why so we're trying to
remove any of the existing files
so let's
again let's try to get Auto
remove and auto
clean again the
update there you go we have the update
and now we shall try to install the
MySQL server with the following command
but the difference is we are trying to
install it with yes that is hyphen y
providing the
permissions there you go you can see my
SQL is running as P ID
6045 anyways let's also check the status
once the update is
done there you go let's quickly check
the status by using pseudo system
control status my
SQL and there you go it says the server
is operational and the main P ID is
6240 let's quickly clear the screen
using contrl l key combination and now
let's start SQL by using the command Soo
my SQL they should start my SQL for you
there you go that's how you install my
SQL in open to operating system again
you can run all your queries based on my
SQL and in case if you want to quit just
type in quit now without further delay
let's get started with how to install my
SQL in Windows to install my SQL let's
go to Google and now let's open the
official website of MySQL workbench so
you have to type MySQL download and go
to the first link which will take you to
the MySQL workbench homepage now scroll
down and you can see my SQL Community
downloads click on that and here you can
see a lot of options go for my SQL
install for Windows then here check your
version let's select the latest one and
let's select operating system is Windows
you have MSI installer and MSI installer
two go to the second option which is
about 200 MB not the first one now just
click on no thanks just start my
download and now go to downloads there
you go your installer file is getting
downloaded let's wait for a few
seconds now the MySQL installer has been
downloaded show in folder run that
particular
installer provide any admin rights if
you are having admin permissions if you
don't have any admin rights I think the
installation should start right
away there you go the install has
started after giving the admin rights I
think this should be the last admin
rights and then the installation should
go there you go the install has been
started now here we have various options
server only client full custom if you
don't have any idea then go to full but
in case if you have idea about what
you're going to install I would
recommend go to custom and select the
server workbench and a few other things
and that should be good so let me go for
server ver first that's a server my SQL
Server 8.0 that's the one we need and if
you need shell you can also go to Shell
and the most important one for today's
session is about the workbench so
anyways let's take the server and then
the shell and also the workbench the
drag and drop is not working I think we
can select the arrow there's the
workbench next is the shell and after
that we should be selecting our server
there you go now next and exit
all these three will be installed
soon I think they have got installed now
yeah I think we should go to next one
last check once yeah so next next and
here just check the port numbers and I
would like to go with the default port
number here no changes and next and here
we have two use Legacy authentication
but I would go with the recommended one
now provide password for your workbench
choose the password that you would like
to remember that's my first password and
I'll be repeating the same password Here
for confirmation and next there you go
let's have a standard system account
Grant full access to my SQL and now
execute so that all these configurations
get applied to your installation we are
started now your work which has been
started double click and now give a
password that you gave during the
configuration enter and that's how you
install workbench in your local Windows
system now you can create new models new
databases Etc and you can run a default
command which is show databases which
will show you the default databases that
are ready available for you to work on
on the my SQL workbench on vendors the
command is show databases and semicolon
but now let's run the default commands
and as the series come down from Simply
learn on SQL you will learn more SQL
tutorials so that's the true databases
command WR that class symbol and there
you go you have the default databases so
first let's have a quick look on the
syntax we use to create a database so
first we have a create keyword which
will explain the SQL Server that we are
trying to create a new element which can
be a database or a table next we have
the keyword database which clarifies the
SQL that we're trying to create a new
database the next one is is not
mandatory if not exist just we're trying
to make sure that the database that we
are going to create is not already
existing so if you use this if not exist
then SQL will tell you in case if there
is an existing database on the same
database name then it will not allow you
to create a duplicated database and
followed by that we have the database
name which can be anything so I've just
created as database name here now that
we are clear with the syntax let's get
back to the IDE that is my SQL to
execute a command to create a new
database so now we are on the SQL
workbench now let's quickly try to log
in there you go now you can see some
existing databases on the left hand side
of the workbench sys or system is the
default one so I already created test
and trial let's try to create a new one
right away so the create
keyword and datab
space key and then F not
exists so here you can see I'm trying to
capitalize the keywords so that it's
easier to understand what is the code
and what is the user defined names right
so create database if not exis
and simply
Lear
DP that's our code let's try to execute
this and there you go so here you can
see in the action output create database
if not exist simply Lear DP has been
executed successfully now we can run a
new code which says show
databases this should show us the newly
created database which is simply learn
which is right over here so that's how
you create new database in SQL now let's
quickly look at the syntax we need to
create a table in SQL so we will be
using the keyword create to let the SQL
know that we're trying to create an
element which can be a table or database
followed by that we will be using the
table keyword to explain the SQL that we
are trying to create a table here
followed by that a customized table name
then inside that we will be starting
with the parameters which can be the
elements or columns which are present in
new table column one or parameter 1 it's
data type and constraint so what is a
constraint we will be understanding
about the data tap and constraint when
we are in the Practical mode Let's
quickly try to understand the syntax
over here so these are the things create
keyword table keyword table name which
is a customized or user defined name for
the table then the parameters involved
in the table that is the columns column
one 2 3 data type and constraint
followed by that close the bracket and
use the semicolon to explain SQL that it
is the end of the code now let's get
back to the SQL workbench so we logged
into the SQL workbench so now we have
logged into the SQL workbench now
previously we had created a database
that is simply learn database now we
will try to create the table in the same
database now we will be using the create
keyword
table now table name which can be
anything let's try to create a student
database or employee database
you can see
that I'm using capitals for keywords and
Smalls for the user defined ones just to
make it clear for the reader to
understand what is what if it is in
capital it is a keyword if it is in
small it is a userdefined name now
EMP ID which is an integer type and then
we
constraint not
null so remember the data type and
constraints that we discussed earlier so
this is it so you're trying to tell the
SQL that the ID what you're creating is
of integer data type and since this can
be a primary keyword it should not be
null right now the next one employee
name
which can be character data type so
let's keep it as CH r or
character and let's give the size as
115 now the next
one okay I forgot to give the
constraint
[Music]
default okay let's not keep it as
default null it cannot be null as
well then comes the
address which can again be
character and let's give it as 500 as
the
size and followed by that it can be
default here we are trying to tell SQL
that it is okay to keep the employee
address column as null it can be blank
again it's your wish if you don't want
the address column to be empty you can
keep it as not null and if it's all
right for you to keep it as null then
you can provide it as default null right
so these are the parameters their data
types and the constraints right now we
will understand them a little more
detail in theoretical section now
followed by The Columns the last one is
to dedicate or create create a primary
key let SQL know which is a primary key
so primary key is very important for
every database or table and I'll explain
you that in the theoretical section
again now which is the primary key the
ID what we created for employees that is
EMP ID is the primary key this
particular primary key will be really
important when we are trying to work
with two different tables with one
single column in common between both the
tables right so with that we have
created the code for creating a new
table in a database now let's quickly
try to execute it so there is a small
error let's try to resolve it yes so the
small error that we created is we did
not try to select a database right
before creating a table you need to
select the database or explain SQL which
database is supposed to be used now for
that we have to use the use keyword and
the database name that is simply learn
DB then me colum now when you run this
particular code SQL will understand we
need to use the simply learn DB and then
it will get access to that particular DB
then it will read this particular code
and try to create a new table let's
quickly run it and there you
go let's try to eliminate this code for
for a while run this now we're using the
simply learn DB eliminate this
code now on this particular code once
again and okay so instead of character
we can use
workare and run it since character limit
was 255 and we gave 500 in stiff
character if we provide work app we can
provide the maximum limit
so now the table is successfully created
here so that's how you can create a new
table in
SQL so what exactly are temp tables in
SQL so temp table is a temporary table
so the term temporary is
self-explanatory you know that every
database in SQL has tables right now
let's say you created 10 tables in your
database and you close your MySQL
workbench or you close your database and
you restart it after a while and then
you will have all your 10 tables intact
in your database but temporary table is
not like that it is something different
which has its existence until the
session of the database is running let's
say you open the database now you have
the session of the database running you
created the 11th table as a temporary
table and that particular 11th temporary
table will be existing in the database
only until the current database is
running and active once you close it
once you turn it off or once you restart
it the temporary 11th table that you
created will die or it will be
eliminated so that is the meaning of
temp table now let's see how we can
create a temporary
table so the syntax is completely
similar to the temporary or to the table
what we usually create right it is
similar to the table what we regularly
create but the only catches we will be
using the keyword temporary create
temporary table table name which is US
defined name and inside that the
parameters may be the employee ID
student ID employee name student ready
name Etc right so this is how we create
the temporary table now let's quickly
get back to the cql workbench and try to
create a temporary table add some data
into it and try to display the temporary
table if getting your learning started
is half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know more now we are back
on the SQL workbench and meanwhile we
are logging in you might have a question
right when you say that the temp table
will be existing or running only until
the database is active then why create
those temporary tables in the workbench
right the sole purpose of using
temporary tables is in a few cases the
intermediate results of the data
analytics process are important and you
can have a quick reference on the
intermediate results and you don't want
them to be existing in your database in
a permanent basis right for such
scenarios you can use a temporary
database now here on my workbench we
have a simple code for create creating a
temporary table so I'll be creating the
temporary table on the name of student
and we have student ID integer data type
student name worker and uh department
and student ID will be the primary key
now let's use the database that is use
simply learn database to get access and
uh we have the access now let's quickly
see what and all tables we have using
the show
command show
tables
enter and we have two tables employee
and employee table two but not
student right now let's quickly execute
this control
enter and now let's use the insert
command same like we inserted in the
previous tables insert into table name
student parameters ID name
department and values comma separated
values student ID name and department or
group whatever he took in college right
now let's execute this
code control enter there you go the data
has been successfully included now let's
Select Staff from student that is view
the contents in this particular table we
have the values in this particular table
and let's also see if we we have that
particular data included in the database
or not let us show
tables there you go it's not included in
the database but it is active when you
try to you know print the values in that
particular table which is in the
database it will show you but when you
try to fetch that particular existence
or the permanent existence of that
particular table it will not be present
and this particular table will be active
only until the database is active now
let's restart this particular work page
I'm closing
it restarting
it now if I run this I will not get it
you can see the error the
database right okay then let's have the
database
selected and let's try to run the
command there you go table simply learn
DB do student does not exist right
previously when you try to execute the
table was giving us values now we have
the error saying the table does not
exist right that is how a temporary
database
runs now the syntax is as follows now
here you have the insert and into
keywords table name is the user defined
name name for the table then you have
the columns that is column number one
two and Etc then after declaring the
column names you have the keyword values
which will help SQL understand this is a
tuple and these are the values involved
inside the Tuple that is Row one value
one row one value two so on and Row one
value n so this type of syntax will help
you to add one tle at one time and this
will take a lot of time to process you
can see to insert the next tle we are
writing a completely new syntax once
again using the same insert into table
name column 1 2 3 n values and row
number two that is the second tle right
so this type of code will take longer
duration to run as well as it will take
longer lines or number of lines will be
extra so is there a way where you can
add multiple Tes in one single go yes
there is so the syntax will be
completely same right so you will be
using one insert into keyword one table
name and once you will be declaring all
the column numbers and once you will be
using the values keyword the only
difference is you will be adding
multiple Tes under the values bracket
right you will be declaring the number
of values you want to include in one
single go and this whole query becomes
as a whole and once you run this query
all the values will be added at once now
that you clear with the syntax let's
quickly get back to to the SQL workbench
and try to run this
command now we are on the MySQL
workbench let's quickly log
in there you go we have logged in let's
use the simply learn database once again
so that we get access to the data which
we have so we already have an employees
table so let's see what's presently
included in employee table select star
from empl o y
e table
semicolon so this is the data that we
already have in our table now let's try
to add some more
data so now we will include one single
element or one single tle data related
to one single employee right using the
first type of syntax let's quickly EX
execute this the command got executed
again let's quickly see what's present
in the
table select
star from employee table again you can
see I'm using lower case for the
userdefined keywords and uppercase for
the predefined keywords just to make
sure that the code is
understandable and which is the user
defined keyword and which is the
predefined keyword so these are the the
ones in smaller case are user defined
and the ones in uppercase are predefined
right so we have successfully included
one single element or one single tle the
details which are related to Brian and
now let's try to modify the same code
and try to include few more Tes inside
the same insert command and try to
insert multiple rows into the
table now here you can see we are using
the same insert into employee table
command and instead of Brian we replaced
or we added six more entries under the
values section right and the only
difference is we are trying to separate
the tles using a comma you can see we
are enclosing one tle inside the
parenthesis and we are separating two
tles with the help of a comma right
ensure that you include comma between
every tle and you can ignore the Comm
for the last T you can see we are not
using any sort of comma or any sort of
specifier at the end right so and we are
closing the command using the semicolon
this explains SQL that it is the end now
we are going to run this command and see
the
output so there you go the command got
successfully executed now let's again
execute the select command and see if
the data is involved or included or
inserted into the given employee table
now there you go the command got
successfully executed and you can see
the table over here and you can see that
all the data or all the doues we
included into the table using the insert
command in one go are successfully
included so that's how you insert
multiple rows into a table using SQL SQL
so let's quickly take a look at the
syntax that we will be following to
change the column name in SQL so the
syntax is as follows we will be using
the alter and table keywords and we will
be specifying the table name and then we
will give the rename column keyword then
the old existing column name and to the
new colum which we need to change it to
so having a clear understanding of the
syntax let's try to execute this command
in the Practical mode so let's get back
to the MySQL workbench so now we are on
the MySQL workbench let's quickly get
access to the simply learn
database there you go and now let's
quickly take a look at the column names
in our existing table now you can see
the First Column is the employee number
let's try to change that by using the
alter
table command and
then and now the rename
keyword the column name is EMP
number to EMP ID semicolon let's quickly
execute this
command and there you go now let's try
to execute the select command once again
and see the output there you go now the
employee number has been changed to
employee ID so how do you delete a
column in SQL now let's quickly take a
look on the syntax we will be using
today so we will be using the alter
table keyword then the table name the
drop keyword to drop a particular column
name and followed by the drop keyword we
have the column name which we are
supposed to be dropping off now that we
have a clear idea about the syntax let's
get back to the MySQL workbench to
execute this particular command so far
we try to create a database create a
table add some data onto the table using
the insert command and update a
particular tle and try to eliminate a
single row now we're trying to eliminate
a complete column here so let's not
eliminate the existing columns let's try
to create a new column and then try to
eliminate it so for that we will be
using the alter table command so this is
the alter table command and the employee
table which is the employee table name
then we are trying to use the add
keyword and we are trying to add a new
column that is the PIN code which is a
work or character data type and not null
we're not keeping it as null and in case
if we did not add any value into the PIN
code the default value will be na which
is a text type right so we are encoding
it using single codes now let's try to
run this
code and let's quickly try to check the
table employ
Table and there you go now we have pin
code here and the null values in the PIN
code so we don't want this pin code over
here so we will eliminate this pin code
column using the same alter command so
alter
table then the table
name and then the column we want to drop
using the drop keyword which is pin code
so let's execute this command and see
the output so there you go the PIN code
column has been successfully eliminated
so so that's how you completely
eliminate a column in SQL how to
eliminate a selected column in a SQL
table now let's quickly take a look at
the syntax that we will be following to
execute this particular
command the syntax is as follows we will
be using the alter table keyword then
the table name where we want to
eliminate the column followed by that
the drop column keyword and the column
name now let's get back to the SQL
workbench to execute this particular
command now we are on the SQL workbench
and you can see we have five different
columns over here and we have the phone
number column which does not have
anything now we will try to eliminate
this particular phone number column
since we do not need that for our
purposes now the command is really
simple as discussed before we will be
using the alter table keyword and the
table name and the drop column keyword
and the phone number which is the column
name now let's quickly execute this
particular command and see the output
there you go now the colum phone number
has been successfully eliminated now
let's run the select command once again
and see the new table there you go the
phone number column has been
successfully eliminated now with that we
have come to an end of the session on
how to eliminate a selected column in an
existing table in SQL how do you delete
a row in SQL let's quickly take a look
at the
syntax so we will be using the delete
keyword and the from keyword adding the
table name and giving a work Clause with
a user defined condition so this was be
a basic Syntax for the process of
deleting a single Row in the SQL table
now to understand in a much better way
let's get back to the SQL workbench so
now we are on the SQL workbench and
previously we tried to create a table
add some data using the insert command
and update of value using the update
command now let's say we have to delete
the last row which is one6 Jeremy hyad
let's say Jeremy found a new job in a
new organization and now you need to
eliminate his credentials from your
database so we will be using the
following code that is
delete from table name is
employee
table and the V
Clause now the
condition which is
EMP
ID is equals
to6 now let's try to run the code there
you go the employee is being eliminated
from that particular database now let's
try to recheck the table so
select star from em p l o y e
e
table run the code and there you go the
last ID which was one6 has been
eliminated from your database how to
eliminate duplicate records in SQL table
now we can eliminate the duplicate
records and SQL by a few methods so we
will use the most simplest ones the
first one is using the inner joint along
with a W loss and the second one is a
simple and the humble distant command
now we have a brief idea on the methods
let's understand them in a much more
detailed way through a practical
demonstration now let's get back to the
MySQL workbench to understand the codes
in a much better way so now we are on
the MySQL workbench and we will get
access to our simply learn database and
we are in the simply learn database so
previously we used to work on a employee
table so let's not work on the same
employee table since we have actual data
there let's try to duplicate that table
so that we will have some duplicate
entries in between so we will be
changing the m employee ID numbers and
we will also be using the same employee
ID numbers so the employee ID has some
details to it so we'll be understanding
that in a much more detail while we are
executing the commands and uh we will
also try to remove the primary key from
the table so I'll also explain why we
are going to include the primary table
and also will explain the usage of
eliminating it so when you have the
primary key in the table SQL workbench
or any SQL will automatically stop you
from adding duplicated values but let's
say if you add a duplicate entry with a
new primary key right then it will not
stop you so we'll also have a
demonstration about what to do in such
scenarios so now let's try to quickly
create a duplicate employ table which
will be employe table two and then we
will try to add some duplicate entries
into it remember we will not use the
primary key here so the code will be
create
table EMP l y e
table
to and everything will be same which is
from the previous table which will be
the employee ID integer type employ name
character type this character type pin
code will be integer and now normally we
include the primary key in this
way primary key brackets open
em so this is the way how we add the
primary key but we are not going to add
it since we want to know what happens if
we enter data which also has the
duplication of the primary key right so
we will not give any primary key over
here let's quickly run this there you go
the new duplicated table of employee
table has been created let's try to
insert the same values with some
duplication there you go I have pasted
the command for inserting the values and
if You observe clearly at the end I have
repeated the values of Tony ktie Sama
Jun and Gloria so these five will be the
duplicate values and also we are trying
to enter the duplicated primary key
since we did not declare the ID as the
primary key it will accept all these
values let's quickly run this and there
you go the values have been successfully
entered into the table let's quickly see
if we have the
duplication select
star
from
employee
table control enter there you go so so
you can see the duplicate values are
also added onto the table now how do you
remove these duplications remember we
discussed the distinct one distinct
method which is the second one so that
happens to be the most simplest one
let's see how it works so here we will
write a simple select
command
select
distinct
star
from the employee table
to now this will give us the distinct
values right but again when you run this
particular command which is Select star
you will have all the details back again
right our job is to eliminate them so
what we will do is we'll create a
duplicate table so let's name it as dup
table
so create
table and duplicate table will be the
name
Now quickly execute this command there
you go now we have
the data which we obtain from the
distant command is stored into the table
named as duplicate table now let's
quickly drop the employee table
to okay the table has been successfully
dropped so when we run the same command
once again it says simply learn theb did
not find any table by the name employe
table to that means it's been eliminated
now the next thing we need to do is
rename
it so what we're trying to do is we are
trying to use the alter table and we are
trying to rename duplicate copy to
employ table 2 so that we have the
actual table here after eliminating the
duplicated values it's not dup copy it's
actually dup table
right there you go now let's execute
this successfully done now if we execute
this particular select command you can
see we have the cleaned data without any
duplicate entries this was one of the
simplest ways of eliminating duplicates
in a SQL table now let's try to get a
step ahead and try to use some join
commands and where commands and we
conditions and using those we will try
to El eliminate the duplications in a
table now we are talking about a table
which does have the you know primary
key and the datas will be duplicated let
me explain you how now let us
declare
the primary key as employee
ID
b p s EMP I
right now we do have a primary key now
there is no way okay let's try to create
this uh before that let's try to
truncate employee table
two so we can use
the not drop table we can use the trunk
it so let's replace drop with trun gate
so that the data which we have an
employee table will be removed that go
now we will or let's quickly drop the
table because we are trying to create
the new table right so let's create the
new
table so once we have executed the drop
table command the table has been
successfully removed now let's try to
create this particular
table control enter there you go the
table got successfully created now let's
try to duplicate the same entries
remember I'm not changing the primary
key
here now when I run this command I will
get an error which says primary key
cannot be duplicated so here you can see
duplicate entry for nine and you cannot
have the duplicate entries right this is
one way to avoid duplications but what
if someone comes up with a brilliant
idea to replace the primary key now if I
change the primary
key at 17
18 let's say we
also have this data
copy let's duplicate
this right this will be our 19 and this
will be our 20 now we have unique
primary keys for all our data and we
also know there are some duplications
let's try to execute this command and
see the
output so somewhere something is not
correct
yet okay this
one so Tony has been repeated so we can
have a different ID for Tony let's say
we have Tony as
21 try to execute the command once again
it should be clear
now okay it still has some duplication
somewhere yes it's right here let's keep
this as
22 okay I think we made a lot of
duplications
somehow let's quickly take a look at all
the major keywords are duplicated or not
so we copied from Gloria so after Gloria
V we will remove these so Gloria so we
just make we're trying to make sure that
the primary keys are unique here so 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20
20
22 there you go so now we believe that
all the primary keys are unique let's
try to run this command and see if we we
get the same error or not no so now all
the data has been inserted into the
duplicate table which is employee table
2 and we also have some duplicate
entries now how would you
recognize that we don't have any
duplicates or how would you recognize
which data has been exactly duplicated
and how do you even remove it now the
old distinct command is not going to
work anyhow let's see if it works by any
chance so when I try to run the distin
command it will give me all 22 rows with
all the duplicate entries right in this
case we can use the first method which
was the join and where condition method
right let's try to do that so we going
to use the delete
command delete
T1 from
employee
table
2
T1 in a
join in a join employe table 2 as T2 so
so we are declaring two different tables
so we are considering T1 as one table
and T2 as the next or second table so T1
and T2 are the copies of the same
existing employee table two right now we
are joining these two tables and we are
having a v condition over here so from
table T1 we're going to eliminate table
one from table two where we have an
intersection and where we have the
employee IDs greater than employee ID in
EMP okay let's not confuse so let's
execute the command first okay let's
execute this to understand what I mean
here so here when we go a little down
you can see 14 for Tony right actual
employee ID of Tony is nine but we have
14 for Tony and Gloria we have 18 19 20
and again for KT we have 22 the actual
number of KT is 10 right so now it will
try to recognize the highest number of
employee ID so it will recognize the
highest employee ID number and it will
retain it and rest all the numbers will
be eliminated so this is the first ver
condition and we're also giving a string
comparison function where SQL will try
to identify if there is a similarity
between between the employee name of the
first table and the employee name of the
second table and we know that when you
give the string comparison operation if
it results in zero it means the strings
are equal if it results in one it means
the strings are not matching now that we
understood the logic of this particular
statement let's try to execute it so
there you go so we have executed the
command now let's try to see what's left
in the table there you go now we should
be having the usual 13 number of
employees in our table and you can see
that the records are retained where the
employee ID number is the highest
remember we had the number 10 as
employee ID for KD and we have that over
here in case if you want the actual
numbers to be placed however they were
you can make a small change to your
command all you need to do is keep this
particular change this particular
greater than symbol to lower than symbol
and you will retain the actual numbers
of the employee records so that's how
you can eliminate the duplicate entries
in the table and if you ask me hey only
two conditions are enough don't you
think the PIN code and you know we also
have PIN code and the address of the
employees don't you think that is also
important yes you can also do that you
can make some minor modifications to
your code and try to include all those
remaining things and again you can do
the same right now let's try to
eliminate the data in our table let's
truncate it and we should be having no
data left in our table and let's try to
insert the duplicate entries once again
and okay before that let's try to do
this particular execution remember we
try to keep the employee ID let's try to
execute that and try to
print it and we should be having the
actual numbers over here right as
expected now let's again trunet the data
and try to compare the conditions or
will be using the where condition and
we'll have all the parameters included
in our condition let's truncate the
table and now let's try to add the
duplicate entries once
again there you go we have all the
duplicate entries entered now what we
will be doing is we will be using the
same command but the only change will be
the string comparison or the where
condition right so you can keep this
string comparison if you want or if you
can change that let me change that
actually so instead
of this we will use this particular
command where we are trying to compare
the employee ID so let's keep the
employee ID as lesser than so that we
have the actual employee ID numbers and
we are using an and condition over here
so that uh this particular condition
should be valid and the employee name
should be equal to the employee name in
T1 and
T2 yeah and uh the next one is here we
have the employee address so the
employee address in T1 and T2 should
also be same and pin code from both the
table should also be same so what we are
trying to compare here is we are trying
to keep the employee ID with the least
number or the least value and the names
of the employee should be same the
address of the employee should be same
and the PIN code of the employee should
be same in that particular condition you
can try to delete the record let's try
to execute this and there you go the
command got executed and now let's try
to execute the select command which
should give us the final result so here
you go control enter and you have the
data here so now we have successfully
eliminated all the duplicates by
comparing the values in each and every
single column and we also have retained
the original ID of each and every
employee now that's how you try to
eliminate duplicates in SQL
tables how to change the data type of a
column in SQL now let's take a quick
look on the syntax we will be using
using to change the data type of the
column in
SQL so this is a syntax we'll be using
so we will be using the alter keyword
table keyword and table name so alter is
the keyword which will help SQL to
understand that we are trying to modify
something and we are selecting the table
by offering the table name and then we
have the modify keyword which will help
SQL to understand that we are trying to
modify something and we are modifying
the column name from the the table
selected and we are modifying that
particular column to a different data
type which will be specified over here
in place of data type keyword right so
now that we are clear with the syntax
let's proceed and execute the command
and change some column data types now we
are on the SQL workbench previously we
created an employee database in simply
learn DB and we will be using the same
table here so we will be typing use
simply learn DB
so that we get access to the simply
learn DB and the tables we have there so
let's select
all employee
table col in let's execute
this so there you go we have the table
on our screen and let's quickly describe
the table using the dec
command and this will give us the data
types of each and every column in our
table now you can see we have pin code
in the format of work app so let's try
to alter or modify this particular pin
code column from work to integer since
it only saves the numbers right
so our Command for that was
alter table table name which is employee
table modify was the
keyword modify the column pin code to
integer semicolon now let's quick L run
this command and there you go the
command got executed successfully let's
try to describe the table once again and
there you go now the PIN code was
earlier mentioned as worka and now it
got changed it to integer now that's how
you alter or modify or change the data
type of a column in a table in SQL that
is how to print or how to obtain current
date in SQL now the syntax is really
simple we have two different commands to
do that we can just type in select get
date or we can just type in select
current date or C date so these
particular commands or functions will
fetch us the current date in SQL now to
execute these commands let's get back to
the Practical mode which can be a SQL
workbench so now we are on the SQL
workbench let's
login there you go so we have both the
commands let's try to execute them
enter and there you go so we have the
current date so that's how you can fetch
current date using get date function or
the current date function in SQL now you
might be having multiple questions is
adding a date is that tough in SQL
tables no you can add a date in SQL in
the format of workare or character
everything but if you want to perform
analytics then using the date format or
date data type would be more beneficial
right so for the SQL table you do have
some formats to follow so that's exactly
what we are going to discuss in this
particular tutorial now let us imagine
that we're going to create a table using
the following syntax that is create
table keywords table name which is a
user defined table name and the
parameters their respective data types
and at the end let's say we have a date
element as date of joining and for date
of joining we will have the data type as
date
right then let's see the
code and you need to make sure that when
you're trying to enter the date element
into your table you need to be a little
more cautious to follow a pattern SQL
has predefined approach to store dates
which is in the format of YY year mm for
month DD for dates you need to follow
this particular way of writing your date
and if you make some minor let's say you
add a date first then the month and then
the year then obviously SQL will throw
an error so we don't want that to be
happening so in that case let's try to
follow the approach that SQL has now
let's quickly go back to SQL workbench
and see how exactly it works so here we
are back on the SQL workbench let's run
this use database command to get access
to our database there we go now let's
see we have a freshly created database
and it doesn't have anything right now
we will add these particular details
into the data table and here you see we
are following the year month and date
approach right now let's quickly run
this command and there you go the date
has been updated into the table let's
now run the command again now we have
the dates here now let's say we try to
break the rules now we will try the DD m
M and the YY format here right now let's
try to run this particular code once
again let's eliminate all the previous
elements and let's consider this as a
new
entry right now let's try to execute
this there you go so it will
automatically throw an error saying the
date value is incorrect you need to
change us back to the original form that
is YY month and the
date only then it will accept this
particular
value there you go so that's how you add
date to your SQL tables get started so
how to update table in SQL let's quickly
take a look on the Syntax for today's
function so here we have the update
keyword table keyword and the table name
which you want to update and followed by
that we have the set keyword which will
help the SQL to set a particular column
name to a new parameter to which you
want to update it now you're giving a
where condition over here so where is
the keyword and the condition is a user
defined condition and the combination of
where and condition will help SQL to
identify a particular Tuple and update
the parameter under that particular
condition now that we have understood
the syntax let's quickly get back to the
SQL IDE which is my SQL workbench and
try to execute a sample command so we
are on the IDE and previously we tried
to create an employee table so let's
select the same table for that let's use
the database we created that is simply
learn DB semicolon enter so we are on
the simply learn database now to update
a table we need to have some data in it
so as we remember we just try to create
a normal table in the previous session
now let's try to add some data into the
same table using the insert command so
let's try to make use of the insert
command and insert into is the keyword
employee table is the table name and
these are the columns we have in the
employee table and followed by that we
have the values keyword and followed by
that we have the data which we need to
enter into the table and these items are
in the form of a tle and every tle is
covered using parenthesis and inside the
tles you have the first one which is in
integer type data which is as it is and
when you come into the text type data
they are covered using the single codes
to let equl identify that it is a
character type data now after entering
all the tles separated by comma we have
a semic colum which indicates the end of
the statement now let's try to run this
particular statement and add the data
into the employee table so let's select
the database once again and now let's
try to add the data there you go now we
have the data added onto our employee
table let's quickly check the employee
table
select start
from
employee
table there you go we have all the data
added onto the table employee ID
employee name and employee address let's
say the last employee Jeremy who's been
working in Delhi since a past couple of
years and you de deci side being the
manager you decide that he should be
relocating to Hyderabad and you need to
update the employ table now by changing
the location of Jeremy from Delhi to
Hyderabad now let's try to run our
update query so first we have the update
keyword then
employe
table then
set EMP
address equals to
Hyderabad
where condition
EMP ID equals
to 1 0 0 6 and semicolon so there you go
the code is complete we have the update
keyword followed by the table name then
set keyword to set that particular
column that is the employee address to
the key Hyderabad from Delhi we are
changing it to the Hyderabad which is
value or key whichever you consider and
since it is a text type value we are
encoding it using the single codes then
the work clause and the condition which
is employee ID must be equals to one6
now let's try to quickly run this
command there go now let's recheck if
the table has been updated or not so
select sta from
employee
table
let's run
it and there you go the last location
Jeremy which was Delhi is now updated to
Hyderabad so that's how you update
values in a table how to use the group
by clause in SQL now before we execute
the actual code let's take a quick peek
on the syntax that we will be using
today now the syntax is completely
similar to the regular syntax that we
usually use which will have the select
key keyword parameters that you want to
print in your table the from keyword and
the table name which you're trying to
access the only difference is you will
have a new keyword that is the group by
keyword and based on a certain parameter
right now we would get back to the
Practical mode that is the MySQL
workbench to understand the practicality
of group by clause in a much better way
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the descript destion to
no more now we are on our SQL workbench
now let's get access to our simply ONN
database there you go now let's quickly
take the look at the tables we have we
have two different tables now let's get
access to our employee table now we have
all the employee numbers employee names
Department designation salary Etc right
let's say you wanted to know the average
salary of all the employees right so
that would be select that is the
AVG average function of
salary close the bracket from EMP L O ye
e right let's execute this there you go
now you have the average salary of the
entire office but what happens when your
manager asks you to find the average of
e each and every Department average
salary of the employees in each and
every dep Department how would you do
that right every organization has
multiple departments HR development
testing etc etc right now your manager
wants the individual Department's
average salary then you can use this
particular clause which says Group by
department so the entire table will be
categorized based on the Departments and
it will be grouped on the basis of the
department and I'm also using the OD bu
here which we will discuss in the next
session but to give you a brief
understanding of why we using order bu
let's say your manager asks you to find
the department which has the highest
average salary right then you will be
ordering the tables or ordering the rows
based on the descending order of the
salary now let's quickly execute this
query and see the output there you go
the query got successfully executed and
we have the average salary of each and
every Department how to use like
operator in SQL
so at first let's take a quick look on
the syntax that we will be using for
getting the like operator
operation right so it's really simple so
all you need to do is Select star from
table name so instead of star you can
also give your selected columns here but
by default I'm using to select the
entire table right and it can go with we
Clause so after the table name you will
be giving the wear clause and the column
name that you want to extract and you
will will be using the like operator
with the constraints and I'm using the
single codes here right because this
particular like operation can be used
upon string or work or character type
data types right so we will represent
that particular data type using single
code now that we are clear with the
syntax let's go to the Practical mode
that is the SQL workbench or my SQL
workbench and execute the like cooperat
command if getting your learning started
is half the battle what if you could do
that for free visit scaleup by simply
learn click on the link in the
description to know more now we are on
the MySQL workbench and we have some
data or tables and uh let's consider the
employee name so we have some text or
vire type of data type in the uh
employee name as well as the employee
Department right let's use that
particular data and uh here we have the
command and Select Staff from employee
table two where we can edit the same
command employee
name uh
like and remember the single codes right
and we will be using the percentage
operation here right we can give the
full name so we have Jennifer here right
Jennifer or let's remove Jennifer and if
somebody asks you give me all the names
which start with J right in that
particular situation we will use using
the modulus symbol or percentage symbol
right now what we will get is all the
names that start with the alphabet J and
now let's say we want all the names that
include a certain alphabet let's say
R right then we can use the modulus
symbol again it can start with anything
and it can end with anything but it
should have alphabet R so this is how it
works so we have all the names which
start or include the alphabet are in
them right and uh that's how we can use
the like operator in SQL you can also
use like operator in this way where you
can give the entire name let's say
somebody asks you to get one single row
which has the employee name as Peter
right you can also do this in this way
there you go you have Peter how to use
the between operator and SQL now before
we begin let's try to take a quick look
on the sentence ta that we will be using
today right it is simply the Select
Staff from table name using the we
clause and the column which you're
choosing for that and the between
operator and we are giving some
constraints and those different
constraints are encapsulated between an
and command here let us say that your
manager tells you to select all the
rules where selecting one single column
that is salary where the employees have
the salary from 10,000 to 20,000
right then you will write the command
select star from table name where salary
between the value 10,000 and the value
20,000 so this is how the between
command works now let's execute the same
practically let's get back to the MySQL
workbench if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scaleup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to no more now we are back
on the MySQL workbench let's make some
edits to the same command select star
from employee where
salary between
operator so we are using float or
integer type so we will not need a
single coach or double caches number
10,000 and operator number
20,000 right now let's execute this
command there you go now we have all the
employee list which have or who have
their salary ranging from 10,000 to
20,000 how to find the second highest
salary in SQL so this particular type of
questions will be most frequently Asked
in data analytics interview questions so
let's try to understand the syntax of
how to find the not just second but any
number of salaries given in a SQL table
let's say your interviewer asked you to
find the top third salary or top fourth
salary you can find that using the same
syntax so the syntax is something
similar to this as shown now but before
we begin if you are an aspiring data
analyst then I have the perfect cause
for you we have the professional
certificate program in data analytics
boost your career with this data
analytics program in partnership with
puru University and in collaboration
with IBM which features master classes
and follows an applied learning model
with realtime projects and business case
studies now that we have a clear
understanding of the pgp data analytics
certification with simply learn in
collaboration with IBM from puru
University we will get started with our
tutorial for today's
session so here you can see select star
you can also use the specific columns
you want that is name and salary but I'm
selecting star that is every single
column in my table that is Select star
from employee table Group by salary so
you'll be grouping by salary here and
order by salary descending since we
wanted to find the highest we will be
choosing the descending order that is
increased number that is the highest
number to the lowest number in case if
your employer or if your interviewer
asks you to find the lowest salary then
you will be using the ascending order
right so since we are given the
condition that we have to find the
highest we will use the descending order
then limit n minus one let's say You're
supposed to find the fifth highest
salary then the formula will be 5 minus
one and the limit one that is you just
want one single row to be displayed on
your output right so that's the reason
we'll be giving limit as one all right
so this is the simple syntax you will be
following now let's quickly execute this
on MySQL workbench and try to get our
results back to the Microsoft SQL
workbench so now we are on the MySQL
workbench let's quickly use the database
and get access to our all tables now we
have access to the tables and the
employee table which we were working on
so let's quickly have the show tables
here and we have employee and employee
table to we will be accessing the
employee table which has the salary
details so there you go we have rakes
Jack Regina Etc right so here you can
see Karan has the highest salary and the
next second highest salary is rages so
we need to fetch this particular column
here right since our expectation is to
find the second highest salary let's try
to write the following code that is
Select star from
employee
Group
by
salary order by
salary descending order since we want
highest salary and the
limit n minus 1 that is 2 - 1 or you can
also write as 1 comma one and
done let's quickly execute this code and
there you go now let's say we want to
find the third highest salary so here N
- 1 3 - 1 is
2 and execute this and there you go you
have Regina so that's how you can
extract second highest salary or any
number of highest salary or the lowest
salary based on the query changes you're
doing let's say if you want to highest
salary then you should be using
descending order let's say you want the
lowest salary you should be using the
ascending order so that's how you can
extract the second highest salary from
SQL tables so the onepoint agenda that
is my SQL connector for python now let's
check on the codes that we are going to
execute for the day so technically we
have the three major codes but in case
if you have the uh my connector for
python existing in your windows you can
then you can also uh unlist or uninstall
that but majorly three major codes check
for the python version if you have you
can proceed then check or start python
IDE and try to execute the last code and
if case if in case if you get an error
that means you don't have it and then
you can come back to the second line and
install the code from command prompt and
then go back to ID and you can get
started or you can also import this into
your IDE that's said let's get started
with the demonstration let me start the
command prompt there you go the command
promt got successfully started let's
check the python version we have python
hyphen
hyphen we have it it is python
3.11.0 fine now let's check the pist if
I already have that my SQL connector in
the lone not so uh I think yes we do
have the python connector now let's
quickly uninstall it you can use the
same code uh
pip
uninstall this paste it done you can
quickly uninstall that just give yes now
it's being removed if I check the pist
again we will not have it right now we
will use the same code to install it
okay before that let's check python idle
right here we have the
idle if we
check
Cod my SQL do
connector we should be getting an error
right so now let's go back to
the command prompt and use this code to
install it back again remember you have
to write pep install we have already
uninstalled it so pep installed my SQL
connector for python enter now the file
should be
downloading so successfully got
installed
now now let's go back to python idle and
execute the same code once again and we
should not get any errors indicating the
presence of my SQL connector for python
presentent there you go you have no more
errors so that's how you install my SQL
connector for python in Windows
operating so how do you delete a column
in SQL now let's quickly take a look on
the syntax we will be using today so we
will be using the alter table keyword
then the table name the drop keyword to
drop a particular column name and
followed by the drop keyword we have the
column name which we are supposed to be
dropping off now that we have a clear
idea about the syntax let's get back to
the MySQL workbench to execute this
particular command so far we tried to
create a database create a table add
some data onto the table using the
insert command and update a particular
tle and try to eliminate a single row
now we're trying to eliminate a complete
column here so let's not eliminate the
existing columns let's try to create a
new column and then try to eliminate it
so for that we will be using the alter
table command so this is the alter table
command and the employee table which is
the employee table name then we are
trying to use the add keyword and we are
trying to add a new column that is the
PIN code which is a work or character
data type and not null we're not keeping
it as null and in case if we did not add
any value into the PIN code the default
value will be na which is a text type so
we are encoding it using single codes
now let's try to run this
code and let's quickly try to check the
table employ
Table and there you go now we have pin
code here and the null values in the PIN
code so we don't want this pin code over
here so we will eliminate this and code
column using the same alter command so
alter
table then the table
name and then the column we want to drop
using the drop keyword which is pin code
so let's execute this command and see
the output so there you go the PIN code
column has been successfully eliminated
so so that's how you completely
eliminate a column in SQL we will try to
delete a row in SQL how do you delete a
row in SQL let's quickly take a look at
the
syntax so we will be using the delete
keyword and the from keyword adding the
table name and giving a work Clause with
a user defined condition so this will be
a basic Syntax for the process of
deleting a single Row in the SQL table
now to understand in a much better way
let's get back to the SQL workbench so
now we are on the SQL workbench and
previously we try to create a table add
some data using the insert command and
update a value using the update command
now let's say we have to delete the last
row which is one6 Jeremy Hyderabad let's
say Jeremy found a new job in a new
organization and now you need to
eliminate his credentials from your
database so we will be using the
following code that is
delete from table name is
employee
table and the V
Clause now the
condition which is
EMP
ID is equals to
one6 now let's try to run the code there
you go the employee is being eliminated
from that particular database now let's
try to recheck the table so select
star from em p l o y e
e
table run the code and there you go the
last ID which was one6 has been
eliminated from your database and that's
how you delete a row in SQL and we will
learn how to eliminate duplicate rows in
SQL how to eliminate duplicate records
in SQL table now we can eliminate the
duplicate records in SQL by a few
methods so we will use the most simplest
ones the first one is using the inner
joint along with a W loss and the second
one is a simple and the humble distant
command now we have a brief idea on the
methods let's understand them in a much
more detailed way through a practical
demonstration now let's get back to the
MySQL workbench to understand the codes
in a much better way
so now we are on the MySQL workbench and
we will get access to our simply loan
database and we are in the simply learn
database so previously we used to work
on a employee table so let's not work on
the same employee table since we have
actual data there let's try to duplicate
that table so that we will have some
duplicate entries in between so we will
be changing the employee ID numbers and
we will also be using the same employee
ID numbers so the the employee ID has
some details to it so we'll be
understanding that in a much more detail
while we are executing the commands and
uh we will also try to remove the
primary key from the table so I'll also
explain why we are going to include the
primary table and also will'll explain
the usage of eliminating it so when you
have the primary key in the table SQL
workbench or any SQL will automatically
stop you from adding duplic ated values
but let's say if you add a duplicate
entry with a new primary key right then
it will not stop you so we'll also have
a demonstration about what to do in such
scenarios so now let's try to quickly
create a duplicate employe table which
will be employee table 2 and then we
will try to add some duplicate entries
into it remember we will not use the
primary key here so the code will be
create table
EMP l y e
table
to and everything will be same which is
from the previous table which will be
the employee ID integer type employee
name character type character type pin
code will be integer and normally we
include the primary key in this way
primary key brackets open
em so this is the way how we add the
primary key but we are not going to add
it since we want to know what happens if
we enter data which also has the
duplication of the primary key right so
we will not give any primary key over
here let's quickly run this there you go
the new duplicated table of employee
table has been created let's try to
insert the same values with some
duplication there you go I have pasted
the command for inserting the values and
if You observe clearly at the end I have
repeated the values of Tony Katy s June
and Gloria so these five will be the
duplicate values and also we are trying
to enter the duplicated primary key
since we did not declare the ID as the
primary key it will accept all these Val
values let's quickly run this and there
you go the values have been successfully
entered into the table let's quickly see
if we have the
duplication select
star
from
employee
table control enter there you go so you
can see the duplicate values are also
added onto the table now how do you
remove these duplications remember we
discussed the distinct one distinct
method which is the second one so that
happens to be the most simplest one
let's see how it works so here we will
write a simple select
command
select
distinct
star from the employee table
two now this will give us the distinct
values right but again when you run this
particular command which is Select star
you will have all the details back again
right our job is to eliminate them so
what we will do is we'll create a
duplicate table so let's name it as D
table so create
table and duplicate table will be the
name
Now quickly execute this command there
you go now we have
the data which we obtained from the
distant command is stored into the table
named as duplicate table now let's
quickly drop the employee table
to
okay the table has been successfully
dropped so when we run the same command
once again it says simply learn D we did
not find any table by the name employ
table 2 that means it's been eliminated
now the next thing we need to do is
rename
it so what we're trying to do is we are
trying to use the alter table and we are
trying to rename duplicate copy to
employ table 2 so that we have the
actual table here after eliminating the
duplicated values it's not dup copy it's
actually dup
table
right there you go now let's execute
this successfully done now if we execute
this particular select command you can
see we have the cleaned data without any
duplicate entries this was one of the
simplest ways of eliminating duplicates
in a SQL table now let's try to get a
step ahead and try to use some joint
commands and we commands and we
conditions and using those we will try
to eliminate the duplications in a table
now we are talking about a table table
which does have the you know primary
key and the datas will be duplicated let
me explain you how now let us
declare
the primary key as employee
ID
b e is EMP
ID right now we do have a primary key
now now there is no way okay let's try
to create this uh before that let's try
to truncate employee table
two so we can use
the not drop table we can use the trun
gate so let's replace drop with trunk
gate so that the data which we have in
employee table will be removed there you
go
now we will or let's quickly drop the
table because we are trying to create
the new table right so let's create the
new
table so once we have executed the drop
table command the table has been
successfully removed now let's try to
create this particular
table control enter there you go the
table got successfully created now let's
try to duplicate the same entries
remember I'm not changing the primary
key
here now when I run this command I will
get an error which says primary key
cannot be duplicated so here you can see
duplicate entry for nine and you cannot
have the duplicate entries right this is
one way to avoid duplications but what
if someone comes up with a brilliant
idea to replace the primary key now if I
change the primary
key as 17
18 let's say we
also have this data
copy let's duplicate
this right this will be our 19 and this
will be our 20 now we have unique
primary keys for all our data and we
also know there are some duplications
let's try to execute this command and
see the
output so somewhere something is not
correct
yet okay this
one so Tony has been repeated so we can
have a different ID for Tony let's say
we have Tony as
21 try to execute the command once again
it should be clear
now okay it still has some duplication
somewhere yes it's right
here let's keep this as
22 okay I think we made a lot of
duplications
somehow let's quickly take a look if all
the major keywords are duplicated or not
so we copyed from Gloria so after Gloria
we we will remove these so Gloria so we
just make we're trying to make sure that
the primary keys are unique here so 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20
20
22 there you go so now we believe that
all the primary keys are unique let's
try to run this command and see if we
get the same error or not no so now all
the data has been inserted into to the
duplicate table which is employee table
2 and we also have some duplicate
entries now how would you
recognize that we don't have any
duplicates or how would you recognize
which data has been exactly duplicated
and how do you even remove it now the
old distinct command is not going to
work anyhow let's see if it works by any
chance so when I try to run the distinct
command it will give me all 22 rows with
all the duplicate entries right in this
case we can use the first method which
was the join and wear condition method
right let's try to do that so we going
to use the delete
command delete
T1 from
employee
table
to
T1 in a
join in a join employ table two as T2 so
we are declaring two different tables so
we are considering t T1 as one table and
T2 as the next or second table so T1 and
T2 are the copies of the same existing
employee table two right now we are
joining these two tables and we are
having a Vare condition over here so
from table T1 we're going to eliminate
table one from table two where we have
an intersection and where we have the
employee IDs greater than employee ID in
EMP
okay let's not confuse so let's execute
the command first okay let's execute
this to understand what I mean here so
here when we go a little down you can
see 14 for Tony right actual employee ID
of Tony is N9 but we have 14 for Tony
and Gloria we have 18 19 20 and again
for KT we have 22 the actual number of
KT is 10 right so now it will try to
recognize the highest number of employee
ID so it will recognize the highest
employee ID number and it will retain it
and rest all the numbers will be
eliminated so this is the first V
condition and we're also giving a string
comparison function where SQL will try
to identify if there is a similarity
between the employee name of the first
table and the employee name of the
second table and and we know that when
you give the string comparison operation
if it results in zero it means the
strings are equal if it results in one
it means the strings are not matching
now that we understood the logic of this
particular statement let's try to
execute it so there you go so we have
executed the command now let's try to
see what's left in the table there you
go now we should be having the usual 13
number of employees in our table and you
can see that the records are retained
where the employee ID number is the
highest remember we had the number 10 as
employee ID for KT and we have that over
here in case if you want the actual
numbers to be placed however they were
you can make a small change to your
command all you need to do is keep this
particular or change this particular
greater than symbol to lower than symbol
and you will retain the actual number
numers of the employee records so that's
how you can eliminate the duplicate
entries in the table and if you ask me
hey only two conditions are enough don't
you think the PIN code and you know we
also have PIN code and the address of
the employees don't you think that is
also important yes you can also do that
you can make some minor modifications to
your code and try to include all those
remaining things things and again you
can do the same right now let's try to
eliminate the data in our table let's
truncate it and we should be having no
data left in our table and let's try to
insert the duplicate entries once again
and okay before that let's try to do
this particular execution remember we
try to keep the employee ID let's try to
execute that and try to print it and we
should be having the actual numbers over
here right as expected
Ed now let's again trunet the data and
try to compare the conditions or will be
using the where condition and we'll have
all the parameters included in our
condition let's truncate the table and
now let's try to add the duplicate
entries once
again there you go we have all the
duplicate entries entered now what we
will be doing is we will be using the
same command but the only change will be
the string comparison or the we
condition right so you can keep this
string comparison if you want or if you
can change that let me change that
actually so instead
of this we will use this particular
command where we are trying to compare
the employee ID so let's keep the
employee ID as lesser than so that we
have the actual employee ID numbers and
we are using an and condition condition
over here so that uh this particular
condition should be valid and the
employee name should be equal to the
employee name in T1 and
T2 yeah and uh the next one is here we
have the employee address so the
employee address in T1 and T2 should
also be same and pin code from both the
taable should also be same so what we
are trying to compare here is we are
trying to keep the employee ID with the
least number or the least value and the
names of the employee should be same the
address of the employee should be same
and the PIN code of the employee should
be same in that particular condition you
can try to delete the record let's try
to execute this and there you go the
command got executed and now let's try
to execute the select command which
should give us the final result so here
you go control enter and you have the
data here so now we have successfully
eliminated ated all the duplicates by
comparing the values in each and every
single column and we also have retained
the original ID of each and every
employee now that's how you try to
eliminate duplicates in SQL tables first
we will understand what exactly is a we
clause in
SQL so we Clause is used along roow
level filtering of data sets so before
we get started both where and having are
like filters let's say you are working
on an Excel spreadsheet and you have an
employee data set so there are various
departments maybe it development testing
Etc right so in the same way if you
wanted to filter out all the employees
from IT department alone you would apply
a filter on Excel right filter employees
which are working in or who are working
in IT department so similarly in SQL you
expect the IDE or you expect the
database to give you a filter data via
your query so in such situations the
query will have where clause and having
Clause so the main difference between
where clause and having is so if you
wanted to group the data in terms of
categories right if you wanted to
segregate the data in term of categories
you will have to use having clause for
that when the data is segre it in terms
of categories and you wanted to extract
a specific part then you will be using
having and you will also use having in
place of aggregate functions let's say
your SQL query has some aggregate
functions let's say count the number of
employees in particular Department then
having CLA will be your choice not where
so where works like a roow level filter
it checks each and every filter in
individual rowes and only gives you the
or only returns you the uh values in row
levels if you want to use count or any
other aggregate functions along with
where it might not work so that's the
fundamental difference similarly having
this also a filter which is used along
with aggregate functions and category
level filtering of data justest as we
discussed before but to make things
clear let's check out a demo and uh that
might help you a little better so let's
get back to mySQL workbench so right now
we are on MySQL workbench and uh you can
create a new database and use that
database so I have created a database
called SLP and then I'm using SLP
database I've created a normal or simple
employee database just as the example we
discussed in the upd part so I'm having
employee ID name age Department salary
and uh here I'm inserting some random
values let's say on 2025 value into the
table now here we have a clause with
where right I mean here we have a query
with wear Clause so in rows wherever the
department is equals to ID give me the
table so I'll run this particular query
so wherever the department is it it is
giving me a table of employees who are
working in IT department now if I want
to use use count of let's say an
aggregate
function count
Department the query will not work
although you can find that there are no
errors but when you try to run it the
workbench throws you an error right so
where Clause cannot execute aggregate
functions along with it now let's try to
not include any aggre gate functions
with
it now here I have another query which
does have aggregate functions and we are
grouping it by department and in such
situations you can get the query done
because we have replaced where with
having now let's try to execute this
query there you go now the Departments
are being categorized and we want the
values which are only working in IT
department right so we are counting the
number of uh people in it and that's
where you got it so that's the
fundamental so where is like a ro level
filter where it will select the values
from rowes which have the given
conditions satisfied and if you want to
into categories say Department wise
categories salary wise categories and
yeah again if you want to give a
condition let's say salary greater than
certain value in such situations you can
use where but if you want to extract the
data along with the categories and along
with the given condition of salaries
greater than certain value then having
is your friend so that's how you can
work with where and having so those are
the fundamental differences between
where clause and a having Clause now how
do we create a view in Excel so it's as
simple as creating a new table the
syntax is as follows you just need to
add create View and your customized view
name as the statements now what are the
statements statements usually have the
statements what your query the query
statements for example select St some
data what you want to fetch from your
table yes I totally understand select
might be a really short one but
sometimes you might have to add some we
conditions you might have to add some
sub queries and the entire query length
might go up to 10 to 15 lines right now
you might not be able to execute that
query for every single time so if you
create a view for that and if you just
write select that particular View and
you get all the data now let's
understand this more easily by going
through a practical demonstration on my
SQL now we are on the MySQL workbench we
are having a small database which is
flights and in that we have a table by
the name flight data and this is the
data which we have added into a flight
dat data right let's run this and get
the table so here you have the
information on your table about a few
flights you have the airline date of
Journey departure destination total
stops additional information etc etc
right now let's say if someone asked you
to fetch a flight from Indigo which is
completely
non-stop control enter now you have this
right now you face this query for once
and what if someone asks you to get this
data for 10 times a day maybe you have
10 clients who are asking for the same
information would you write the same for
you 10 times no right similarly here you
have let's say someone wanted to go to
Delhi and they ask you to get the
information for the flights which are
going to
Delhi and someone asked for the flights
which are going from Bangalore to
Delhi right similarly you have many of
such things so what would be helpful
here so let's say you add one more
query which reads us create
view now the customized view name could
be anything let's say
view Indigo
nonstop as your query right let's
quickly EX execute this query and it
should create a new view for you the new
view is currently done similarly let's
try to create a new view
again create view let's name it
view
lights
Delhi
kolata and the Bangalore Delhi
flights right now you have the queries
ready or the views
ready now all you have to do is just get
the select
statement star from the view
name this is simpler
right just control enter and you have
the data over there now let's say
somebody asks you to fetch the data for
flies from Bangalore to Delhi all you
have to do is Select star and you should
be having the
data there you go right as simple as
that so that's how you can create a view
in SQ
and in case if you wanted to drop it
let's say you don't need it anymore so
it's simple just drop the
view and the view name let's say you
want to drop this particular view paste
it there and control enter there you go
the view got successfully dropped now
when you try to run this query you will
not get it now you may be wondering what
is SQL injection well let us explain SQL
injection is a serious vulnerability
affecting web applications where
attackers can execute unintended code on
a server by injecting malicious SQL
commands into a database query if
successful and attacker can gain
unauthorized access to sensitive data or
even modify it so if you are a web
developer this is something you must
take seriously but don't worry in this
video we will explain how SQL injection
works why it's so dangerous and how you
can protect your application from it so
be sure to watch until the end to learn
how to safeguard your apps from this
threat before we begin if you are

here we go and now we'll see the agenda
for our tutorial starting with we'll
first see what is SQL injection then
we'll see how does a SQL injection
attack work then we'll see what are
types of SQL injection attacks and then
we'll see the detection and prevention
of SQL injection attacks then we'll see
some real life examples that happen with
the SQL injections and then we'll have a
overview of impact of SQL injection
attacks now we'll start with what is SQL
injection SQL injection is a technique
used by attackers to manipulate a web
application's database queries by
injecting malicious SQL code into input
Fields attackers can execute
unauthorized commands and potentially
gain access to sensitive information SQL
injection attacks primarily Target web
applications that use SQL databases such
as MySQL Oracle or Microsoft SQL server
and now we will see how does a SQL
injection attack work so to understand
how a SQL injection attack Works let's
consider how a typical SQL query
functions queries are used to retrieve
or modify data from a database attackers
exploit vulnerable input Fields by
injecting malicious equal code that
alters the intended behavior of the
query and attackers first study the
targeted database to understand its
structure and behavior then they craft a
equal query that the server interprets
as a legitimate command for example or
1al to 1 that is a queries input field
an attacker can bypass authentication
and gain access unauthorized access and
SQL injection attacks can also be used
to delete data manipulate records or
retrieve information from multiple
database tables using techniques like
error based injection Union based
attacks or inferential SQL injection now
we'll see an example to understand this
concept more so consider a website that
has search feature where users can
search for products by entering keywords
the website uses a SQL database to store
product information in a secure scenario
the website would take the users input
sanitize it and construct a SQL query to
fetch the relevant products for example
the query might look like this that is
Select star from products with name like
and the entered keyword what they want
to search so this query retrieves
products whose names contain the entered
keyword however if the website is
vulnerable to SQL injection an attacker
can manipulate the input to execute
malicious SQL statements let's say the
attacker wants to retrieve all products
from the database regardless of the
entered keyword in the search field they
entered or 1 equal to 1 hyphen hyphen
the input manipulates the SQL query and
this query becomes this that is s select
star from products we name like m% and
then or 1 equal to 1 hyphen hyph percent
in this case the attacker uses the
single code to close the existing string
followed by or 1al to 1 Hy hyph to
inject a new condition that is always
true the semicolon is used to terminate
the previous statement and the double
hyphens are used to comment out the
remaining portion of the original query
as a result the modified query
effectively becomes that you can see on
the screen and the condition 1 equal to
1 is always true so the query retrieves
all products from the database
regardless of the keyword and this
example demonstrates how an attacker can
exploit a vulnerable SQL injection point
to modify the SQL queries logic and
retrieve unintended data remember this
example is simplified for educational
purposes and real world SQL injection
attacks can be more sophisticated it's
crucial to secure web applications
against SQL injection ction
vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized
access and data breaches now we'll see
types of SQL injection attacks so there
are different types of SQL injection
attacks that attackers can employ let's
explore a few of them the first we'll
explore is inband SQL I is injection
here that is inband SQL injection so
this type includes error based and Union
based attacks where attackers use the
same channel to loan CH attack and
collect the results and the next is
inferential SQL injection
that is also known as blind SQL
injection this type invols sending data
payloads to the database server to
observe its response without directly
seeing the results it can be either
Boolean based or time based and the next
is out of band SQL injection in cases
where inband SQL injection is not
possible attackers leverage other
channels such as DNS or HTTP request to
retrieve data from the database now
we'll see detecting and preventing SQL
injection attacks so detect detecting
and preventing SQL injection attacks is
crucial to safeguarding web applications
here are some preventive measures so the
first measure is train employees on
preventive methods that is educate your
it teams including developers and system
administrators on SQL injection attack
vectors and prevention techniques next
we could do is Implement input
validation and parameterized queries
validate and filter user input using an
allow list approach and use
parameterized queries or prepared
statements to separate SQL code from
user input that will not allow any
malicious hacker to enter any SQL code
into the input method and the next is
regular security scans perform regular
security scans to identify and address
potential vulnerabilities in web
applications and the next is keep
software up to date that is ensure that
all software including databases and
programming languages are regularly
updated to include the latest security
patches and protections against SQL
injection and now we'll see some real
life examples of SQL injection attacks
so let's take a look at some real life
examples the first is Tesla
vulnerability in 2014 security
researchers discovered a SQL injection
vulnerability on Tesla's website which
allowed attackers to gain administrative
Privileges and access user data this was
one of the SQL injection attacks and the
next was fortnite V ility in 2019 a SQL
injection vulnerability was found in
fortnite that could have enabled
attackers to access user accounts the
vulnerability was promptly patched and
the next was Cisco vulnerability in 2018
a SQL injection vulnerability in Cisco
Prime license manager granted attackers
shell access to computers with the
installed license management system
Cisco addressed the issue promptly and
last not the least we'll see the impact
of SQL injection attacks so the impact
of SQL injection attacks can be
devastating for businesses the first
could be the unauthorized access to
sensitive information and resources and
the next is potential data breaches and
exposure to confidential data and the
next is data manipulation or deletion
and the next is Network infiltration and
system compromise and the next is loss
of customer trust and decreased revenue
and the last is reputational damage and
long-term consequen for the business and
that wraps up our discussion on SQL
injection it's crucial for businesses
and developers to be aware of this
vulnerability and take necessary
precautions to prevent attacks stay
vigilant keep your software up to date
and educate yourself and your team on
best practices for web application
security how to use update query and
postest SQL now we are on the PG admin 4
so that we can execute our postr SQL
commands this is similar to the MySQL
workbench which we usually use for the
SQL since this is the postest SQL PG
admin is the best one now let's start
our
query so we have the query tool
opened now before we run the update
query let's try to create some
tables so let's create the simple
employee
table so we have the SQL like query here
which is create keyword table keyword
and the user defined table name that is
the employee and the parameters which we
will be having or the column headers we
will be having are employee name
employee ID employee Department salary
and
address let's execute the command by
pressing the F5
key there you go the table got
successfully created and our next step
would be to add the information into
this particular table we can use the
insert command for the
same there you go so we are using the
same insert into keywords completely
similar to the SQL queries and here we
have employee table name and the
parameters of the column headers which
are the employee Name ID Department
salary and address so next is the values
keyword and we will be entering the
comma separated values each and every
tle right each and every row is
separated by a comma and at the end we
don't have to use the comma because this
is the indication which states this is
the end of the row all right now let's
run this particular command by pressing
the F5 key there you go now let's
quickly check our table using the select
command select star
from
employee
semicolon
F5 so this is the data that we have in
our table right now now what is the
update query now let's understand the
update query in much more detail here so
this is the set of employees that are
working in your company and let's say
there is some error in certain row let's
say the employee ID is wrong or let's
say you are going to conduct a hike
session let's say R perform well and
rishab needs a hike his current salary
is 18,000 and he want to improvise or
upgrade his salary to 20,000 right
that's when the update command comes
into picture now let's discuss the
syntax or update command so the syntax
is as
follows we having the update key then
the user defined table name then the set
keyword and followed by that the column
name and the value then we have the work
loss now let's say we wanted to improve
Rab's salary so update keyword then the
employee which is the table name after
that we have the set keyword followed by
that the column name which is salary
equals to value currently it is 18,000
let's say we want to increase it to
20,000 then we have to use 20,000 number
in the Value Place then we have the V
Clause followed by that we have the
condition where exactly you want to
change it where the employee ID is
equals to the employee ID of rishop
right now let's practically see that on
PG admin
4 there you go we have the update
keyword employee which is user defined
table name set keyword employee salary
is the column we want to change then the
value will be 20,000 since it is
currently
18,000 and a where condition and the
Clause is where employee ID is equals to
1001 right this is the ID of rishab now
let's quickly execute this command and
see the output F5 is the shortcut key to
execute the commands in PG
admin and now let's try to execute this
command once again to check if the table
is updated or not select sta from
employee F5 and there you go the current
salary of rishab
is 20,000
here it is so that's how you use the
update command in postest SQL with that
we have crossed our second milestone on
SQL proceeding ahead we have powerbi the
ultimate bi tool that every business
analyst must know powerbi is excel's Big
Brother powerbi steps in for large scale
data visualization and storytelling it
seamlessly connects to various data
sources including Excel sheets and
transforms them into inter active
dashboards and compelling reports
powerbi empowers analyst to uncover
hidden insights identify Trends and
present complex information clearly and
engagingly to stakeholders I'd like to
talk a bit about business
intelligence as you might be aware there
are zillions of companies across the
world these companies generate massive
amounts of data on a daily basis when I
say data here it simply refers to
business information both internal and
external customer feedback product
Innovations and profit loss reports to
name a few companies use all of this
information to make crucial decisions
that can either hamper or boost their
business you might have heard of the
term data is the new oil well it
definitely is if organizations analyze
all the available data very well then
this oil is definitely
valuable and to help organizations with
this we have business intelligence which
is more often termed as bi
we can Define bi as a technology-driven
process which works on analyzing
unstructured data to derive meaningful
information from it basically it is a
set of architecture and processes that
convert raw data into useful information
that helps in achieving profit for a
business so to achieve business
intelligence goals we use a set of tools
these tools are termed as bi tools they
help organizations acquire and analyze
data efficiently some of the bi tools
are seasal but some are evergreen we
have a plethora of these tools in the
market which makes it hard for
businesses to select one single tool
here we have a recommendation list of
the top five bi tools of 2020 after
extensive research and an in-depth
evaluation we have come up with this
list in addition to the top five we also

storytelling is an important part of bi
click sense provides this feature but it
is not available with click view with
the click data integration platform you
can do powerful data integration and
perform modern
analytics as you can see on your screens
these are the companies using click we
have Mercedes-Benz cognizant Accenture
and Cap Gemini so for all those who
joined in now let me just quickly repeat
our list at number five we have thoughts
spot then at number four we have sasp
and at number three we have click so far
do you all agree with this list let us
know in the comment section below
let us now move on to our next tool at

giant Amazon the Italian luxury sports
car manufacturer Ferrari then we have
Walmart followed by Cap Gemini and
Linkedin before we move on to the number
one bi tool in our list let's have a
quick look at a few bi tools which
didn't make it to our list but which
seem to be very promising in the year
2020
so here we have Zoho analytics which is
a cloud-based self-service bi and data
analytics software that is used for data
visualization and for creating
dashboards now let's understand why
powerbi is needed first powerbi has the
ability to access vast volumes of data
from multiple sources it allows you to
view analyze and visualize huge
quantities of data that cannot be opened
in Excel some of the important data
sources available in powerbi are Excel
CSV XML Json PDF Etc second powerbi
provides an easy to use drag and drop
tool with features and functionalities
that allow you to copy all formatting
across similar visualizations powerbi
has exceptional integration with Excel
it helps you gather analyze publish and
share Excel business data powerbi helps
to accelerate Big Data preparation with
Azor using powerbi with Azor allows you

scientists powerbi allows you to get
insights from data and turn insights
into actions to take data driven
business decisions finally powerbi
allows you to perform realtime stream
analytics it fetches data from multiple
sensors and social media sources to get
access to real-time analytics so you are
always ready to make business decisions
now let's see what powerbi is powerbi is
a business analytics service provided by
Microsoft that lets you visualize your
data and share insights it converts data
from different sources to build
interactive dashboards and bi reports as
you can see we have an Excel data about
sales using this data powerbi helps you
build different charts and graphs to
visualize the data now that we have
understood what powerbi is let us look
at the important features of powerbi
first is powerbi desktop powerbi desktop
is a free software that you can download
and it allows you to build reports by
accessing data easily for using powerbi
desktop you do not need Advanced report
designing or query skills to build a
report second as already discussed
powerbi supports stream analytics from
Factory sensors to social media sources
powerbi assist in real-time analytics to
make timely decisions third support for
multiple data sources is one of the
major features of powerbi you can access
various sources of data such as Excel
CSV SQL Server web files Etc to create
interactive visualizations and finally
custom visualization custom
visualization is another vital feature
of power
while dealing with complex data powerbi
default standard might not be enough in
some cases in that case you can access
the custom library of visualization that
meets your needs let us jump into
discussing the various components of RBI
as you can see there are six major
components of powerbi now let's discuss
them one by one first is power query
power query is the data transformation
and mass up engine it enables you to
discover connect combine and refine data
sources to meet your analysis need it it
can be downloaded as an addin for Excel
or can be used as part of powerb desktop
second we have power pivote power pivote
is a data modeling technology that lets
you create data models it also allows
you to establish relationships and
create calculations it uses data
analysis expression language or Dax to
model simple and complex data third we
have power view Power view is a
technology that is available in Excel
SharePoint SQL server and powerbi it
lets you create interactive charts
graphs maps and other visuals that
brings your data to Life Next we have
power map Microsoft's power map for
Excel and powerbi is a 3D data
visualization tool that lets you map
your data and plot more than a million
rows of data visually on Bing maps in 3D
format from an Excel table or data model
in Excel then we have powerbi desktop
powerbi desktop is a development tool
for power query power pivote and Power
view with powerbi desktop you have
everything under the same solution and
it is easier to develop b data analysis
experience finally we have power Q&A the
Q&A feature in power B lets you explore
your data in your own words it is the
fastest way to get an answer from your
data using natural language an example
could be what was the total sales last
year once you have built your data model
and deployed that into powerbi website
then you can ask questions and get
answers easily now let's see what
powerbi service is powerbi service is
the software as a service part of
powerbi it is also referred as powerbi
online to access powerbi service you
need to log into app. powerbi.com now
let me show you that I'll go to Google
I'll open a new tab and search for app.
powerbi.com
it's
loading but this is how the homepage of
powerbi service looks like I've have
created some dashboards on it first you
need to log to app. powerbi service you
can see I'm logged in now under my
workspace if I go to dashboard here I
have created a finance dashboard you can
see the different charts and graphs I
have prepared and pinned it to the
dashboard so powerbi service allows you
to connect to your data create reports
and dashboards and you can also ask
questions to your data now as you can
see in this dashboard we have created
some charts and graphs so this is a tree
map there's a pie chart there's a bar
graph below you can see there line
charts and donor charts it tells you the
total sales that were made the total
number of unit solds the sales by
product sales by country salesp segment
and lots more one of the key features of
powerbi is creating dashboards from
multiple reports and data sets powerbi
dashboard is a single page visualization
to tell a story The visualizations on a
dashboard are generated from multiple
reports and each report is based on one
data set a single page dashboard is
known as a canvas the visualizations you
see on the dashboard are are called
tiles these tiles are pinned to the
dashboard by report designers now let me
go back to my dashboard so this is
called a canvase and each of these are
called tiles so on the top you can see
we have three tiles now let's understand
how to create and publish reports in
powerbi dashboards powerbi allows you to
create different reports on powerbi
desktop these reports can be published
on the powerbi dashboard using powerbi
service here you can see there is a
powerbi report created on powerbi
desktop if you click on publish it will
take you to the powerbi service where
you can build a dashboard here is the
button for powerbi publish once you
click on powerbi publish it will take
you to the dashboard so this is a single
page powerbi dashboard on powerbi
service now let's understand the powerbi
architecture powerbi architecture is a
service built on top of a z there are
multiple data sources that powerbi can
connect to powerbi desktop allows you to
create reports and data visualizations
on the data set powerbi Gateway is is
connected to on premise data sources to
get continuous data for reporting and
analytics powerbi services are basically
the cloud services that are used to
publish powerbi reports and data
visualizations using powerbi mobile apps
you can stay connected to their data
from anywhere powerbi apps are available
for Windows IOS and Android platforms
now let's look at a case study on how
Meer which is one of United States
largest Supermarket chains used powerbi
to solve its business problems initially
Meer had become dependent on it it
organization to extract insights from
its data it was timec consuming and
inefficient as you had to wait for it to
build every report Meer was unable to
perform ad hoc and realtime analysis
easily so what Meer did was it connected
powerbi to an on premises SQL Server
analysis Services Cube this allowed them
to refresh 20 billion rows of data in
near Real Time with powerbi teams can
now pull in the data faster and perform
real-time analysis to derive insights
from data a big Department inside Meer
used powerbi to compare its sales with
regional performance they analyzed where
Meer was behind the regional Trends
focused on the problem and created a
solution with powerbi they can now drill
down into early sales and send out a
sales flash to 800 Mayo Business Leaders
so powerbi enabled them to standardize
data sources and Empower store directors
and team leaders to develop and track
their data to ensure what they can
improve now let's do some practical
Hands-On demo with powerbi so this is
how the powerbi desktop interface looks
like on the left you have the report
view the data View and the model view
the report view is where you visualize
your data with different charts and
graphs to build reports the data view
allows you to view the whole data while
the model view is where you check if
there are any relationship between the
tables on the right you can see the
different visualizations that you can
build we'll quickly run through all of
these in our demo so here you can see
there's a finance sample data that will
help you draw insights about the sale of
products in different countries we will
create a report to visualize different
charts and graphs and analyze those
sales so let me go to my powerb desktop
first we'll import our data so let me go
to our get data Tab and choose Excel as
my data source I click on Excel so here
is our finance sample
data we'll select sheet one you can see
the data here click on it and then
select
load this might take some time to load
the data now if I go to my data tab you
can see the entire data set it has
Fields such as segment country in which
the sales was made the name of the
product the unit sold and the sales
price and many more let's start building
our report now I'll go to my report view
so first let me create a text box let me
resize
it let me name it as Finance dashboard
we'll increase the size of the text
we'll use Font consolas Center it we'll
also add a background to this we use
blue color change it to
White and increase the size now let me
first show you how you can create a
matrix I'll go to visualizations and
click on Matrix let me resize
it from the data sheet tab I'll select
sales and drag onto
values so you can see the total number
of sales that we made now let me do some
formatting so I'll go to the format tab
click on column headers let's add a
background color and let me increase the
text size to 20 similarly under values
we'll increase the size of the text to
20 as well we can also click on border
and choose the color of the Border we
take as Let It Be black so this is a
simple Matrix that we created which
shows the total number of seals that
were made similarly let me choose Matrix
once again now we'll drag on the unit
sold onto values we'll continue with the
same drill under column headers We'll
add a background this time let's choose
some other color and under values let's
increase the size of the text to 20 even
for the column headers let's increase
the size of the text to
20 again we'll switch on Border me
resize a
bit so here we have two Matrix created
for our report the first Matrix shows us
the total sales that were made the
second Matrix shows you the total units
that were sold now let's move ahead and
create a simple bar chart so under
visualization I click on clustered
column
chart under this we'll drag the date
column onto axis and the sales onto
value let me expand it so it shows you
the sales per year this is the sales
that were made in 2013 and this shows
you the sales that were made in
2014 now there's a drill down option
which gives you more
granularity this depicts the sales by
quar if I drill down further you can see
this shows you the sales by month also
you have some options like s bu and S bu
sales so you can see October month made
the highest number of sales moving ahead
let me now create a pie chart where we
will see the sales by different segments
under visualization I'll click on pie
chart let me first resize
it here I'll drag the segment column
onto the legend and the sales column
onto the values as you can see we have
the sales made by different segments
government segment made the highest
number of sales with
44.2% now let me add a border to both
the visualization I'll click on the pie
chart and go to the format tab I'll
switch on the border similar L for the
clustered column chart I'll go to the
format Tab and click on Border let me
resize a bit all right next we'll create
a very simple table that will depict the
total sales made by each product so
under visualizations I click on table
let me bring this
below so from the data sheet I'll first
drag product onto values you can see the
different products and then sales just
below it
so this depicts the total sales that
were made by each product and finally it
displays the total value of the sales
that were made this is same as the one
shown here now let's do some formatting
under format tab I'll go to values and
increase the text size to 15 let me
expand it also under column headers I'll
increase the text size to 15 then let me
go and add a
border now let me create a map that will
show you the sales that were made by
each country so first let me create a
new page and under visualization I'll
click on map now I'll drag the country
column onto
location so you can see we have our map
ready and we'll drag sales onto size you
can see the different countries and the
sales that they made if I move the map
you can see the sales made in the Europe
region let me recite it I'll add a
border to
this now let me go ahead and create a
donut chart that will show you the
profit by each segment under
visualizations I'll click on donut chart
I'll move this to the top now from the
data sheet I'll add profit onto the
values and
segment onto the
legend if I expand this you can see
government segment made the highest
amount of profit with 65
5.04% let me resize this and we'll add a
border okay in the final visualization
I'll show you how to create a tree map
this tree map will tell you the total
amount of sales made by each product so
under visualizations I'll click on the
tree map let me expand it I'll drag
sales onto values and product onto group
so here you can see our tree map and the
sales made by each product you can see
now we have a report ready we have
created two separate canvas to visualize
our data now if you want to change the
color of These Bars you can simply go to
the format Tab and under data colors you
can choose whichever color you want in
power desktop you have an option to
switch your theme this will make your
dashboard or the report look more
attractive so now we are under the
default mode Let's try out different
themes that's Frontier it's temperature
solar which is a little yellowish the
one which I like is tidle I hope this
was helpful in making you understand the
basics of powerbi and how it works you
learned the various features and the
components of powerbi and looked at the
architecture of powerbi finally you saw
a demo to create a report using Finance
data set now what are the steps to
connect to data so now we will go
directly into powerbi and try to import
one by one few most commonly and
popularly used data sets which are most
commonly used uh in a day-to-day
activity rest of course there are uh
powerbi supports n number of data
sources uh but we will do something
practical on the most popular ones so
let's let's open our
powerbi now this is my powerbi and first
I want to show you that how can I import
data Direct directly from a web page and
import the data now it is asking for a
URL in order to import data so what I
have done is I have created a Google
Excel sheet with simple data with rows
and columns and what I've done is I've
have shared this sheet as publish to
web okay so you just need to say publish
to the web the link as web page
and say done it's it's automatically
published and say link so copy the link
which you have published on the web copy
this link and then go back to your Tablo
paste it link over here and click
okay now powerbi will try to establish a
connection with this Google doc sheet
because it's published on the
web you need to wait for a while while
it is
reading okay now it has read one of the
HTML tables so I'll select this one now
you can see it has it is showing me a
preview of the table which is there on
my Google sheet right it has 11 rows so
it has all showed all the 11 rows so now
I can go and transform this data because
I can see my headers are there starting
from the second row so there's an
opportunity for me to transform the data
so I'll go and transform it so that it
looks
clean okay so first is I need to remove
the first row which is
the null row remove the top
rows okay and then I need to use the
first row now as a header so you just
click this option use first row as
headers that's it so now if you see my
row ID order ID order date ship date all
my data is now ready so I can say close
and
apply click apply
changes now this is an example of web
data import you can go and preview your
data right
now uh the biggest advantage of this
data connection is that it's a live data
so for example I insert another
row let me change the order
ID some some I've some changed some
basic stuff and
I it's Auto saved contrl s now I'll go
to my W and I'll
refresh now you can see as I refreshed
my power query editor I clicked refresh
all and I got my new row which is there
in the live data I got that fetched from
my
okay I got that row the row row ID
number 12 so I I have to say close and
apply now you can see the new row the
row number 12 is now available in my new
data set in the data set because it's a
live connection it's a live connection
with the web based Google sheet okay so
this is one important way in which you
can import data now let's try to import
data from a text file now I've have
already prepared a text file called sub
categories.
txt now let me just open it in a notepad
now it's a very plain simple file tab
separated
file in which you have product
subcategory ID subcategory name and
product category key so basically to
which product category this particular
sub product belongs to right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my get data
option and I'm going to select text SL
CSV
option and I'm going to select option
mod product subcategories do
txt okay so now powerbi has identified
that it's a tab delimited file it has
recognized the headers Etc right and I
can now directly load this
file okay so now once the data is
imported in powerbi it is like
irrelevant to me it's a composite data
in import I'm doing right so in my
presentation when I'm talking about
importing data there are different
importing modes right import data import
can happen through different ways
okay one is direct query mode in which I
create a live uh connection to the
database which I'll also show you uh
using my SQL and mssql server and also
you can do a composite mode in which you
can have data imported from Excel plus
you can have direct query modes so you
can have multiple uh modes to connect
Conn and create a composite data model
and that's what we are doing right now
in our practical so what we are doing
over here is one we have imported data
from the web second we have imported
data from a text table now after doing
text now our next task is to import from
CSV let's try another one so now I have
imported product
subcategory now I'll
import a CSP file so again I'll choose
the option text / CSV and now in this
CSV file let me open this CSV file and
show you what it is
it so this is a list of all my products
product key product subcategory key
products uh stock keeping unit Etc a
simple CSV file and I'm going to import
that okay so now it has identified the D
limiter is comma rather than a tab and
it has already recognized the header is
correct so I'll load
it okay so now my products are there
product subcategories are there for
product categories now what I have done
is I have created a Excel mode now so
now Excel I'm using to import my product
category so now I have to click on the
option of import data from Excel and
I'll say product
categories select the sheet load
and now so my products product
categories product subcategories do with
different uh data storage types but
still now the data is imported into
powerbi it is a composite data model now
another very important data type which
you can import is the PDF also right so
what I have done is I have created a PDF
called customers my customers data is
lying in a PDF so what I've done is I
I've created a
PDF which has data for some columns are
there like you know customer key prefix
first name last name birth date marital
status gender email address annual
income total children etc etc so this is
the data set which I have created in PDF
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
select PDF
now and import customers. PDF and see it
has recognized my table on page one
which I'm going to
load
okay you can rename this as
PDF
table
so this basically these are the
different type
of
data types we have imported PDF Excel
text CSV and web page now let's take a
look at another interesting data set
which we want to import is the my SQL
Server data
set so what I've have done is I've
already installed called my SQL server
on my local instance and there's already
a schema of SQL live tutorial over there
and I have certain tables
already prepared over there like
Department employee Etc so my goal is
now to import this data or create a live
connection with this data set now in
order to
import my SQL database Connection in
powerbi you need to
First download
a connector my SQL powerbi connector so
you need to go to this
link and then click on download and
install the MySQL connector based on the
operating system you have you click on
download and install it after you have
done this go back to
powerbi and then give the IP address of
the database in my case it's there in
this local machine and the schema which
I want to import is SQL live tutorial so
I'll give the
name click
connect okay now it's connected so now
it is asking me which particular tables
you want to create a connection with I'm
choosing department and
employee and I'm just loading
them okay so now this is the exact data
which is there in the employee and
Department in my cull okay so this is
one example of how to create
connectivity between powerbi and
MySQL now I want to do the same thing
using SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server so
I have also installed Microsoft SQL
server on my machine and I have used the
SQL Express so this is the name of my
server so which I'll copy the server
name and go to get data select SQL
server and for now database is optional
I can say direct query click
okay okay now it is showing me what all
tables I can import so in my SQL Server
tutorial in my SQL Server I
have I have these three tables customers
employee TR Olympic events so I can use
probably the customers one which
is
now you can see this is the data the
customers data which is lying in my SQL
Server okay so I can preview it and load
it
so now you can you can preview the data
in uh powerbi that this this is the data
so I can rename is customers from
mssql and this is
from my
SQL
and
okay so now this is not the only uh
data sets you can import now if you take
a look at the options which powerbi gave
of what different type and variations of
data it can it has compatibility to
import
from okay so we can just take a look at
the categorization on the left hand side
first there are file based like Excel
text XML Json is also possible you can
evenly directly import entire folder and
uh within the folder whatever uh data
types of files are there it will detect
it PDF Pary or even SharePoint folder
which is itself a
Microsoft uh technology then different
kind of databases SQL server and my SQL
we just saw but it's are only limited to
this you can connect to Microsoft Access
ssas Oracle database IBM db2
postgress uh sbase teradata and then sap
uh uh databases Amazon red shift Impala
vertica Snowflake and and number of
databases which are there in the market
today uh Amazon Etc then it also allows
you to connect with its own power
platforms powerbi platforms data Mars
powerbi data flows data ver Etc aure
there are different kind of storage uh
mechanisms in azour and azour itself is
a Microsoft Technology uh so it has a
compatibility with lot of azour uh based
data storages like azour SQL database
blob storage uh azour data brakes right
aor HD Insight spark so if you have
those kind of services running on your
Azor cloud services you can even import
them over
here now online services like you know
you have erps running uh or some data
which is shared on the internet if you
want to import it uh that is also
possible through certain products uh
Dynamics 365 Microsoft Exchange online
Salesforce Google analytics Adobe
analytics GitHub uh LinkedIn sales sales
if you want to do some analysis of some
social
networking uh you know feeds that also
you can
import then other misscellaneous are
also there web based Hive R script
python script if there something to
import get data from uh Google Sheets
like we saw one example in our video
right now so there are multiple options
available now once you have imported the
data which is relevant to you um in our
subsequent sessions we will see how to
create relationships but just giving you
a glimpse that whatever data you
importing powerbi autod detect certain
relationships and it will create for you
but then you can go and manually also
change so this is the composite data
model which is getting created in the
back end while you are are importing the
data you can easily go and manage these
relationships either keep them as is you
can delete and create new ones manually
so there is no limitation in
that so this is what we have witnessed
we have imported data from different
files types data types and then you know
we have tried to once it is imported
into uh bi then there is no limitation
of how you use it you can create
visualizations across different data
sets and then create
your standard
reports so this is the example of
importing data from web importing data
from a database from a
PDF and then once you have data you can
shape and combine data you can basically
do what whatever transformation you want
to do you want to uh make joins merge
the data so for example if we go back to
our powerbi and if I go back to my
transform data section now as I have now
different data sets available with me I
have I can do any kind of U you know
operation transformation on the data
right uh so like I showed you I uh
upgraded the header row because one of
the imported data was not showing the
header correctly uh or this columns like
this exact one column is extra I can
remove the
column right all those Transformations
whatever I do in the back end gets
captured in the applied step section
right this is the customer data you can
create uh you can merge it you can
append it uh you know with other data
set right look for example I want to
create a merge data set of my categories
and subcategories so I can say mer
select this two data sets and say merge
queries as
new and I can select product categories
and product set categories
select product category key on both the
side and then they do a left Auto join
so whatever product categories are there
I'll get the subcategories associated
with it and I'll create a new table
which will
have now I have the table which has the
category and the subcategory and
subcategory in one table itself so I can
rename it now to
as
category
subcategory table it's a it's a merge
basically it's a join between category
and subcategory and now I have a common
table right
and I can close and
apply so imagine I have created a new
table which is imported created from one
data set is which is Excel page and
another data set which is text
base see this category subcategory table
so now I can use it the way I want in my
visualization reports so that's what the
presentation says right that once you
have uh the imported data you can shape
you can combine you can adjust you can
do whatever transformation you want to
do and create your visualization also if
you're an aspiring data analyst looking
for online training and certification
from the best universities or a
professional who wishes to switch
careers in data analytics by learning
from the experts then try giving a shot
to stics from C University in
collaboration with IBM the link in the
description box below should navigate
you to the homepage where you can find a
complete overview of the program being
offered now what is powerbi it is a
business intelligence tool to visualize
your data and share insights across your
organization so when we talk about bi it
came into existence as a self-service bi
tool and it does have different
components which can be used now before
we get into details of powerbi let's
understand what are the different
components or what are the different
ways in which you can work on your
powerbi now one of the main challenges
when it comes
to organizations or users is that data
is scattered in different places it
might be in different formats and anyone
everyone would want to use that data to
basically perform some
calculations create visualizations or
dashboards which could be interactive
and that's where they would want to
bring all the data in one place might be
transform it so that you can filter out
and not load huge amount of data in your
system and you can work on selective
data so when it comes to powerbi it
helps us in ETL it helps us in data
modeling it helps in data storage and
Reporting so what are the benefits of
powerbi here are some of the benefits so
extract intelligence rapidly and
accurately so that's basically
transforming your Enterprise data into
Rich visuals and accurate reports for
enhanced decision making now one thing
we already know that when we talk about
data data in draw format might have lot
of hidden information if we look at
different data sets which I'll show you
in the
process it might have lot of meaning but
then the real meaning comes out of the
data if we can create visualiz I
izations if we can create relationships
between different data sets and thus
that can help us in enhanced decision
making now powerbi supports Advanced
Data Services it integrates seemlessly
with Advanced cloud services like
Cortana to provide results for the
verbal data queries as
well when you talk about seamlessly
integrating with existing applications
that's one more benefit of powerbi so it
adopts analytics and Reporting
capabilities easily to embed interactive
visuals quickly in your applications you
can build Rich personalized dashboards
so it basically provides a unified user
experience with customized dashboard and
reports that meet your exact needs it
also has a way where you can have secure
way of publishing your reports so you
can can set up automatic data refresh
and rapidly publish reports allowing
multiple users to Avail the latest
information across your organization or
across your working
community so powerbi can connect to
different sources we'll see that in a
while so basically you have an option
which says get data and that basically
opens up a window where you can find
different type of data sources such as
Excel your CS or text Json
PDF getting data from databases or
directly accessing data from databases
now before we get further into
understanding how powerbi looks like it
would be good idea to share information
in how you can set that up on your
machine so when it comes to your powerbi
and let me open up a notpad
here so for example I bring up a notepad
let's say when you talk about your
powerbi
components so you basically have powerbi
desktop and that's mainly your
playground or that's mainly used for any
kind of development
activities you have your powerbi
server or you can say service now this
one is where you would make reports
online and
share or make them
[Music]
available to different
buus now that's one more component of
powerbi and then you also have your
powerbi mobile which is mainly for
viewing the information or I would say
viewing reports so these are the three
main components we can also look at the
licensing information of these so these
are the mains so powerbi desktop is
something which you can set up on your
laptop or on your machine powerbi server
is where you can log in with your user
ID and password and powerbi mobile is
mainly to view your reports now how do
you set this up before you can explore
or start working on powerbi so here is a
link which you can basically use so if
you look into this so so this one
basically says Service s Service sign up
for powerbi it says sign up of powerbi
service as an individual normally when
you would want to use powerbi you can
use a website called
HTTP and then you have
basically app and let's say I think it's
called app powerbi.com now this is the
place where you can basically login now
if you see here I have created an
account and if you look at my account it
says auat l. on microsoft.com now how do
you get this kind of email because when
you talk about powerbi it will expect
you to have a official ID and it does
not take IDs which are from common
domains such as Google or yaho and so on
so this particular link gives you an
idea how you can do that so basically
you have what is powerbi basic
explanation on that it says signing up
for powerbi service so powerbi desktop
it's a totally free download and then
you have mobile apps also a totally free
download and here it says that what kind
of email addresses it supports and if we
look into this you have to either sign
up because that does not accept your
private email IDs or you can go for this
one with says enroll US government
organization and this is where you can
basically sign up for powerbi so it
basically says try free if you go to the
website say
powerbi.com or you could go into this
one which I was saying
HTTP SL
SLA
do your powerbi.com and this is what you
can use or as mentioned you can go to
powerbi .
microsoft.com for example if I open this
in a different tab it takes me to Pia
Microsoft I can say start free I can
click on this it says try free but then
when it asks you to sign in this is
where some of us face problem because it
does not take your private email ID now
how do you tackle that what you can do
here is on this page which says learn
about alternate ways to sign sign up you
can basically open up this link and in
this link it says sign up for powerbi
with a new Microsoft 365 trial account
and what you can do is you can basically
click on this link which takes you to
The Office
365 and what you can do here is you can
search for something which says say 365
E3 and here you have tried for
free so in my case it is translating
okay so here you have an option which
says tried for free click on this one
and then basically go ahead with your
signup process now once you do that you
can basically create an account or give
a email ID so it asks you to give an
email ID to check if you already have an
account and once you do that it will
guide you through the process where you
can create an account like I have done
now once you have done that so for
example we can go into my this page
which I said HTTP SL
SLA powerbi.com now once you have
created an account you would be asked to
login now I can click and login here and
then basically given my password and
once I do that it takes me to the
powerbi server or service now on the top
right it might say that go for a trial
version I have already selected that and
this is a Pro trial which is giving me
validity for 60 days so this is the
service which I can use now what it
means is I can be using my powerbi
desktop which would be also installed so
once you log into this page you can
basically click on apps you can
basically search for something like
powerbi and that that will show up an
app and you can install and download on
your machine now once that is there you
can basically bring it up so for example
in my case I can just say
powerbi desktop and that's the app which
I have installed on my machine and
basically that comes up so that's your
powerbi desktop which is coming up and
it will still ask you to sign in so that
you can share your information through
powerbi so you see here on the top I'm
already signed in and here it also shows
you some tutorials and videos which
basically helps you in getting to know
something more or what's new so you can
always browse that so you would have
your powerbi desktop which would be set
up you would also have your powerbi
service which would be running and then
basically whatever you have developed on
on your powerbi desktop you can share
that through the powerbi service now
usually when you talk about licensing I
can give you brief insights here so you
basically have your powerbi service as I
said licensing so you have the pro
version which is
basically uh your
$9.9 per user per month and basically it
has some kind of limitation so it has
say Max 10 GB you can work on uh some
features like incremental refresh is not
allowed you can always look onto the
Microsoft website for more details and
in those kind of cases you usually go
for the premium account if you are a
extensive user and premium account
basically is conditional base so it
depends on your requirements and then
basically you pay for the service what
you use so that's mainly about your
servicing now when you talk about your
server and Service as I said it is
basically making your reports online and
sharing and making them available to
different buus so that is the Highlight
so when you talk about sharing reports
that's one of the things you have
anomaly
detection that's also possible here you
can talk about automation of report
you have security that is you can go for
role based or Ro level based kind of
security implementation and all those
are some of the features of your powerbi
server and service so it is good to know
and basically have your desktop and
powerbi service set up now once you have
that then you basically have your
powerbi now when you talk about your
powerbi it basically helps helps you
with various things so this is how
easily you can have it set up and then
basically you can explore this so for
example as I was saying powerbi can
connect to different data sources now I
do have an option here which says get
data I can click on this and that shows
me all the different data sources I can
even click on more if I'm interested in
looking what more powerbi desktop tool
helps me to do so it shows me all the
different ways in which you can get the
data you see here the servers so the
database Services your folders your
different formats you can click on file
formats or databases you can look at
Power Platform so if basically you are
connecting to a platform and getting
some Services you can connect to the
cloud that is aure you have online
services and then you have other options
so these are all the ways in which you
can get your data when you talk about
visualiz I izations you see a lot of
visualization options here which can be
used once your data is loaded and I will
explore and explain more about this so
you have something called as insert
wherein you can go in for different
visuals or different types you can also
get into say transform the data now that
basically is going to pop up and bring a
power query editor now that's where a
lot of your ETL Works happen so when you
when you do a transform data it opens a
power query editor which we can use to
transform the data or change the data or
modify the data as per our requirement
before loading all of it into our power
bi so you also have option here which
says modeling wherein we can create new
tables or we can work on our data where
we can manage relationship so as of now
we don't have any data so it does not
show this one is activated but that can
be activated this is where you can view
your reports so this is in short
exploring your powerbi we'll see what
are the different options which we can
use here so it basically supports
different kind of data so when we look
at the visualization Paine that
basically allows us to create different
kind of visualizations here and we will
understand that
so you can basically visualize on your
different data and create different kind
of charts graphs maps and basically
derive insights from your data now when
you talk about data models that's where
you can basically establish
relationships so when you talk about
data models it is basically used to
connect multiple data sources to build a
relationship now we might have have
different data sets or we might have
data coming in from different tables
where we may want to
basically get insights or get data from
multiple data
sources for our purpose now in that case
data models do help us so for example if
you have two tables let's look at the
standard tables so you have products
lookup table and you also have the sales
table now usually what you have in any
kind of scenario is if we basically say
you have your data tables so that's
basically where your data resides and
then you have series of your lookup
tables so usually you might have say
your data tables here and this is what
I'm talking about which might have some
data for example let's say sales is one
of them you might have some other data
table which might be for example let's
say budget table or might be something
else and these are your data tables now
at the other end you might have your
lookup tables so basically you have
various lookup
tables and these lookup tables for
example let's say this one is
customer this one is territory
let's say this is
product and let's say this one is a
calendar so these are basically my
lookup
tables so we can basically as I said
your data might be coming in from
different sources let's say database or
let's say some kind of files or let's
say some kind of systems what you have
so your data might be coming in from
different places now you might want to
transform the data so this is where I
could say there is your query editor
which I was explaining so you have your
query editor which basically allows you
to edit the data table or basically
allows you to edit the data before it is
loaded right you can hide a column you
can add a new column you can modify your
column so your query editors would be
basically used to work on the DAT which
goes into your data tables now you might
have lot of lookup tables as I said so
let's say these are my lookup
tables and these are my data tables so
what we need is sometimes we need
information based on our lookup tables
and data tables now that's where data
modeling comes into picture so basically
if I would want to extract information
from here so I can notice that there is
a product key here and there is a
product key here now this is where we
are already talking about say foreign
keys or we are talking about your
relationships right now when you talk
about relational databases you have
something called as foreign key
constraints which is in in powerbi terms
I would say it's not exactly a
constraint but it is more of a filter
propagation instead which is used to
basically connect your different data
sources and you could have basically
crossfilter directions you can go for
single or one to one or one to many or
many to many kind of relationships which
basically allows you to work on the data
so we will learn more about data models
when we are doing a quick demo there
where we can talk a little bit about
normalization and
denormalization the way the data exits
is right and then you basically would
want to gather insights from your data
so when you talk about your two data
sources as I said so you have a products
lookup table you have a sales table now
if you would want to calculate the total
order quantity of each product name
which is we are talking about the order
quantity as a information here and you
have product name here now how do you
get that information what we see here is
we would want something like this or we
would want more information so how do we
do that so what we can do is the order
quantity for each product is basically
showing us the same value now this is
because the product and sales tables are
not connected and there is no
relationship between them even if you
would want to take two sources and just
get information out of them probably I
would complain that there is no
relationship is established between them
so what we do is we create a data model
so what we do is we build a relationship
between both the tables using a common
key column which exists in both cases as
I said there is a product key here there
is a product key here so that basically
allows us to have a relationship between
these two now that could be one: one
this could also be related to other
tables so it could be one to many you
could have many to one so all those
relationships are possible so product
key is basically used to create a
relationship you see the arrow Mark and
then there is also this star which can
basically mean one to many now when the
product key is used to join these two
tables or form a relationship then we
can look at the product names and the
order quantities which basically gives
me a total now that's the basic use of
your data models now what about this Dax
so basically data analysis Expressions
now that's a a library of functions and
operators that can be combined to build
formulas and expressions and powerb
desktop usually when we work on our data
sources when we would want to connect
them it automatically shows us these
data analysis Expressions however this
gives us extension it basically gives us
more power to work on our data now
sometimes instead of working on Dax or
Dax Expressions it would be good to go
for better data modeling and have the
relationships established better and
sometimes when the relationships are
established you could use your tax which
basically gives you more power on
working on your data so your values are
calculated based on information from
each row of a table it appends values to
each row in a table and stores them in
the model it increases the file size so
that's what happens now you can right
click on any column to add a new column
and for example in this one it shows
that there was a quantity type
calculated column which was based on the
calculation what we see here on the top
in the in the expression bar which says
what kind of calculation was performed
and that basically gives us the value
for quantity type and that is basically
added here to our existing data so
that's the power of Dax and powerbi so
you also have something called as uh
measures so Dax allows you to create new
calculated columns and measures so
basically here if you see we are working
on
awor sales and then we have selected
quantity sold and what we are looking in
the report is we can basically right
click on any table name to add a new
measure here so we have added what we
call as quantity sold as the measure so
values are calculated based on
information from any filters in the
report we will see this how this can be
done and that basically here the measure
does not increase the file size it does
not create new data in the table
themselves in comparision to what we
were seeing earlier that is your
calculated columns so these are your
type of Dax functions so Dax allows you
to create new calculated columns and
measures so you have date and time which
basically allows you to work on date and
time data or Fields you have logical
functions which allow us to create new
filters or add more filters to our data
you have text functions which basically
allows us to say transform the data into
a lower case or an upper case or
basically get the length of a string or
concatenate two fields
or basically uh do a filtering based on
some criterias or replacing some content
you also have statistical functions
which can be used you have information
functions which can be used so these are
different types of Dax functions which
we can use in powerbi so we will learn
more on powerbi through a quick demo
where we can U use some data sets and
those data sets could be found on
internet although I can also upload that
on a GitHub link and you will have
access to those data sets so let's learn
about powerbi through a quick demo by
uploading some data sets and playing
with those data sets let's look at a
sample data set and let's upload it and
as I explained while uploading let's
also transform the data so that we can
have selective fields or selected data
loaded here instead of loading the
complete data set and then let's see how
we can visualize this or how we can use
the information in this data set now
what we can do here is we can click on
get data and then we can choose one of
the data formats which we would be
looking for so for example I can go for
Excel and basically click on this now
here are some of my data sets so let's
look into the folder here and these data
sets are also available on my GitHub
link which I'll share with you later so
here we have something called a super
store let's click on this and here I
already have a data set which is global
super store or I also have selective
data so let's select this one click on
open now
that's basically connecting to my data
source and that will show me what does
that Excel sheet have so it has
different tabs which is orders people
and returns so let's select orders and
that basically gives me a preview of the
data which I have and if you scroll all
the way to right it shows me city state
and then country and if you see here we
do see information of all the country
now this can be huge amount of data
which may which we would want look into
but say for example my use case is that
I'm interested in looking for the data
for United States and uh as a country
and all its states so we will do that
when we do a transform now we can also
select the returns Tab and that shows me
these three Fields however the first row
should have been the heading of this uh
particular data set and we will
transform that now I can go ahead and
click on load but that will load all the
data so instead of that let's go for
transforming so let's click on transform
data now once you do that it brings you
your toolkit that's brings you your
power query editor which allows you to
transform your data so for example we
have uh data from returns tab or returns
data source as you see here so we see
column 1 column 2 and column three and
that also shows the type of the data
here it also gives me a quick small
option here let's select this and then I
can say use first row as header now
there are various other options which
you can do you can add a custom column
you can add column with examples you can
keep the top rows you can remove the top
rows you can keep errors keep duplicates
so there are different ways and you can
you can also do a merge query or a pend
query so as of now let's just say use
first row as headers and that basically
shows that now my first row has become
the header you also see in the applied
steps it basically tells me if I have
changed the type of the data if I have
made any other changes those steps will
get added here so it basically shows me
the name as it returns it shows me
applied steps where I've changed the
type and now I basically have this
information now this is something where
you can change the type or you can
basically set it to a particular format
however we are not doing anything of
that sort right now so we can do that
for any of these columns so this looks
good when it comes to orders let's click
on this and as I said I would be
interested in selecting for country as
United States only and let me just work
on that data however we can work on all
the data so let me scroll all the way to
right and here I have the country now
there are these filters which we can use
so basically I can click on this and
that shows me all the countries are
selected now there is also something
called as text filters which we will see
how we can use to select particular data
I basically have other ways of filtering
the data so for example now I will just
uncheck the select all and what I would
be interested is in United States so
let's type it here that shows me has an
option here select this and then
basically say okay so that should
basically now filter out and it shows me
the data is United States only and then
you have different states and rest of
the data remains so if you look at the
applied steps it tells me that there are
filtered rows now we have done the basic
transformation for this data set on
these two data sources that is orders
and returns so here you have an option
which says close and apply so close the
query editor window and apply any
pending changes you can click on this
and it says apply so for example I can
just say apply for now and that should
basically apply the
changes which I have performed us using
my query editor that is I have
transformed the data so that I can have
selective data uploaded in my powerbi
now it's doing that it shows me it is
working on both of these data sources
that is orders and returns so that's
done and now basically if there are any
other pending changes we can just do a
close and apply so that basically has
closed and now you would see the data
appearing here so I have uploaded the
data as per my preferences now if you
click on the data tab here so it
basically shows you your data fields it
might take some time to populate but if
you see in the country field now if even
if I click on the filter it just shows
me United States now that's what we
wanted so we have already uploaded this
data in orders you can always expand the
option here which shows me all the
fields which are there in this might be
this is an aggregation might be that's
an order date so this is again some kind
of aggregation we can change the data
types so we are looking at all the
fields in my orders table or basically
coming from the orders data source I
also have returns which shows me three
fields and that shows me the data which
is returned order ID and region so the
column names are applied correctly as we
want and that basically looks fine now
we can also look at
your model so when you click on model it
shows me these two however there is no
as of now relationship established
between them so it says under properties
select one or more model objects to set
their properties so right now these are
not related there is no relationship
established between them so if I would
want some data which relates to orders
and returns then that would fail because
it would say there is no relationship
now I can go to the first option which
says report and we have not created any
report here although we can create a
simple report we can look at the data so
we have our orders field now we can
basically pull out some information from
here we can choose what kind of report
we may want to create so for example
let's go for
uh the table option from visualizations
you have various options here which we
can use this is where you can do a
formatting this is where you can select
the fields this is where you can search
and filter out the data you can also add
data fields here so first let's click on
table and that basically gives me a
table now this table as of now does not
have anything so you can use the filter
and slices
option here which will affect the
visualization or basically what you can
do is now since we have orders here so
this is my orders and I would like to
work on this so let's say for example
country is I can select country as a
field and if you say it shows me country
is all as of now and it says the value
is United States what I can also do is
I'm interested in the state States so I
have state now I can basically drag and
drop it here and then the state gets
added here so I can basically say select
all and that should basically take care
of my State field being added here so
state is all country is all now we can
basically look at something else so
might be let's choose
sales and I can just drag and drop sales
here so that basically says if you would
want to have any kind of advanced
filtering which says filter type so go
for advanced filtering is less than or
equal or you can also go for advanced
filters so that's fine as of now so we
have added some Fields here and that's
basically my data here so let's go for
filters
here which basically should select all
my
Fields now if you see the visualization
shows my country sales and state which
we had either by selecting the fields
and dropping them here or you can in
this section where it says Fields so you
can for example let me show it again so
I can just delete this I can click on
the table option I can just drag it here
I can basically make it bigger and I
need to add data to this one so it says
add data fields here so now let's say
country is what we are interested in we
are also interested in
States so let's drop that here and let's
say sales so this is also what I'm
interested so I'm looking at one
specific country I'm looking at sales
per state and when we look at sales it
basically tells me that this is
summation so you will basically get the
total sales which have happened now we
are looking at this data here we can
always go to formatting we can click on
grid we can basically increase the font
here we can change the grid color so for
example let's make it for example
blue so I can just select
this and it should basically allow me to
have the grid color is blue now I can go
in for the grid thickness I can go for
rope padding outline color so we can
basically make it a little bit more
readable and then we can basically
increase the font size here to look at
the
information and you have other options
here so what would you want to do with
column headers so I can basically have
the font color background color is fine
do you want to have an outline do you
want to have a change in font what is
the text size might be we can make the
heading a little bigger and then
basically you also have the field
formatting so all those could be done
you could go for background and all
these things can be done in formatting
so now we already have our data here and
this basically looks good and this is
basically one of my visuals which I have
here and this has given me some
information for sales and basically I
can scroll this I can also make it
bigger so I could select a particular
field if I'm more interested in looking
at the information for a particular
State now I can add more fields to this
so this is my one of the reports which I
have created now
what I can do with this report is I can
basically have more data fields I can
add filters to this I can basically look
into all the data here by just clicking
somewhere in the grid but somewhere
outside if you select a particular row
then that data shows up here you have an
option of focus mode which you can go
for you can look at the other options
which says export data now if this is
the data which you are interested in you
can export it you can always do show as
a table if you interested in you can do
a sort by country sales or state so for
example let's do a sorting by
state and that basically gives me the
data which has been sorted by state
information now we could obviously have
the information here so I can then
change the order so it shows me
alphabetically this is the information
which I have so I've created a simple
visualization using the data which I
have and what I can do is I can click on
save so that basically asks me to save
this as a powerbi file which has an
extension of PB iix and I can basically
call it my report so let's say first
report and here I can say country or I
can say
state wise sales in
USA let's say USA and that basically is
my first
report
now once you have saved this report you
can always look on your machine for
example if I go in here and if I go into
this folder might be I I should look on
desktop and this is where I should have
saved it so it shows me first report
statewise that will open up in powerbi
and we have created a simple report
which we have basically used by taking
our data now I can also do is I can
publish this if I would want to share
this information so publish this report
online in powerbi service you can
basically
select your report what we have here and
I clicked on publish so it says what's
the destination so you can have
different workspaces I will choose the
default that's my workspace I can click
on select now it says publishing first
report statewise sales in USA to powerbi
you can create a portrait view of your
report and you can do all that stuff so
let it publish and then we can basically
look into our our powerbi server that's
our service where the information is
already
shared or published I would say which
can then be shared with different
sources so we can come here and
basically I can look into the
powerbi and this is where I will be able
to look into my workspaces and let's
look in my workspace so it says this is
the place where I had initially
downloaded powerbi data set it says your
data set is ready let powerbi help you
explore your data right so you can
always do this you can click on view
data set which basically allows you to
bring out your workspace and first
report state wise sales now that's the
report which we have published so let's
first check in our desktop if that's
done so it
says success open first report in
powerbi now I can click on this one
straight away and that takes me to my
service now once it takes me to the
service it shows me the report which we
created which we published and it
basically has the option where I can
save it as a a different copy or give a
different name I can embed this in diff
in a website or a portal I can publish
to
web embed this report for Public Access
by anyone on the internet we can do that
we can export it to point so we can do
all these options you also have an
option of view where you can change the
view you can basically also edit report
here so you can do that if you are
interested in something specific you can
do a sharing to teams so if you have
your teams or group set up you can share
it with them you have an option of
common pains you can basically view
usage metrics report now that can is
sometimes helpful you can basically go
ahead and go and subscribe a particular
report so if there are new changes made
you will be the one who will be informed
you can click on share now if I click on
share here from my service it says only
users with powerbi Pro will have access
to this report recipients will have the
same access as you unless Ro level
security on the data set further
restricts them so I can grant access and
this is where I will have to give the
email IDs of the people with a message
that I would want to have them look at
this
report right you can also allow
recipients to build new content using
the underlying data sets and you can
send an email notification to the users
as of now I don't have any other groups
so I'll not be sharing it but I have
created a simple report now let's also
look at edit report let's just to see
what it helps us and when you click on
edit report it basically brings up this
one which says your file view it gives
you the filters it basically allows you
to add data fields to this so it is
basically giving access to these data
sets which were in my desktop it is
basically allowing you to give or create
different
visualizations now here we have the data
which we are looking at and if say for
example somebody is interested in
filtering the data so you could do that
so you could click on filter here and
that basically applies this is the
filter we have now country is fine sales
might be I can click on sales and I
would say okay let's look at sales which
is more than a particular amount so we
can say is greater than and might be I
can give a number here so I can say
30,000 and
basically I can say apply
filter so right now I'm applying filter
and I would look at the values which
also shows me the total value is changed
so you have not only created a report
you have published it and now from the
service you can edit it so I'm looking
at particular data here and then
basically I can click on file and I can
save it or I can say save a copy of the
report and let's say I will call it the
same name so I'll say
first report
underscore state wise sales and I will
say modified so let's do a
save and the report has been
saved so now you're looking at the data
here so that is basically giving you
information so when I click on my
workspace
here I can click on reports and that
does show me my previous report it shows
me the modified report it gives me an
option of looking at the usage metrics
report so say for example you want to
click on this one and it will basically
give you the usage metrics so let's
click on this one and that basically
shows me the report usage metrics which
is generated so views per day unique
viewers per day you would want to look
at the different platforms who was using
it views by user and this can be
sometimes useful if we would want to
look into this one now I can go back to
my workspace I can click on reports and
that basically took me to usage metrics
I could be sharing it I can analyze in
Excel I can look for quick insights
based on this data what we have you can
basically look at the related
information you can also look at the
settings of this one and basically this
is how you have your data report here
now that also shows me the data sets
option so which basically gives me the
data sets which can be used to create
further reports and we have our data
here so for example if I click on create
report it basically gives me these data
sets and we can continue working on this
so this is how I have a simple report
created without basically working on two
different data sources but I have
selected some data here and then I can
basically add details to this so for
example now if we look at orders and say
for example this is the data I have
and say you would want to add some
Fields so let's go to returns and say
for example I would be interested in
looking at the the products so might be
what I should do is I should replace the
report here instead of country it would
be interesting to look at the product
which we have or basically customer ID
so we can look at customer ID we can
look at the order ID which would be
interesting to see if there is a
particular order what was the sales
which was generated and if there were
any returns which were happening on that
so for example here when I have these
let me cut out country as a field and I
will basically take order ID and place
it here so now if you see my data has
been easily modified so I have my order
ID I have sales and I have statewise
information so you have basically all
the information but this is now order ID
State and so on now what if I would want
to also see based on the order ID if I
say I would want the returned
field so for example I would want to
take this one and let's drag and drop it
here now that says cannot display the
visual now why is that so if you click
on C details that says
cannot determine relationships between
the fields so it cannot display the data
because powerbi cannot determine the
relationship between two or more fields
and how do we fix that so for example if
I click on fix this now it says there is
a missing relationship between these
fields use autod detect to search for
relationships or create them manually
now I can click on autod detect which
will try to search for fields which
exist in both the data sets or basically
I can create relationships so let's
click on create relationships and that
basically takes me to this page which
says there are no relationships defined
from table to table and so on so I can
click on
new now here it says select the tables
and the columns that are related now I
can say orders now those are my Fields
where you have order IDs and it
automatically shows that returns also
has an order ID field although all the
values might not be same but this is how
you can create a relationship and it
says the cardinality says many to one so
you can have basically many to one
relationship you're saying cross filter
Direction is single so make this
relationship active and it has already
helped us basically identifying the
field so I can say okay so it says now
these two tables should be related or
should be connected based on order ID
so here we have this and let's basically
say
close now once that is done if you
see I have order ID I have returned I
have sales column and I have state and
if you see in returned I do have a value
of yes which shows this particular order
ID
had generated some sales and it was for
state Alabama and it was returned and
the value is yes so if you scroll down
you basically see all the values now we
can add different filters where we can
say I would want only yes and no now
this is again an interesting report so
let's go in also into the
formatting and what we can do is we can
look at say the grid option if we would
want to basically say vertical grid and
let's
say on and it says vertical grid color
so let's select this mightbe I can try
doing a black here it puts it in a right
nice table format and that basically
looks good so you have sales returned
and so on and this is basically the
order which I'm seeing here so for
example if I would want to change the
order and if I'm saying okay I would
like to look at sales and return and so
on so we can be doing that we can come
here and say for example I have sales
and return let's try moving the sales
column over here might be state is uh an
information which we would want in the
beginning so let me also move the states
all the way here here so it gives me
state it gives me the order ID sales and
if there was a return which was
happening on that particular product so
easily I've modified my report now what
I can do is I can just save
it and I can do the same thing so I can
publish it I can basically continue
using it or I can work on a new report
so let's continue learning and uh now
here we will also see how you can load
some data and perform some
Transformations and basically get
multiple results or multiple tables or
multiple data sets which can be then
further used for reporting so powerbi
does give you a lot of options now here
you have an option as we saw earlier
that is get data or what you can do is
you have an option where you can
create new data also which says enter
data now this is something which can be
easily used if you have relatively less
number of fields so you can basically
add more columns here and you can
basically add values so for example if I
would just call it something
like um scientist
ID okay and then I can say scientist
name and then basically I can say uh
[Music]
domain and then I can say for example
let's say year of joining and and I can
keep adding the number of columns here I
can delete the columns right and I can
give this and I can say country so
that's it and now we have created these
five countries uh sorry five columns
which we have given some names and we
can start entering some values so I can
basically say let this scientist ID
be
2234 I can give some name so let's give
Peter let's say domain and I can say
biotechnology I can give year of joining
2011 and I can say Germany as the
country and I really don't want this
particular column so I can go ahead and
delete this now I can come here and then
I can give something else so I can say
this is scientist ID I can give John
let's say the scientist is mainly
working in
physics and then I can say
2018 and let's say
France and go back here and let's say
4567 and let's say Marie and let's say
uh she does her research in uh molecules
and let's call it
2001 and let's say
Italy okay and you can continue adding
datas in this way now you can say if the
data is already here so I can say for
example no I do not want want this
particular
row I do not want this particular row so
you can basically keep adding values
here now you can say edit so here we
have to give some names so let's say
scientist okay and then if you choose
edit it basically brings up your powerbi
editor which allows you to work on these
fields if you would want to make some
changes now we can make some changes
here we can see what are the number of
rows we can basically perform any kind
of transactions here so this one
basically tells me what is the data type
so here we see scientist ID and this
clearly tells me this is an integer
however we will not want to do any kind
of computations here so we can as well
change this so I can just do a right
click and I can work on this particular
column what I can also do is I can just
click on this and this tells me that you
would want to change it to date time or
you want to change it to some number so
I can just say string because we are not
going to perform any computation here so
on the ID column so let's say text and
I'm changing it so it says replace
current add a new Step so selected
column has an existing type conversion
would you like to replace the existing
conversion or preserve the existing so I
will say replace current and now the
data type has been changed it is of a
string and if you see this step has got
added here so it says that the change
type is the kind of transformation we
did here so that's fine now what we can
also do is we have the scientist name
but we don't like the column name here
so it would be good to change this
so there is something called as remove
or remove columns and so on so when you
do a right click it gives you a lot of
options in applying filters or doing
some transformation if I just click on
this one so what I can do is I can look
at the date time and let's go here so we
have an option which says do you want to
change the type now we could have done
that here or like I said you could
choose the time and do it you can just
say transform and how do you want to
change it so do you want to change it to
upper case well you can do that and
changes all the values of this
one what I can do is I can again do a
right click and I can choose basically
if you would want to clean up the data
or if you would want to convert to lower
case you want to capitalize each word so
let's choose that and if you see here
the steps are getting added now to undo
any particular step if I just cancel
this then I'm back to this if I cancel
this I'm back to my original form so you
can anytime undo your changes and you
can basically work on this so we are
working on this particular column now
there are various other options that you
can look at so for example these are
this is some of my data but it does not
have much information it would be good
to load some bigger data set and then
use these
Transformations or basically working on
changing the data types as I mentioned
or if you would want to do a filtering
and remove certain fields and only
select particular Fields if that's what
you're interested doing a right click
where I want to create a copy of this
and then basically I can use that
particular copy now what I can also do
is I can add column from examples I can
duplicate column and then I can make
some changes to that so this is my
duplicate column and say for example you
would want um this one to be changed so
we can say remove duplicates we can
basically if you're doing some kind of
change you want to change the format
here you can do that you can use for
other things like filling up and and all
that now I can just call it rename and
let's say um Alias scientist name right
and I can continue adding columns or I
can do some Transformations and once you
have done with these transactions now
this one if you see it shows as integer
but is it an integer no this is an date
format so I can go for modeling and
change the formats what I can also do is
I can select this and it says it's not
not a decimal it's not a fixed decimal
it is date time it is date it is date
time and time
zone right and you can select any one of
these so for example let's make it date
which makes it more meaningful but then
what happens is when you do this it is
going for the default dates or the older
dates so I don't like that so what we
will have to do is we will have to
basically transform this and here here
we have transform you have change type
so you have date and time you have date
you have time so let's choose date and
time and if you see here it gives me
some default timing based on these
values which we do not like so again
filter it out but what we can do is we
can just make sure that this is changed
or you want to make it a string because
we are not going to do any computation
here so I can keep it as date but then
if I have more Fields like month and
days and so on then you can do that so
here it also has the options so when you
have selected this you have an option
called transform and transpose uh sorry
transform also has various options which
allow you to work on these do you want
to do some scientific calculations do
you want to work on the date field so as
of now it is just integer so we can use
one of these we can do a group by but
obviously we don't have much data here
so as of now let us retain this I can
just change this to text and that's okay
because we are going to look at this
later we can add more data and work on
it so as of now once we have done all
these changes you can go back to say
home and here you have close and apply
and I can basically say close and apply
so the changes will be applied and then
my new table which we just created by
entering some random data performing
some basic
Transformations will be available so if
you look into this
one so that's where my data is it shows
me the columns but there is no
aggregated column as such here you don't
see any summation Mark you just see the
field names or the column names you see
the values now obviously if you go into
modeling there is no or there is no
existence of a different table which you
can join these tables or you can perform
some transactions come back to the data
set so this looks good and we have it
here now obviously we have not created
any visualization based on this which we
can and we can continue working on it so
here this is my data set which is a
small table where we have created some
data and we can use it anytime now let's
work on a bigger data set and see what
kind of Transformations we can do we can
then also see on modeling or basically
using some smarter ways of working with
the
data so what we would want to do is we
would want to load some data here so
let's go
into sorry let's go into home let's go
to get data let's use our old store data
and I'm going to take the global super
store which is huge data set with all
the countries and the products and the
sales which have happened and we can
take this data but before loading it as
I suggested earlier we should basically
transform the data we should basically
transform the data so that you don't end
up loading everything and you don't work
on all the data I mean unless you really
want to so here I will this Excel sheet
which I'm talking about has two
different tabs we have used it before so
let's use orders let's use returns and
that basically shows me the data what we
have so I can do a load but that's not
what we would want to do so you can do a
load and you can get all the data but
let's go to
transform make some basic
Transformations before we load the data
so our power bi editor allows us to work
on this now here we
have it says this preview may be up to 9
days old so I can do a refresh I can
select this and I say first thing is use
first row as header because that's what
I want so it is basically setting the
first row as header which looks good and
we have some order IDs we have
the returned If the product was returned
so let's look at the filter here so it
just has yes values which we are looking
at
so it says list may be incomplete let's
say load
more and let's see what are the filters
here so either there might be a product
which is returned or it might be blank
field so that is chosen so that's fine
we have order ID we have region which is
basically showing me different regions
here let's look at orders and orders is
again having your row ID order ID order
date ship date ship mode so you have
quite large amount of data here for your
different countries now in earlier
example I chose United States and then I
was only focusing on the states and city
in United States so we can do that now I
can basically work on refresh so
whatever preview was stored in the
memory we are just refreshing it now now
here we have this row ID and if you see
the row ID is an integer obviously we
will not be performing any kind of
computation here so here you don't have
any row ID but here we have row ID so
let's make it uh from integer let's make
it string and I'll say replace current
so that's that looks fine it's a row ID
which we will use to search but we are
not going to perform any computations
unless you want to find on an average on
row ID or anything else now you have
order IDs so what we can do is we can
filter some
values we can rename the field as we
desired right so for example let's go in
here and what we can do is let's go
into uh customer ID
ship okay
and here you have say State you have
region okay now at any point of time if
I would want to filter out the values
the easier option is that you can select
on this one and here you can do some
text filtering okay or you can basically
select the values from here so for
example if I say let's get rid of select
all what we will be interested in uh say
United States and UK that's the data we
want and then I can basically say okay
so it is basically going to filter out
the data which is for United States and
UK as of now now what we can also do is
how about doing some more filtering
before we basically work on this so
let's go in here and we are looking at
United States and UK related data and
let's let's look at it is sometimes good
that you can
basically uh work on the data here so
for example I go into orders now what I
would want to do is I would want to look
at the fields okay and we want to we
have not yet loaded the data so if you
look in the background I just have my
scientists because we have not applied
these changes we have not loaded we are
still in the transformation stage right
now what we can do is let's go for so we
can do segment and all these kind of
fields can be used for grouping the data
so we will see that whenever you have a
data set you would already know there
are certain fields which have repeated
values which can be used to group the
data and we can do that we can change
any kind of values which are not going
to be computed on so for example I have
postal code I can use this but again we
are not going to find a postal code
which is greater than something right so
integer is not the valid type let's
change it to text okay and U if for
example I would want to look at this so
I have done some changes here okay and
this shows me null so for example let me
just rever this back back and let's make
it a whole
number okay so there are certain columns
or rows which do not have some values
and we can basically get rid of those
values so as of now we can do a
filtering here so let's keep the postal
code AS integer or let's change it to
text do a replace cont
and now what we will do is we'll scroll
all the way right might be I'm
interested in technology category so
that's what I'm interested in so what I
can do is here I can do some
filtering so I can basically
choose technology now the easier way
would be since these are categories and
there are only three categories we
really don't want to go and apply text
filters here but if you had something
like an office supply and um Office
Inventory then you could have done some
text filter so let's not do some text
filtering here what we can do is I would
be interested in technology so that's
the field I'm interested in so now you
are only having data which is related to
technology okay and you have some
product names so this is where we want
to do do some kind of filtering so we
can rename the field we can select some
Fields so let's for example let's go
for uh any of the field which I think
might have more entries here so for
example let's go
for Canon Wireless or Canon Image right
so let's go for product names and I will
say
let's go here now I could have done a
transformation but that's not what we
want we want to do some filtering so
let's go to text filter and here I can
say begins with I can say ends with I
can say contains so let's go for
contains and it says enter a value here
so you would want to keep the rows where
the product name contains something and
it gives you some
suggestion right so where you are seeing
in some values here so for example if I
would have selected this then it applies
the complete thing but that's not what I
want so I will get rid of all this and I
will say it contains Canon now I can go
for advanced filtering also okay wherein
you can select Advanced and then you can
give different columns and what do they
contain what kind of values you're
looking for so you can do do that but we
will not go for advanced in one step
let's go for basic and let's say okay
and now I should get all the products
which are Canon and you have different
products so this is one kind of
filtering I've done it tells me what is
the category of this it is machines it
is copers it is obviously belonging to
the technology category we are looking
at uh the market which is for this
particular data
when you look at the country we are
still focusing on United States and
United Kingdom that kind of data right
so we have filtered the data we have
done some uh selection based on the data
here and what I can do is I can then
basically rename a particular field so I
can do that I can say I'm interested in
um sales which is the data here we can
basically look into the quantity so
sales is something which we are
interested in but mightbe we are
interested in sales which are more than
a particular value I'm not interested in
lower amount of sales I would want to
look into United States and UK data but
I interested in sales or I'm looking at
if the discount percentage was something
or if the profit was more right so we
can apply different kind of values here
but what we can do is with these changes
because you don't want to transform and
make changes all here you want to make
the changes once the data set is
uploaded so we have selected some data
we have create done some Transformations
we can basically break a particular
column into multiple columns if that's
what we want if we see that we will do
an aggregation based on ear or we will
do a aggregation based on the country or
year and Order ID right so we can break
this data into multiple columns so we
can do that but for now let's do a close
and apply and let's apply this so that's
going to apply all these changes it's
going to load my data but remember now
we are having selective or selected data
which gets loaded so that should get be
available here so it takes time
sometimes so you have to wait and then
you can go ahead and check here so for
example now I'm looking in tables let's
basically minimize this let's go for
orders and this is the data I have which
obviously row ID if you see so you have
all the row IDs and again again you can
do filtering here but this is where you
have already loaded the data the data is
available and then you can start working
on the columns here so we have this
if you closely see we see this summation
Mark and this basically means that these
are my aggregated columns or these
values are measures which can be used
for calculations so we can see that we
can create an own aggregations so we can
do that we can rename the field as we
have
seen we can filter out the data so we
have all the fields showing up from
orders and let's also look at the
returns which basically has the columns
the order ID and your region so it
basically shows the region here where
was the product returned from and we
have this information so what we are
doing is we when we were doing a text
filter in the previous example remember
it was case sensitive okay and you have
to take care of when you're doing a text
filter you have to give a field which
exactly matches as it exists in the
content now okay this is the data we
have and let's look at the order column
right now what we can do is we can do
some quick Transformations here and we
can basically look for more data here so
let's say we have uh some filtering to
be done now I can do a filtering based
on
my uh
product so we had all these products but
now let's do a filtering on product and
then products you have copers you have
machines so you have mainly two
categories right and when you look at
machines it basically talks about your
PC uh something so let's look for
machines and here we have basically The
copier fields which are more so I can B
basically go for filtering
here and that's the data we have so we
don't want to really unselect any of
these here but what I'm doing is I'm
saying text filter and let's go into
this one now and let's say
contains okay so I'm saying contains and
then I can basically say uh let's say
copier now that's what I'm interested in
and uh
show rows where product name
contains
copier okay now you can give a and
condition here so if you would want a
specific copier if you are interested in
okay let's also say uh contains and
let's go for laser
also laser and let's say okay so you see
the data gets filtered out here and uh
we have the sales which we are seeing
here so let's go to sales and we will be
interested in anything above 500 so
let's go to
sales let's go for number filters let's
say greater than and I will say for
example 500 oh sorry
500 okay
and uh let's say okay so that basically
filters out the data and then then I am
also interested in quantity Where I
would want the quantity to
be more than one or more than two so for
example so let's go
in here and you can basically choose
what is the filter you want so you can
apply any number of filters now you have
the filtering here you can always click
on the filter and if you want you can
just do a clear filter and the filtering
will be gone so you have all the data
right and this is the particular data we
have and here I have say for
example product name now I can keep the
filter because I'm interested only in
these values or I can filter out so this
tells me that when we did a and it is
basically going for laser and copier
right so let's say for example clear all
filters the thing is gone what we can do
is let's go here go for text filter say
contains and here I will say it can be a
copier okay or so last time we did a and
and I'll do a contains
laser so let's choose this that gives me
more entries so either the product name
has copier or it has laser it has the
the quantity it has the product name and
we have all this detail here now what we
can also do is we can do some
transformation on the product ID so for
example you have product ID or order ID
so order ID shows up as uh looks like
the country name uh the year and then
the order ID so we can basically split
it up so I can select this and here I
have option
of let's go to home so when you have you
have selected this column so you have an
option of transform data here so use the
power query Editor to connect prepare
and transform the data so if you really
want to transform the data here if I
basically select
this if I just do a right click here now
here it just tells me do you want a new
column do you want to create a copy of
this column
okay you want to create copy table so
this is your transformed data what you
have and for example let's create a copy
table and let's come in here so you
should be able to see
your copy table now so let's go
in and select this one and what what you
need to do here is creating a copy of
this or copy table would not be the
right option what we can do is we can
work on transforming this rather than
doing it from here so you have this
option of adding a new column going for
a new measure renaming it right so
that's okay but what we can do is Select
this particular column let's do a home
and first thing is let's go to transform
so I want to transform the data now
let's select this one and it brings up
your power editor again here we were
interested in orders so we are looking
at our data
here now if you see my country is United
States and UK so you can confirm that if
you look at category it is technology
product name has copier and Laser as we
selected so those things are retained so
you have not lost any changes as of now
so this order ID column what we have now
as I said you can be doing a filtering
okay you can select this particular
column and then you have other things
which can be used to transform here like
you want to change the data type you
want to use first row as header you want
to replace some values okay you want to
run some merge queries you want to do
some analytics so all these options are
here now what we can do is while this
column is selected I can do a right
click now there is an option called
transform which is basically going to
help me in changing the data here okay
now I can basically duplicate the column
so I really don't want to work on this
column itself but it would be good to
have a duplicate column on which we can
work on so I can do a split column here
if I would want to but let's create a
duplicate column so let's say duplicate
column now that gives me a duplicate
column so we can rename it later so now
I will not work on my original column
but I'll work on a duplicate column and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
basically transform or split this so
again to a right click now you have a
split by so we can say split by by D
limiter or by number or by characters or
by positions so by lower case and upper
case so you can do all of this so let's
go for by D limiter
now if you see it basically identifies
the D limiter which is hyphen or Dash
now you can go for split at leftmost
identifier right sorry leftmost
delimiter rightmost each occurrence of D
limiter and that's what we want to do
you can look into Advan options where it
says split into columns so do you want
to split that into columns do you want
to split that into rows because that's
more or less like doing a group by and
you can say number of columns to split
into so we have here 1 2 3 4 values so
that looks good to me and uh let's do
say for example if I choose
three so I can choose three and then
split using special characters so you
could do that so let's for example let's
say
okay and let's look at the data how it
looks like we can anytime delete the
data we can keep it it the way we want
right so what we did was we created a
copy of the column then we did a split
and what we have seen is we just have
three columns now if you see the fourth
bit is gone fourth bit doesn't show up
right because I just did a three as
the resulting column so I have the order
ID okay and we can check if there is
already an order ID column so we have
order ID but that has the complete order
ID here and the relatively product ID so
you can see the customer ID you can look
at this one so it basically has your
order ID and then let's look at the
fields here so we have the product ID
which says Tec Ma I'm looking at the
first one
370
and that has in no relation to the order
ID right so we can make sure that there
is nothing which is conflicting with our
entries now once that is done so we have
order ID which can be used to categorize
the data you have order ID which is
basically the year okay and you have
order ID which is basically having some
more value now I can keep this data as I
want so so I can basically click on this
I can go for renaming and I can say
let's say let's call it
order
ID and let's say IDs so let us in case
there is a particular column and you
would want to look at so just give the
name correctly now order IDs is f so
here we will also rename this one so
let's call it uh
order
here and that's going to be order ear so
we can again change this to string okay
and here you have the order ID so let's
rename this
one and I have
my let's call
order
number right so we have we are seeing
all the steps which we have added here
we just split the data based on the D
limiter and we have now three new
columns which have got added to our
existing data which was already filtered
and we have done some splitting up of
data by creating a duplicate and then
renaming it right so if
you go and look at your Transformations
now if I would have done a split here
straight away then my original column
would be gone but probably we want the
original column because sometimes you
may want to search order ID with a
Consolidated information sometimes you
may want to segregate it based on ear
right now we have the year field or
order date field here you have the ship
date right but then might be you want to
just aggregate based on year you don't
want to really spend time in aggregating
or extracting the month and day and so
on so my these three columns can be
useful now what I can also do is I can
merge The Columns if I want so we have
split the columns but what I can do is I
can say select select select so using
your control and now do a right click so
so you should have an option called
merge columns right now this is
something which is uh we would want to
merge so let's say merge columns and
let's say do you want to keep a
separator so yes I want to keep a
separator but might be this time I will
give my separator is
a uh colon and then what is the merge
column name you want to create so let's
call it something like like
um
order okay uh here and then let's call
it num right so sometimes renaming the
fields to a name which makes more sense
or based on your naming convention is
good so let's do a merge and now what I
have done is I have done merging of
those columns so I I split the data I
merg The Columns and now if you see my
The Columns which I had created those
columns are gone because you did a merge
you did a merge and now you have the
fields which are
either uh earlier you had something
which is separated by a hyphen and here
you have something which is separated by
colon right now anytime if you want you
can
unmerge this by removing this step right
and you can get rid of this merge column
so if for example I would do that so I
have my data back right I have my data
back so what we could have done is we
can select
this okay and then what we can do is
like what we did earlier so you can
basically go for removing the columns
okay you can do a merge column okay you
can select one by one and create
duplicate of those and then you can
merge them right so all the possible
options are there so you can the best
option would be to create a duplicate of
these columns and then basically merge
them as per your convenience so might be
you can say order IDs and order number
is the pairing what you want ear is
something which you don't want right
because we already have the date field
so I can basically say
remove and this one is gone now I will
select this and this and let's go for
merge columns and I want to give a
separator which
is might be without the ear and you have
space or you can go for custom like
earlier we had give a symbol and then
what do you want to call it so let's say
order
specs
okay right so this makes more meanings
because we already have the date field
so why do I want the year into my order
ID so I can always be doing a
segregation now based on order
specs right now this is some simple
transform
what we are doing here we are seeing the
data which we have okay now what I can
do is I can basically first apply these
changes so that all my changes what I
have done are applied right now once
these changes are done we can basically
go ahead and save this file so I can
just say save I can go for save as I
have different other options so so if
you would want to perform keep
performing your transformation then you
can just do this you can add a column
you can view the data so for now our
Transformations are good enough and what
we can do is we can
basically go back to home we can do a
close and apply and we will be back to
our data set which has been modified so
we can see if the data what we have has
been
transformed so we have ordered specs
here that's good we did not do any
filtering or um we have the filter left
here which basically tells me that there
are these different fields we have not
removed them but what we are doing is we
are just applying a filter to choose
copiers and Laser
Printers so that's what we have here and
this is good enough now what I can do is
once this is done I can basically save
it so I would want to call it some kind
of report if you would want to create
okay so let's call
it as
uh uh let's say
second
report and here I will say
country
and
Technology specific
info let's save
it and now basically I have saved my
data so what you can do is you can go
[Music]
for creating other report or basically
having this information published if
that that's what you want to do if you
want to go for visualization because
right now what we are seeing is we have
lot of data here we have lot of data
here it shows me there are these uh
tables or data sets which we have worked
on that shows
me here in the models but there is no
relationship with them if you go into
visualization then you don't have any
option or you have not created any
visualizations based on this data but if
you go here
now based on the data what we
transformed if you see we have order
specs right now that's what we chose we
basically have other fields so you have
ship date you have aggregated columns
which can be used for visualizing and we
can work on this so I can come back here
and what I would be interested in is
this data set is fine but I want to do
some grouping I want to basically have
some selective data in this and for that
what I can do is let's go for ship mode
now this is something what we have so we
are in this data field now we have this
transform so let's go back to transform
again and let's choose our orders so
that's the data we have and now if you
see here this
is you know huge amount of data what we
want is we want to group them based on
the shipping mode so here you have a
option called Group by so I can select
this I can go in here I can basically
work on okay get rid of duplicate values
but that's not what we want to do you
want to do a group buy so as I said you
can do a group buy from here or you can
choose from the transform option above
and you can do a group buy so let's do a
group Buy
now how do you want to group the data so
I'm saying I want to group the data here
based on shipping
mode or which is the other column you
want to use to do a group by so let's go
for shipping mode and what is the new
column name right so we want to
basically find out that you want to go
for ship mode but that's not enough I
mean I can a ship mode and I can do a
grouping byy but you want to just count
the rows no that's not what we want to
do so let's go to Advanced so ship mode
is fine so that's your grouping right
but then what we also want to do is we
want to do a grouping based
on say sales so here for example let's
go for
sales okay and what should we call this
so mightbe we can say uh
shipment
wise sales whatever you would want to
call so you can basically get the
operation do you want to really count
the rows no we want to basically do a
summing or we want to might be find out
an average price right so let's do a
sum okay and here I would want to do a
summing based on say for example sales
so so this is what I'm going to use for
getting a count of the sales now
grouping by might be we will change this
instead of
uh instead of sales we are using a ship
mode what we can also do is let's go for
a
segment and that would be valid grouping
so it will take a combination of ship
mode segmenting group the data based on
that and then get me the sales
which
is which is basically let's call it
shipment wise
sales so it gets a sum so let's do a
okay and that's my more relevant data
which I'm looking at so I'm looking at
the ship mode I'm looking at what is the
segment and then I'm looking at what is
the total sales there I'm looking at
again the ship mode standard and home
office so always remember when you are
choosing m multiple fields or multiple
columns for grouping by you are
basically
having a combination of two Fields so
that has to be unique and your grouping
is done based on that so now you're
looking at the sales wise and this is
something as an important information
what we have so we have done some
transformation and what you can do
is you can use other ways like you can
use pivote to get individual values from
it you can run on merge queries which is
basically running some merge queries and
merge the query with another query in
this workbook if you have so you can go
for this now I can basically go for
apply and close so just to add to the
group by step what we did was if you see
here I have removed the group by filter
which we just did couple of minutes back
and what I have done is instead of
transforming your complete data set you
can basically create a copy of it so for
example I can just do a copy and then I
can come here and do a paste and I have
done that and I'm calling it order
summarized but this is my complete data
now what we will do here is we will
basically go ahead and do a grouping by
again like what we did earlier based on
your shipment based based on your
segment and based on the sales so that's
what we are looking for so let's go for
the ship mode and we go for group
buy and here you would want to go for
advanced to ship mode and this one I
will go for Segment so that's fine now
we want the new column name so let's say
shipment one
sales so I want to do a summing not the
counting of rows and I want to do a
summation based on sales like what we
did earlier and then you say
okay and that basically gives you the
data here
now what we have is we have the
resultant data based on the data which
is coming in from here we did the same
thing just one minute back but we worked
on the original data set so what I did
was I created a copy and now I'm working
on this one so I'll say close and
apply and now we are back to our desktop
so it is applying these changes where we
have done some Transformations we have
done some grouping by and what we can do
is once we have the data here we can
anytime look at at our data sets or
tables so this is my original one if you
see now I have order summarized I can
just pull out this information I
basically have my returns which we have
not really touched and we have the
scientist so we have all the four data
sets here now what we can also do is
let's look into order summarized and we
just have this data here so this is is
fine and you can continue working on
this you can basically merge columns
from two different data sets and then
you can get the merged column and you
can rename it so you can obviously do
that you can basically do a
uncheck whenever you're are working on
these data sets so what you can do
is if you would want to work on
transforming for example let's go back
here and say I want to do some
transformation on it so how did we do it
we just did a
transform and you can go back to
transform so you have this data here and
the data what you have you might be
interested in transforming this into
something else and then you don't want
to maybe load this data so you have this
option where you are selecting orders
and then you have something called as
enable load which can be unchecked so
when you do a uncheck what will happen
is whatever changes you perform only
those changes related data set will be
loaded and they will still be available
but this will not affect your it will
not affect your original one so for
example let's say copy and let's go in
here I will do a paste let's say
orders oh I did a paste I need to rename
this so let's do renaming let's say
orders and here I will say
summarized and I will say
us so I'm renaming it now let that get
loaded we can perform some
Transformations on it so I have
here where is my country so let's look
for
Country yeah and let's look for Country
so here I will go for only United
States okay that's what I'm interested
in and then I can choose well I am
interested in just Central us so I can
basically go for just the central us and
I can get rid of all of these
so now I should have only Central us
data and this is fine and this is the
data might be we are focusing on right
now for doing some visualization might
be looking at sales might be looking at
the product name so you have the product
name now remember you don't see any
filters here right because the filters
are coming from the resultant set and
your transformation so if you have any
filters you would be seeing in the top
row now this is the data we have let's
uh let's not restrict it to region
region would then reduce my data but
that's good enough for us I can just say
no I'm clearing off this filter I'm
still looking at United States but I
want to look at all the regions yeah
what we would be interested in category
and that's anyways chosen as technology
which we had chosen when we were loading
the data we have copy in machines right
and we can basically keep this now this
is fine I can apply the
changes I can apply the changes based on
this one and what I can do is I can just
say for now
apply so that's going to apply all the
changes which you have done in all
orders or summary or the new one right
and what I can do is now I can choose
order and I can say don't enable this in
load so it says disabling load will
remove the table from the report and any
visuals that use its columns will be
broken we are not creating any visuals
as of now the table will be removed so
that's
fine and now I will say close and
apply so what happens is you are loading
the data based on the changes okay now
you have
your order summarized you have returns
you have scientist but you basically do
not have orders anymore so that was not
loaded so I only have this one I only
have this one
and you have returns you have scientist
you don't have the orders column right
now that particular data set was not
loaded at at all because we did not
choose that to be loaded right now while
I'm in this orders which
is let's see here and actually you can
drag in yeah so you have order summary
and this has basically kind of data
which I'm looking for so I really don't
need the orders table so you can do it
in steps and you can aggregate this you
can have aggregated data you can have
all the data which is filtered
transformed grouped by and then
basically just load it and the original
data set which you used that's no more
being loaded here now at any point of
time if I really
want I can go back to transform data and
remember it is still here it is still
here it's not gone right so you can
basically select this and you can say
enable load and you will have the data
back which you can continue working on
right so these are some quick
Transformations which really help us in
working on the data now obviously if you
have data you want to perform some left
joints right joints you have inner
joints outer joints so you can always do
that you can take two different data
sets might be I'm interested in taking
the orders summarized which talks about
standard class consumer shipment
sales and here if I look at order
summary I have other details but the
thing is we need to make sure that these
have the
values these have the values say for
example the segment column here and the
segment column here can really be used
to join these two tables so if I create
a relationship or if I create a join I
can basically merge the data so this is
how you work on data we will also see
some more examples on might be modeling
the data using some Expressions to work
on the data so we already looked at
creating a report selecting particular
fields and then publishing the report
onto your powerbi service now this is
the report which we had created which
says State order ID sales and then I
also added this returned field and that
was basically by creating a relationship
between order and returns which we can
also have a look in model so this is the
relationship which is created if you
just place your cursor here it tells me
that we have a relationship between
order ID of returns and Order ID of
orders and that basically allows me to
join the data bring it in my one report
now this is basically your data sources
you can look at and if you click on your
visualization so that shows you report
now what we can also do is we can make
it interesting now we would not want to
scroll through the fields to see
wherever or what was the order or what
was the order ID which was returned now
I can do a sorting I can filter out what
I can also do is I can use this option
which shows slicer here and that
basically allows me to work with this
data so we have this report here and
basically as I said you can click in
here it shows the data now what I can do
is I would want to filter out
information or slice the information
using your returned either being yes or
having a field which has no value how do
we do that so basically I can drag and
drop the
returned here as a field which comes
from returns now that basically shows me
only the value as yes but I do know that
there is there are some fields which are
blank now how do I add filter to this so
I can click on this one and then I can
click on slicer now once that does so it
basically pulls out all the different
values so you have either yes or you
have the blank field for returned so
what we can do is we can select yes you
will see
only the orders and their IDs and sales
where the products were returned so that
gives me8
,18 and I can select blank so that will
basically get me all the orders or
products which were not returned now
this is a simple way wherein I can add a
filter to or a slicer to my report to
basically give viewers a choice of uh
selecting different fields and you can
add any number of slicers you can
basically say I would want particular
kind of information so for example if I
go into orders and we know we have the
state now I do have the state
information here and basically I can if
I would be interested I could filter
this out in my report itself I can sort
it I can look it in a different order
what I can also do is how about bringing
in state here and basically dragging it
here so that gives me the state option
it is giving me a visual which is
basically
giving me a geographic location of all
these points so yes that can be good
what I can also do is I can keep this
which basically shows me the state map
might be it can be useful you can zoom
in you can zoom out you can look at
specific information here you can drag
and drop here so that's fine what I can
also do is I can again take the state
and bring bring it here and that
basically can be instead of my map I can
go for slicer so that gives me all the
values here and which basically allows
users to choose the fields or the states
which you would be interested in looking
at so for example if somebody is
interested in looking at the data for
Georgia just select this one and you see
the map automatically shows you where in
the map that's the place
and it shows me all the sales for
Georgia State now I can also basically
select yes and that shows me which were
the orders which were basically returned
so that gives me a quick overview of
statewise what is the geographical
location if the orders were returned or
mightbe I can just click on blank and it
shows me the non returned orders I can
again go here and uncheck the joio
option and that shows me all the states
now once you have done this this looks
like a comprehensive report which can be
useful for the viewers for your
management team and so on so we can just
do a save and that basically is saving
my report so I have this report now what
if I publish this report so I can just
to a publish and when I publish it says
okay workspace so let's say select
and then it says replacing this data set
may impact two reports you already have
a data set named by this one view the
impact I would say replace or I will say
view impact so that basically takes me
to the powerbi service because sometimes
we may have some reports which we have
already uploaded and updating an
existing report might basically affect
my existing report so it basically shows
me the impact analysis it shows me one
workspace there are two reports they
they have not been added to dashboard
but these are the ones which will get
modified so let's for example as of now
go ahead here and let's look into my
powerbi so go back to your desktop and
I'll say no I don't want to replace so
click on cancel so I do not want to
publish it what might be what I can do
is I can try saving it as a different
report so let's say save
as and now I will basically
say
additional
filters okay let's save it so now you
see the name on the top changes to
additional filters and now it's Sav to
publish this and now I can go ahead and
publish it select your
workspace and basically it says this is
the report being published with our
additional filters with a map which
gives a
geographical uh area showing us the
information and then basically what I
can do is once it is done I can look
into my powerbi service like we did
earlier you can do a filtering we can
basically query this data we can share
it with other users who might be
interested in looking at this particular
data now this says it is done so it says
get quick insights and might be it's a
good on option to look into what kind of
insights it's it gives you so click on
that see the beauty of powerbi where it
tries to search for any kind of insights
which it can gather from the kind of
report which you have built now once the
insights are ready it will let you know
what we can also do is we can come in
here click on view data set so you see
now it shows your additional filters and
here you have option where it should be
showing your report so let's say View
and view is fine so and if it doesn't
show up sometimes it might be taking
time for refreshing so you can always go
here and then you can click on your
report and that should get
populated so this is the report these
are the filters which I have gives me an
option of choosing all the states and
basically allows me to edit the report
and look at all the information here
meanwhile we can see here it is still
trying to gather some insights from the
data and now you see there are some
insights here so it says sales which is
coming up and a subset of your data was
analyzed and the following insights were
found so you're looking at sales by ship
mode so it's a standard class second
class first class and same day so there
were different shipping modes in our
data and that's what it shows me the
sales which one had the majority it
shows me the profit so which city or
state had more profits so New York City
has noticeable more profits here every
by shipping cost by subcategories so
there are these different subcategories
which we can look at such as copers and
machines have noticeably more shipping
cost profit by product name and you can
basically look at the row ID and
quantity so this is where you're looking
at a regression analysis you're looking
at row ID and quantity so there is a
correlation between row ID and quantity
so these are two different variables or
fields which are related
you're looking row ID by
category row ID so it says California
has noticeably more row IDs sales your
profit count of region and count of
returns so there is a correlation again
between two different variables average
of shipping cost now we would have taken
lot of time in building all these
visualizations but powerbi has already
helped you in gathering all these
insights and then you can basically
select which one of these is what you're
interested in you can focus and look for
more information based on all the fields
it has given you good amount of insights
which will help anyone who is looking at
this particular report so that's your
quick insights here and we have this
information now once you have this
information this is basically where you
have your focus mode so it says subset
of your data was analyzed following
insights were found you can basically
say
download and uh here you have other
options which allow you to work with
your powerbi so let's look at this one
so this is where we have our report and
we can continue exploring it
more one more interesting feature which
powerbi has other than having your
insights ready to use which is basically
in your workspace and you can basically
use these insights what we are looking
at various options here and basically
you have this option where it says spin
the visual if you are interested in a
particular Insight you can always pin it
which you can always go back and look
into what you can also do is you can
also click on edit report here now
that's a report which has already been
published
to your powerbi service not yet shared
but that can be shared or that can be
subscribed now once you click on edit
report it has option of reading View
mobile layout you have basically an
option which says basically options for
navigating through the data set you can
go for how visuals on the canvas
interact with each other you have all
these options and one of the good
options is ask a question question so
you can always click on ask a question
and that basically B
says some suggestions now you can open
this and it says okay ask a question
about your data try one of these to get
started what is the average sale sort
orders by order date sort orders by
product ID how many ship modes are there
compare quantity and discount so do not
worry that your report
has only four Fields so it has State
order ID sales and returned with some
filters but what about you looking at
how many ship modes are there so it is
already looking at your data so if you
click on this one here and you can see
what are the different fields what we
have and you have ship date and ship
mode so this is one of the fields which
it is showing you to ask a question now
what you can do is you can say how many
ship modes are there let's click on that
let's ask this question it says four
ship modes and do you want to add this
to report yes you can you can let it be
as it is so you can basically keep this
question here and here you have an
option the visual is showing number of
ship modes when you place your cursor
here if you see here turn this Q&A
result into a standard Visual and let's
do that and basically it is saying
number of ship modes right so now that's
the power of your uh bi power bi which
has basically allowed you to ask a
question and quickly add a visual to
your report now what we can do is we can
basically save this or you can say save
as and give a different name so might be
I'll just say save because I would want
to have this information and the report
is saved so in this way you can
basically not only create smart visuals
you can not only
relate different data sources using data
models or relationships you can add maps
you can add filters you can add quick
questions you can basically just go here
and say for example you would want to
ask a different question now we see the
fields here how about looking at the
shipping cost right so here I can say
um what is
the uh highest
shipping cost and that shows me some
suggestions let's select that and that
shows me the
value which is great and I can keep it
as it is I can basically convert this to
a visual I may want to keep the question
because might be this question was asked
and uh you would want to see the result
here might be you can move this
somewhere
here and that gives me some kind of
question which was asked and we can do a
save and that's my report which has been
saved in my bi service the data set is
still there you can basically go ahead
and share this Excel and PBI are both
powerful tools for data analysis but
they serve different purposes and
different testing features here are top
10 differences between Excel and powerbi
starting with the first one data
visualization and business intelligence
Excel primarily a spreadsheet tool with
basic charting and visualization
capabilities powerbi design specifically
for business intelligence and data
visualization providing more advanced
and interactive
visualizations second difference is data
modeling and relationships Excel
supports basic data modeling but
creating and managing relationships
between tables can be more manual and
less intuitive on the other hand powerbi
it offers a robust data modeling
environment with easy to create
relationships between tables making it
more suitable for complex data
models the third difference between the
both is data import and transformation
Excel data import and transformation are
possible but can be more manual and less
scalable for large data sets now PBI PBI
has advanced capabilities for data
import transformation and cleaning
through Power query providing a more
scalable and automated approach fourth
difference is data refresh and scheduled
updates Excel data refresh is more
manual and may require manual
intervention powerbi powerbi allows for
scheduled data refreshes ensuring that
reports and dashboards are automatically
updated with the latest data fifth
difference between the both is sharing
and collaboration sharing can be done
through file attachments but
collaboration features are limited in
Excel powerbi built for sharing and
collaboration with cloud-based sharing
options and the ability to publish
reports to the powerbi service for
broader access the sixth feature is RO
level security Excel it has limited
support for RO level security on the
other hand for powerbi it provides
robust Ro level security features
allowing you to control access to data
at a granual level based on user roles
now the seventh difference between the
both is integration with external data
sources Excel Excel can connect to
various data sources but may require
additional steps for complex
Integrations next is PBI PBI offers
seamless integration with a wide range
of external data sources including
databases cloud services and online
services now the E difference is custom
visuals and Marketplace Excel
visualizations are somewhat limited and
there is no centralized Marketplace for
additional visuals on the other hand we
have PBI PBI has a Marketplace for
custom visuals allowing users to access
and integrate a wide range of additional
visualizations created by the community
now the ninth difference between the
both as data storytelling Excel has
limited capabilities for creating
interactive and dynamic data stories on
the other hand powerbi it includes
features for creating compiling data
stores with interactive elements making
it easier to communicate insights now
the last difference between the both is
scalability Excel while suitable for
smaller data set it may struggle with
handling large and complex data
sets on the other hand Pi is engineered
for scalability making it more efficient
in handling large volumes of data and
providing better performance in
scenarios involving big
data in summary while Excel is a
versatile tool for General data analysis
and Reporting powerbi is specialized for
business intelligence offering more
advanced features for data modeling
visualization and collaboration the
choice between them depends on the
specific needs of your analysis and
Reporting tasks now let's discuss the
pros and cons of excel advantages or
Pros Excel is user friendly and has a
user friendly interface as well Excel is
Excel has a familiar and user-friendly
interface making it accessible to users
with varying levels of expertise most
people are already familiar with basic
spreadsheet operations second Advantage
is versatility Excel is a versatile for
a wide range of tasks including data
analysis Financial modeling budgeting
and Model Management and project
management budgeting and project
management it supports various functions
and features to accommodate different
needs third one is formula and function
capabilities Excel offers a robust set
of formulas and functions that allow
users to perform complex calculations
and Analysis users can create custom
formulas and automate calculations fifth
Advantage is data visualization Excel
provides basic charting and graphing
capabilities allowing users to create
visual representations of data this
helps in conveying information more more
efficiently and effectively and making
data driven decisions fifth one is as of
data access and
entry Excel makes it easy to enter
organize and manipulate data users can
quickly input data into cells creating
tables and use features like data
validation to ensure data
accuracy now let us discuss the cons or
disadvantages of excel starting with
limited data size and performance Excel
can struggle with large data sets or
complex calculations performance May
degrade and the software may become slow
when handling extensive data leading to
limitations and scalability manual data
updates is a second one data updates and
refreshes are often manual processes in
Excel this can lead to errors and
outdated information especially in
situations where data changes frequently
third disadvantages lack of centralized
data storage Excel files are typically
stored on local machines which can lead
to Version Control issues there's a risk
of working with outdated versions of
files and it can be challenging to
maintain a centralized and up to dat
data
set fourth one is limited collaboration
features while Excel allows for sharing
of files real-time collaboration is
limited multiple users can't really
easily work on the same file
simultaneously which can hinder
collaboration in team settings now the
fifth one is security concerns Excel
files May lack robot security features
and sensitive information can be
vulnerable if proper precautions are not
taken access control and data encryption
are not as advanced as in specialized
business intelligence tools like BBI and
T now let us discuss the important
advantages and disadvantages or pros and
cons of powerbi starting with advantages
first one is Advanced Data visualization
ations Pap Pi excels in data
visualization offering a wide range of
sophisticated charts graphs and
interactive dashboards second one is
robus data modeling powerbi provides a
powerful data modeling environment with
features like relationships calculated
columns and measures third one is
seamless data integration powerbi
seamlessly integrates with a variety of
data sources including databases cloud
services and online platforms fourth one
is realtime data refresh powerbi allows
for scheduled dat data refreshes
ensuring that reports and dashboards are
automatically updated with the latest
data fifth one is collaboration and
sharing powerbi is designed for
collaboration and it can integrate with
cloud-based sharing options now let us
discuss the disadvantages of powerbi
starting with learning curve PBI has a
steeper learning curve compared to basic
spreadsheet tools like Excel second one
is cost while powerbi offers a free
version more advanced features and
capabilities are available only in power
Pi Pro which comes with a subscription
cost third one is dependency on internet
connection powerbi relies on internet
connection especially for sharing and
accessing reports through the powerbi
service model now fourth one is limited
offline functionality while powerp
allows users to download and work with
reports offline to some extent certain
features and interactivity may be
limited when disconnected from internet
now the last disadvantage which is about
security and compliance concerns
organizations handling sensitive data
may have specific security and
compliance requirements while power
provides security features organizations
need to carefully configure and manage
access to ensure compliance with their
policies so with that we have reached
our third Milestone these three tools
when combined form a powerful Arsenal
for business analyst each has its
strengths and mastering all these three
allows you to efficiently handle any
data challenge that comes your way so we
call it a r and with that we are at the
