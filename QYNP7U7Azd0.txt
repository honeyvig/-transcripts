1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,399
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,639
tutorial my name is hry backy this time

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,240
we're going to be going over something a

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,559
bit different recursion and this time

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,400
using the example of

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
factorials uh and so uh again today

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,080
we're going to be talking about

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,680
recursion uh and so today we're going to

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,640
be doing something again a bit different

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,119
we're not going to be using apps we're

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,880
going to be using playgrounds uh so

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,519
anyway I'm still going to label it under

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,480
iOS apps just because it becomes easier

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
and I don't have a million different

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,160
playlists uh but they are classified

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
under iOS apps and this is technically

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,879
an algorithm because we're teaching you

18
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,719
how to get the factorial of something uh

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,559
using recursion not using recursion and

20
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:46,840
sort of using

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,960
recursion anyway let's get started today

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,600
uh with finding my marker anyway so now

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,960
that I have it uh let's get started with

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,399
first of all what in the world is

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,280
recursion well cursion simply put is

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,920
just recurring repeating it's just

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,400
calling something over and over again

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,080
for example if you have function called

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,920
um factorial and within that function

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,240
you call itself making an eternal Loop

31
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,960
that's considered recursion however I'm

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,759
going to be teaching you not how to

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,960
crash your computer not how to create an

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,079
internal Loop but instead how to create

35
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,040
a loop by calling a function over over

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,680
and over again within itself but then

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,640
stopping at a point and then returning a

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,360
value so let's get started by asking

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,880
another question what in the world is a

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,880
factorial well let's get started first

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,040
of all what's the operator for factorial

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,360
hint math because I have to put math

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,439
into everything anyway the operator for

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,719
a factorial is actually an exclamation

45
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,240
mark uh and so actually bit thicker you

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,799
probably can't see that on camera there

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,439
and now if I were to find something like

48
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,719
four is

49
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,640
factorial I would just put the number

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,960
four in front of

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,040
it four factorial and so all this

52
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,519
equal how do we calculate a factorial I

53
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,760
don't understand well you'll find out

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
right as I write this

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,000
down that's the factorial of four 4 * 3

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
* 2 * 1 and so you must understand the

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,920
point of a factorial now it's taking

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
number

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,519
n multiplying it by each number that

60
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,440
comes in between it till the number one

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
and so in the case of number four it's 4

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,959
3 2 and 1 so 4 * 3 * 2 1 so first let's

63
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,560
do it this order so 2 * 1 we know that's

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,920
2 2 * 3 we know that's 6 4 * 6 we know

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
that's 24 and so we can theoretically

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,959
say that 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 is

67
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,319
24 and so we know that the factorial of

68
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,560
four can successfully be identified as

69
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,840
24 now why exactly would we use this in

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
the first place well let's take this

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,159
down a step let's see what uh three's

72
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,519
factorial is for example so

73
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,120
3's

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,920
factorial 3's

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,319
factorial now how would we find this out

76
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,200
again 3 * 2 * 1 which I'll just write

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,799
down one more

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,560
time we know 2 * 1 is uh 2 and we know

79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,920
that 3 * 2 is of course

80
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,239
6 and so we can say that 3 is factorial

81
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,599
is

82
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,519
six now let's just write down the

83
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,280
numbers 1 2 and three or to make it

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,680
simpler a b and

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,159
c so we have

86
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,120
a b and

87
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,280
c okay now how all can we arrange these

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
letters or what are the possible

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
permutations of this

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,079
set in this case let's get started it's

91
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,160
going to be

92
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
ABC a

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
CB B

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,400
CA B c a

95
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
c

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,240
CBA and C

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,160
AB now these are all the possible

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,160
permutations for a b c if you were to

99
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,240
swap these out with numbers 1 2 3 one

100
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,600
like 1 2 and three then you would have 1

101
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,440
2 3 1 3 2 etc etc but let's just count

102
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,080
this for a second there's one possible

103
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,759
permutation two possible permutation 3 4

104
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,240
5 6 oh what a coincidence this must not

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,680
even matter well the um apparently

106
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,880
factorial for three is six and the

107
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
possible permutations for it are six as

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,240
well what a coincidence well it's not

109
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,960
because that's what factorials are used

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,360
for factorials are used to find out the

111
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,160
possible permutations of a

112
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,520
set

113
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,360
so we can see that if we were to do this

114
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,560
with any number four is factorial 5 6 7

115
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,240
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 or even

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,720
19 or even 20 any

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
number is any number is factorial will

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,880
be the amount of permutations you can

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
give it give

120
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,000
it and so now that we know this much

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,639
let's continue really

122
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,720
quickly and so you might be wondering

123
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
actually you aren't wondering this

124
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
because I haven't told you this

125
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,080
already however I'm going to tell you

126
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,400
something a bit

127
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,440
shocking which you may have not

128
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,240
known which

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,240
is

130
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,599
that watch

131
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,440
this On's factorial

132
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,560
is equal to Z's

133
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,000
factorial which is equal to

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
one I'll just write that a bit

135
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,199
bigger how is this

136
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,479
possible well let's take this a step

137
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,400
back what are the possible permutations

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,479
of the set with one in

139
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,319
it well might not seem obvious at first

140
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,039
but there is one

141
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,039
permutation which is to do nothing keep

142
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,479
one in its place

143
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,520
so that counts as a permutation because

144
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,120
as you saw we counted a b c as a

145
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,000
permutation that was still in place so

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,080
why can't this be counted as permutation

147
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,599
H and so according to that

148
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,800
theory the uh factorial of one should be

149
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,080
one however zero how does this work so

150
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,479
these are the possible permutations for

151
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,160
zero just a blank thing because of

152
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
course it's

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,400
zero now what are the possible things

154
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,680
that I can do to this set well I can do

155
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,840
one thing keep it in place again and so

156
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,440
we can successfully say that Zero's

157
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,319
factorial should in theory be one which

158
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,319
is equal to one's

159
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,800
factorial and so now that you know that

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,639
you are completely equipped with the

161
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,000
knowledge for

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,879
factorials now that you know about

163
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,800
factorials nothing's left but to go to

164
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
the Mac part uh and so oh one more thing

165
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
before you continue on your quest is

166
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,840
what about

167
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,800
this -4

168
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,199
factorial well first of all let's break

169
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,080
this down into steps in order to find a

170
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,759
negative numbers

171
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,800
factorial take the

172
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,919
negative write a bracket then the

173
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,440
factorial part then another

174
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,520
bracket what does this do exactly well

175
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
that's telling us that we solve for

176
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,479
Four's um factorial and then give it a

177
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,080
negative

178
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,560
value and so we know that four is

179
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,120
factorial is equal to

180
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,160
24 now if we were to

181
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,160
take

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,560
24 we would actually quite actually

183
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,480
negative of positive 24 if you watch my

184
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,360
integer series I you know what I'm

185
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,519
talking about the link will be down in

186
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,399
the description and also on the screen

187
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,320
right

188
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,320
now and now it's gone uh but so

189
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,839
now negative and positive is equal to

190
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,200
negative so the net answer will be -4

191
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
and theoretically we should be able to

192
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
say that

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,920
-4 factorial is -4

194
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:36,920
and so that actually completes your

195
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,320
knowledge for

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,600
factorials anyway now I'm going to be

197
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,640
joining you in the Mac part where I will

198
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,480
be creating an implementation for this

199
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,160
in Swift using not using non- recursion

200
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,240
a little recursion but still keeping it

201
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,040
readable and no readability at all so

202
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,839
yeah it's going to be pretty interesting

203
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,560
uh so stick around to the Mac part in

204
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,920
which you will learn how to create your

205
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,640
own recursion sort

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,440
of program for factorials and then you

207
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,560
can apply it to any pretty much any

208
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,000
other algorithm or function you want so

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,760
let's get to

210
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,240
it so welcome back to the Mac part now

211
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,839
that we're at the Mac part let's

212
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,040
actually give a demonstration of how you

213
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,720
would do a classic sort of way of

214
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,480
finding the factorial now classically

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,920
wouldn't use recursion so we're not

216
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,279
going to use recursion this is going to

217
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,440
be the longest method and first I'm just

218
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,399
going to show you a barebone of how this

219
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,480
will work so let's get started by

220
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
creating a function uh named

221
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
factorial uh and let's just say that

222
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
this is not recursive uh and let's take

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,120
it take a number to factorial uh as a

224
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,720
number as an integer uh and return an

225
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,800
integer uh inside of here we're going to

226
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,519
do a few things like uh let's just

227
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,320
create the result variable so we have

228
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,240
something to return and let's just

229
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,639
return

230
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,160
this sometimes I hate Alex code takes a

231
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,240
bit of time yeah that was not supposed

232
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,200
to happen okay perfect uh and then next

233
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,560
let's just declare a limit for our while

234
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,000
loop uh and next what we want to do is

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
take our number over here and change it

236
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,240
to a variable you'll see why in just a

237
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,279
minute next we're going to create a

238
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,120
while

239
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,440
loop uh for while num the number that

240
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,920
they gave us in the parameter is not

241
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,639
equal to to our limit meaning it'll keep

242
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,360
going we just decrement our number and

243
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,360
say that our result times equals that

244
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,440
number now first of all I'm just going

245
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,680
to show you that it works after I show

246
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,839
you how it works I'll explain in depth

247
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,720
and explain some of the limitations as

248
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,279
well so let's see this as well let's see

249
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,680
this right now so factorial NR and let's

250
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,360
just get the factorial for four as you

251
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,000
can see first of all let's just

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,880
Spotlight it so if I do four exclamation

253
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,920
mark or exclamation mark uh we see we

254
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,399
should be getting 24 and we do and so

255
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,519
this

256
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,959
means if I open up here we get 24 and so

257
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,600
this means that our factorial function

258
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,000
is working we can even do five and if we

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,160
Spotlight

260
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,199
it 120 and we get

261
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,000
120 I can do it for six 7 8 9 10 11 up

262
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,480
to like a lot of

263
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,880
numbers however

264
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,399
what we can't do is something like

265
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,399
this and then we just go into an eternal

266
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,079
Loop of Despair and so in order to stop

267
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,800
this eternal Loop all we do is we make a

268
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,120
simple conditional before we even start

269
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,560
our function we just want to come over

270
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,920
here and say if our number is equal to

271
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,600
zero or our number is equal to one then

272
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
just immediately return one don't even

273
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,440
do anything and now if I give it a zero

274
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,600
don't worry about that error it's a

275
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,600
ghost err perfect we get the result one

276
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,120
it doesn't go into internal Loop of

277
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,959
Despair uh and so now next what we have

278
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,959
to do is something like um I have an

279
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,920
idea what if we were to give

280
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,440
it4 again it just realizes that hey I'm

281
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,040
never going to stop looping so I should

282
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,600
just give us a give an

283
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,480
exception and so in order to combat this

284
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,320
we have to do something like um okay

285
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,639
let's do this of first of all let's

286
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,720
create a flag and let's just check if

287
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,399
our uh number is

288
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,399
negative uh and we're going to check

289
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,279
this by saying if our number is less

290
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:52,360
than zero then it is or else it is

291
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,000
not okay so now we know if our number is

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,480
negative but we still aren't doing

293
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,519
anything about it and so in order to do

294
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,360
something about it what we need to do is

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,079
we have to say number is equal to first

296
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,759
of all we have to check is our number

297
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,120
negative if it is it's equal to uh the

298
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,399
absolute value of this number or else

299
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,839
it's just equal to the

300
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,240
number and so this will turn it into a

301
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,880
positive number now as you can see

302
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,480
already we see that it isn't going into

303
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,839
an internal loop it's just giving us

304
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,600
24 which is the factorial for positive4

305
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,360
however if you see this 4 is factorial

306
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,279
24-4 is factorial -4 I can do the same

307
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,440
thing with five 5's factorial is 120

308
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,680
Nega 5's factorial is- 120 and so what

309
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,600
this means is that a numbers a negative

310
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,399
numbers factorial is equal to a positive

311
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,480
numbers

312
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,560
factorial negated or actually put a

313
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,639
negative in front of it if you don't

314
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,519
know what that means and so in order to

315
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
do this when we're turning we just say

316
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,440
okay was our number negative in the

317
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,399
beginning okay if it was return our

318
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,680
negative result or else just return our

319
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,199
normal result and this should give us -4

320
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,399
and it

321
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,279
does and so now we've built a function

322
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,320
uh which does not use recursion uh and

323
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,800
it solves our purpose of finding a

324
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,199
factorial uh it can do negatives zero

325
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,399
one and any positive

326
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,440
now there's just one problem with this

327
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,480
it's way too long and it's adding too

328
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,880
much mess to your

329
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,399
code now how can we solve

330
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,319
this in order to solve this all we

331
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,720
really have to do is use something

332
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,839
called recursion there are two ways to

333
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,720
use

334
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,920
recursion one is just a nicely readable

335
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,440
uh sort of long uh nice way to do

336
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,440
recursion and then there's a type where

337
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,199
this is completely almost unreadable

338
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,639
unless you're an expert

339
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,360
programmer and it's just a oneline

340
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,959
program and so let's do both but first

341
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,600
I'm going to show you the medium way

342
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
then I'll show you the really short

343
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,199
oneliner way so let's get started by

344
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,720
creating um a function uh this is going

345
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,560
to be named

346
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,920
factorial with recursion but it's a bit

347
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,240
longer

348
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,680
method and we're going to again take a

349
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,480
number as an integer and we're going to

350
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,759
return an integer

351
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,319
uh and then we can do stuff like so now

352
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,199
what's going to happen is let's say we

353
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,519
give it factorial for the number four

354
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,040
it'll say four times the factorial for

355
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,360
three okay 3 times the factorial of two

356
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,759
okay 2 * a factorial of one and it'll

357
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,560
keep going until it finds the correct

358
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,279
answer if you don't get what I mean yet

359
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,839
don't worry because I'm about to explain

360
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,800
it so let's just move my head over here

361
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,160
for a second uh and so now what I'm

362
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,600
going to do is I'm going to explain how

363
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,240
exactly you can use recursion in a

364
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,480
longer method inside of function to find

365
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,959
a factorial and the simplest way you

366
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,160
could do this is say okay let's just

367
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
declare a result variable and set it to

368
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,520
two our current number times the

369
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,640
factorial for our number

370
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,160
minus1 and then we just return the

371
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,320
result

372
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,480
seems simple right it should

373
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,400
work however if I call it as you can see

374
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,799
right now it

375
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,160
again should go into an eternal

376
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,400
Loop uh sorry about that uh and so

377
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,760
what's happening now is Swift will

378
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
realize very quickly that this is just

379
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,360
going to keep repeating and repeating

380
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,880
and repeating over again so it doesn't

381
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,919
give us an exception but it gives us an

382
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
exception and it does not recurse over

383
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,400
and over again it just gives us an

384
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,720
exception

385
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
in order to solve this we have to see

386
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
why it's

387
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,120
happening well let's just take a look

388
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,280
first of all in order to find the

389
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,799
factorial of four we have to find four *

390
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,400
the factorial of 3 in order to find the

391
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
factorial of three we have to do 3 * the

392
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,000
factorial of

393
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,600
2 then in order to find the factorial of

394
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
two we have to do two * a factorial of

395
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
one but then there's one aspect we

396
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,039
didn't look at here wouldn't this just

397
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,760
keep going on till negative negative

398
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,559
Infinity yes and that's why I call this

399
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,320
new thing that I'm about to teach you

400
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,360
the barrier of

401
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,919
recursion what this barrier of recursion

402
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,280
will do is it'll make sure that our

403
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,120
function stops calling itself at a

404
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,400
certain point which in this case will be

405
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,240
when the number is equal to one and

406
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,799
it'll start back tracing each function

407
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,600
until it gets to the first one and now

408
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,480
in order to do this we just have to keep

409
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,039
on checking each time this function is

410
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,400
called if our number is equal to zero or

411
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,200
one and why did I say zero well let's

412
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,159
just kill two words with one stone and

413
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,120
let's just check if the user entered

414
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,039
zero or one or if our function got to

415
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,640
one so in order to do this we just do

416
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,240
the exact same thing as we did in our

417
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,520
older function which is if number is

418
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,720
equal to zero or the number is equal to

419
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,320
one then just immediately return one and

420
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,840
now as you can see it should give us the

421
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,600
correct answer 24 as you can see this is

422
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,240
a drastic improvement I think five to

423
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,640
six lines for the last one three lines

424
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,039
for this one so that's a pretty nice

425
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,120
Improvement but there are still a few

426
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,799
limitations for

427
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,039
example negative

428
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,760
numbers if I were to give it a negative

429
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,520
number again it just uh doesn't work and

430
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,679
so in order to uh fix this what we have

431
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,120
to do so first of all yeah as you can

432
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,400
see it went into an eternal loop again

433
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,600
in order to solve this first of all what

434
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,000
we have to

435
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,240
do is check if our number over here is

436
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,200
greater than zero if it is then we just

437
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,480
want to do the regular thing that we

438
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,240
were always doing however if it isn't we

439
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,320
want to positive out our

440
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
number by doing the number times we know

441
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,880
that this is a negative number we and so

442
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
we need to times it by another negative

443
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,360
number in order to make it

444
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,400
positive once we we make it positive we

445
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,440
can solve for that positive um uh number

446
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,640
once we solve for the positive number we

447
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,039
can negate it and return it in order to

448
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,640
do this all we have to do is we have to

449
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,480
instead of doing number times

450
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,280
factorial number times the negative fact

451
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,120
torial and you won't understand this yet

452
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,360
or maybe you will we're giving it

453
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,640
negative number minus one now what does

454
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,559
this mean basically what we're doing is

455
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,880
we're saying number times the negative

456
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,799
factorial of the positive number minus

457
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,200
one sounds a bit complicated it sort of

458
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,240
is but it should work and as we can see

459
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,320
we get 24 which is not the right answer

460
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,200
and I purposely tricked you to see if

461
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,320
you paying attention and so the reason

462
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,080
this won't work is because we're just

463
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,840
returning the positive result we're not

464
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,320
negating it then returning the result in

465
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,159
order to negate this we can again just

466
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,480
check if our number is greater than zero

467
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,320
then just return our result however if

468
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,279
it's not then return our negative result

469
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,840
and as you can see it gives us

470
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,080
-4 and that concludes this uh little

471
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,159
function however I just going to take a

472
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,880
look at one more thing which may just

473
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,080
work because the reason we're uh

474
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,480
negating negating the um factorial yeah

475
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,279
that worked as well so as you can see

476
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,120
this is a bit more understandable way of

477
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,799
doing it so essentially we're taking the

478
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,919
absolute value of our number so

479
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,840
basically positive number times the

480
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,440
factorial of our positive number again

481
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,679
so I can again say absolute value minus

482
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,080
one uh and so I guess what I could do

483
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,520
here

484
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,720
this could theoretically work and then

485
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,559
if I just do

486
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,760
this yeah so this is a even shorter way

487
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,159
of doing this uh and to be honest this

488
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,960
does save uh quite a lot of uh space uh

489
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,520
and as you can see using just this much

490
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,320
code you are able to find that factorial

491
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,520
and so simply what it's doing is it's

492
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,039
finding the absolute value of the number

493
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,440
meaning if it's negative make it

494
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,240
positive if it's positive keep it

495
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,000
positive times the factorial of the

496
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,520
absolute value of the number again

497
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,120
negative positive positive

498
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,080
positive minus

499
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,760
one and then once we find the answer of

500
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,320
the positive no matter what a result we

501
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,799
are checking if our number was greater

502
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,080
than zero good turn return the result or

503
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,679
else negate the result then

504
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,480
return however I believe there is a

505
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,279
smaller way to do this maybe even in

506
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,720
just one

507
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,799
line in order to do this let's create

508
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,279
another

509
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,000
function let's just call this function

510
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,360
um

511
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,200
factorial with recursion short now again

512
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
uh I mean it's not required for you to

513
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,080
use this method because of course this

514
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,360
is hardly readable and if your program

515
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,000
is going to be open source for beginner

516
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
programmers I would not recommend doing

517
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,559
this but if it's just for you and you're

518
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,960
just whipping up something really

519
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,480
quickly and you don't want really long

520
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,919
code then this is amazing for

521
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,760
you watch this we just need to and look

522
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,679
at this for a second all we're doing

523
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,320
here is conditionals there's an if

524
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,240
statement then there's a variable which

525
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,080
is full of a full of just uh stuff that

526
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,640
we're returning

527
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,120
anyway and so we can

528
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,120
put

529
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,399
essentially we could just say um

530
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,039
actually I'm not going to do that yet

531
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,000
but if you see this function it's just

532
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,559
all conditionals why not take those

533
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,880
conditionals and Stitch them into one

534
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,360
line not using

535
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,559
semicolons but you'll see how in just a

536
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,679
second so basically just immediately

537
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,440
return we're not going to do anything

538
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,279
else okay just immediately

539
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,240
return but then we just want to check is

540
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,000
our number equal to zero or is our

541
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,360
number equal to one if it's any of

542
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,159
those then we just want to return one or

543
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,760
else we want to

544
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,360
return first of all we have to check if

545
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,240
our number is greater than

546
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,360
zero then we just want to return our

547
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,960
normal number times uh

548
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,600
factorial number minus one however if it

549
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,679
is

550
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,640
not then we have to return the negative

551
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,159
of whatever we put here the reason I put

552
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,760
negative of is because over here we have

553
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,360
time to actually negate the result using

554
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,039
a conditional in the return statement

555
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,559
however here we don't have time for

556
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,039
another line and so we do it on the Fly

557
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:55,399
while we're doing this and so it's just

558
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:58,480
returning the negative value of of

559
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,159
whatever I just explained in factorial

560
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,159
with the recursion but long method now

561
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,960
I'll explain this in a bit more in depth

562
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,039
but first let's try it out so you know

563
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:12,360
it works factorial wrs let's give it a

564
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,200
four handles four is amazing 24 done

565
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,720
let's give it a

566
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,880
five 120 amazing let's give it um a

567
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,399
zero one let's give it a

568
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:31,039
one one let's give it a

569
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,039
-44 -4 amazing now let's do

570
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,039
uh5

571
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,399
-20 and that's how this function works

572
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,080
so it's checking if our numbers are

573
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,279
equal to zero or one if they are just

574
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,399
return one then we're checking if our

575
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:54,360
number is greater than zero if it is do

576
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,720
our classic number times factorial

577
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,559
number minus one method

578
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,000
however if it's

579
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,440
not return the negative of the absolute

580
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,559
value of our number times the

581
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,840
factorial H sorry just make this the

582
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,200
short method so it's

583
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,679
faster of the absolute value of our

584
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,520
number minus

585
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,080
one and so that'll return a positive

586
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,080
result which we then

587
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,240
negate and that's just the simplest way

588
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,320
we could do that and and that also

589
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,399
concludes this uh and also one more time

590
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,360
uh this recursion stuff takes up a lot

591
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,159
of memory and I've even seen some

592
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,960
programming languages don't allow you to

593
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,399
do recursion uh and so this is because

594
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,519
it takes so much memory uh but nowadays

595
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,159
we don't really care about this because

596
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,960
we have so much memory before uh if if

597
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,519
you were to just go back a few hundred

598
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,240
years and just say okay here's a

599
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,159
computer with 8 GB of RAM just 8 gab

600
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,240
they would go crazy because that's a lot

601
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,720
lot of RAM for a time that only has a

602
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,600
few megabytes of Ram uh and so uh back

603
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,840
then that would be a really big concern

604
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,360
that okay how are we going to conserve

605
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,840
memory well don't use recursion simplest

606
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,960
method uh but nowadays we have like

607
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,120
gigabytes and gigabytes of memory so we

608
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,960
don't need to really care that much uh

609
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,600
but again if you're looking for your

610
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,600
program to be fast down to the

611
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,760
millisecond then don't use recursion but

612
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
again they're so fast now that we don't

613
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,960
need that anyway I'm not going to

614
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,799
elaborate on that this video isn't

615
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,760
really talking about speed uh and just

616
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,960
one more thing recursion in memory

617
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,720
actually uses Stacks in case you didn't

618
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,399
know or you wanted to know it uses

619
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:44,200
Stacks so it builds up lots of recursive

620
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,039
functions right as it gets to that

621
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:48,080
barrier that barrier of recursion that I

622
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,159
talked about uh it comes back down and

623
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:53,320
again only a few programming languages

624
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,159
use that stacking sort of thing and

625
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,679
recursions and yeah and and that's going

626
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,799
to conclude our video for today I hope

627
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,360
