hello everyone and welcome to simply
learns youtube channel
today in this video we will discuss
everything about validation in
javascript we'll start this video with
regular expressions in javascript we'll
go through certain different topics like
meta characters character sets and
ranges and shorthand character class
then we'll move on to form validation in
javascript and we will see how regular
expressions are used to validate a
user's input in javascript so before we
begin make sure that you have subscribed
to a youtube channel and press that bell
icon to never miss an update from simply
learn so without any further delay let's
get started have you guys ever heard
about validation or pattern matching in
javascript we come across these terms
when we hear about passwords mostly
right so we say that we can use the if
else statement to match if the user's
password matches with the one we already
have for that we write if password is
equal to is equals to some sort of
string or characters and then we see if
the password matches will let the user
enter otherwise the entry will be denied
so we are discussing all that because
regular expressions are objects used to
perform pattern matching or if we want
to search for something in a string or
even if we want to replace something
from a string we can do it all with
regular expressions
so we'll go through the syntax for
regular expressions and some more
important things about regular
expressions in javascript so regular
expressions are present in almost every
programming language it's not limited to
javascript only and the concept remains
the same everywhere the syntax may
differ a bit between different languages
but the logic behind them will always be
the same the name might be a little bit
confusing but
the reality is entirely different they
are pretty easy to use and if you
understand the basics clearly you'll
face no problem while working on
advanced topics
so let's go through the regular
expressions before we move on to
validations using regular expressions in
javascript so let's understand the
concept entirely so that it will be easy
for you guys in further videos so
consider a scenario where we have a
string and we want to find a particular
word in that string or we can say we are
in a static website i hope you guys are
aware of the term static where we have
the search option to find some word in
the entire html document we have to
write the word in the search box and it
will return us the location of that word
in the html file or in the website
right what we'll do now is we'll use a
word and we'll find that word in a
string will make some changes to that
word with the help of several functions
used along with regular expressions in
javascript so the syntax for regular
expressions goes like this we'll move to
a javascript file and we'll take a
variable here so let's say the variable
is where
rejects
and we use two forward slashes for it
generally we use the double slash for
comments but it will be recognized as a
regular expression in javascript if we
write something inside these double
slashes so let's say we are writing
something here let's say we write here
hello
now
this word hello is present inside the
variable rejects and this word needs to
be searched in a string
so let's use a string as well so for
that we'll write here
where let's say the string name is str1
let's say we are writing here
welcome
to a
youtube
channel
full stop
say hello
if
you are new here
fine so let's say this is the string we
have
now this string contains the word hello
in it all we have to keep in mind is to
add the main keyword in the string for
now
moving ahead what we want to do is we
want to find this word in the string
right we want to find this hello world
in this string
so next up we'll go through certain
essential functions which we use with
regular expressions and we'll see the
functioning of these essential functions
the first function is the exact function
so let me write here guys
this is the first function exec
function
now this function returns an array if
the word is present in this string
otherwise it will return null if the
word is not present in the string the
syntax is pretty straightforward all we
have to do is to use the exact function
with the variable that contains the
regular expression now in this case the
word rejects contains the regular
expression we have to use it with the
function and the string name will be
passed as a parameter to this function
so
let's write the syntax here and it will
be easy for you guys so let's comment it
out
and we'll write here let's say we are
taking another variable where output
will write here the
variable name
dot function name will write here exec
and the string will be passed as a
parameter fine
so this is the syntax now this output
variable over here will have an array
and the array will return the index
number of the word hello industry
fine so let's print this array on the
console and we'll write here
console.log
output fine
save it and open the console so we will
move to a browser and we'll open console
here
see here we have an array and if we
click on this array we can see that we
have
the word hello at index 36 so if we
count from here and the counting should
start from 0 because error index always
starts from 0 so at index 36 we can find
that hello is over here and so it will
return the index of this particular word
now
if we write here something else other
than hello let's say we are writing here
2 save it now and you can see here we
have 2 present at index 8 so if we count
from here we can see that 2 is present
at index 8 so this is working totally
fine now another scenario is if we write
here 2 with a capital t save it now and
you can see here the output is null
why so because regular expressions in
javascript are case sensitive case
sensitive means it differentiates
between the capital letters and small
letters fine
but the good part is we can make them in
case sensitive as well so all we have to
do is we have to use a modifier a
modifier is actually used to make
modifications in the search so what we
have to do is we have to write here in
the beginning we have to write a single
letter and in this case we'll write here
i because this modifier will tell the
system that there will be no problem
with the case sensitivity of the word
now it will work fine and if we save
this program
we can see we have the output as index 8
now if we change this string and we'll
write here something other than this so
we'll write here h e
l o but
the three letters of this word are
capital letters
so save it now and you can see we have
the output as
index 36 so this is working fine now one
last situation is if we write here more
than one hello in a single string so if
we write here hello and welcome to our
youtube channel now there are two hello
words present in a single string save it
and you can see we have the word hello
at index 0 so it will return the first
hello world in the string now if we want
to get access of the second hello and
for if we write here this piece of code
again what we are expecting is we are
expecting it
to give us the index of second hello as
well but it will not happen save it and
you can see it will give the index of
first hello twice you can see here we
have index as 0 in both the areas right
so it will not work
now the solution to this problem is
modifiers again what we have to do is we
have to use another modifier here now we
have to write here the letter g and save
it
now this is returning null because we
have
the string wrong here so we have to
write here hello because we have removed
the in case sensitive modifier save it
now and you can see we have both the
hello words with indexes as 0 and 46
respectively so this global modifier
tells the system that the word is now
global and if you find the word once and
the user tries the exact function again
then the second time you should return
the index value of the second word
so this is how it actually works now the
following function we are going to
discuss is a pretty simple one the test
function
now this function returns either true or
false nothing else
this function checks for a particular
word that if the word exists in a string
then it will return true otherwise false
it will not return the index value or
some sort of other things
it deals with the boolean value only
that is true or false so that's it for
the function let's see how this function
work
actually so what we'll do is we'll
mention here this test function
and will
comment this piece of code
so that there will be no
confusion
we'll comment it out
now we'll go through the syntax of this
test function
the syntax is pretty easy we'll use the
output variable again
and we'll write here
variable name dot function name and the
string name will be passed as a
parameter
now the next thing we'll do is we'll
write here console.log
and we'll print this on a
console
fine so this is the syntax for test
function
save it
and here you can see in the console that
for the word hello it returns true if we
change this word here to something else
like if we write here hi instead of
hello
save it and you can see the output is
changed to false because high is not
there inside a string right because
height does not exist according to this
history
so this is how the test function
actually work now one more thing i want
to mention here about the test function
is if we write here some part of a word
not the whole word but some part so
let's say if we write here
e l
now this is the part of hello world now
what if we save this you can see the
output here is true that's because the
test function checks for every letter
and if it finds these three letters in
any word it will return true in that
case as well fine next up we have
another function to use with the regular
expressions in javascript now the next
function's name is match function
i'll write it here
first i'll comment these two statements
and then i'll write here the name of
this function so the name is match now
this match function returns an array of
results otherwise null the syntax for
this function is exactly opposite from
the previous functions
because we'll pass the regular
expression as a parameter to this
function now and the function will be
used along with the string
so
it is completely opposite to
the syntax we used for the previous two
functions so we'll write here for this
we'll use the output variable again
we'll write here where output
and
instead of rejects we'll use it with the
string so we'll write here str1 dot
match
and
the variable name will be passed as a
parameter fine
so this is how the syntax for match
function looks like it's exactly
opposite to the syntax we used for
previous two functions the next line
will remain the same we'll write here
console.log and will print
output on a screen fine now we have to
do one more thing here what's that is we
have to remove this modifier from here
and we have to write here
hello so save it and you can see we have
an array over here now what if we want
to find both the words in a string if we
have if we want to check if there's more
than one word with the similar name so
what we have to do is we have to write
here g and if you save it now you can
see the output is completely changed and
now we have an array with two similar
words what if we add another hello here
so let's say we have another hello here
save it and you can see here the array
size is increased to 3 now now we are
left with one more method and the method
we are going to discuss now is pretty
important because we'll use this method
in future as well so the last method is
the replace method which is used to
replace something from a string we can
either replace the first matching word
or all the matching words from a string
if we are using the global modifier then
all the words will be replaced otherwise
the first matching word will be replaced
so the syntax for this method goes like
this
what we have to do is so let's comment
it out first
and we'll go through the syntax of final
method so the final method is
replace method
fine
so the syntax goes like this we'll use
the output variable again
and we'll write here
str1
dot replace because we want to replace
something in that particular string the
first parameter will be the
variable name we'll write here rejects
comma and then we'll pass
the word we want to change so hello will
be changed with let's say in this case
hi
fine
now check over here that if we are using
any modifier so we are using global
modifier here
now if we print this on our console if
we write a console.log and
we are writing here output
if we save it now we'll get to know that
all the hello words in the string are
replaced with the word hi
save it and you can see over here that
hi and welcome to a youtube channel say
hi if you are new here and then we have
a hi you can see that all the hello
words are replaced with the word hi
now if we remove this global modifier
from here and if we save it now you can
see only the first hello world is
replaced the other hello words are here
and there will be no change in them
because we are not using the global
modifier now in the previous video where
we came across regular expressions in
javascript we saw different predefined
functions that we use for finding a
particular expression present inside a
string right
like the predefined functions we also
have some javascript characters that
make the searching part easy
so these characters are used within the
expressions and help us in different
ways for example let's consider a
scenario where we have a regular
expression and we want to find a
particular word within the string
but we don't remember the whole word
let's say we forgot the word with time
and now we remember only a part of that
word so let's do the same side by side
and what we'll do is we'll go to our
javascript file
and we'll take three variables
we'll write here let regex is equals to
then we'll write here let str1 is equals
to
and then finally we'll write
where output is equals to
fine
now here we have three variables the
variable rejects will store a regular
expression within it we haven't returned
the word yet next up we have a variable
str1 to store the string and a variable
output to store the output returned by a
function the function we'll use will be
any one of the ones we used in the
previous video so let's do it here the
word let's say the word will be
welcome fine
you can take any word you want now
moving on to the string let's write the
string as well we'll write here welcome
to our youtube
channel and then we'll write another
welcome here
fine we'll discuss the reason why we
wrote welcome twice now if you guys
remember from the previous video where
we have used the test function to check
the availability of a word present in a
string or not we'll use the same
function again so we'll write here
variable name
dot
function name so the function name is
test and then we'll pass the string name
as the parameter so we'll write a str
that's fine
and finally what we'll do is we'll
print this on our console so we'll write
a console.log
output fine now we already know the
output for this piece of code right the
output will be true that's obvious
because we have the word welcome present
in our string not once but twice
the output will remain true if we remove
the first welcome from the string let's
do it here let's save the program first
and then we'll move to the console
and you can see here the output says
true for the word welcome present in the
string str1 that's true right
and now if we remove this welcome word
from here and if we save it you can see
the output still remains true because we
have another welcome word present in the
string right
so this is how the test function
actually works we'll put the welcome
word here again we already know the
functioning of this test function the
main point of discussion here is the
meta characters so metacharacters are
characters with special meanings
like the dot character if we write this
regular expression like we can remove
any one character from this word and put
a dot in its place let's do it
we'll remove a random character and
write dot a so let's say
we are removing
l
fine and instead of l we are putting a
dot here
now the dot character here will replace
this character and the system will not
throw any error
it will still find the word we can also
use exact function here to check the
index number of the word so what we'll
do is we'll take another variable
and we'll do the same we'll write here
rejects dot
exec
and then we'll pass the string name as
parameters
fine
we'll copy this console.log from here
and we'll paste it here
the variable name is op
save it
and here you can see
we have the output as true for the test
function and for the exact function it
returns the index number 0 of the word
in the string now the system
automatically puts a l in place of the
dot character similarly if you want to
do the same thing for more than one
character we have another meta character
for that it's not that we can't use this
dot operator but we can use it for a
limited time like we can use it for a
single character but if we want to put
more than one character and we don't
know the number of the characters so
then we have another meta character for
that the meta character is asterisk
now this asterisk allows us to put
multiple characters within a particular
expression for example if we write here
let's remove all this
and we'll put star or asterisk in place
of all the characters in between so save
it and you can see the output returns
true
for
test function and for the exact function
the index is
0.
now if we write here something like that
and we don't know what it is but let's
assume it so if we save it now you can
still see the output returns true for
this as well
because
now we can put any number of characters
in between w and e the only thing that
matters is the first and the last
character of the word welcome
now
the next character we'll be looking at
does not work the same way as these
characters the character works upon a
whole string let's go through the syntax
and what we'll do is
we'll remove this
unwanted piece of code and then we'll
come here we'll write here
welcome again and now we'll put this
carrot character now the carrot
character is this character so
what this character returns is this
character returns true only if the whole
string starts with the word welcome the
second welcome word does not even exist
for this meta character if we save this
program now it will return true because
welcome is present at the start of this
string right so save it
and you can see the output is true now
if we remove this welcome from here
and if we save this program now we know
that we have another welcome present in
the string but this character does not
work
that way
and it will return false because the
string starts with
two now right
save it and here you can see the output
is false for test function and for exact
function the output is null it will not
return any index number of the second
welcome or some sort of thing so this is
how the carrot character works in
javascript
the next meta character does the same
thing but for the end of the string the
symbol is dollar and it checks for the
end part of the string this meta
character is placed at the end of a
regular expression and it checks if the
string ends with characters present in
the expression the syntax goes like this
what we'll do is we'll remove this
carrot character and we'll put a dollar
sign you
now this statement now will check if the
string ends with the word welcome or not
in this case the last word of the string
is
back right
not welcome so the output will be false
save it
save it and you can see here the output
is false and null
suppose we write here back in place of
welcome now what we'll do is we'll write
here
back in place of welcome and if we save
this program now the output will change
to true because back is the last word
present in a string right so this
character checks for the end of the
string
save it and you can see the output is
changed to true and the index number is
32
find the exact function will return the
index number of the word back the last
meta character we will discuss in this
video is the optional meta character
the question mark symbol represents this
meta character and the functioning be
like
any character before the symbol is
treated as optional
this means that it doesn't matter if the
character is present in the string or
not for example if we write here let's
say
we'll
write here welcome again because welcome
has more characters than back and we'll
write here
welcome as well
fine
now let's make some changes in this
particular rejects expression so what
we'll do is we'll put a question mark
here
and let's say we'll put another question
mark here fine now if we remove c and e
from the string or any one of them then
also the function will work fine and the
output will be true let's do it and what
we'll do is we'll make some changes in
this particular string and we are going
to remove some characters from this
string so we have two welcome words
there and what we'll do is we'll remove
c from this one
and we have two optional characters
right both c and e are optional but for
now we are removing c only so the string
looks like this we have the word vellum
it doesn't mean anything but for
understanding purposes we have done it
so save it and you can see the output
remains true for vellum
now
what if we put any other word in place
of this character
let's say we are writing here b
fine
the output will change we have to put an
o as
because o is not an optional character
now the output
will change
as we were discussing if we save this
program you can see it is true for now
but it is saying true because of this
welcome now if we remove this welcome
from here and if we save it now you can
see the output is changed to null
yes these characters are optional but we
can't put any character in place of them
we have two options only either we can
put c in its place or we can leave it
so there is no other option with the
optional characters so these are the few
meta characters present in regular
expressions which helps in validation a
lot we came across meta characters in
regex in the previous video where we saw
how to check the availability of a
particular word or expression within a
string we know about functions as well
so today we will combine all these
things to some extent and we'll see how
basic validation actually works in
javascript
we'll see an example wherein we'll go
through the character sets and ranges
and check for some specific type of
validation in this video
now the topic character sets and ranges
itself is a pretty explanatory topic and
we can get an idea of what's coming just
by going through the words characters in
layman term refers to alphabets and
numbers right we see a character on a
daily basis and we know a lot about them
now if i write here a
we can say that this is a character in
javascript now we can use one single
character or a group of characters at a
time with regular expressions in
javascript we have a particular syntax
for it we'll go through the syntax first
and the syntax is like we have to use
square brackets and we have to write
characters in between these brackets or
inside these brackets
here we have three characters a b and c
what we can do is we can give
instructions to the system to use any
one of them in a regular expression
so let's take a small example of how
this actually works with regular
expressions and what we will do is we'll
do the same thing we have been doing
till now will search a word within a
string will check that if a word exists
within a string or not so we'll do it
like we'll take a variable regex
that will contain the regular expression
so this is
the syntax for regular expression and
this is a regular expression which says
d e f so in actual this is not a word
but assume it as a word for now and what
we have to do is we have to include
character sets with this regular
expression right so we'll write here
inside square brackets abc
now the next thing is we'll define the
string let's say the string name is tr1
and the string says
this string
contains adef
so def
or we can say adef is what matters the
most for now so anything else you can
write on the string the next thing we
are going to do is we are going to
use the test function to check if this
particular regular expression
is available in the string or not so
we'll write here
regex dot
test and inside this will pass the
string as a parameter
now the last thing we'll do is we'll
write here console.log and
we'll print this on our console fine
we are done with it so what we are doing
here is we want to search the string for
a word which contains the letter d e f
compulsory but before d e f we can have
a character that character can either be
a
b or c no other character will be taken
in front of d e f because we have
defined a character set as well right
and that character set contains only
three characters a b and c
so
here you can see we have adef present in
the string and we have a along with def
so
what we are expecting is this test
function should return true right so
save it and check for the output in the
console so we will go to a console
and here you can see the output says
true because we have adef only
now if we write here anything else like
if we replace this a with the character
r
save it and you can see the output is
false because r is not present inside
this character set now what if we write
here something like
let's say we are writing here
caution def now this will check for this
letter only for this l only other
letters don't actually matters in this
case in the case of character sets the
only character that matters is the
character right before the regular
expression
so if we save it you can see the output
is changed to false and if we write here
let's say
caution adef save it and you can see the
output is true because it checks for
this character only fine
talking about ranges let's say we want
to add any character in the string
between a to z now we have two options
to do so first one is we can write a b c
till z here like we'll write here d e f
g h i and so on and so forth tills it
but this task is a little bit lengthy
right and we have to spend a lot of time
in that process so the alternate to this
process is to define a range of
characters to define a range of
characters it's quite an easy task all
you have to do is write a
hyphen z so this is how you can define a
range of characters now this range will
consist every character from a till z a
and z will also be included keep this
thing in mind if we write here caution
df again so we have seen in in the
previous example that it returned false
for this right save it now and you can
see the output is still true
that's because now we have a range from
a till z
if we write here 5 now now it will
return false because 5 does not lies in
between this range in between a to z so
it will return true for any character
between a till z fine
now let's say we want to exclude some
particular characters from this range
like we don't want the user to include
def again no character from d e or f so
the syntax for that is also pretty easy
we have to use the carrot operator and
we have to write here but we don't want
to include so let's say in this case we
don't want to include def fine so if we
write here ddef now and save it you can
see
it will return false because we have
included ddef and if we write here adef
save it and you can see the output is
true
now we can't include
characters
d e and f in front of this regular
expression because we have defined this
character set to not include these
characters in the regular expression
so these are characters and ranges in
regular expressions so the next thing
we'll be doing is we'll be going through
a basic validation example and we'll see
how actually basic validation works in
javascript what we'll do is we'll create
a small html form that will take the
employee id from the user and it will
check if the employee belongs to the
organization or not
so let's say the employee id of the
organization has some unique characters
present in it and the character remains
there in each employee id
the idea is simple we'll take the id
from the user and we'll use if else
control statement to check if it belongs
to the organization or not so let's move
on to the html file and we'll create a
placeholder and a button so
let's do it
we'll write here
form
and inside this form tag
let input
id is equals to
eid
and
placeholder is equals to
employee id
and type is equals to
text fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to include a button as well
button and we are going to call a
function on clicking so we'll use the on
click event so we'll write your own
click and let's say the function name is
employee
and the button name is let's say submit
save it and you can see over the browser
that we have a placeholder along with
the button so let me give a space here
save it now and you can see we have a
placeholder and a button so that's all
what we have to do in html part now the
rest of the thing we'll be doing in the
javascript file so let's move to a
javascript file
and comment
this piece of code first
now what we want is we want to call a
function employee on clicking the submit
button fine so what we'll do is we'll
define a function employee
and inside the body of this function the
first thing we will be doing is we'll be
taking
the user's id right so we need a
variable for that so let's say the
variable is
mpid and we'll write here
document
dot
get element by id the id is
eid
dot
value
fine now this empid variable will hold
the value entered by the user right so
like if we write here something like
d2386 so let's say this is the id this
will be stored the value for this id
will be stored inside this empid
variable fine
now we'll use the regular expression to
check for some special characters so
we'll write
here inside the function we'll write
here where
check is equals to
inside the regular expression we'll
write something so let's say we want to
start the employee id for the
development team with the alphabets d
and d
and each id will have a similar numeric
code like 253 which represents the code
for a particular team fine
so we'll write here inside the character
sets
we want de to be there before a similar
numeric code right so
253 is the numeric code and we want to
include either d or e
before that right
and
after 253 let's say we have a range of
numbers that each employee id has a
unique two digit number the id should
look like
either
d
2 5 3
1 1 or either
e
2 5 3
6 1
something like that right
now so for that what we have to do is we
have to include here another range and
this range will be from 11
oh so this range will be from 10 till 99
fine
this looks a bit complex now but if you
try to do it by yourself believe me guys
you'll find it out that this is an easy
task but a little lengthy we can say now
the next part is we have to validate the
id entered for that we have to use the
if else control statement along with the
test function
so we have to write here
if
check
dot test and inside this will write
amp id because mpid is the variable
which is holding the value entered by
the user right so if it's true then it
will return
an alert box with the message that says
valid
employee id
fine
else
it will
return a message in the pop-up
which will say
invalid
id fine
so this if-else statement will check the
value returned by the test function if
the value returned is true it will
return a message valid employee id
otherwise the else statement will run
and the user will get a pop-up with the
message invalid email id fine
let's check the output and in the
browser here we'll write the employee id
in the
given placeholder so let's say the
employee id is d
25319
submit it and you can see it says valid
employee id we can do it for some mode
like if we write here e
2 5 3
9 8
submit it and you can see it still says
valid employee id now what if we want to
include any character between this range
and the unique number right so let's try
to do it we'll write here d
253
k
89 fine so let's say this is the id we
want to enter submit it and you can see
it says invalid employee id
now one more thing we want to do here is
like if we write here
d 253
okay 8 9
in this case it will return false or
invalid employee id why because we
haven't included any modifier here and
it will differentiate between uppercase
and lowercase character so to overcome
this problem what we can do is we can
include the in case sensitive modifier
and we are clearly good to go now if we
write here d25398
and save it if we write here now d
2 5 3
9 8 submit it
and you can see here the output says
valid employee id
so this is how we can use validation
along with regular expressions
in the last video we came across
character sets and ranges we saw how we
could use them with regular expressions
and we also saw how to validate a user's
input with the help of character sets
and ranges along with regular
expressions now in this video we'll look
at the shorthand character classes
present within regular expressions and
we'll see how they are helpful in
javascript
if you guys remember the regular
expression we used became a bit
confusing and lengthy because we have
used so many ranges and character sets
all in one right a character class can
be used to overcome this particular
problem and we have several character
classes present in javascript so today
we will go through them in this
particular video now the syntax is not
too much complicated all we have to do
is to write a single character with the
backslash and we are good to
for example if we go to a javascript
file and if we write here
backslash d now if we write this
character before any regular expression
in javascript it means that we have
added a character class to a regular
expression this backslash d is a
character class used for finding a digit
within a string let's go through an
example for this character class
and we'll do the same thing we'll take a
string and try to find a regular
expression within that string so what
we'll do is
we'll write here
where
rejects is equals to
and here we'll write a regular
expression
first we'll take up a string and use
some functions to check the output so
let's do it here what we'll do is we'll
take another variable let's say the
variable name is str1 and
the string says
user's
phone number
is
three two 987654321 zero now let's say
this is the string we are using for
today's program
the next thing we'll do is we'll use the
exact function to find the regular
expression within the string so we have
already gone through this exact function
in javascript today we'll use that
function only
now we'll write here where
output is equals to
regex dot exec
and inside this will pass a string as a
parameter the next thing we'll do is
we'll write here console.log
and we'll print this output on a console
now we are good to go so we are done
with it and the next thing we want to do
is to find a particular pattern along
with the number present before that
pattern in the string so let's suppose
if we write here inside these slashes if
we write here let's say 3 to 1.
now
this statement here asks the computer to
find a pattern three to one in the
string
save it
and go to the console so we'll move to a
browser and we'll press control plus
shift plus i and here you can see we
have a console here and here we have an
array as well so here you can see it
says
let me zoom it out a bit here you can
see it says
321 is present at index 28.
now
the system finds out that this
particular string or this particular
regular expression
is present here in the string at index
number 28 obviously the indexes will
start from 0 and the moment it will find
this
3 to 1 regular expression it will show
the index number in an array
in a console
now if we add
backslash d here let's say we are adding
here backslash d
in front of this expression and check
the output here save it you'll notice
that we have a number present here right
before that expression
right we have four three two one here
instead of just three two one the output
here gives us the number four this means
that this backslash d represents this
number
four in this string now what if we put
an alphabet before this expression now
let's do it what we'll do is we'll write
here a
and let's say we are adding only a
single alphabet here let's say we are
adding a before three two one now the
expected output is a321 but the moment
we'll save it you can see it says null
that's because this particular character
class works for digits only if it finds
anything other than a numeric digit it
will return an error or it will return
null in that case now if we want to find
all the numbers before this pattern then
we have to add a plus operator in the
regular expression all we have to do is
we have to write here plus and we are
good to now it will return everything
until it finds a space or any character
other than a digit now let's suppose if
you are writing here a after 987
now this particular statement will
return all the numbers till 6 the moment
it will encounter a here it will return
all the numbers after a it will stop at
a and it will not go further now save it
and you can see it says six five four
three two one
that's because
this backslash d works for digits only
now if we write here nothing
like we have a number nine eight seven
six five
one
save it and it will return the whole
number 987654321
not 0 because we haven't included any
number here
now if we write here again
backslash d after this as well save it
and here you can see we have the output
as
0 as well we have the whole number here
fine
so this is how this backslash d actually
works in javascript so this is a
character class
now
the next thing is what if we want to
find a non-digit character before a
particular pattern
if we write here
before 321 let's say we are writing here
a
and we want the system to return that
non-digit character before 3 to 1 in
that case we use capital d instead of
small d always remember guys every
shorthand character class in rejects
have an inverse that does
precisely the opposite of that
particular class like if we have small d
here that works for digits only we also
have an inverse which is denoted by
backslash capital d and it is exactly
opposite of this small d here
now if we write here
capital d in place of small d
what will happen is it will return the
character here it will return true for
everything other than a digit
now if we remove this small d from here
and save it
here you can see it says null because we
haven't included the backslash sign here
save it and here you can see it says
a321 it will return true for anything
except for a digit even if we put a
symbol over here then also it will
return the output as true for example if
we write here
let's say we are including dollar sign
here let's say we are including two
dollar sign here save it and it will
return two dollar signs that's because
we are using the plus operator here
obviously let's include as many signs as
we can
save it and here you can see we have all
the symbols present over here on our
output
so this is how capital d character class
works or we can say inverse character
class of small d this is how it works
now the next class will be going through
is the wordly character denoted by the
letter w small w and is used in place of
any character that can be an alphabet a
number or an underscore sign we can use
this character over d if we are unsure
about the character present before the
pattern for example if we write here
let's say backslash w
ber
now here we have used the ber pattern
which is present at the end of
number right here ber is present at the
end of number now this statement will
return m only because we are not using
any plus operator here if we use any
plus operator then it will return the
whole number because it will return
everything until it encounters a space
or something like that
so for now we are not using any plus
operator so we'll be writing here this
only now here it will return m because
it can take up a number an alphabet or
an underscore sign it will return false
if it finds any space or something other
than these three these three means a
number an alphabet or an underscore sign
fine
now save it and you can see on the
console that the output says mber let me
zoom it a bit so here you can see the
output says mber right present at index
14. it will return null if we put a
space before the pattern like if we
write here num space b e r save it you
can see it says null for this now we can
use the plus operator as well here for
this particular character class now what
will happen is it will return every
character present before the pattern
until it encounters a space or something
like a symbol or any sort of thing so
let's try it what we'll do is we'll
write here w
plus b er and we'll remove this space
from here
save it and here you can see it says
number what if we remove this space from
here remove it save it and here you can
see it says phone number it will return
every character before the pattern until
it finds any space or any other let's
say
symbol so let's say we are including
here dollar percentage
and carrot sign
save it and here you can see it says an
e number so it's returning it from here
because it will not return true for any
of the symbols here
save it and here you can see we have the
output as phone number again so that's
working totally fine
like the inverse character class for
digits we have the inverse character
class for this also and it returns true
for everything other than an alphabet
number or any underscore sign now if we
write here
instead of small w let's say we are
writing here capital w
and let's do something with the string
as well so let's put a space here again
and we are good to go we are not doing
anything more than that so it will
return null because before ber we have m
here right if we remove this m with us
sign let's say if we are removing this
with a dollar sign or with an empty one
like we are writing here space nothing
then it will return the index number and
the pattern
so let's do it save it
and here you can see it says dollar then
it says ber and index number is 14 you
can count the index number so 0 for u
and then similarly 1 for s 2 for e 3 4 r
4 for s up to 14 for dollar so dollar is
present at index 14 it will return the
index number here now the plus operator
also works for this inverse character
class as well right here plus ber and we
can insert as many characters or as many
symbols as we want so like here we have
inserted so many symbols this doesn't
mean anything but we are inserting them
for
example purposes or for practical
purpose so save it and here you can see
we have all the symbols present over
here in a array and the index number is
still 14 if we remove
these n and u from here now save it the
index number will change to 11
that's quite easy
now
the next class we have is the simplest
of all this class works for white spaces
only it means that it will return true
or give us the index number of the
expression
from the string only if a white space
exists before the pattern
it is denoted by small s and works for
spaces only now if we write here
let's say
backslash s
okay we have made a mistake we'll write
a backslashes
and we'll write your phone so
this is the pattern and this is the
character class backslash s is the
character class now what we'll do is
we'll
remove it from here and we'll
write the string as this again we'll
write a user's phone number is this and
this
now for this regular expression it will
return the index number of this space
the space is present at index 5
0 for u 1 for s 2 for e 3 for r 4 for s
and this space is present at index
number 5 so it will return index as 5
for this particular space now don't get
confused guys for this index number s5
the index number is for the space
present in the screen before the pattern
phone
right
now if we try to do the same for users
as well
let's suppose if we write here users it
will return null in this case because
there's no space present before users in
the string right save it and here you
can see the output says null in this
case
fine now we can also use the plus
operator here for more than one spaces
present in the string it will return all
the spaces until it finds a character or
something other than the spaces like if
it finds any symbol or any character
then only it will return false otherwise
for spaces it will return true so if we
write here
too many spaces if we put too many
spaces before the word
phone or let's say we are changing this
word
phone
save it and here you can see we have all
the spaces here it's denoted by a single
space but the index numbers is changed
to 19. now we have so many spaces
present here before the
pattern phone or before the word phone
so this is how we can use
space character class in javascript
now we have also the inverse class for
this character class as well it returns
true for everything other than empty
spaces if we write here
let's say we are removing this and let's
say we are right okay and let's say we
are
writing here users
and we are
giving so many spaces here before the
word users now it will return null in
this case because there are spaces
present in front of the word users
if we include a character or something
in front of this word then only the
output will change and return the index
number along with the string so save it
first and here you can see
okay we have used the smallest in place
of smallest we'll write here capital s
save it and you can see here the output
says null for capital s because this
capital s will return true for
everything other than spaces only now if
we put here any symbol let's say we have
these symbols here
save it and here you can see now we have
a hash symbol present before the word
users that's because we have used
capital s only now if we use a plus
operator save it and here you can see we
have all the symbols present in a array
we have the index number as 11 we have
dollar percentage carrot and hash
present over here right so this is how
the inverse of character spaces in
javascript actually work so these are
the character classes we have in
javascript we discussed all the six
character classes three of them were
inverse i hope you guys got it these
character classes are sometimes used in
place of character sets and ranges as
they make searching and comparing tasks
easier for us during the validation
process we'll go through the validation
part in the next video
so we'll go through how validation is
used with html and then we'll move on to
validation with javascript
if you guys see we have two text boxes
over here one is for the username and
other one is for the password creating
such text boxes in html is quite an easy
task we have to use the input tag which
we discussed a few sessions back
and we are using some more properties
here
so you can see we have type as text for
username and for password the type is
password
so before we move on to validation with
javascript let me tell you guys that we
can do certain things with html as well
like if we want that none of the two
text boxes over here remains blank
we can write here inside these input
tags so if we write here
required
save it and now if you try to click on
the submit button you can see it says
please fill out this field it will not
allow the user to submit the form until
there is any value present for the name
so if we write here any random name and
submit it now you can see the form is
getting refreshed that's because we have
used the form tag over here now if we
try to submit without writing anything
we'll get the pop-up as please fill out
this field and we can do the same for
password as well like if we write here
required and save it
now if you write any name over here for
the username and if we leave this
password field blank submit it you can
see it says please fill out this field
for password as well
so html can let you do all this stuff
but when it comes to actual validation
like if you want the user to enter only
if the name or password matches the one
present in the backend or maybe we can
say in the server
we have to use something more than html
now the case with javascript is a bit
different if we talk about validation in
javascript we can use javascript for
client-side verification
the scenario here will be the one we'll
discuss in today's video what we'll do
today is we'll create a basic signup
form with three text boxes one is for
the username the other one is for the
password and we'll add one more box for
each
half of the work is already done and we
have to add one more box now for the age
so edge is just a number right so we can
add a text box over here what we have to
do is we have to write here
before the submit button will write here
input
type is equals to number
and we'll provide it the id as well so
let's say the id is each we'll use the
id attribute later
and inside this placeholder will write
here h
save it and here you can see we have
three text boxes over here
inside the h we can't write any
character or alphabet because we have
defined the type as number for this so
we can write numbers here only now the
next part is to link this page to
another web page such that if the
credentials are correct the user will
enter the home page of our website for
that we have to use the action attribute
in html now the question here is when do
we want the user to enter the home page
only if the credentials are correct
right
we have to use the action attribute with
the form tag so you can see over here we
have already mentioned the form tag now
what we'll do is we'll write here action
and what we want is we wanted to
redirect the user to another page or
another web page the home page of our
website after checking the credentials
and if the credentials are correct the
user will move on to the home page so we
have already a file named homepage.html
so we'll write your homepage.html
and save it now on clicking the submit
button okay we have to fill something
for
name and for password as well so we'll
write random values over here submit it
and you can see we have been redirected
to another page and this is the home
page of our website
however it doesn't look like a home page
still we can assume it right so now we
know what should be done if the user has
correct credentials to enter the home
page we are almost done with the html
part we will make some more changes to
this file later the next thing we have
to do is to validate the credentials
entered by the user right for validation
purposes we'll use the if else control
statements in a javascript file will
create a function in a javascript file
and call that function when the user
clicks the submit button but there is a
difference will not call the function on
clicking the submit button instead we'll
call the function on
submission of the form so instead of
writing here on click and then calling
that function what we'll do is
we'll write here inside the form tag
we'll write on submit so this is an
event and on submit what will happen is
it will call a function named validate
will create this validate function in
our javascript file now
so you can see here we have already used
the id attribute with all the input tags
in order to get the values entered by
the user so let's move on to the
javascript file and what we'll do here
is we'll first declare a function named
validate so we'll write here function
and the function name is
validate
and then we have the body of this
function
now we'll take three variables to get
all the values entered by the user
because we need to check for all the
values right so we need to check if the
user's name and password match the one
we want and the user should be aged
above 13 to enter our website
for all these we need the values entered
by the user so we'll use the get element
by id method to get all the values
now for that we'll take three variables
so let's say the first variable is
unnamed it will hold the value entered
in the username text box let me go to
the form again
and here you can see we have three text
boxes username password and h so we'll
take three variables
for username we'll write here
document.getelementbyid
and the id is unname
let me confirm it once so you can see
here the id for username is
unname
for password it is pass and for h it's h
so
we'll write here dot
value
the next thing we'll do is we'll create
another variable for password
we'll write here again
document.getelementbyid
and the id is pass
we'll again write here dot value
and the third variable will be where age
it will hold the age of the user
so we'll again write here
document.getelementbyid
and id for ages h
we'll again use the dot value property
now we are done with the values
we have three variables holding all the
values entered by the user next up we'll
use these values to validate the data
entered by the user
now the first condition we can have here
is that we don't want the user to leave
any of the text boxes empty right
if we click on this submit button you
can see it says please fill out this
field now we can do it with the help of
html as well but for now we are using
javascript so we will remove these
required keywords
so that we can do it with javascript
only
save it
and submit it now you can see it is
redirecting us to the home page of our
website so it's working totally fine now
what we'll do is we'll write a condition
if the user leaves any of these fields
empty so we'll write here if
unname
is equals to is equals to blank
or
pass is equals to is equals to blank
okay
pass is equals to is equals to blank
or
age
is equals to is equals to
blank
now what will happen is it will give the
user a pop-up with the message
let's say
the message is
missing
credentials fine
save it
and if we leave any of these fields
empty now a pop-up will appear with the
message missing credentials so the first
condition is done but there's a loophole
in this condition so let's check it out
first we'll leave username and password
empty submit it you can see it says
missing credentials right
now the next thing is if we write here
let's say a random name and password as
well but we are leaving this age text
box empty submit it it still says
missing credentials because we haven't
entered the age
and it's working totally fine
now there's a loophole in this condition
the exciting part is it will work fine
if the user enters more than one space
in all the fields like
if you are giving here spaces for more
than once and similarly for password as
well submit it and you can see it says
missing credentials because we haven't
filled the h
so let's
do one thing we'll
write some spaces for username and
password and for h we'll say the age is
4 submit it and you can see we have no
error over here now to overcome this
problem we have a predefined javascript
method that treats all the spaces the
same
no matter the number of spaces whether
it be one or more than one it will treat
all the same we have to include the trim
method within the if else statement so
what we'll do is we'll write here dot
trim
for user name and similarly for password
as well we'll write here trim
and for age as well let's say
dot trim
and save it now
move back to a signup form and if we try
to give more than one spaces here
and let's say the age is 4 submit it you
can see it says missing credentials for
more than one species as well so this is
working totally fine now the following
condition will be for validating the
name let's say the required name is
caution or anything else
the required password is let's say one
two three four five and the age should
be more than 13.
then only the user can enter the website
so for that we have to use the else if
statement and what we'll do is we'll
write here
elsif and inside this will give our
conditions so let's say the conditions
are you name
is equals to is equals to
caution
and
pass
is equals to is equals to
one two three four five
and
h
should be
greater than or is equals to
13.
then
it will give the user a pop-up and which
states that we'll write here alert
we'll write here
sign up
successful
fine
save it
now the user can enter the website with
these credentials only otherwise a
pop-up will appear
so let's give the else condition as well
what we'll do is we'll write here else
and we'll use another alert
inside this we'll write
wrong id and
password
fine
now we have all the conditions here save
it and now we'll check for different
inputs
so let's move back to a form
and what we'll do is we'll write the
username is let's say ravi
and the password is let's say any random
numbers
and age is let's say 6 submit it and you
can see it says wrong id and password
now what we'll do is we'll give it the
correct credentials we'll write here
caution and the password will be one two
three four five
and the age is let's say twenty one fine
the age should be greater than or equals
to thirteen so submit it and you can see
it says sign up successful
now we have different conditions over
here
like if we write here any random name
and
if we write here any random password now
it will return wrong id and password but
if we write here correct id and password
and
correct username as well let's say we
are writing here caution and let's say
the age will change to
11 submit it and you can see it still
says wrong id and password we can add
one more condition over here like we'll
write here elsif age is less than 12 it
will give an alert that
you are underage or some sort of that so
we'll write here elsif
h
is less than 13
an alert
which states under each fine
save it
and what we'll do is we'll move back to
our form and we'll write here caution
password is one two three four five and
age is let's say
11 submit it and you can see it says
under aged now so it is working totally
fine now one thing that seems a bit
irritating as well is it redirects us to
the home page every time right it
doesn't matter if the credentials are
correct or not it redirects to overcome
this issue we have
to make some minor changes in the html
file and include the return keyword in a
if else conditional statements so let's
go back to our html file and what we'll
do is
we'll write here inside the form tag now
we have on submit over here so what
we'll do is we'll write return
before validate
so save it and we'll move back to a
javascript file
now this return keyword will let the
form perform any action only if the
value returned by the function validate
is true otherwise it will not allow the
form tag
to perform any action the action here is
redirecting the user to the home page
right so
let's do it here we know that the
function should return true only if all
the credentials are valid so we'll write
here
for all other
conditions we'll write
return
false
fine
for this one we'll write
return true because this is the
condition when all the credentials are
correct and for all other conditions
we'll write return
false
similarly for else as well we'll write
here
return false
now save it and we'll move back to
sign up form
save the html file as well once
and what we'll do is we'll write a
caution password is 1 2 3
and age is let's say 4 submit it you can
see it says under aged click on ok and
now it is not redirecting us to the home
page right
now if the credentials are correct what
we'll do is we'll write here the
password is one two three four five
and the age is let's say
21
submit it
now you can see it says sign up
successful click on ok and you can see
we are in the home page it is working
totally fine
so if all the credentials are valid then
it is redirecting us to the home page
exactly what we wanted so these are the
basics of validation in javascript
obviously we can't validate a form with
javascript in the real world because we
don't have to deal with one user only we
need the backend to do all the
validation and all but simple validation
can be done with the help of javascript
we did it just now
we have many things to do with
validation in javascript like adding
some more conditions or using regular
expressions to validate forms in
javascript using regular expressions for
validation in javascript is what we
already saw in the previous videos so we
have gone through it already i want you
guys to show some creativity and do
something new on this topic and let us
know what you have done in the comment
box
today we'll add another text box here
wherein the user will enter the mobile
number and then we'll validate it in two
different ways so let's add another text
box here what we'll do is
we'll write here
input
type is equals to
number and let's give it the id as well
so let's say the id is mobile
and the placeholder will say
enter your
mobile number
fine save it so you can see we have
another text box here
what we'll do is we'll
add a break tag here we'll write here br
save it now so this is our form
and here we have username password age
and mobile number one thing to notice
here is we can use the type as text as
well
as we are using
mobile number that consists of digits
only so we are using type as numbers
here so let's move on to the javascript
file
and we'll do the rest of the part there
so we'll take the user's input and store
it inside a variable to compare it right
so
let's add another variable here here you
can see we already have three variables
for username password and h we'll add
one more so let's say the variable name
is
where mob is equals to we'll use the
document dot get element by id attribute
so we'll write here get element by id
and the id we used is
mobile so let's cross check it once so
here is the id mobile and we'll take the
value we'll write here dot value so this
variable mob holds the user's mobile
number and will make certain changes to
this existing if else statement
so the first thing we'll be doing is
we'll check if the user is writing
something inside the text box or not so
we'll add another condition here we'll
write here mob dot
trim
is equals to is equals to space if the
user leaves this box empty so this will
pop up in his screen and it will say
missing credentials right next up we'll
change this condition as well we'll
write here
and then so let's say the mobile number
is zero nine eight seven six five four
three two one
some sort of this and we'll write here
mob is equals to is equals to
zero to one
now the last thing we are doing here is
we'll be adding one more elsif to check
if user enters any other mobile number
than this one
so like we did for h similarly we will
do it for mobile number as well so we'll
write here else if
mob
not is equals to
09876 54321
then it will return
wrong mobile number
and it will also return
false
save it
now we have made three changes here
first one is we added the mob dot trim
so that the user won't leave this space
empty the next one is we checked if the
number entered by the user matches the
one we have in our system and last one
is for the number entered by the user
doesn't match then it will return wrong
mobile number fine
so we are done with it you can check it
here we have a condition here if the
mobile number does not matches it will
return wrong mobile number so let's do
it here we know the username is caution
the password is one two three four five
and the a should be above 13 right so
let's say we are writing here 15. now
here we are in the mobile number so
let's
add a random number here what we'll do
is we'll write this and submit it you
can see it says wrong mobile number
fine
now the next thing is we'll write here
zero nine eight seven six five four two
54321 let's suppose this is the mobile
number submit it and you can see it says
sign up successful and it will redirect
us to the home page
now this is working totally fine and
this is the traditional way of checking
the phone number of a user only if we
already know what the user has to put in
the text box to enter the website
now the next thing we'll be doing is
pretty simple as well but for that
method one should have a clear
understanding of regular expressions in
javascript
now we'll use regex to validate the
user's phone number
and if you haven't watched the previous
videos on regular expressions yet i
suggest you to go through it before
mobile number validation in javascript
and this task of validation will be so
easy for you guys so what we'll do is
we'll move on to another html file let's
create one here first so we'll create
another html file let's say the html
file name is
mobile
dot html
and here what we'll do is
we'll create another text box
so let me connect it to another
javascript file first and we'll create
another javascript file as well find so
we'll write here
mobile.js
so this is a javascript file
and the next thing we'll be doing is
we'll write a heading here so let's say
we are writing mobile number validation
in javascript
fine save it and open it with live
server so here is a new html file and
this is the javascript file so the next
thing we'll be doing here is we'll
create another text box right we'll
create a single text box so we'll write
here
input
type is equals to text we can either use
numbers here as well
and then we'll use the id attribute
so we have to do it later but we are
doing it right now placeholder as
mobile
number fine
now we'll create a submit button as well
we'll write here input
type is equals to button
and value is equals to
submit
what we'll do is we'll call a function
on clicking the submit button so we'll
use the on click event here as well so
we'll write here on click and let's say
the function name is well
fine
go to save it
and here you can see we have a text box
for mobile number and a submit button
over here
so what we'll do next is we'll move on
to the javascript file to create this
val function now we'll create a function
and that function will check if the
number entered by the user is in the
proper format or not so let's create a
function first we'll go to a javascript
file and we'll write here
function well so this is the name of our
function and then we have the body as
well now the next thing we'll be doing
is will be writing a program here so
what we'll do is we'll first take a
variable let's say the variable name is
where mobile and this variable will hold
the value entered by the user right so
we'll write here document
dot get element by id
so his id is
i guess mobile so let's check it once so
here you can see we have the ids mobile
now what we'll do is we'll write a dot
value to get the value entered by the
user and now what we are doing is we are
using regular expressions for this
purpose right so we'll create another
variable
for the regular expression and we'll
leave it empty for now because we'll
change it later first we'll write the
whole program so what we'll do is we'll
again use the if else control statement
so the first condition will remain the
same we'll write here mobile dot trim
to check if the user is leaving the
place empty or not
and
in this condition
here we'll write
alert
and then inside alert we'll write
please
enter a mobile number fine
i hope you guys got it so you can see
here we are getting an error here in the
if statement that's because we haven't
written something over here so if we
write something inside a regular
expression so the error will go
but for now we are not using any regular
expression because i'll explain it to
you after this so leave it here only for
now the next
condition will be
writing here using the elsif so we'll
write here
elsif and we'll use this rejects
variable with the test function
to validate the user's mobile number so
we'll write here rejects
dot
test and will pass this mobile number as
a parameter to check right to compare
between rejects variable and the mobile
variable so we'll write here mobile fine
now this elsif will return something so
we'll use the alert method again we'll
write here mobile number
submitted
successfully
now you might be thinking why we are
doing so because we know that this test
function is used to compare the values
and if this test function will return to
then only a pop-up will appear with the
message mobile number submitted
successfully i hope you guys
already know about this test function we
already discussed it a few sessions back
when we came across regular expressions
in javascript
so i think it might be easy for you guys
and
at last we'll write here else
for any other input
for any other input
so we'll again use the alert method and
we'll write here
wrong mobile number fine
here we have written everything inside
this function even the conditions as
well we have three cases over here
the first one is if the user leaves the
field empty and tries to submit the next
one is for checking the number entered
by the user and the last one is for
everything else
so we haven't written the regular
expression yet because let's discuss it
before writing
so guys what we want is
we want a 10 digit mobile number and the
number should start from either 7 8 or 9
because we know mobile numbers generally
starts with these digits either 7 or 8
or 9 fine
then it has 10 digits only now for
checking the length of the mobile number
we could have used the mobile.length
property right but the regular
expression gives us a simple and easy
method to do so we discussed the
shorthand character classes in rejects a
few sessions back right so now we want
all the inputs to be digits only so what
we'll do is we'll write here inside this
regular expression
backslash d
so this is a shorthand character class
and
we'll use
these curly braces and we'll write here
10 inside this so this statement over
here will check the length of the string
but we have to do some more things here
the next thing we need to do is the
initial digit of a mobile number that
can be 7 8 or nine
so for that what we'll do is we'll
define a range for initial number and
we'll write here before this character
class
what we'll do is we'll define a range
over here so we'll use square brackets
and we'll write here 7
to 9. now this particular statement
defines a range that consists of only
three numbers 7 8 or 9.
now this regular expression is sort of
complete we can say now one thing we
have to keep in mind that we have to
write here 9 now instead of 10
that's because
we have already defined the first number
right and we need 9 more digits apart
from that particular digit
so let's check it out
save it
and we'll write a mobile number here so
let's say the mobile number is this one
two three four five six seven eight and
what will happen is it will return wrong
mobile number that's because the number
here starts from 1 instead of 7 8 or 9
so submit it and you can see it says
wrong mobile number
now we'll try for another condition
we'll leave this field blank and submit
it you can see it says please enter a
mobile number so this is also working
fine now the next thing we'll be doing
is
we'll be starting the number from 9
and let's say the number is this
so this is a 10 digit mobile number
submit it and you can see it says mobile
number submitted successfully
so this is also working fine
now the only problem here is if we write
anything before this particular phone
number
like if we write here before
9 if we let's say we are writing here a
b c d e
any character or alphabet as well submit
it you can see it still says mobile
number submitted successfully
now it will not give any error because
it finds the expression present in the
string
right we have to mention the static and
the end points of a regular expression
for this purpose
we have two meta characters one denotes
the start that is the carrot character
and the other one denotes the end of the
string that is the dollar sign so we'll
add both of them in our expression what
we'll do is we'll write here
carrot
this will denote the start of the string
and here we'll write dollar this will
denote the end of the string save it
and now it will work fine
and one more thing guys don't
misunderstand this character with the
one we use inside the brackets to
exclude any particular string like if we
remove this from here and if we insert
this carrot character inside
this bracket what will happen is it will
exclude this particular range it will
exclude 7 8 or 9. we have already
discussed the use of this carrot
character now if we write it here it
will denote the start of a string so you
will not get confused if the concept of
meta characters and character sets are
clear to you so let's check the output
save it
and we'll check for certain phone
numbers now we'll check for that
particular condition only we'll write
here
one 9876543210
so this is a correct mobile number if
you submit it it will say mobile number
submitted successfully
but now if you write here something
before this 9876
now if we write here any
characters or alphabets and submit it
you can see it says wrong mobile number
because we have used the carrot
character and we want at the start of
the string either 7 8 or 9. now similar
thing will happen at the end as well if
you write here anything
and submit it you can see it says wrong
mobile number because we have added
dollar sign as well fine
remove it and if you are adding any
numbers here as well save it and you can
see it still says wrong mobile number
because the length is more than 10 and
the end will be denoted after nine
digits so these are the nine digits and
this is the end of the string according
to a regular expression
so these are the ways how we can
validate a user's phone number in
javascript we already know a lot about
validation by now we came across
validation several times so let's move
on to the programming part directly and
we'll create a text box here to take the
user's input so what we'll do is we'll
create a text box we'll write here
input
type is equals to
email id here as let's say mail
fine the next thing will be a
placeholder and
the placeholder will say
enter
email id here fine
we'll close this input tag and the next
thing we'll be doing is we'll be
creating a submit button we'll write
here type is equals to
button
value will be
submit
and we'll use the on click event
so we'll write here on click so we'll
call a function on clicking this button
we'll write here validate we'll create
this validate function in a javascript
file
now save this piece of code and you can
see we have a text box and submit button
here now if you write here something
you can see nothing is happening over
here
now the next task we have to do is the
one we already know we'll move on to the
javascript file we'll create a function
there and use the if else control
statements to check if the email id
entered by the user is in accordance
with the pattern or not
quite a simple task because we have been
doing it for quite some time right so
let's do it quickly what we'll do is
we'll move to a javascript file i forgot
to create one here so let me create one
and the name will be email.js
so this is a javascript file
we'll create a function here so we'll
write here function
validate
the next thing is the body of this
function
so we'll write here everything other
than the regular expression because the
rest will remain the same as mobile
number validation so we'll try it here
we'll create a variable here we'll write
here where
email is equals to
we'll write here
document.getelementbyid and the id is
mail
now we'll use the dot value attribute
the next thing is we'll again take a
variable for regular expression and
we'll
leave it for now we'll move on to the
next part
what we'll do here is we'll use the if
else control statement again so the
first condition will remain the same
we'll write here if email dot
trim is equals to is equals to null
then what it will do is it will give a
pop-up so we'll use the alert keyword
and inside this will write
please enter a valid
email id fine the next thing we'll do is
we'll use the test function in regular
expressions so we'll write here elsif
regex dot
test
and we'll pass this email variable as a
parameter
here it will check if the
input given by the user matches the
pattern of the regular expression will
check for it so we'll
write here alert and inside this will
write
email submitted successfully
fine
and at the last we'll use the else
statement
and we'll write here alert
wrong
email id
fine
save it
now we are almost done with everything
apart from the regular expression we
didn't define the rejects until now
because we'll discuss it first because
you know guys using a regular expression
for email validation is slightly
different from other things like we have
several parts for a regular expression
let's discuss it first
so let's take an email id first so let
me write here
let's say we have an email id
as caution
at the rate simply learn
dot
com
fine we can't write here two dots so
this is what a primary email id looks
like an email id consists of four parts
the first part is the name that can be
anything it can have alphabets digits or
sometimes dot and underscore as well so
we can have the name as like if we write
here
let's say caution
one one or if we write here caution dot
one one or we can say we can write here
caution
underscore 011
right so these names are allowed in an
email id the next part is the at the
rate symbol it's mandatory to add the
symbol in each email id as you know
so the third part is the domain name
that can be the name of any particular
organization like here simply learn is
the domain name
or it can be gmail or yahoo or hotmail
or any of these so that depends on the
user where they have their email id
now the last part is the extension which
comes after a dot so after this dot we
have an extension over here this com is
an extension
fine
an extension can be dot com it can be
dot in or dot net or it can be dot co
dot in
so now that we have an idea about how an
email id looks like the next thing we'll
be doing is working here on the regular
expression to create a particular format
of this type
right so we have four parts but we have
to compulsorily add and add the rate
symbol and
dot before the extension
so what we'll do is we'll take three
pairs of parentheses or round brackets
we can say for defining the rest three
parts so what we'll do is we'll write
here
so we need
three parentheses right now we have to
mention at the rate and dot compulsory
leave fine the rest will define but we
have to add these two symbols
compulsorily in each email id
the caret and the dollar signs are meta
characters used to define the regular
expressions starting and the end points
right so i hope you guys are clear with
regular expressions till now as this is
the last video on this topic and still
if you have any doubts about rejects
feel free to comment your doubts and
we'll get back to you so let's define
the first part here the first part is
the name consisting of alphabets digits
or some specific symbols like dot and
underscore right we'll define a range
here so we'll use square brackets to
define the range so what we'll do is
we'll write here
a to z
or
a to z
or zero to nine
fine here we have defined three ranges
arrange for small letter alphabets
capital letter alphabets and a range of
numbers from 0 to 9. now we could have
used the global modifier at the end of
this regular expression instead of
defining a range of capital letter
alphabets we have already discussed the
concept of modifiers a few sessions back
now the next thing is to add specific
symbols like dot and underscore we can't
write them simply because if we write
here dot or underscore the meaning will
change
and it will return true for any
character in place of dot
the concept of meta characters remember
so we have to put a backslash before
writing the symbols what we'll do is
we'll put a backslash over here
now we have added the special symbols as
well the next part is the length of this
name
now it can be either 10 or maybe 20 or
we can say in some cases let's suppose
it can go more than 20. now what we can
do is we can either define the length
inside curly braces like this we can
write here
2 comma 20. so this is the range for
length but we can't do it here because
we are keeping this thing in mind that
the username might go above 20
characters so what we'll do is we'll use
the plus operator the plus operator will
let the user enter the name as long as
they want
instead of using these curly braces over
here what we'll do is we'll use the plus
operator here
fine
now the next part is for the domain name
after this add the red symbol over here
what we'll do is we'll write the domain
name
that has to be there in each email id
right the domain name can be the name of
any organization as we have already
discussed we don't need digits in the
domain name right so what we'll do is
we'll simply write here
a to z and
a to z so we have defined two ranges for
domain name one for the small letters
and the other one is for the
capital letter alphabets
fine we did it almost the same as name
now again the domain name can be of any
length so we have to use the plus
operator here what we'll do is
we'll first put them inside square
brackets i forgot to mention them here
and then we'll use the plus operator now
the regular expression looks a bit
complicated right but we don't have to
worry about it because these all are
easy things just a little bit lengthy we
can say so the next thing we'll be doing
here is we'll be going through the last
part of a email id after this dot symbol
what we have to do is we have to define
another range for the extension
right the extension can be any alphabet
with a length not more than 6 to 7
right so what we'll do is we'll write
here
a to z only consists of small letters
or we can include capital letters as
well so what we'll do is we'll write
here
a to z as well
now the next thing we'll do is we'll
define the
length of this extension
so we don't need the plus operator here
because the length of any extension
can't be more than 4 5 or 6 maybe right
so what we'll do is we'll define a range
of
length we'll write here 2
and 6 so 2 is the minimum length of
extension and 6 is the maximum length
now save it
and let's check the output so we'll
check for several email ids now what
we'll do is we'll write here
abc at the rate
gmail.com
fine
submit it you can see it says email
submitted successfully let me zoom it
out a bit the next thing we'll do here
is we'll write here
abc
underscore
1 1 at the rate
gmail.com
so one thing we have forgotten here is
to include the carrot character and the
dollar character so we have to specify
the starting and the end point here so
what we did is we have included the
carrot character and the dollar sign
here
now we'll write here abc underscore one
one at the rate
gmail.com
submit it and you can see it says email
submitted successfully so this is a
valid email id now the next thing we'll
be doing here is we'll be using any
random symbol so let's say we are using
here abc star at the rate gmail.com
submit it and you can see it says wrong
email id
now the next thing we'll be doing here
is
we'll write any number here let's see
and we'll write here caution
112.3
fine so
this will return wrong email id because
we have included numbers in domain name
and we haven't defined any range of
numbers for the domain name submit it
and you can see it says wrong email id
now remove these numbers from here
and submit it you can see it says email
submitted successfully so this is
working totally fine
now the last thing is what if we have an
email like
caution112.3 at the rate gmail.com
submit it and you can see it says wrong
email id
in this case we have to define another
range in the regular expression that can
be optional so we have the question mark
symbol that acts as an optional
character it means that any range or
anything return before this meta
character will be optional
so we'll use this symbol
and we'll write here
before this dollar sign will again use
parenthesis and we'll write here dot
a to z
and then we'll define the range as 2
comma 6
and we'll use the question mark sign
here or we can say this optional meta
character here save it
and now what if we write here
caution at the rate gmail dot co dot in
now submit it and you can see it says
email submitted successfully and this is
totally optional if we write here
caution
gmail.com submit it and you can see it
still works fine so this is how we can
validate a user's email id in javascript
we can do a lot more stuff in this i
want you guys to do it so that's all for
