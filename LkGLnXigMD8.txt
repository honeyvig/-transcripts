here if you'd like to see how to

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,290
retrieve information from a parse table

click over here if you'd like to see how

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,210

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,250
rest of my videos in that pattern so

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,149
let's get to it

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,540
so hello there and welcome to another

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,430
tutorial my name is Sonia Bakshi and

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,040
this time we're gonna be going over

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,379
parse and so I know I've already done a

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,570
chatting app tutorial but now I'm also

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,460
going to be going over just hi playing

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,340
how to use parse and so now I went to be

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,620
going over a few main things which are

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,840
retrieving data from the parse database

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,699
then I'm going to teach you how to

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,500
actually upload data into the parse

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,580
database I'm going to teach you how to

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,590
update some information in that table

29
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,049
and also delete some information from

30
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,210
that table and let's get started right

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,760
now in the first of all as you can see

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,250
I've already logged in to parse and I'm

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,560
gone to my dashboard now I'm not going

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,909
to go over how to do that because that

35
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,920
should be very self-explanatory and I

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,170
believe you can also login with Gmail or

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,360
even github or even Facebook so that

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,909
should be quite easy for you to do and

39
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,479
yeah so now what I'm going to just do is

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,240
in our dashboard you see up here there's

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,759
a create a new app button so I'm just

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,000
going to click on that I'm going to

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,979
create my put my face a bit smaller

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,659
actually I'm just going to cover right

45
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,470
there so I'm going to call this new app

46
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,280
parse tutorial ok I'm going to create it

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,670
and now what I'm going to do is I'm

48
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,110
going to click on this Quick Start

49
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,099
button let's click on it make our face a

50
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,940
bit smaller and now I don't always

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,790
recommend for you to do

52
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,560
is click on the data button now you can

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,060
choose any of these but since I'm

54
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,680
developing for iOS I'm just going to

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,030
click on mobile iOS now you can choose

56
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,890
between objective-c Swift or if you're

57
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,590
using this amber in c-sharp so I'm just

58
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,290
going to collect select Swift let's just

59
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,030
click on the new project button the

60
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,349
existing project button will be an

61
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,739
entirely different video then what

62
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:40,819
you're going to do is you're going to

63
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,829
click on this blue button here download

64
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:48,680
the blank Xcode project now you can just

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,629
uh go over here and wait for it to be

66
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,290
done downloading

67
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,799
and so now as you can see I've extracted

68
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:15,099
it and so what I can do is I believe yes

69
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,230
what you do once you extract it and go

70
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,769
into it double click on par starter it's

71
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,900
all your project Swift and then

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,540
double-click the Xcode project this

73
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,909
should open up the actual Xcode project

74
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:33,670
that you are developing for now what I'm

75
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,540
just quickly going to do is come over

76
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,150
here and since I'm actually developing

77
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,660
for iOS 9 not 9.1 I'm going to send it

78
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,849
to 9.0 perfect so now what I'm going to

79
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,310
do as you can see this has already been

80
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,959
set up by par so it's a nice app

81
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,659
delegate I believe yep all our

82
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:59,079
frameworks should already be imported as

83
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,459
you can see whatever is required and so

84
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,079
all we need to do is enter in our

85
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,690
application ID and we should be good to

86
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,430
go so what we're going to do is we're

87
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,720
going to go back into this parse

88
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,389
QuickStart page we're going to copy this

89
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,349
little code that they gave us we're

90
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:19,150
going to go into application did finish

91
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,990
launching with options and we're going

92
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,900
to take this little part where it says

93
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,190
uncomment and fill in with your parse

94
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,039
credentials parse set application ID

95
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,130
your application ID and your client keep

96
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,720
paste it in and now effectively what

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,940
we've done is we've told parts that yes

98
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,770
we are this person connecting to this

99
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,470
table and so we want access and so parse

100
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,900
it can be like yeah sure and now we can

101
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,370
access that entire parse database and so

102
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,620
that'll be good so now we can go to into

103
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,650
any table retrieve add update and even

104
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,970
Billy so now in order to actually use

105
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,620
these features I'm going to be really

106
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,570
simply just using the print commands for

107
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,910
now not creating any fancy UI this is

108
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,169
due to the fact that I just want to

109
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,180
explain how posh works too I don't want

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,520
to overcomplicate you with a UI and this

111
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,460
and that this is for beginners of course

112
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,199
so what I'm going to do

113
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,469
he's in our muted load function let's

114
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:25,629
demonstrate adding a row but wait what

115
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,120
are we adding a row - well in order to

116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,099
solve this let's go back to parse sorry

117
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:38,680
and let's click on this core button then

118
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,090
let's click on add class make sure this

119
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,159
is set to custom and let's just set this

120
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:49,240
class name to messages now let's add a

121
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,509
column to this table let's make sure

122
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,219
this is a string and let's name this the

123
00:05:54,219 --> 00:06:00,279
message and that's also how to column a

124
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,699
name at the number meaning which

125
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,789
actually sorry this has to be a number

126
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:10,360
so this is a number called number I'm

127
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,099
just going to take this call over here

128
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,409
that we just created a number and drag

129
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,839
it over here beside message you don't

130
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,580
need to do this it's completely optional

131
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,219
but you know it's more clean and easy

132
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:22,599
for you to see okay message number

133
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,370
residence number actually you can even

134
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,810
put the number before the message

135
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,099
because that makes more sense because

136
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,259
that's the unique not the unique because

137
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,240
object you get the point anyway

138
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,779
continuing now how do we add a row into

139
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,909
this table it's simple

140
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,860
first of all we need to do is we need to

141
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,610
define this row how do we define this

142
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,819
row we create a VAR object which is

143
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:53,409
equal to a new PF object but there's a

144
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:53,979
problem

145
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,680
we need an initializer and so if I do

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,389
this as you can see it fills in this

147
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,800
initializer class name for me and so I'm

148
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,399
going to give it the class name messages

149
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,080
because as you can see over here we gave

150
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,460
it messages and of course I exclude us

151
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,229
to load because it's really really slow

152
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,729
okay so now that we've decline and sorry

153
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,330
decline declared our objects what we can

154
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,240
do is we can say object dots set object

155
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,870
now we're going to say

156
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,020
we want the message named my name is

157
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,639
Tammy Bakshi for the message and for the

158
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,830
and so I went is also set number one for

159
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:49,490
the number and this should actually work

160
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,560
now what's going to happen it's going to

161
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,900
set the message to my name is Hannah

162
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,570
Bakshi and I'll set the number to one of

163
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,490
course I'm not going to go to the actual

164
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,940
database and find the number yet because

165
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,190
that would be way too much coding but

166
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,710
this is just a simple explanation of how

167
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,130
you'd actually save into parse but

168
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,570
there's a problem we're only setting

169
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,280
objects we're not actually saving into

170
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,680
the table so in order to do this let's

171
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,350
forest try object dot save because I

172
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,840
know that in my case this will work but

173
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,370
in your case you can implement air

174
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,229
handling because again air handling is

175
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,419
an entirely separate video for now I'm

176
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:27,620
just trying to teach you how to use

177
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,720
parse

178
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,160
now if I make the deployment target my

179
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,669
iPhone and if I run now gonna not going

180
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,610
to stream my iphone to my Mac because

181
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,020
you only really need to see what it

182
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,729
prints out not even prints out at this

183
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,870
stage whatever comes over here so as you

184
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,029
can see this should eventually run and

185
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,839
if all goes well it should give us this

186
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,080
warning perfect so now if we got a parse

187
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,089
and we reload by clicking on this little

188
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,029
refresh button here as you can see

189
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,170
number one

190
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,010
my name is Tana Bakshi we have inserted

191
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,440
this row into our table now what else

192
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,790
can we do

193
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,300
uh let's take this for an example now

194
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,750
that we've added a row again I'm going

195
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,020
to keep this code in the actual source

196
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,440
code or actually nevermind let's just do

197
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,089
this because we don't want to save it

198
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,230
again I'm just going to comment that out

199
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,790
okay so now that we've actually added a

200
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,180
row

201
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,690
let's try retrieving the information

202
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,110
that's already in the database now how

203
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,310
do we do this

204
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,880
first of all let's just declare a query

205
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,620
which is equal to a new PF query and of

206
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,970
course again we're going to give it a

207
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,089
class name aka table name and I'm going

208
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,259
to again give it messages then what I'm

209
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,399
going to do is I'm going to say I think

210
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,940
it's a yeah var objects is equal to

211
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,060
query dot find objects and of course way

212
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,880
to force try this now this is an array

213
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,889
of PF objects but what if we wanted to

214
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,750
print it out in a special way or we need

215
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,060
this information in a normal string

216
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,930
string or string any object dictionary

217
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,560
well in order to do this what I do is

218
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,610
say var final objects is equal to string

219
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,339
any object and this is actually an array

220
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,779
of this and so now we can loop through

221
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,980
the actual objects and so it's going to

222
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,670
happen is we're going to say final

223
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,120
objects dot append a blank dictionary

224
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,269
then final objects the last element

225
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:05,810
meaning final objects dot count

226
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:12,630
minus one specifically message will be

227
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,160
set to J which is the loop parameter

228
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,230
that we made the value for key message

229
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,860
as string then what we can do is we can

230
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,760
do the same thing

231
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,019
final objects final objects count minus

232
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,019
one meaning the last dictionary we're

233
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,490
setting the number to J dot value for

234
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:50,819
key number as a string so us effectively

235
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,649
what we're doing is we're taking the

236
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,620
message from the specific object from

237
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,120
this array

238
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
converting it to a string and putting it

239
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,400
into a final into the final objects

240
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
dictionary which is the last dictionary

241
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,650
in an array of more dictionaries of

242
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,839
values from this objects alright sounds

243
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,820
complicated right now but once I print

244
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,080
out the final objects won't really seen

245
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,130
this hard now it should actually print

246
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,100
out the my name is anand bakshi number

247
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,220
one oh sorry I made a mistake unless I

248
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,910
caught that integer not string a number

249
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,910
can't be a string unless you got that

250
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,040
and as you can see it has worked

251
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
perfectly and now in order to prove that

252
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,510
this actually does work I'm going to add

253
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,290
another row from within parts number two

254
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:57,740
message hi I'm new here

255
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,400
okay so now if I run this app it should

256
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,970
give us exactly what I typed in as you

257
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,520
can see it retrieves all the contents

258
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,000
from the parse table now we can

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,350
effectively retrieve all rows but what

260
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,089
about updating a row well that's also

261
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:31,709
quite simple in order to update yeah

262
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:38,730
update a row all we need to do is say

263
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,279
okay first of all we're going to do

264
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,380
create a query so this is going to be a

265
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,560
new query PF query of course it's not

266
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:57,140
error code query of class name messages

267
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,930
next what we're going to do is we're

268
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,530
going to say query dot we're key or

269
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,540
sorry not this one

270
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,150
we're key

271
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,320
equal to in my case where the number is

272
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,170
1 let's update the message to yay it

273
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,270
worked so first of all we've said the

274
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:31,490
query should look for a key number where

275
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,390
it's 1 so now let's get the object value

276
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,190
of that by doing query get first object

277
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,540
so this is effects we're going to do

278
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,660
it's going to get the object value of

279
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,720
the actual row it'll basically get the

280
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,800
row where number is equal to 1 or at

281
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,480
least the first row where number is

282
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,170
equal to 1

283
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,030
not sure about if there's any others

284
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,440
it'll just get the first one now I'm

285
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,930
just going to make this a let object so

286
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,040
it stops giving me a warning and so now

287
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,750
I'm going to say object dot set object

288
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,490
let's just say let's just say the new

289
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:22,100
message is yay it worked and let's set

290
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,210
this for the message of course and now

291
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,390
let's save this on to our parse server

292
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,810
and theoretically this should go to the

293
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,790
parse table update my name is anand

294
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,210
bakshi

295
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,320
into yay it worked so let's actually run

296
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
this code

297
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,770
okay no exception and if we go over here

298
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:59,620
and refresh it changed now

299
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,360
we're going to do the last thing and

300
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,710
this is actually very very fun it's

301
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,570
basically just updating with a little

302
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,160
bit of a twist so what we're going to do

303
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,940
now is we're going to delete a row so

304
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,880
now how do we delete a row you ask

305
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,920
well actually what I'm just going to do

306
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,140
is I'm going to copy this much code from

307
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,120
updating and I'm just going to say

308
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,900
object dot delete it was literally that

309
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,560
simple and now it'll delete yeah it

310
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,060
worked because we're deleting wherever

311
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,390
the number is one or at least the first

312
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,470
row where numbers one and so now if i

313
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:53,730
refresh number one is gone and it worked

314
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,510
and yeah that's pretty much it for this

315
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:03,490
tutorial and really quickly yeah that

316
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,720
was actually pretty much it for this

317
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,490
tutorial again if you enjoyed please

318
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,170
