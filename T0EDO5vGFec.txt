2
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:16,770
so Walter and welcome to another

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,670
tutorial

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,550
my name is Timmy Bakshi and this time

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,380
we're going to be going over how you can

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,170
use a year off neural network in order

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,390
to classify it between two different

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,630
types of hearing disorders now actually

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,880
this is going to be the first video in a

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,200
new series that I'm going to be doing

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,360
called healthcare and the range from

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,420
anything related to healthcare and of

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,710
course we're going mixing in a lot of

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,960
Technology and AI to make it really

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,050
really interesting alright selectman so

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,239
today what we're going to be doing is

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,370
we're going to be taking a data set from

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,280
the UCI machine learning repository and

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,930
we're going to be using it to train a

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,969
neural network powered by the near off

21
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,570
API in order to create a neural network

22
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,030
that can take some actions about a

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,339
person and classify whether he has a

24
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,950
normal ear an ear or a nearly two

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,350
different types of hearing disorders and

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,070
now let's talk about that alright so

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,439
basically the data set that I'm going to

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,250
be using was actually donated in 1992

29
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,590
and so basically what within you is the

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,750
data set consumes around 200 different

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,360
rows of training data and what we're

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,009
going to be doing here is we're actually

33
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,140
going to take like Golden Rose not

34
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,939
treating data and by the way there are

35
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,380
69 input attributes about the people

36
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,299
that are in this data set so 69 training

37
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:45,570
attributes and so basically the neural

38
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,570
network is said 69 attributes about the

39
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,920
person who is who is going into or who

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,540
is going to be classified by this neural

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,420
network and what's going to happen is

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,250
these 59 attributes will of course go to

43
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,170
a little hidden layer the hidden layer

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,170
will calculate somatic values that we

45
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,759
really don't care about just yet

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,849
and then those values will be given our

47
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,790
out will give us our output

48
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,760
this output will classify what type of

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,109
hearing further they have so basically

50
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:18,150
as a fiddler going to input 69

51
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,129
attributes of hot our patient or really

52
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:22,109
any person and we're going to send that

53
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,150
the neural network over here this is our

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,379
neural network phase and then we are

55
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,200
going to output either if the user or

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,799
the patient has a normal ear or if their

57
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:43,769
cochlea has aged and that's their

58
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:46,889
hearing problem or if it's something to

59
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,669
do with their cochlea but we don't

60
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:55,049
exactly know what it is all right so

61
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,389
that's basically what would we be doing

62
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,129
today and I'll explain a lot more about

63
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:00,750
what's going on in the middle of the

64
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,480
neural network in the actual coding part

65
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,659
but I get to go to a little science

66
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,099
explanation right now

67
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,389
ah so if you're wondering what exactly

68
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:14,220
cochlea means here what's actually quite

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,349
simple the cochlear is responsible for

70
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,069
well your hearing and so what happens

71
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,139
easy cochlea is actually powered by

72
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,780
something called the vestibular cochlear

73
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,739
nerve and the vestibular cochlear nerve

74
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,209
basically is one of the one of the

75
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,440
twelve this is the eighth cranial nerve

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,909
which goes from your inner ear in your

77
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,010
cochlea to your brain and so basically

78
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,280
what color of white cranial nervous

79
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,690
cranial nerves they're actually twelve

80
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,389
cranial nerves and so these are nerves

81
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,400
that don't originate from the spinal

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,650
cord but instead originate straight from

83
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,729
the inside your brain and so this is

84
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,949
what that would be one of those nerves

85
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,829
and so basically the vestibulocochlear

86
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,599
nerve can also be called the auditory

87
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,400
vestibular nerve and as the name

88
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,069
suggests not only does it does it

89
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,549
control your hearing and yeah your

90
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,220
hearing it also does I handle things

91
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,289
like your balance and of course the

92
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,120
equal equilibrium of your body and

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,190
making sure you don't tip over as you're

94
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,380
standing up straight and so that's neat

95
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,820
agree what that does although the

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,980
cochlear is only cancer

97
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,050
hearing in the labyrinth does all the

98
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,710
Elda balancing this nerve transmit that

99
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,570
transmit sound information from inner

100
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,560
ear to the brain but now though without

101
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,690
any more further ado what we're going to

102
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,700
do is I'm actually going to go over to

103
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,740
the code part now where I'm going to

104
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,950
show you exactly how you can implement

105
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,620
this neural network and of course we're

106
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,300
going to be reaching around a ninety

107
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,490
eight point nine percent accuracy on

108
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,850
this data set all right so let's get to

109
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,500
the color part now where I'm going to be

110
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,720
showing you how exactly you can do all

111
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,090
this

112
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,920
alright so welcome back to the code part

113
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,110
and now I'm going to show you how

114
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,970
exactly you can import your data sets

115
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,580
and train this neural network that I

116
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,620
have created

117
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,570
alright so let's begin our now I've

118
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,760
actually got two data sets the training

119
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,280
data set the testing data set so one man

120
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,530
is only the certain links down in the

121
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,270
description actually download those two

122
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,190
data sets but if you'd like to even

123
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,140
actually attain your own neural network

124
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,180
on this exact same thing as well because

125
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,890
what I thought I had done by taking back

126
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,380
down non-standard data that was provided

127
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,570
with this data set and I convert it into

128
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,490
my standard data so you can easily

129
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,670
import it into your neural networks

130
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,550
because right now is also troublesome to

131
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,790
get it into your neural networks due to

132
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,380
the fact that it's not a standard data

133
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,930
sets it's not a bit sorry not a standard

134
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,210
format for data set but now I've

135
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,340
converted it to one so that you can take

136
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,100
a look at that alright so let's take a

137
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,050
look at how this is going to work I

138
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,360
thought I already got my data set and

139
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,980
one of the training one of the test set

140
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,260
and by the studio here what I start

141
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,330
having done is we're going to create a

142
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,910
new data set under training set we're

143
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,840
going to call this audiology training

144
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,410
and we can have 69 on Friday 59 69 input

145
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,810
and we are going to have three output

146
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,690
course one into normal ear okapi or

147
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,810
eight or so clear something we're going

148
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,460
to be loading with is that from a file

149
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,070
and all of course this file will be for

150
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,590
my downloads here although I have

151
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,650
created this on Marcel

152
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,870
pinnacle and it's called ring final

153
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,500
audios rcfe I'm going to click on finish

154
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,169
them and as you can see we successfully

155
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,440
imports my 99 rolls of training data I'm

156
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,520
going to click OK

157
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,040
and I'm going to tell us to save with

158
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,380
new data set under test steps I'm going

159
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,419
to create another new data set and I'm

160
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,949
going to call this audiology testing of

161
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,930
course we're going to have 69 inputs and

162
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,310
three outputs once more and it's going

163
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,320
to be loading this up from a testing

164
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,750
file that I've created called testers

165
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,600
svse and you can see successfully

166
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,760
imported my few rows of training data

167
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,710
I'm going to click OK and tell it to

168
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,870
save this is then what I'm going to be

169
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,400
doing is I'm going to try to note on

170
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,440
your onion feed forward neural network

171
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,210
or in this case T is called a

172
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,360
multi-layer perceptron network and so

173
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,970
once seen on main your network I'm going

174
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,850
to call this audiology on 9 neurons

175
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,740
because we're having we're going to have

176
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,860
nineteen-year-old in our freedoms layer

177
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,510
and so building in a color network and

178
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,820
of course it's a multi-layer perceptron

179
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,860
type network we're going to click on

180
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,950
next and force within a 16-9 put me off

181
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,500
and you've all forgotten 90 15 year-olds

182
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,530
as well as 3 output we're going to make

183
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,300
sure we do use eyes neurons the third

184
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,460
thing help us make generalizations and

185
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,680
we are going to connect our we are not

186
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,270
going to connecting our input to alpha

187
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,820
you're on after that we're going to

188
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,470
begin a new transfer function or the

189
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,970
activation function as it's more

190
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,150
commonly known as sigmoid instead of

191
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,010
hyperbolic tangents that are really

192
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,300
lowly normal back propagation

193
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,349
full-on sex on we're going to click on

194
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,630
finish and you can see it creates our

195
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,750
nice little neural network here has 69

196
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,449
in for CTL books as well as 19 years in

197
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,880
between now if we were to do the math

198
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,190
here as you can see we've got this come

199
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,789
to 6970 connections from ankle to

200
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:31,800
feeding and competed alphabets activism

201
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,010
semi-sweet and since we've also got bias

202
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,450
neurons you mix if we want to do 70

203
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,020
times 91 times

204
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,960
this should be exactly how many neurons

205
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,370
in half folk are and this to be nine now

206
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,870
sorry how many connections between

207
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,360
neurons that we have in total and it

208
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,130
should have between nineteen thousand

209
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,470
month the hot 100 in ten different

210
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,649
connections between our neurons from the

211
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,700
layers where is that is how we or are

212
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,370
technically actually this should not

213
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,649
have been agent efficient have been

214
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,339
calculated that way it should be seventy

215
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,060
times nine one which is that and then

216
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,209
Plus that 91 times three operator

217
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,670
actually how many connections we have in

218
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,339
total sorry Elsa incorrect past there

219
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,950
Bob this is actual total number of

220
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,610
connections we have between our neurons

221
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,860
and so are actually the guilty pleas

222
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,110
network for these many connections now

223
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,209
line in D is I actually want to drag in

224
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,640
my training dataset from the training

225
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,520
set here to Mia's neural network and you

226
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,470
can see it grabs that training dataset

227
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,510
and I'm going to click on train button

228
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,750
and then it with a maximum error to 0.01

229
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,950
and what I'm going to do is a

230
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,360
millisecond learning rate in young men

231
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,760
comes to normal values and currently

232
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,670
that is 0.2 in 0.7 respectively of

233
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,020
course I'm going to tell if you stole my

234
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,730
error graph so I can actually see how

235
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,230
the how the training is going for now

236
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,750
I'm going to go to click on train now

237
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,760
this may take a moment or maybe not

238
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,560
depending on how the computer wants to

239
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,170
teach us and it ok you can see it was a

240
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,630
key very quick Bob just under 150

241
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,170
iterations required to uses error rate

242
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,400
what I'm going to do then is I'm going

243
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,890
to actually drag in our testing data set

244
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,570
and I'm going to click on the test

245
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,690
button and you can see our total mean

246
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,930
square error here in there that 0 159

247
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,529
here - tssss but we're going to do 1 -

248
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,950
live and then multiply this by 100 and

249
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,149
you can see what's currently leaking

250
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:46,270
nine eighty three percent accuracy but

251
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,450
as re many points in percent accuracy

252
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,279
and so this is actually quite good

253
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,829
accuracy imagine for just a 0.01 error

254
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:55,029
rate which is actually quite high

255
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,200
technically not high

256
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,540
but it isn't a Louis area that you can

257
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,460
hope work and we were able to achieve

258
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,160
quite a very nice accuracy actually and

259
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,200
as you can see that for example black

260
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,740
foam here the desired output was 0 1 0

261
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,850
I'm the real networks outputted almost 0

262
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,010
0.99 in an almost 0 even though these

263
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,350
numbers here are not in the training

264
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,940
data set the swimming I really like the

265
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,790
test those numbers were not serious

266
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,920
training data sets attack training and

267
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,140
test a completely separate the neural

268
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,640
network has never been exposed to these

269
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
into supports never been sold with the

270
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,450
outputs are for these inputs and we were

271
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,100
still able to achieve such a nice error

272
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,560
rate in fact if I just saw note this

273
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,680
down 98.3% and if you would a train

274
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,020
again about what I can do is even

275
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,240
further decreases error rate let's just

276
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,840
say 0.05 but the thing is I'm going in

277
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,750
increments here because it's already and

278
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,160
the reason going in increments here and

279
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,960
another thing opening 100 also a really

280
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,510
small error rate oh and I need a mistake

281
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,970
I tend the neural networks on the

282
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,260
testing set that's something you should

283
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,140
never do let's create a new neural

284
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,970
network here let's create this second

285
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,070
Network I can say network configuration

286
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,930
so wait to bring in a trance again and

287
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,080
we're just a cheap a slightly lower

288
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,600
error rate on the training set now again

289
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,700
the reason other thing for the reason

290
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,200
going in these sort of influence here

291
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,730
and they're not just rates going for a

292
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,010
really small error rate is because the

293
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,350
thing is I don't want to over fit to my

294
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,840
dreams that that my test set gets hardly

295
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,610
in the accuracy at all because right now

296
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,280
we're going 98.3% but if my neural

297
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,050
network would have just memorized within

298
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,640
my training set and not really

299
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,590
generalized to the fact that ok these

300
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,300
parameters means normally release

301
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,280
parameters in your cochlear and you can

302
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,810
these parameters means normal cochlear

303
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,840
issues then what happened means it's

304
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,550
really 1 or if there's no point it's

305
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,960
just memorizing the inputs and outputs

306
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,750
to everything that's why you want to go

307
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,490
in increments here and in fact if you'd

308
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,260
like to know more about what I'm doing

309
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,870
called it really swapping algorithm and

310
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,370
you can actually see video about that

311
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,200
that I created that's on my youtube

312
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,490
channel a link to that will be the

313
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,300
description below

314
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,820
Oh

315
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,110
but now as you can see we've gone to a

316
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,870
slightly lower error rate I need to drag

317
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,330
in the testing set and click on tests as

318
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,770
you can see if I just paste this in here

319
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,610
we have now launched a 98.7% accurate in

320
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,360
rounding that by the way 98.6 70 more

321
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,840
precise and our percent accuracy and you

322
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,160
can see we're just going up and up and

323
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,590
up as we are continuing to Train it's

324
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,240
just that again what could happen is

325
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,490
like for example if I were to go back to

326
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,590
my neural network click on the train

327
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,810
button and then get maybe too low of an

328
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,210
error rate but maybe not exists well

329
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,210
let's try this low for example now that

330
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:49,930
was quick

331
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,690
I'll just test it once more then where I

332
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,820
trained it all the testing set again but

333
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,230
you know you probably do get my point

334
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,190
where we want to Train it to a certain

335
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,560
point where the accuracy on the training

336
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,420
set doesn't really matter to us

337
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,280
it's the accuracy on the test set

338
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,840
because the training set is something

339
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,250
that the neural network can always just

340
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,740
memorize if you think about it we want

341
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,270
the neural network to be able to take

342
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,280
inputs that it's never seen before there

343
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,960
to being a completely unique case and

344
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,760
it's never referred for someone who's

345
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,970
let's say 23 years old and has these

346
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,440
parameters it's never heard from that

347
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,030
type of person before it but we still

348
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,370
want people to think that ok usually

349
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,020
these attributes are associated with

350
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,510
cochlear age be that successful see with

351
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,310
normal ears and then weigh those

352
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,320
together and then finally find our

353
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,420
answer but if we're just memorizing a

354
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,180
few casings is no point release is no

355
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,240
bug that's why I recommend you always

356
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,920
clean these things in increments unless

357
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,020
you have some default implementation of

358
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,930
an early stopping algorithm in place in

359
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,670
which case that is absolutely perfect

360
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,640
and you can continue to train until you

361
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,900
believe that your accuracy on the test

362
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,300
set is going up and then down to stop it

363
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,670
at its peak in fact you can find out

364
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,290
more I'm not going to go into too much

365
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,720
detail about this algorithm but you can

366
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,190
find out more about that in a separate

367
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,290
video that I created about overfitting

368
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,480
neural networks and memorization versus

369
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,990
generalizations oh but that is going to

370
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,840
be a full this video too okay so I have

371
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,090
to buy one but that would be it for this

372
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,250
video today thank you very much for

373
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,250

like the video please - make sure to

375
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,400
LIKE the video and if you think this

376
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,380
could help anybody else for emails like

377
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,580
your friends or family please do

379
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,510
course though if you have any more

380
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,430
questions suggestions or feedback please

392
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,130
content of course though if you really

393
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,660
like my content you want to feel a lot

394
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,800
more of it we need to consider

much for watching today that's going to

399
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,930
be it for this tutorial

400
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,710
goodbye
