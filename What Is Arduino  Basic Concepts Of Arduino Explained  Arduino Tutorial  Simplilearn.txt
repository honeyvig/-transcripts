hello everyone welcome to another video
by simply learn in this video we will
learn about uino the arino platform has
grown in popularity among those just
getting started with electronics and for
good purpose in contrast to the majority
of earlier programmable circuit boards
to load new code onto the ardo you don't
need a separate piece of Hardware all
you just need is a USB cable let's see
what's in it for you in this session we
will first start with understanding what
is
arvino followed by which we will see why
to use ardino then we will look at some
of the important features of arino after
that we'll see the different types of
arino
boods and at last we will see advantages
and disadvantages of arino but before we
begin make sure you have subscribed to
our YouTube channel and clicked on the
Bell icon so you never miss an update
from Simply Lear so without any further
Ado let's get
started what is
uino Arduino is an open source
electronic Gadget that treats input such
as light on a sensor a finger on a
button or a tweet and generates output
based on those inputs such as turning on
an LED or activating a Mot
adino was created at the design
Institute as a simple tool for students
with no preer experience with
electronics or
programming aduino boards are
microcontrollers not entire computers
with operating system of their own like
the Raspberry
Pi adino just run C or C++ code that is
stored in the
firmware the adino IDE is free software
that allows you to create and upload
code on an aduino
board why
adino aduino has been used in millions
of projects and applications due to its
simple and accessible user
interface the adino software is simple
to use for beginners but it is
customizable for advanced users
it works on Mac windows and Linux
systems aduino is a valuable tool for
learning new skills anyone including
youngsters amateurs artists and
programmers Can Begin tinkering by
simply following the step-by-step
instructions it can be used by teachers
and students to create lowcost
scientific equipments to demonstrate
chemistry and physics principles and to
begin learning prog programming and
Robotics designers and Architects create
interactive prototypes while musicians
and artists create installations and try
out new
instruments features of
arino adino has microcontroller of at
Mega 328 and the operating voltage is 5
volts whereas the input voltage is
recommended to be from 7 to 12 volts and
input voltage limits from 6 to 20 volts
we have digital input output pins that
is we have 14 pins and we have analog
input six pins and we have DC current
per input output pin 40
milliamp and DC current for 3.3 volt pin
is 50 mamp and we have flash memory of
32
kiloby and we have S Ram of 2 KB and E
ROM of 1 KB and we have clock speed of
16
mahz now let us look at the different
types of arino boards present firstly we
have arino Uno arino Uno includes
everything you will need to get started
it has 14 digital input output pins six
analog input a USB port a power jack and
a reset button among other features it
comes with everything you will need to
get started with the microcontrol
plug into a computer with USB cable or
power it with an AC to DC adapter or
battery next we have lyad adino lyad is
variable e textile device created by Lee
and designed in collaboration with spark
fun each Lily Pad was cleverly
constructed with large connection pads
and a flat back to sue conductive thread
into garments in addition the lily pad
features its own set of input output
power and sensor boards designed
exclusively for eex tiles and can even
be
washed Adin Omega the Adin mea is the
larger brother of arino Uno it contains
many digital input output pins that is
54 and 16 analog inputs a USB connection
a power jack and a reset button it comes
with everything you will need to get
started with microcontroller plug it
into a computer with USB cable or power
it with the AC to DC adopter or a
battery RedBoard uino the aduino ID can
program the RedBoard over the use of
mini B connector it will run on Windows
8 without requiring changes to your
security settings because of the USB
chip we used it's more study and it's
fully flat on the back making it easier
to integrate into your projects
and we have adino Leonardo the Leonardo
is Ado's initial development board with
a single microcontroller and USB port as
a result it may be less expensive and
easier additionally because the board
handles USB directly board libraries are
available that allow the board to
imitate a computer keyboard mouse and
other
components now let us look at the
advantages of arino
in comparison to the other
microcontroller system adino boards are
comparatively affordable the adino
module his cheapest version can be
assembled by hand and even pre-made uino
module cost less than
$50 for Windows Macintosh OS X and Linux
the aduino software IDE is provided the
vast majority of microcontroller systems
are windows only
compatible the adino software simple for
beginners but it's also flexible enough
for advanced
users for experienced programmers the
adino software is available as an
open-source tool to extent people who
want to learn more about the language
can use C++ libraries and those who want
to learn more about technical specifics
can switch from arino to avrc
programming
language the adino is an open source and
has Hardware that can be expanded the
adino board blueprints are made
available under creative common license
allowing experience circuits designers
to create their module version extending
and upgrading
it at last we will look at the
disadvantages of
adino adino cannot run multiple programs
at a time no memory safety checks
expensive for CPU power and memory
it has lack of buil-in
communications lack of buil-in
peripherals The Limited number of
programming languages and a limited
number of
Ides so with that we have reached the
end of this video thank you so much for
being here keep learning and stay tuned
