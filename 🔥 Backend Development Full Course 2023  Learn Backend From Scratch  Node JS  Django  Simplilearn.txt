hello everyone and welcome back to
another video by simply learn in this
video we will see a comprehensive full
course on back-end development back-end
development refers to the process of
creating and maintaining server-side
components of a software application or
website it involves building the logic
and functionalities that runs behind the
scenes and support the user interface
data storage and interaction with the
client side which is the front end of
the application but before we move
forward if you want to become a software
developer consider the course on full
stack web developer means tag by simply
learn and master those necessary skills
you can also consider a postgraduate
program by Caltech in full stack web
development the link will be in the
description box so now let's move to the
agenda for this full course first we
will see introduction to backend
development in which we we will cover
what is back-end development back-end
developer skills back-end developer
roles and responsibilities and back-end
development salary and we will tell you
how we can help you after that we will
see front-end development versus
back-end development
moving ahead we will explain you node.js
with express.js when we will also create
a project using node.js and express.js
which is a user registration form after
that we will see what is Django you will
learn concepts of Django in depth moving
ahead we will explain you SQL which is a
database after that we will explain you
mongodb moving ahead we will tell you
what is GitHub and how we can use it for
the development purpose and moving ahead
we will see how to become a back-end
developer and after that we will see top
6 projects to add to your resume in 2023
that can help you land a good job and
then we will see backend interview
questions and answers that are
frequently Asked in the interviews we
will cover topics that will help you
showcase your expertise and you can land
a great job in the domain of back in
development this comprehensive course
will give you the skills and knowledge
needed to become a proficient backend
developer so without further Ado let's
get started but before that let's see
what our Learners say about us
learning is growing and we not only
decided to grow together in life but
learn and succeed together as well I
successfully switched my career to post
a Java domain with a 15 salary hike and
I was able to grab new opportunities in
my current organization and also receive
a 10 salary hike hey I am swamijit Basu
I am a senior QA engineer at Encore Inc
Skilling Journey
and certainly we made the right choice
after our marriage I had to relocate to
Bangalore and take a year Gap after
working 45 years but I decided to
restart my career again and make a
switch to software domain so I enrolled
myself in full stack Java developer
program from Simply learn seeing my
wife's passion for learning every day
inspired me to take up a course on
simply learn as well I've always been
passionate about technology and learning
devops was always in my bucket list when
I saw simply learns collaboration with
Caltech ctme I decided to take a course
on PG devops after the course I not only
switched my career to full stack Java
development with a 15 increment in the
salary but now also I can work from home
since it's a software domain and being
the new mom that's the best thing one
could ask for to spend time with little
one during these early years
for me learning devops was fun and
fulfilling at the same time earlier I
had to rely on others at work but after
upskilling myself I single-handedly can
set up the entire blueprint on my code
base alone and get the desired output
and because of that I could grab new
projects in my organization with a 10
salary high we enrolled to upskill
ourselves
simply learn would be undoubtedly very
special to both of us while doing the
course we did come across a lot of
challenges due to the pregnancy but my
wife show me was a great inspiration for
me as she was handling it all together
and she kept motivating and inspiring me
all the way moreover the recorded
classes and the weekend class helped us
maintain the balance between work and
learning apart from work we love to
spend time with our little one learning
that simply Learned was quite a
fulfilling experience for both of us we
believe that God doesn't happen
overnight rather it's a journey of
several small steps and upskilling is
one of them hey guys
I'm sure you all have heard about
phrases like web development front-end
development back in development and so
on
but if you're not sure about what
exactly they mean don't worry you're in
the right place
in this video we will focus on back-end
development
I suggest you check out our other videos
on fronten versus backend and full start
development
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update
so here are the topics that we're going
to be covering
first we'll see what exactly back-end
development is
then we'll understand who exactly your
backend developer is
moving on we look at some of the skills
that a back-end developer must have
finally we look at some of the job roles
and job responsibilities of a back-end
developer
from there we look at the salary of a
back-end developer
and lastly I'll let you know how we can
help you so first let's begin by
understanding what back-end development
is
now web development that occurs at the
back end of programs is accurately
termed as back-end development
back-end development covers the
server-side application logic like
integration writing apis creating
libraries and working with system
components as opposed to front-end
development which focuses on customer
facing services and programs now back in
development involves ensuring data
integrity and consistency and also
involves scripting and writing code to
communicate with the database
now that you know what back-end
development is I'm sure you have an idea
about what a back-end developer does but
to name a few a back-end developer is
the one who builds an effective website
architecture
who also writes code to communicate with
the database and again as mentioned
ensures data integrity and consistency
now essentially a back-end developer
handles what you don't see they're in
charge of the back end of a website
which includes servers database
applications and so forth
so if you wish to become a back-end
developer you can but there are a few
skills that you need to have
so let's look at the skills that you
need to hone to become a successful
back-end developer
first up is data structures and
algorithms now you must have a good
understanding of data structures and
algorithms understanding how the data is
being stored is crucial
so Concepts like Stacks queues linked
lists sorting and search algorithms are
important
next we have programming languages and
Frameworks
one of the most critical skills of a
back-end developer is the in-depth
knowledge of back-end programming
languages this includes JavaScript and
its environments like node.js and
express.js Java in particular was built
from the ground up to be run on server
side so popular JavaScript Frameworks
like spring and JSF are also important
moving ahead we have python which is the
most popularly used language now it is
flexible and easy to use so there are
Frameworks like Django and flask again
these are crucial and it's important to
have a good understanding of these
Frameworks
we also have C sharp which is a
preferred architecture for backend
programming so it includes asp.net code
and net MVC now other programming
languages include PHP Pearl and Ruby and
since back-end and front-end developers
work so closely it's also helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end web Technologies like HTML and
CSS
proficiency is required not only for
performing daily tasks but also for
working alongside front-end developers
to develop Solutions
so moving ahead we have Version Control
now Version Control Systems help manage
the project files and keep track of the
entire history of users things
so popular ones are get GitHub and
subversion
now git helps manage the project files
it keeps track of the entire history of
things that the user is working on right
and GitHub is a web-based service for
Version Control using git
moving ahead we have database Management
Systems
now a back-end developer writes code
that is used to perform relational
mapping to fetch data from the database
so some popularly used database
management systems are MySQL they're
supposed to SQL SQL server and you also
have mongodb
and lastly we have web hosting platforms
now web hosting platforms allow you to
deploy your product on a cloud service
provider so it can be accessed from the
World Wide Web
now popular ones are Amazon web services
Google Cloud platform Heroku and
Microsoft azure
now of course a backend developer should
also possess non-technical skills like
problem solving critical thinking decent
communication practices and analytical
skills now they should be a debt to
working independently as well as in a
collaborative team
now that you're familiar with the skills
let's have a look at the key
responsibilities and roles of a back-end
developer
to begin with roles a back-end developer
could be assigned the following roles
back in developer Java developer full
stack developer devops engineer software
engineer and iOS Developer
and here is a list of responsibilities
first up
is to form an understanding of the
website's performance needs and goals to
develop effective and efficient
Solutions
development and management of
application programming interfaces
having a good knowledge on programming
and ensuring framework utilization
developing solutions for websites to
accept and store data securely
especially for those involved with
Payment Processing
writing testing and maintaining the
development solutions for code related
issues
effectively communicating with
developers designers and system
administrators and organization of
system logic now it's also crucial to
ensure the development of website
architecture using proper methodologies
like agile scrum and framework
and it's also important to know how to
troubleshoot and debug applications
so now that you're familiar with those
responsibilities and roles
let's have a look at the backend
developer salary
according to Glassdoor a back-end
developer
in the United States earns around 102
000 US dollars per annum while in India
a back in developer earns an average
salary of 7 lakhs 23 000 Indian rupees
per annum so now that you're familiar
with back-end development and know what
the roles and responsibilities are
You Must Be Wondering Where to Begin
well look no further you can head to the
official simply learn website and just
search for back-end development a number
of Articles courses and programs will
appear you can also choose the one that
suits you best you can just click on the
program and get an overview of what the
course consists of and depending on your
requirements you can opt for the course
that is most appropriate for you hey
guys I'm sure you all have heard about
phrases like web development full stack
development front-end and back-end
development
but if you are not sure about what
exactly they mean or how they're
different then don't worry you're in the
right place this video on front end
versus back-end development will help
you differentiate the two
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our Channel already make
sure to hit the Subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update
now let's Jump Right In and look at
what's in store for us
so first we look at what exactly web
development is
then we'll look at the different types
of web development
going ahead we'll look at what front-end
development is and understand what
exactly back-end development is
and lastly we'll be comparing the two on
the basis of languages libraries and
Frameworks skills job roles and Saturday
so now let's begin by understanding what
web development is
web development is the process of
creating a website on the internet
it refers to the non-design aspects of a
website such as creating features and
functionality using programming markup
and scripting languages
developers concentrate on the technical
aspects of web development such as
architecture programming application
integration and graphics
now let's look at the different types of
web development
now web development could include the
front end and the back end
now together
they form something called as full stack
development now I'm sure you're
wondering what they actually mean so
let's go ahead and understand them
let's begin by understanding what
front-end development is
now front-end development is a part of
the website that codes and creates
front-end elements of a website which
are features that are directly viewable
and accessible by the client
I'm essentially a front-end developer is
in charge of everything you see be it
styling Graphics text alignment
navigation colors Etc and the attempts
and he attempts to improve the user
experience to make it as seamless as
possible
now these front-end developers also
contribute to the overall design and
aesthetic along with debugging
responsiveness and performance are the
two main objectives of front-end
development
then what exactly is back-end
development
you guessed it right now web development
that occurs at the back end of programs
is accurately termed as backend
development
now this back-end development covers
server-side web application logic and
integration and activities like writing
apis creating libraries and working with
system components as opposed to
front-end development which focuses on
customer facing services and programs
now back in developers create code that
allows database and an application to
communicate with each other
essentially a back-end developer handles
what you don't see we are in charge of
the back end of the website which
includes servers databases and
applications
so now that you have a brief
understanding of what front-end
development is and back-end development
is let's go ahead and compare the two
so we'll be comparing the two
based on five different features that is
languages libraries and Frameworks
skills
job roles and salaries
now let's begin with languages
now front-end development typically
includes coding using languages like
HTML CSS and JavaScript now as you all
know HTML is a markup language that is
standardized system for tagging text
files to achieve font color graphics and
hyperlinks now CSS is used to format the
layout of these web pages
and JavaScript is used to create
interactive elements on the web page
when it comes to backend the languages
include python C hash Java Perl PHP Ruby
and some JavaScript now Java in
particular was built from ground up to
run on the server side so Java is
extremely useful python is also one of
the most popularly used languages and
c-sharp language is the preferred
architecture for backend programming in
Windows environments
now talking about libraries and
Frameworks front-end libraries and
Frameworks include react.js angular view
jQuery and bootstrap while talking about
back-end Frameworks we have expressed JS
node spring Django flask JSF
asp.net and Dot net MVC
now front end and back-end developers
work very closely so it's helpful to
have a foundational understanding of
front-end developer Technologies like
HTML and CSS as well
moving on to skills now front-end
developers are in charge of bringing
visual elements to a website as well as
interactive elements such as navigation
buttons and anything else that improves
overall usability
HTML JavaScript and CSS are frequently
used to ensure that the site's visual
site operates well so it's crucial to
know these languages and a good
understanding of JavaScript Frameworks
and libraries is also essential
and other General skills include a good
grasp of front-end programming languages
the ability to create a responsive
design the knowledge of testing and
debugging and an understanding of
front-end development tools like
automation content management Version
Control Systems
talking about the skills required for
back-end development
now back-end developers deal with
back-end languages and Frameworks like
Java Ruby on Rails Etc
now back-end developers deal with
languages like Java Ruby on Rails Etc to
make web pages and applications operate
now it's vital to know commonly used
back-end languages and Frameworks like
Django node.js Express JS and so on
other important skills include database
management framework utilization
programming knowledge of accessibility
and security compliance and
understanding requirements in ensuring
data consistency and integrity
now moving ahead let's look at some of
the job roles for front-end and back-end
development
talking about front end we have the
front-end developer the CSS or HTML
developer we have front-end web designer
we have front-end SEO expert full stack
developer and a UI developer
talking about backend this back-end
developer Java developer full stack
developer devops engineer
software engineer and an iOS Developer
and lastly let's look at the salaries
offered to these front-end and back-end
Developers
in India the average salary of a
front-end developer is around 6 lakh
rupees per annum
while a back-end developer earns about 7
lakh rupees per annum in the US a
front-end developer earns around 100 000
US dollars per annum while a back-end
developer earns about 121 000 US dollars
per annum so what exactly is node.js now
consider a scenario where a user
interacts with the web application the
user only interacts with the front end
of the application but there's a lot of
work that goes behind the scenes now in
a web application there's a front end a
server and a database the front end is
developed using JavaScript and
Frameworks like angular and react while
the server is built on Java PHP or
node.js and the backend database that
stores the data usually consists of
MySQL or mongodb so node.js is an open
source cross-platform JavaScript runtime
environment for running server-side
applications it is used to develop i o
intensive web applications like video
streaming sites single page applications
online chatting applications and other
web applications it is used by large
established companies and newly minted
startups node.js was developed by Ryan
Dal in 2009 and at the same time of this
session its latest version is v13.3.0
now that we know what node.js is let's
go ahead and look at why it was so
prevalent in the field of web
development here are a few points first
up node.js is extremely fast being built
on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
its library is extremely fast in code
execution node package manager has
around 50 000 bundles for developers so
whatever functionality is required for
an application can be easily imported
from npm all apis of node.js Library are
asynchronous that is non-blocking it
means a node.js based server never waits
for an API to return data node.js
dramatically reduces the processing time
while uploading video and audio files it
is also an open source platform and is
easy for beginners for web development
the above reasons more than justify the
popularity of node.js platform and why
it is being adopted by a large number of
organizations and businesses today so
now moving on let's familiarize
ourselves with the parts of node.js
node.js consists of several components
now let's look at them one by one first
up we have modules now modules are like
JavaScript libraries which I use in a
node.js application to include a set of
functions now we can use required
function with the parenthesis to include
a module in a node.js application
node.js application has many modules to
provide basic functionality needed for a
web application some of them could be
HTTP util FS URL query string stream and
zlip next up we have console the console
module provides a simple debugging
console that is similar to the
JavaScript console mechanism provided by
web browsers now the console can print
messages to STD out that print standard
output messages and SCD air to print the
error messages the next component is
cluster now node.js is built upon the
concept of single threading programming
a single instance of node.js runs in a
single thread to take advantage of
multi-core systems the user will
sometimes want to launch a cluster of
node.js processes to to handle the load
a cluster can be added to an application
in this way here is a small code for you
the next component is global now global
objects in node.js are available in all
modules now these objects are functions
modules strings Etc some node.js Global
objects are mentioned in the table you
have dir name that is a directory name
file name exports module and require the
next component is error handling now
node.js applications experience four
types of Errors we have the standard
JavaScript errors system errors user
specific errors and assertion errors now
errors in node.js are handled through
exceptions now for example let's handle
that error that would occur when we
divide a number by zero now this error
would crash the node.js application and
so we should handle this error here's a
small code for you next up we have
streaming a stream is an abstract
interface for working with streaming
data in node.js streams are objects that
let you read data or write data
continuously there are four types of
streams first one is a readable these
are the types of streams from which data
can be read writeable these are the
types of streams to which data can be
written duplex these are both readable
and writable streams lastly we have
transformed these streams can manipulate
the data while it is being read or
written moving on to the next component
buffer the JavaScript language has no
mechanism for reading or manipulating
streams of binary data buffer is a
module that allows handling streams that
contain only binary data an empty buffer
of length 10 can be created by this
method next up we have domain domains
provide a way to handle different i o
operations as a single group domain
module intercepts errors that remain
unhandled there are two types of methods
that are used for intercepting these
errors firstly we have enter internal
binding in this case the error emitter
executes its code inside the arrow
method next up is the external binding
now here the error emitter is explicitly
added to a domain via its add method the
next component is the DNS the DNS module
enables name resolution for example it
is used to look up the IP addresses of
host names DNS module is used to connect
to a DNS server and perform neem
resolution by using the method
dns.resolve the DNS module is also used
for performing name resolution without a
network communication by using the
method dns.lookup the next component is
a debugger node.js includes an out of
process debugging utility accessible via
a V8 inspector and built-in debugging
client this node.js debugger is not
feature packed but supports simple
inspection of code it can be used in the
terminal by using the inspect keyword
before the name of the Javascript file
in order to inspect a file say
myscript.js you can use the following
method now that we are familiar with all
the major parts of node.js let's go
ahead and learn about the node.js
Express framework Express is a flexible
node.js web application framework that
provides a wide set of features to
develop both web and mobile applications
you can assume Express as a layer built
on top of the node.js that helps manage
the server and the routes now let's have
a quick look at some of the core
features of Express framework it is used
to design single page multi-page and
hybrid web applications it allows the
setting up of middleware to respond to
http requests it defines a routing table
that is used to perform different
actions based on the HTTP method and URL
it also allows Dynamic rendering of HTML
Pages based on passing arguments to
templates now moving on let's take a
quick example of a simple hello world
program now this is developed using
Express framework to gain a better
understanding alright first up we have
the WHERE Express now this is used to
import Express framework into our
node.js application now the app.get
method is a callback function with
parameters request and response the
request object represents the HTTP
request and has properties for the
request query string parameters body
HTTP headers Etc the response object
represents the HTTP response that an
Express app sends when it gets an HTTP
request now the application will listen
to the defined Port which in this case
is 8081 and variables host and Port will
contain the address and the port
respectively lastly we have the
console.log which is used to show the
address and port in the command prompt
so this is what the command prompt would
look like and finally the output is
displayed on the web browser Having
learned about the Express framework now
let's move on and look at the node.js
use cases now it is no doubt that node
stands out for its speed and intensive
data exchange so top industry leaders
like NASA PayPal Netflix among others
incorporate node.js first up we have
Netflix the world's leading internet
television network with over 117 million
users is one of the top companies that
trusted their server services to node.js
the reasons why the company chose to use
node.js for application scalability and
data intensive application now you must
be wondering what application
scalability is with basically the
potential of an application to grow in
time being able to efficiently handle
more and more requests per minute and
data intensive application allows
millions of people to stream Netflix
simultaneously next up is Walmart now
Walmart is the world's largest company
by Revenue with around 514 billion US
Dollars according to the fortune Global
500 list in 2019. again the reasons why
the company chose node.js were
asynchronous IO and efficient handling
of concurrent requests now asynchronous
IO which is a form of input output
processing allows other processing to
continue before the transmission has
finished node.js is able to efficiently
handle concurrent requests with the use
of thread pool and event cues Uber Uber
is an American multinational ride
hailing company offering services that
include peer-to-peer ride sharing right
service healing and food delivery the
reasons why the company chose node.js
were asynchronous i o quick iterations
and active open source Community as
mentioned earlier asynchronous IO
permits other processing to continue
before the transmission has finished now
quick iterations now node.js is
continually being updated and added new
features that help in further
Improvement in the performance of web
servers and finally active open source
Community resolves many problems that an
organization May face in a particular
scenario next up we have NASA now NASA
as an independent agency of the United
States federal government responsible
for the civilian space program as well
as Aeronautics and Aerospace research
the reasons why the company chose
node.js were reduced access times
handling of data intensive tasks and the
fact that the servers are active 24 7.
now NASA has lots and lots of data and
using node.js has really helped them in
reducing the access times it is also
continuously handling and working with
large streams of data node.js is highly
stable which helps in keeping the server
active 24 7. next up we have PayPal now
PayPal is an American company operating
a worldwide online payment system that
supports online money transfers as
opposed to traditional methods like
checks and money orders the reasons why
the company chose to use node.js or the
fact that node.js has extremely fast
build times it allows tasks to be
carried out with fewer lines of code
when compared to other server
Technologies like Java and PHP and
node.js being data intensive efficiently
handles a large amount of data next up
is medium medium is a popular online
publishing platform developed by Evan
Williams and launched in August 2012.
the main reasons why the company chose
to use node.js were a data driven
applications now these applications are
ideal for being interfaced with node.js
servers B to run a b tests now A B
testing is essentially an experiment
where two or more variants of a page are
shown to users at random and statistical
analysis is used to determine which
variation performs better lastly node.js
server maintenance is simpler than its
counterparts moving on to the last topic
of this session industry Trends now
node.js developers are in demand across
the globe since many companies are
adopting JavaScript libraries according
to Forbes it is one of the top 10 most
in-demand jobs according to node Source
the total number of node.js downloads
increase by 40 in the last one year the
use of node.js in production has
increased dramatically since its release
in 2010 with early adopters such as
LinkedIn PayPal and Netflix among others
node.js has seen an exponential increase
in its use in web development the
popularity of node.js is also accounted
to JavaScript now since JavaScript is
the most popular language as evident
from a survey conducted by stack
Overflow in 2019 many developers can
start working on node.js library with
not much of a learning curve node.js
developers are being offered better
salary options than another web
technology developers according to pay
scale the average salary of a node.js
developer in India is around 6 lakhs 13
000 rupees per year the average salary
of a node.js developer across the United
States is around 105 000 US dollars per
year in this video we'll help you
install node.js on your Windows system
so without further Ado let's begin the
first thing you need to do is download
node.js from their official website so
go ahead and type download node.js
navigate to their official website and
here
you can see the 64-bit version so go
ahead and download that once the
download is done go ahead and run the
downloaded node.js installer
accept the license agreement keep the
default settings as it is
and then say install
so with that we finished the
installation process
once node has been successfully
installed the next crucial step is
verification now this process ensures
that node has been properly installed
to do so we first open the command
prompt and then type in a few commands
to verify the successful installation we
type in this command
node hyphen V now this command Returns
the version and if it Returns the
version it means it has been
successfully installed
so here we go it Returns the latest
version
now the final step is to update the node
package manager now this npm is bundled
with node.js which consists of all the
repositories and packages required for
development purposes so to do that type
in the command npm
install npm
hyphen hyphen Global now that we're done
with the installation of node let's go
ahead and Implement a small program for
that we make use of a text editor in our
case we've installed vs code so go ahead
and download vs code once you're done
with the installation this is what vs
code looks like so go ahead and click on
file and create a new file it's going to
be a simple program where you're going
to print a hello world message on the
web browser to do that we make use of
HTTP modules so node comes with built-in
HTTP modules to transfer data across it
so for that we make use of a require
method we create a variable first say
where
HTTP equals require
and just say HTTP within single quotes
now the HTTP module can create an HTTP
server that listens to the server ports
and gives a response back to the client
to do that we make use of the create
server method so let's go ahead and type
the code
say http
dot create
server and internally it consists of a
function
now the parameters to this function are
request and response now the response is
basically used to write to the client so
we say response dot write and here we
type in the message say hello world
welcome
to this tutorial
once you're done with that you end the
response
so the server listens to a port number
to display the message by default it
listens to the port number 8080 so we
keep that as it is and we end it save
your file
now to run the program you have to open
the command prompt so open your command
prompt
and mention the path to your file so in
our case it's our desk saved on the
desktop so CD
desktop and now to run it say node
demo one dot JS now we navigate to your
browser
and say localhost 8080 and here we go
our message is successfully displayed so
let's talk about the node.js
architecture and understand why it's so
good
so to begin with node.js has what's
called a single threaded event Loop
architecture and this allows you to be
able to handle many many concurrent
clients at the same time it's just a
very flexible way of being able to scale
up your support for many clients
and then in addition to that we have the
JavaScript event based model along with
the JavaScript callback mechanism that
allows you to have this standard
approach to being able to connect with
and talk and discuss interactions
between the client and the server it's
good to have these kind of Standards
where you're not using something that's
unique to a specific framework or a
specific technology and this just makes
it so it's a more accessible for
everybody
so if we look at the actual node.js
server itself everything centers around
the the concept of the event Loop and
the event Loop has a a an event queue an
operation completed um fire request
threaded pull and then it'll actually do
the actual computation or the file
system interaction
all of this interconnects in a nice
seamless Loop the great thing again with
node.js is that it's not new technology
it's been around for almost a decade
it's very very well tried out many of
the largest websites out there are runny
node.js
so let's now dig into each of the parts
of the node.js architecture so let's
talk about requests
so the way that the request works is
that you have your framework such as
angular on the client and that will then
send a request to the web server there's
many ways that those requests can happen
through web workers through forms and
through other interactions but at some
point a request is sent to the server
and so these requests can be for data it
can be for deleting data they can be for
updating data they can be for
interacting with Services as mentioned
before but the goal is to have some kind
of request now once that request
actually hits the server and then we
start actually getting into the queuing
and threading process that centers
around the event Loop and this is where
node.js really excels because it's able
to use that single threaded model to be
able to manage from just even a few
requests to tens of millions of requests
so it receives the actual request and
starts the event queue and this is where
a single threading process starts is by
queuing everything up appropriately
and then it then maintains the thread
within a pool so you have the queuing
process as one action and then you have
a threaded pull which manages those
threads as well
and then we have an event Loop which you
know goes through as you receives and
processes those requests
and then finally what we're doing is
we're actually then going to be
interacting with a system and that could
be a database it could be a cloud system
it could be an API file system but we're
interacting with something that's
outside of the node.js server so the
node.js server itself is doing some
actions on the server but then it's also
interact with things outside of its own
server environment
and so this talk a little bit about that
workflow so requests come in they go
into the event queue and they get
spiraled through the event Loop and then
we have a non-blocking operators which
are going to be doing the input output
polling such as KQ e-poll and other
services and from there we're also going
to be then interacting with a threaded
pool and we're using the blocking
operations to manage that threaded pull
and that threaded pool is going to now
then go outside of the server and
interact with something beyond the
server so whether that is a database or
file system or API or microservice these
are things that can be interacted with
so let's go through what npm is so npm
itself stands for the node package
manager
no great shakes there as the name says
it's responsible for all the packages
and modules that are bundled Within
node.js
so the notification itself really has
two key functionalities now the first is
that reply it is a central repository
for all packages and modules which you
can then search through um online you
can go to
search.nodejs.org and you can find all
of the packages of modules that are out
there now the second is that it's also a
command line or terminal uh line utility
that allows you to install those
packages so you can actually go through
and you can see the version management
and dependencies that within those
packages and you actually can control
the packages themselves
so why would you use npm
so npm is really useful for being able
to extend the project you're working on
so when you're building out a project
one of the concepts I like to use is the
concept of Lego bricks
um big fan of Lego and uh what's great
about Lego bricks is that they're all
individually by themselves very small
very specific functionality but if you
actually get a whole collection of Lego
bricks together you can build like crazy
cool things so think of when you're
working with the node package manager
itself is that each of those individual
pieces that you're working with each of
those individual packages are their own
Lego bricks and by themselves you can
then edit and update and maintain that
piece separately from the whole
environment as long as your inputs and
outputs you know really the piece where
you snap the logo in or when you connect
the Lego to something else are
interacted and open and well documented
then you can actually then use those
modules effectively throughout your
project
um so you can actually then be able to
do that you can do Version Control on
your codes and dependencies you can do
testing very easily
and then once you actually get to the
point where you go yes I want to release
um a new module you can do that
effectively using npm and it will
actually go through and do the actual
deployment for you
so let's go through the npm installation
so the actual package manager itself is
included with the installation of
node.js so if you've installed and
you're running node.js locally then
you've already installed the package
manager but you can also access it
through command line or terminal window
on your data server or in your server or
in via the cloud
if you haven't now downloaded node.js
here's the website where you can go down
to install it and there's Windows and
Mac versions of that code as well with
the installs which allow you to get up
and going very quickly
you want to be able to run the installer
and accept all the default settings just
to you know to begin with you want to
kind of have the standard setup so that
you are most familiar with the normal
settings before you start getting to the
point where you're a master and you're
tweaking things
there is a way that you can open up the
command window or The Terminal window
and once you've actually installed
node.js to verify that it's actually
installed you can write the command node
dash dash version and they'll actually
then pull out the version of node.js
that you have installed and then you'll
be able to see that you've got it
actually up and running
and then you can also do the same thing
for npm where you can do npm dash dash
version and actually will then show you
which version of the node package
manager you have running so you can
actually take it full advantage of that
program and verify that it's actually up
and running now so we're actually going
to go ahead and actually run a demo of
using npm and to do that I've got three
windows in front of me right now so I
have this window here which is my
terminal window where I'll be doing all
of my instructions and then I also have
a folder which shows where I'll be
putting all of the files and then
finally I'll actually have a text editor
in this case I'm using vs code because
it's free but you can use any text edit
you like to be able to go in and show
what the code that's been created by npm
in the Json file so you can actually see
what it looks like and then we'll modify
it a little bit so first thing we want
to do is we want to go ahead and create
a new project file so I'm going to go in
I'm just going to move into let's do
change directory I'm going to the
project folder and we'll see down here
that we have an empty project folder but
for this one I'm actually going to go
ahead and I'm going to create a new
directory in this one and I'm going to
call this one simply learn
and there we are we've created a new
simple event folder
and we are going to move into the simply
land folder
and so we're now in the simply land
folder uh there's nothing in there right
now um so the first thing we want to do
is we want to take go ahead and
initialize this folder as a project
folder for working with npm now to do
this you will have to have already
installed npm if you have node.js npm
comes with it and if you want to see
whether or not you have npm installed so
you can just do npm
version
and that will actually tell you what the
version of npm you have installed is it
also verifies that npm is installed so
I've gone ahead and I've been able to
validate that I have npm installed so
what I'm now going to go ahead and do is
I'm going to initialize this folder so
to do that just do npm in it and you'll
see that the path is that we're already
in the simply learn folder and then when
you do that
it's going to ask you some questions so
what is the package name we're going to
go with the defaults for right now and
then I can show you how we can edit
those in a little bit uh we're going to
go with just say yes to all of these
just by hitting return
and you'll see here that we're going to
create a new folder called a
package.json folder this is the
instructions that we have in the folder
do you want to go ahead and create this
we want to and it's going to go ahead
and do that and we can see now in our
folder here that we actually have
package.json so if I go ahead and open
this up with
vs code here we are we can actually see
what all the information is we can go
ahead and we can actually go and update
this metadata if we want to I'm going to
leave it as is for right now because I
want to show you a couple of other
things so a lot of times when you're
actually working with npm and the reason
why you're using npm is that you want to
take advantage of packages that are
freely available in the open source
community that are supported by node.js
and one of those is a package called
Express and express is a lightweight
framework for building out web
applications similar concept to angular
or react.js I like using it and it's
also a great way to be able to show how
we can install this using npm so to
install this you just start with the
command npm and then you type install
and then we type the name of the package
and we hit
enter and it goes ahead and what you'll
actually see
is a couple of things one is we have a
dependency in our package above we also
have so this is in our Json package that
it's now dependency is written in there
we can also go in and under our node
modules we actually see that we have if
we scroll down we should see Express
there it is Express
now if we decide that we don't want to
use um Express we can actually just come
in and we can write command npm
uninstall
type
Express
oops
did a typo there so let's try that again
npm
uninstall
Express
and couple things can happen one is in
our Json file the dependency for the
express file has now been removed
and we can also see that underarm node
modules there are no extensions there
so this is kind of cool this allows us
to be able to see
um that we can easily add and remove
packages so let's just go ahead and I'm
going to install Express account so
install
Express
npm install Express
all right so it's gone ahead and it's
installed Express
now one of the things that often happen
is that when you're working with a
package the actual Json package so
you'll receive this file and you want to
be able to go ahead and install of the
sub modules that come with it so and you
can go through you can manually install
them like this or you can actually run
and install command so you can actually
install all of them at once I can just
show you what that looks like
because we're going to actually go ahead
and simulate as if we're going to
install bootstrap
which is another
popular framework
and we're actually going to go with
and then we'll save that
and what we'll see is under the packages
that bootstrap isn't listed in there we
do have Express there it is right there
so we now come over to our new command
so we can actually write the command
npm install
and now
site typo let's try that again
let's do npm install
okay it does help to save your file so
let's go ahead and
let's run npm install
and when you do that what we'll now
actually have is not just
Express but we'll also see that
bootstrap has also been added
now I don't recommend that you use the
star symbol which will install the
latest version of bootstrap because you
obviously haven't tested your
application against that but it gives
you an idea of of what's happened here
now if we want to we can actually go in
here and we can see on in
install
bootstrap
and it will actually remove that from
your Json package so there we are that's
how you work with using npm from getting
started with a setup for a base
initialization of your package going
through to creating the first package
being able to set up and control the
naming convention for each of the items
within the metadata that provides the
instruction for the package how you can
then put in dependencies such as Express
and bootstrap how you can install them
and remove them and actually use do all
of this through command line if you have
any questions please let us know
so this kind of jump into the express.js
framework
so express.js is a really flexible
node.js and web application framework it
is just something you can spin up very
quickly and build both web and mobile
applications just a really great tool um
you know I use it all the time for
building up my own applications
the thing that's so great about it is
it's really simple and so and it's not
going to be as have all the the
functionality that you'd have in maybe a
larger scale HTTP service but with that
said it does come with a lot of
functionality that allows you to not
only create websites but you can also do
apis and other routing calls very very
nice
so let's go through some of the features
that expressjs have
so as I mentioned before it allows you
to build simple web applications and
they can be either a single page
application or a multi-page application
it also allows you to do middleware
requests and responses so for instance
if you want to do an API and have that
be part of your middleware you can
actually set that up real quickly in
fact in the demo that we'll do later on
we'll actually be building out four
different API calls that you'll be able
to do and you'll be able to see how you
can use express.js for that and that in
then turns allows you to be able to see
how express.js can help manage some of
the routing of the different HTTP
methods and that you'd be using via URL
and then finally it's just a great way
of being able to dynamically test the
work that you are developing so you can
actually build out a solution and test
it right away and express.js have it in
a single packet and then once you get to
a certain point you can then check in
the whole packet and even have it as
part of your container and then check
that into your main project
and then if somebody else wants to then
take on the work they can then just pull
that in so let's kind of go step through
a you know a basic example so here we
actually have a full script for creating
a simple hello world and this includes
installing express.js uh defining the
ports it's going to run on as well as a
basic piece of code so the first thing
you want to do is actually go ahead and
Define how you want to install
express.js and this is called the very
first variable which is I'm requiring
that Express be installed as part of
node packet manager npm will then pull
in the latest version of Express if you
need to define a specific version of
course you can do that in this example
we're just going to pull the latest one
and then we'll go ahead and with the
second line which will then install
Express and when you do it once you'll
see how quickly it stores onto your
local development machine
the next parameters are actually a
callback function so if something
actually happens when you go to the
website where we're going to run our web
application you want something to pop up
and in this instance we'll say hello
world will pop up
the third block is all about where you
would actually go ahead and host your
code and so in this one you'll see that
the server is going to listen and listen
to Port 8081 so that's what that
function actually there defines
and then you can either put in uh the
specific host address in the demo you'll
actually see how we Define that for
localhost but you can actually then
point this to a production host
environment if you want
and then the final line here is a
command that actually sent a script to
your terminal window telling you that
which port and which host that you are
listening to so let's see what that
would look like so here we can see have
our terminal window and we're actually
able to then run the hello world JS
script that we just wrote and then once
we do that it'll actually then post that
we have an example app listening ads and
here we don't have a web domain address
and we do have the the port 8081
and in our browse window it says hello
world
so that's a quick breakdown of
express.js now let's jump over and do a
demo
so the first thing we want to do to get
Express up and running on our system is
we have to have node.js installed so
we're just going to do a Google search
to let you know where you can find
node.js it's actually at nodejs.org so
we select that link that will take us to
nodejs.org and there are two types of
downloads one is the current download
which has the latest features and then
there's a more stable version that if
you are new to node.js I'd recommend you
to download next we want to find a text
editor and we're going to go with Visual
Studio code or vs code is known it's an
open source solution from Microsoft that
runs across all the leading platforms so
this will default to our Windows
platform but you can run it on Mac OS
and Linux as well I really like it it's
a great code it comes a lot of
extensions and it's open source
and next thing you want to do is because
we're going to be developing apis we
want a way to be able to visualize those
apis quickly and a great tool is a
product called Postman again open source
and so you can go out and go to
postman.com top right hand corner you'll
see a bright orange download button
where you can actually go and head and
download and install Postman and that
will allow you to be able to access all
of your apis that we're going to be
creating in Express
you can actually use other tools such as
apigee as well for visualizing your apis
but this one's just great to get you
started so let's go ahead and open up vs
code and we want to go ahead and open a
new folder where we're going to have our
project we're going to just for
our demonstration here we're going to
put this on the desktop you wouldn't
normally do this but it will work fine
here we're going to create a folder I'm
going to title the file the node Express
and we'll select that folder and that
now becomes the root folder for our
project in Visual Studio we don't really
need the the welcome screen anymore so
we're going to get rid of that
and one of the things that is great
about working with vs code is you can
actually have the terminal window up and
running as well so let's go ahead and
open that so it's running at the bottom
of our screen and this gives us a little
bit of space
and the first thing we want to do is
actually turn convert the folder we're
in actually into a project running
node.js so we're going to use npm in it
and they'll actually initialize the
project we have another video that
explains how to use npm or node package
manager and you can go ahead and find
that um in our library here but as we go
ahead and we do that you'll actually see
that it will create the default package
Json file which has the name of the
folder is the default name of the
package but you can actually go in and
edit any of these documents
we want to create a default file as
called index.js This is where we're
going to write most of our scripts that
allow us to work with node.js
and the first is writing a script that
allows us to install Express and we'll
use the node packet manager to actually
pull and install Express and you can
fault to specific versions of Express if
you want and we're just going to go with
the latest one so we're just going to
put in Express and then we'll go down
into terminal window and say npm install
dash dash save Express and this will
install Express so we can actually test
out the code we're working on
and this will be just a moment to
install
great thing with working with node
package manager is that once we've
finished with our package here we can
actually wrap it all up and send it over
to any other developer that we're
working with and then you can actually
run the the package and actually have
exactly the same code installed
and there we are we have everything
installed and ready to go
we can see we actually have all of the
modules installed you'll see that we
actually have Express installed as well
and we also want to then make this an
app
and then we'll do app listen
to Ports 3000 so this is by default
we're going to be running from our Local
Host which is uh HTTP server running on
this test machine and we're going to
have Express for this project run on
Port 3000.
and in the once we actually run the
script we'll actually post into the
console window a piece of text saying
server started on Port 3000.
so we're going to go ahead and save this
file a little control s to save these
files
so let's go into localhost in a web
browser to localhost colon sorry yeah
it's localhost colon 3000 and you'll see
nothing has been reached that's because
we actually haven't done anything to
initialize the script so we want to come
in and we're going to go node index.js
and hit return and as you can see now we
have a message in our console window
that means that yep there we go we
actually have everything up and running
so we can actually see that the service
is running not a very pleasant message
so let's go ahead and change that
so let's change that to
app get
and
acquire res
and so if you use the get message that's
change what will print
and we'll type hello there
exclamation mark
I'm going to save that
and we refresh the screen
oh nothing happened again because we
didn't run the script let's go back in
and we'll run the script node index.js
and now what you'll see is if we refresh
there we are we have our new hello there
message
all right well let's actually start
building some apis in this environment
so to be able to build the apis we want
to be able to pull content so we can
actually create a new file called
users.js and we're going to create
I'm going to go ahead and create a a
user's Json packet and a Json packet is
essentially
a an array and as we consider it like a
small database and in this array we're
going to have four objects each object
is going to have three pieces of
metadata we have an ID name and email
and there'll be ID 1 2 and 3 and then
you'll see that the names will be John
Smith and we'll make up a couple of
others I'm just kind of giving them
arbitrary email addresses
it's just for our demo here
let me grab this copy it and kind of
speed up
the script writing time
there we go
and let's just change what we need one
of the things that's nice with working
with the visual studio code vs code is
there's lots of plugins and so one of
the default features is that if you
select a variable it'll actually look
for the same variable in the script so
you can if you need to you can actually
change them all in once
but we don't need to worry about that
right now we're just creating a Json
packet so we have four items
ID one two three and four for John Smith
and Jack and Chris
all right so that's our
erased string and we're gonna then make
sure that we can export that as users so
we can actually now whenever we select
the term users in our scripts you'll
actually pull in this packet
all right looking good
now let's go over to our main index.js
file and we're just going to go ahead
and we want to like Store where the the
API is going to be so we're going to
create a folder called route and then a
subfolder called API
and then we'll call a file in there
called users.js so as we're updating our
scripts we know where to
pull the data from
it's just a standard way of being able
to pull out the values so in here we're
going to say
um in this instance Express is required
for our Scripts
and we're going to also say that from
router
with an Express router
correct naming convention
and the script is case sensitive we'll
also want to create a value later on
that will have a unique ID so we're
actually going to pull in a uuid
package that will actually then allow us
to install unique identifiers so we use
node package manager to install uuid
again this is a great example of how you
can go from nothing to something very
quickly with Express
node.js because we've installed Express
we installed uuid and We're Off to the
Races
so let's have users require the path for
where our API is going to be located
all right so let's do a basic get which
will be to pull the record so we're
going to have it pull all the records so
router.get and we're going to require it
to pull all of the records in the Json
Packer that we created
so there should be four items to come
back
save that
looks good
make sure that users is consistent
there's our Json packet
and yep everything's looking pretty good
all right let's go back to index
and we're going to switch out this
function here from just a generic get
with a generic statement to actually
being able to pull in the users so
let's go app
use express.json
lab dot use
URL encoded
extended
false
NP dot use
API uses so
you're going to be pulling them off in
the same location
require
and where we have our API
Scripts
okay
and then let's go ahead and open up
Postman because we can actually use
Postman to actually show us what the
results look like because right now the
results won't show up appropriately
um in our browser window
suppressment again is just a API
management tool if you used apogee or
other similar tools that are on the
market mulesoft
you'll see it's very consistent again
this is open source and what you want to
be able to do is you can actually go and
actually go to the path where the API is
stored and then you can use all the
different types of commands within your
environment to be able to you know test
out the scripts so let's go ahead and
create a new project new request and
we're going to go with the default get
but there's actually quite a lot of
different commands we can use
and these are just HTTP commands
and we're going to type in the request
and in this instance
it's going to be
let's run our script first
came into our script I think we're good
let's make sure we're exporting the data
correctly
okay so we want to run our script so
let's do a node index.js and that will
run the changes that we just created so
we can now come over to get we select
API
um localhost colon 3000
API uses when we do that brings back the
Json package with that for entry points
there there's all four of them
so that's your
first action
now let's kind of get this a little bit
tinier let's actually go in and see if
we can filter by ID
so we're going to go in and we're going
to modify our script so it's gonna be
round and then we're going to put in the
filter and in this instance it's going
to be ID
which would allow us to be able to just
put a backslash against the end of the
URL string we just had and put in a
number or a unique identifier and then
that will actually then allow us to pull
in that unique record
thank you
again
pass the data
okay so it found
and two
take the Json and
print it
so we're going to filter here against
user ID
and then publish the results
else if it doesn't work I might just
have a generic error message
we shouldn't see this though in the
demos we're creating this is just good
practice
to save that
and let's go ahead and rerun our node
index file against that folder
and now we can actually come in here and
we do backslash one and that will give
us just one record and we could change
that to 2 or 100 in this instance and if
it's 100
we'll just get a bad request error
message
there's two
all right
so that's get so we'll be able to pull
all of the records we've been able to
filter against one specific record
against a specific parameter in this
instance it was ID so let's go ahead and
create a new user so that what we do for
this is we're going to use the post
command from HTTP to actually push and
post data into the data source the data
source is our Json packet which means
that we'll have to then push a new
record into the Json package using our
array statements
because Jason's just essentially in an
array
and so we're going to post and when we
do this we have to create a unique ID so
this is where we have to reference the
uid
I'm going to do a V4 unique ID
which will be
four groups of four so these 16
characters
and then
we'll have
name
and email will post
okay looks good
Okay so
if
new user
and then put dot name
and
new user dot email
I'm going to return
the results
okay
and so he uses Dot
push so we posted which is HTTP
statement and then pushing into the
the Json packet array
okay
okay that's looking good
all right so I think we're good
let's go ahead and rerun our script
node index.js
now allows us to do that so let's go
over to postman so we can actually
connect to the URL and we're going to
change a HTTP statement to post
and get rid of that go back to users now
if we just do this nothing's gonna
happen so we actually have to go in and
we have to update the body this would be
the content that would be passed through
and we're going to go through with a raw
statement here
and we're going to do Json this will be
that's the packet we're sending so let's
go ahead and the records we wanted to
update we only have to update two which
is one is name and the second is email
we don't have to do an ID because we're
using uuid to generate an automatic one
for us
and we're going to create records for
Steph and her email address is Steph
gmail.com
yep looking good
okay so let's go ahead and send that we
sent it
and if we look at the bottom we can
actually now see that we have five
records so a new one's been added we
have our unique ID at the top and then
we have name and email which are the
ones that we just created for Steph and
staff at gmail.com
all right
so that's posting now the next thing you
want to do is to update a record so that
means we need to select an ID
and then be able to update the content
and for that we're going to use the HTTP
put command
so we'll use ID as our way to be able to
filter
and then we'll be able to update against
that filter
so construct found
equals users
and then
we'll have it going against
user's ID so we know how to get the
correct record and then pass the record
Bank
onto the screen so we know what we're
editing
so if
so I found
I want to update the user
and I'm going to go ahead and pull the
information from the body for what will
be updated
now for each
diffuser ID
and pass the integer
okay
so this is our values to pass against
the ID
and in this instance we'll make sure
that we're updating the values of
username
so if we are updating user and we're
just updating the username we want to
make sure that that's the value that
gets updated
and then we also want to do user email
we don't want to update the ID so it's
going to remain unique and consistent
okay and we're going to make sure that
everything is pushed to the Json package
and then we'll also have a message
saying that
the field has been updated in the Json
package
okay
all right so run that script again
and looks good so let's go to our folder
let's change the HTTP post let's put it
as get just so we can see that we have
uh all of their values in the array from
the Json packet
and now we want to say put which allows
us to update just one record
so let's go ahead and select one record
we'll select id1 so we have one record
we can go ahead and for name we can
change this
so let's go ahead and change these
so now you see that the email has
changed so we have staff
as the new account
all right our final API that we're going
to create is to delete an account and in
many ways it's actually a very basic API
because all we're doing is we're
grabbing the ID and then we're saying
that all the associated records with
that ID
within that row as it were in the table
just to delete the whole row
and so we want to use again our ID as
the unique value that we
pulling against
so we're going to if uses are found and
we're going to
filter those users
I'm going to do that filter against user
ID
and pass that
and
and they go and
first a message to uh Jason packhead
saying user
deleted
and a generic message of things fail
okay save that and we'll
see we'll go ahead and we're using we're
just deleting the record now
and we're going to do it by filtering
against a unique ID
and then you will then just eliminate
that record
we'll pass the message that has been the
account has been deleted
okay let's save that let's go run our
script
node index.js
we good okay let's come over here and
we're going to
show that we can put any of the accounts
so let's just take one of them
one I think that's good
so let's go ahead and we're going to
change
the HTTP command to delete
and we actually have to
select an account so we just do one when
we do that it'll actually delete that
record and here we are um it says that
the user has been deleted and we now
only have three records in the Json
packet
and we can pull all the records
and you'll see that there's only three
so being able to pull all the records
from a Json package we've been able to
create a record update a record and
delete a record
and we can just step through so here's
our Json package that we created
originally again this is just an array
it's just a different way of setting up
the array and then we have our index
files which um identifies what are the
apps that need to be installed and where
the API is going to be serviced out of
and that we're going to be doing this on
uh the port 3000
again these are additional tools that we
need to make sure that we have up and
running um in our script and so the
first script was to get all the the
records the second to filter against a
user ID for just a specific record and
then for creating a record we actually
went in and we used the uid tool to
create a unique identifier and then we
posted in the data for the new records
we did something similar with updating
the record we didn't have to update the
user ID we just had to update the values
in the two fields that we needed to be
updated
in this case name and email
and the final step was to go ahead and
delete a record so these are all apis
that you can now pull into your own
application so you can use them in web
applications or you can actually go
ahead and use them in other applications
such as mobile applications
um local applications and other scripts
and this really allows your application
to become more scalable and more useful
hello and we're going to go through and
do our demo of building a restful API
with node.js so the first thing we want
to do is go ahead and install all the
correct pieces of software we're going
to start with node.js so let's do a
Google search on node.js and you'll find
that node.js is at
nodejs.org so we select that link
and that's going to take us to the
node.js website and there are two
versions of node.js you can download
There's the stable version and then
there's the latest version I'd go with
the stable version you'll find it
available in Windows Mac OS and Linux as
well
and if we go to the next piece of
software we want to go ahead and install
the text editor of your choice I'm going
to use Visual Studio code vs code it's
an open source solution it works on all
leading platforms uh works really well I
like it a lot Microsoft did a good job
with this I also really like it that
it's open source but there's lots of
extensions you can get for vs code and
so it's a great text editor
and we'll also need Postman Postman is a
tool that allows us to be able to view
the apis that we're going to create so
let's go ahead to postman.com and again
it's another solution you can download
for free and so we're going to go ahead
and select the download button and it
will automatically detect which OS
you're on so in this case it's going to
be windows but you can also get Mac and
Linux as well so we'll go ahead and
download those
and once we have everything installed
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a project in vs code and that's
actually really easy to do all you have
to do is create a folder
and we'll do this right off our desktop
and we're going to call the folder node
rest API and we'll select that folder
and you'll see on the left hand column
that we have the new folder that we
created we still have the vs code
welcome screen we'll get rid of that we
don't need that anymore
so let's go ahead and one of the things
I like with vs code is you can actually
toggle the terminal window so let's go
ahead and open up the terminal window so
we can actually run that at the same
time and so we're going to move our
cursor to the folder we just created and
there we are you can see that
and what we're going to do now is we're
going to initialize this with no package
manager to make this a package
and it's going to go ahead I'm going to
ask right now we're just going to go
with the default so we're just going to
say yes yes to a couple of these yep
enter enter
[Music]
enter enter
and is this okay
yep enter
all right so now we have a new file and
this is our Json package it has all the
defaults in it we can go in and modify
these if we want to uh no need to for
this exercise but you may want to for
the solution that you're putting
together
and we're going to create a new file
called index.js and this is going to be
the reference file that's in the Json
package for npm
and here we're going to put in our
solutions that we absolutely have to
have for this to run so we're going to
install Express and express is a web
service application but it's very
flexible and one of the things that
we're going to use it for today is build
apis
so in our terminal window we're going to
type npm install dash dash save Express
this will install Express locally on our
machine
and takes a few minutes but it's going
to go and download all the latest
features this is going to be the latest
version of Express you can if you want
to specify a specific version of
software for these examples there's no
need to do that
so you'll see that everything has been
installed we expanded the node module we
can scroll down and indeed yep there we
are we see Express has been installed
along with some other
um pieces that are used for
all right so that's our first piece and
the next
is we're going to Define our amp and our
app is going to use Express
and we want Express as a local host on
our local machine on Port 3000 so we've
identified Port 3000 as the default port
for our application
and
we are going to now create a an array
for some movies
I'm going to have ID title director and
release date
such a great movie
and director Christopher Nolan
and I was released
in 2010 yes 10 years ago
okay so we're going to do an a couple of
items here and just so that we have some
more than one entry in our array and
array is a JavaScript uh you can think
of it as a very simple uh table and it
allows us to have structured data you
can also do a Json file you can also
connect to a database mongodb or
something like that
2019
okay so we have two movies in our little
array
would be more than enough for right now
uh key part is that we have a consistent
structure for the array of IDE title
director and release date
and so we're going to create two apis
one's going to be a get API we'll get
the list of the items in our API and the
second will be a post where we'll be
actually pushing in a new item so let's
go ahead and start with the get and what
we want to do is we're going to select
get slash movie and
we are going to
have this run as an API and so what
we'll do is we will test this in a
moment so we'll be running from our web
browser and actually we'll probably open
up Postman and run it through Postman so
okay
that pulls all the movies
and we'll do a another
um getting amount we'll filter by movie
ID but let's just get them all for right
now
and we are going to listen
on a server port in this instance it's
going to be important
and we already had to find the port as a
variable earlier and which so we're just
referencing the variable and the port
number is listed at the top in line four
it's just a text stream it's going to
get put to the terminal window
and it is going to dynamically
grab the port the value from the
variable from 3000
and place it in our text string easy
and we want to save the file
and now we're going to go ahead and run
it so we're going to do node index touch
Js
that runs the script
and tells us that we're listening on
Port 3000 that's great
that means now that we should be able to
go into Postman
and
grab the data from an API
so here's Postman if you've not used it
before it's a great tool for being able
to manage apis strongly encourage you to
have a go with this so we're going to
get the get command and we've done any
applications web applications you've
probably used get and post for the data
and that your
pulling and pushing from forms online
same principle so we want to go ahead
and we're going to go and grab get I'm
going to type in localhost
and it's going to be colon
3000 slash movies because that's the the
name of the file
and we're going to hit send and
what we get as a response
is the
data in our query
sorry in our array here we go so there's
our array and the data values have been
pulled back by Postman
that's great
so now we want to go ahead and add a
movie
to our array
and we're going to do that we're going
to use the post
command and I get imposed our HTTP
commands
and so we're going to use movies
and in this instance we're going to push
the value
into
our list
so construction movie requires we're
going to need a structure here and that
structure is going to be
the information that's in the the body
and then we're going to push to the log
our terminal window
and I'm going to push so here we're
using push and that's a term in for
arrays within JavaScript where we push
the data into the actual array itself
there are lots of ways of being able to
control data within an array if you're
new to a race with JavaScript I strongly
encourage you to learn more about them
there's just an awful lot you can do
with them
and then we want to have a validation
message come up on the screen saying yes
movie has been added to the list so
we'll save what we've just created
and if you don't save it you want to
show up and then we're going to re-run
the node index.js file
you can see this is what we've created
here already
a an API that allows us to pull and push
data
in and out of a variable
okay so let's go back and we're going to
change the header from being guessed to
being push
so we're going to use sorry not push our
post so we're going to select post and
then what we want to do is the value
inside of the body and so let's go code
huh
and we want to select a body
and we're going to play in text
and select Json so it's going to be
structured and so here we will
essentially copy the structure we have
here so let's go ahead and just
copy these elements
and we have to give it an ID because we
don't have an auto generator ID so we're
going to make this ID
3.
and then
and it's going to be a number three
and then you want to put in
title
a new movie and we'll put in director
and we'll have this as
I don't know new director
not very creative here today
and then
we need to put in a date
so release underscore dates
and let's just put in a date
uh to
um just so you know that we're not
formatting the date con it's
so let's go ahead and we'll select send
and this will actually go and we can see
Hello boom movie's been added to our
list
and we can go back and let's go ahead
and validate that so we're going to
change from post to get
use the same
and now we go to the low
oh looks like we put an error in
our formatting
so let's go
to
pass the Json
and we'll pass it using Express
and this will
clear up any formatting issues
so
app.use Express Json
Express
URL encoded
extended false
and this should help us pass
value
and then we'll rerun that script make
sure you save the previous file
otherwise it won't run the new script
all right okay so let's go back
and
let's go back to our
localhost 3000 slash movies
and there's only two values here so what
we need to do now is change from get to
post
we'll go to body
and what we're going to do is we want to
have
raw Json and
what we want to do is capture the values
that we have below
and insert
this
file into this new
Json packet
into our array
let me actually just copy that
it's a little bit cheating but it's the
main same so let's go ahead and
get everything consistent
and we'll change the number to three
and creating a unique title patching
sorry new typo doesn't need to be unique
just the ID needs to be unique
so title is a new movie new director and
change it to New director
and we'll change the date
I'm not doing any formatting on the date
so it can be any any date any number
really
hit save
movies being added to our list so it's
been added but now let's go back to get
and let's see if we can actually see the
third entry and scroll down and there we
are we've actually pushed that Json
package into our array
so we now have three items and and that
have been added fire our API
okay
so
now let's go ahead and search our Movie
Database I guess we only have three
entries but you know we want to be able
to so we can do that by using the get
command and what we'll be doing is we'll
be validating against
a specific ID number so we have three
and we're going to
validate against just the ID number
um in this instance
um the way to do it is through the URL
so beforehand we had localhost colon
3000 slash movie now we're adding in uh
Slash movie slash and then whatever
number of that we will actually filter
against the ID and
that's essentially what we're doing here
right now
so we're going to go into f movies
dot ID again we're using the ID menu to
actually pull from our arraylist
with my variables and arrays mixed up
here today
and then once we actually have the value
we'll actually post back as a Json
packet
and here we have any errors then what
we'll do is we'll throw up message maybe
not found so there we are we're going to
plug in some ID
and we should be able to then pull that
up through Postman into our terminal
window
again the reason why we're using Postman
is that this is actually just showing
the values going back and forth we're
not having to render a whole web page uh
it's extremely fast very efficient
all right
so we saved and rerun our script all
right let's go back and what we're going
to do is we're going to change the value
so we're going to hit send here we are
we see all of our movies using the get
command now what we're going to do is
we're going to use a look filtering just
id2 which is the Irishman so to slash
two and there we are we have just the
information on the Irishman
so now you can see how you can create a
simple search
all right
so the final action we want to do is to
delete a record
in our array and so we can go ahead and
do that and we're going to use the uh
Delete commands to actually do that so
we'll be able to push
um in a record we've been able to view
records filtered audience records now
we're going to go ahead and do delete
and so we can do app delete and then
we're going to filter by specific ID
number
and when we do this we'll actually then
we'll be put in the URL path which will
be localhost colon 3000 slash movie
slash and then the ID number so this is
inside that 102 probably use two that
will then
delete from our array
the record for the Irishman

I do the shortcut and the keyboard
shortcut of Control Plus s to save files
on Windows or command processing my Mac
and
once we've deleted a record we want to
send a message saying B movie has been
deleted
all right so we want to go ahead
and let's just check our code looking
good save our file
and we want to rerun
the index.js file
yep
rerun okay let's go to postman
new gram
the delete
so again we're filtering against the
movie ID and then we'll delete that ID
okay so we went against the Ashman and
we hit send
and there it is now we're going to
change
the command to delete
so we hit
one will actually delete conception the
movie has been deleted this parade and
now let's go ahead and grab uh use get
to pull in all the movies that are
listed and it's not going to find movie
number with the id1 that's not there
anymore
and if we get all the movies
we see we only have one movie and that's
the Irishman and so our delete function
has worked
there we are so we've installed Express
we're using Express to build all of our
applications we have our app running on
Port 3000 we are using Express to pass
the Json effectively back and forth we
have a simple array that array is then
being used to create an API to pull the
details then we're being able to add a
movie then search for a movie yeah it
sells reading against an ID
and then we can actually finally go
ahead and delete a movie
all this using express.js
hello Learners simply learn brings you a

understand the most widely used concepts
of express.js in an exciting manner
you will see how to create a simple rest
API in this video by the end of this
tutorial you will be able to understand
and deploy the express.js
before we begin let me tell you guys
that we have regular updates on
programming videos so if you are a
programmer and want to learn something
new then consider getting subscribed to

icon to never miss any update from
Simply learn so let's go through the
agenda for this full course
first we'll see the introduction to this
course after that we will see what is
expressed Js
moving ahead we will see how to install
express.js
after that we will see express.js get
post method in detail
moving ahead we will see what is a
middleware and its function then we will
create a middle wherein express.js
moving ahead we will see express.js test
API and then we will see react with
express.js in this we will also see how
to connect the server side to the client
side
after that
we will see what is typescript and how
to connect node and express.js
and in last we will be creating an user
registration form with Express so let's
begin
I hope you guys are ready to learn
something new now we will start our
first topic
node.js is a file JavaScript runtime
environment but it does not support
request handling functions HTTP methods
or serving files so Express GS comes
into the picture Express makes the
node.js code easier as Express provides
a wide range of features to develop both
web and mobile applications it is used
to build single page multi-page and
hybrid page web applications as Express
is written in JavaScript it is very easy
to understand for the developers who
know JavaScript until now Express is the
most popular framework of node.js
you must have heard about mean stack in
web development right where e stands for
express.js
it is a back-end part of mainstack it
manages routing HTTP methods sessions
error handling Etc
let's see what Express JS is
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
cross platform mobile apps quickly and
easily it is very high performance fast
lightweight and unopeniated that is
there is no structural way to write a
code XPS does not force you to write a
code in a fixed manner
express.js is used as a server-side
scripting language
let's see the need for express.js but
before that let me give you an example
if you have to write a rest API using
the core modules of node.js and the same
using the framework express.js you will
realize that with the help of express it
will take 5 to 10 times less code and
time
that was the reason behind creating
express.js framework for node.js
express.js is time efficient fast money
efficient very easy to learn and
asynchronous let's see the features of
express.js
for server side development with the
features of node.js XP saves a lot of
time middleware middleware is a request
Handler that has access to the
applications request response cycle
routing this refers to how an
application's endpoints URLs respond to
client requests
templating it provides templating
engines to build Dynamic content on the
web pages by creating HTML templates on
the server
debugging Express makes it easier as it
identifies the exact part where bugs are
let's see the advantages of express.js
expresses unopeniated and we can
customize it and use it as per our needs
as it is written in JavaScript a single
language is used for front-end back-end
development
Express is fast to link it with
databases like MySQL mongodb
Etc
let's see the disadvantages the
disadvantage of express.js is that
there's no structural way to organize
things sometimes the code becomes
non-understandable
there are so many issues with callbacks
the error messages that will come are
very challenging to understand
now we'll see the companies that are
using express.js the major companies are
IBM Uber eBay PayPal essential Fox
Sports Netflix LinkedIn
as per the nlib.com there are more than
34 300 companies that are using
express.js
now I think you guys have a brief idea
about Express as it is a lightweight
framework that gives functionalities to
make node.js easy
Express JS is trending so much because
it is helping so many developers to save
their time it is so awesome that most of
the companies are moving towards it
if you know JavaScript and node.js the
framework expresses what you should know
to strengthen your coding skills
now here
you'll find downloads
you can download node from here
and install it but if you find any
difficulties downloading node.js you can
click on the link in the right corner to
see how to download node.js
now let's see the version for node to
verify here I am using visual studio
code you can go and search it and simply
download vs code
after opening your Visual Studio code it
will look like this
here
you will find a terminal click on it
the terminal window will open
here we will write node
hyphen B
this will show us the latest version of
node.js
now we need to update the npm which is
node packet manager this bundle consists
of all the repositories and packages
required for development purposes to do
that npm install npm globally
NVM install
VM hyphen
globally
this will download all the npm packages
globally now let's create Express for
that first we need to create a separate
folder where we will keep all the
modules and files of express.js let's
clean this TLS
you can open the terminal by clicking on
the shortcut also by pressing Ctrl and
backtech that will open the terminal for
you
let's make a folder mkdir
this is a command that is used to create
a folder on the terminal then we will
write our file name I will write Express
by
simply learn
enter
here you can see the file name expressed
by simply learn has been created
you can also click here
and enter your file name
m.js
press enter
as you can see a new file has been
created
now we need to install a package manager
that is npm
we will write a npm command open your
terminal again
write a command
npm
in it
enter
version enter description and
description you can write Express
tutorial
bye
simply learn enter
repository if you have your git
repository you can add yours enter
author
Dylan
license enter
press yes
after this
you can see npm created a Json file
now we will finally install express.js
we will write npm
install
Express
enter
now as you can see our Express is
installed in our system
let's open the app.js that we have
created earlier
now we will create a express application
with the help of Express functions that
we can do by requiring the express
modules let's create our first program
first
constant
press
required
Express
in this line we are requiring the
express module
const
a name equals to function
Express
dot get
to get the file
request response
to get the request and the response
of the user
and
we will need to pass callback function
here
let's write
response send
this message will be shown
in the server welcome
to
welcome to Simply learn
now here
we will write a report number where the
message will be shown to us add dot
lesson
4000 you can write anything
here also we are passing the Callback
function
console
DOT log in console log we will see the
message in the console
listening to Port
number
four thousand
close this line
save this
let's run it open your terminal new
terminal
now to run this file
we need to go to the express
folder
CD
Express
by simply learn
we are now in a simply land folder
now the easiest way is to write the file
name write node
space
the file name app.js
enter
now you can see it is printing our
message listening to Port 4000 now we
will see a message on the server
open your Chrome
type localhost 4000
press enter
and here we go a message is successfully
displayed welcome to Simply learn
get in post method are the standard HTTP
request used to create traced apis
get in post methods are used to send and
receive significant amount of data
the client sends a request in the form
of Json file and with the help of HTTP
requests which are get post and other
methods it will go to the server and
then the server sends back the response
to the client in the form of a message
to tell what happened to the request
that was sent to the server
now
express.js get method
get is a method that is used to request
data from the server but mainly this
method is used to read data
to handle get request in Express is
pretty straightforward
get requests are to be cached and
remains in the browser history and
that's why the get method is not used
for sensitive data
to get the data we add parameters in the
URL and get data in response get method
is more efficient and popular than the
post method
now we'll see express.js post method
post method is used to create new or to
edit already existing data this method
is used to communicate with large amount
of data
the post method is secure because the
data is passed in a request body and not
visible in the URL and the user is not
able to bookmark it mostly we use get
method only but when we want to send a
sensitive data we use post method
now we will see how to get the post and
get methods work
now open your Visual Studio code
I have already installed node and
express if you haven't installed it then
you can click on the right corner of
this video to get the setup done
coming back to express get and post
methods
now what I have done here is I have
created a basic express.js app
const app require Express this will
install all our Express modules
now first we will write our gate method
so let's start
first we will write get method
then we will initialize how it will be
called will write get
this Quest
create new content request parameters
request and response
write the fat Arrow function
this we will send a response
to the server
hello
this is
full
okay
let's I have not initialized the
brackets
let's see what I have not done oh
God like this
now let's just save this file
we will run this file open your terminal
and write node
Dot
and
I think I have done something wrong
let's again open the terminal
right node
Dot so it is showing server is
successfully running on Port 4000.
now we'll open our Chrome and write
localhost
enter
as I have told you earlier this needs a
parameter so we'll initialize here
get request
hello this is successful get request
so a request method is working fine
now
we'll go back to the post method and see
how it Rose
app dot post
response
response send
just like this only
just
post
hello
this is
successful
post
he now will run save this first and then
run it in the terminal
yes node
dot so we're running on 4000
we have to write this so first copy from
here only
open your terminal and here we can write
post Quest enter
so what you can see here is it can't get
post request
for this to see we need to have the
postman I'm using Postman here
here I will write post method and here I
will write the
localhost 4000 and the post request
method then we'll press send
here
in the body part
we will see hello this is successful
post request
how this is working is because post
method is secure and data is passed in
the request body and it cannot be
fetched in the URL
what is middleware middleware is a
request Handler that has access to the
applications request response cycle it
is a function that contains the request
subjects response object and the next
middleware function
middleware can also send the response to
the server before the request
the next middleware function is commonly
donated by the variable named next
simply middleware is a function that can
only be applied using routers with the
help of middleware we can access and
modify requests and response
now we will see what are the functions
of middleware
middleware can execute any code
it can make changes to the request
response objects
middleware can also end the request
response cycle
it can call the next middleware function
in the stack
we use these functions to modify our
middleware to perform many tasks like if
you want to block our site from some
country or if you want to check the
authentication of a user

description to know more
now we are going to create a simple
middleware
we can create a middleware in a router
file but the best way is to create a
middleware file separately and then use
it creating and using middleware is very
easy now we first need to create a basic
express application but before that you
must have all the app packages to run
Express
you can take the help of our video what
is express.js the link will be in the
description
you need to install npm Express to run
this so coming back to our application
first we need
const
express application
so we'll write constant
Express
required
Express
now we'll write constant app
equals to express
function
now to get the data we'll write app Dot
get
foreign
response
response
function
write response send
welcome to
simpler
now or we'll copy paste this
to get the
home page the better way it's too late
copy paste it
here
here we will write the extension of the
next page
home will say
and welcome to this villains
foreign
application we are going to create
just
home page
now we'll make it listen to some Port so
we'll write
add Dot listen
to Port will say report
four thousand
oh
again that other function
control
log
right listening
this message will be prompting to us on
the control determinant
so we'll close this brackets
foreign
open your terminal
first we need to go to this folder CT
Express
by
on
enter
now we'll write
file name
uh
called enter
so it's showing
listening to Port 4000. now we'll open
our Chrome
local server
type localhost 4000 enter
so it is successfully showing us welcome
to Simply learn now we'll go to the next
page we have written there home
enter
so it's successfully showing
welcome to Simply learns homepage
now
will create a middleware go back to that
file
will write
strength
required filter
request you can write anything here
request object
spawn subject
and next
in the fat Arrow function
we will write
console log
okay
yeah right then Quest
then you use this
evaluating
app dot use
request
filter
and save this file
now
we haven't
called our next parameter in Express
framework next is a function
what we'll do is we'll call it in the
bottom of our middleware
will write
next
question
save this file
again we'll open our new terminal
where we'll go to the start folder
Express
by simply run
enter
like node the file name app dot here
enter
and I'll open our file go to the
home
right localhost 4000 enter
it is printing welcome to Simply learn
we'll go to the home page
slash okay welcome to Simply learns
homepage with this we have successfully
reached the end of this video
npm which is called as node package
manager is node.js built in package
manager by default and express.js is a
framework of node.js which is fully
built in JavaScript
it was first made and available for use
in January 12 2010.
let's move on to what is npm
let's take async as an example npm is
incredibly easy to use and all you need
to do is to type npm install async to
install the desired module in the
current directory under node module
folder you may use need function on them
as they use build-ins once installed in
your node modules folder
the biggest software registry in the
world is npm there are more than 80 lakh
code packages in the registry to share
software open source developers utilize
npm npm is often used by businesses to
control private growth
all of the node.js packages and modules
are managed through npm which also
includes the npm command line client
along with the installation of node.js
it is added to the system npm is used to
install the necessary modules and
packages in the node project
moving ahead let's see what is a package
in node.js a package includes every file
required for a module
you can add module in a JavaScript
libraries to your project
now let's see the functions of node
package manager which is npm
online node.js packages modules
repositories can be searched on
node.js.org
use a command line tool to manage
node.js packages dependencies Version
Control and installation
now let's see how to install npm
to install node package manager we have
to install node.js for that you have to
download node.js and install it in your
system
now we will see the version of node.js
go to terminal new terminal
and search here
for
node hyphen V which is denoted as
version enter and this is my version of
node
now we will verify the npm version to do
that we have to run a command
write npm hyphen hyphen version
and you can clearly see my npm version
is 8.5.3
now we will see how we can install node
modules using npm this is a very simple
Syntax for that we just have to write
npm install and that module name
now we will install the famous web
framework module of node.js we will
simply write a command
npm
install
Express
this is a very simple command you can
write in your console or terminal and
then press enter
you can clearly see
the express is installed in our system
what is error handling
array handling is a process in which
express catches and processes the error
that occurs synchronously and
asynchronously
Express comes with its own default error
handlers
simply in error handling the tasks are
to identify errors report them to the
users and then develop some recovery
strategies and Implement them to handle
the errors
this whole process should not slow the
overall processing time of the program
now
how does error handling Works in
express.js
express.js comes in with a built-in
error Handler this default error
handling middleware function is added at
the end of the middleware function stack
it automatically catches all errors in
router handlers and allow developers to
extend router handling functionalities
by middleware function
error handling in Express is done using
middleware this middleware is defined in
the same way as other middleware
functions the errored handling functions
have four arguments error request
response and next
we have next function method that
matches us to the next middleware
Handler in middleware
in error handling we have the next error
method this function skips all
middleware and matches us to the next
error Handler for the router now let's
set up our end link with Express
open your Visual Studio code choose from
over 300 in-demand skills and get access
to 1000 plus hours of video content for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more first we will create a new
directory
for that
open your terminal
new terminal
let's try it
make directory
now I will enter the directory name I
will write
simply learn
or you can also write
error
and
press enter
you can see the area and Link directory
has been created it's empty
let's go inside that CD
L handling
now we are in the middle link folder
now let's create a new project here
we'll write npm
in it
hash
by
so as you can see
the Json file has been created in the
error handling folder
now
we will install couple of packages here
okay
first we will install Express right npm
install
Express
now we will also install Morgan
which locks the request
after that we'll also install HTTP
errors
errors this package makes it very easy
to check the status code
and then last
we will install node dot EnV
press enter
this will take couple of seconds
now in the dependencies
you can see dot EnV Express HTTP errors
and Morgan
now I will create a file in this error
handling folder
right app dot JS enter
now let's install node bond which helps
us not to reset our file again and again
for that we'll write in the
npm
install
is minus sign save
node mod
enter
this will also take couple of seconds
now
here you can see
the node one has been successfully
installed
now open your package.json files
here
in packet.json file
you can see here
this line
I will rewrite this
you can also remove it let's write
script
and in this I will write
note
app dot JS yes
save this file by pressing Ctrl s
yes
now open the file app.js
here we will be importing some packages
in node.js we use require function right
so we'll write const
press
required
and
Express
here we need Express packages
now we will be needing Morgan
we will write const
ant
require
D in
now like this we will need HTTP packages
const
ant
error
create
error
required
p
errors
we also need dot EnV packages to import
our environment variables for that we
will simply write required
Square
tactic
Dot EnV
Dot
config
for this command we need a EnV file we
will create a file
dot EnV
render
and here we have our EnV file where we
can have our environment variables
first we want a port for this
application so we will write the port
3000
save this file
now again go back to the app.js file
here
first we will be initializing our app
we'll write cons
tab
Express function
now we will start the application for
this we will write
const
port
to which it will be called process
dot EMV Dot
port
three thousand
now we'll make our application listen to
Port 3000 we will write
app Dot listen
port number
port
it will call the port number
and here
we will call the Callback function
header function
and here we will make a log statement
for this we'll write console
DOT log
vector
server
new
on
import
two dollar sign
and
port
now let me start the application before
that we'll save this file
now to start the application we'll write
npm
start
enter
here it is showing error let's find out
okay
here
I have wrote script
here we need to write start
save this file
and now clear this screen
enter npm
so as you can see it is successfully
running in the port 3000 rest API are
the standard way to send and receive
data for web services
client sends a request which goes to the
rest API then to the database
to get or put the data after that it
will come back to the rest API and then
to the client
using an API is just like using a
website in a browser but instead
clicking on the buttons we write code to
request data from the server
it is very flexible and can handle
multiple types of requests
restful API is very popular and very
commonly used to create apis for
web-based applications
what is express.js
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
and cross platform mobile applications
it is used as a server-side scripting
language
express.js is high performance fast
lightweight and unopeniated
we'll see what is rest API but before
that what is rest and what is API
rest means representational State
transfer rest is a popular architecture
which is used to create web services
Now API is a application programming
interface it is a code that allows two
software programs to communicate with
each other
rest API is a software that allows two
applications to communicate with each
other with the help of internet and
various devices
now
we will see the HTTP request types first
one is get it is used to request data
from the server but mainly this method
is used to read data
next one is path it is used to update
the data or to change or replace it next
is
post
method is used to create new or to edit
already existing data
after that it is delete
delete method is used to delete the data
completely from the server
now we will see the complete
architecture of HTTP request type in
this client sends a request in the form
of Json file
and with the help of HTTP request which
are get patch post and delete it will go
to the server
and then sends back the response to the
client in the form of message
to tell what happened to the request
and now we will create a simple restful
API from scratch

first you need to open your editor for
this I am using vs code
for this
you need to open your folder
created one folder in the
C drive
Express Js
for this
you need to have node.js installed
first open your terminal by clicking on
Terminal New terminal
first we'll write npm
in it
hyphen y
press enter
this will create a Json file
for us
now let's install express.js
for that
will write in pm
install
Express
enter
installing express.js
this will add
all the dependencies
so now we have only one Express
installed
we need a file here
to write our code
so we'll create a file called index
dot JS enter
in this file we will write all our code
when index.js Js
first we'll write cons up
where
Express
in this line we have imported the
Express package
which itself is a function
so we'll write parenthesis here
to initialize it
now
right
port
we'll write the port number I'm writing
4000 here
this will call a variable which is 4000
write app dot let's see
till now our API hasn't defined any
endpoints
this app Dot listen tells the server to
listen on specific Port which we have
defined already as a variable
four thousand
now
in app dot lesson we will write a second
argument as callback to tell us the API
is working or not
then we'll write
port
comma
we'll write the Callback function here
function
console
DOT log
tactic
it's
running
on http
closed
localhost
all this time
and import
which will come under curly brightness
now we can run this app by writing the
command on a terminal
actually save this file
terminal
now we'll write a command to run this
file
index node
file name index Dot
yes
so it's successfully showing us it's
running on HTTP port
4000.
0 Chrome or anything
I'm using Chrome here I'll write
localhost
4000
enter
closed enter
can't get
now
if you open this URL you will see
this message can't get this is because
we don't have any API endpoints as of
now
but express.js is still responsing with
error message
you can add an API and call it
every application consists of front-end
back-end and the database together they
form full start and in this video we
will be talking about react and
express.js
react was created by meta and it is used
to make web application responsive
express.js is unobedient and it is used
to make apis Express is maintained by
node.js
let's see what is react.js
react is a JavaScript library which is
used to build mobile and web
applications fast and Interactive
it is an open source reusable components
based front-end library of JavaScript
basically with the help of react we can
create a client-side application or user
interface
it is a combination of HTML and
JavaScript
let's see the features of react.js
first jsx
it is a syntax extension of JavaScript
with the help of react.js we can use the
extension to see how the UI should look
like
virtual document object model Dom it
defines how documents are exist and
manipulated in the web page
performance there are several ways to
speed up your regular act application by
using virtual Dom
one with data binding information Flows
In One Direction react receive
information through arguments and pass
it by returning values
react goes beyond simple UI and has many
extensions for complete application
support extended with flux and Redux
among others
debugging it is a small browser
extension to make debugging easier and
faster let's see what is express.js
expresses a node.js framework designed
to build apis web applications closed
platform mobile apps quickly and easily
it is very high performance fast
lightweight and unopeniated express.js
is used as a server-side scripting
language
let's see the features of express.js
first fast server side development with
the features of node.js Express saves a
lot of time
middleware middleware is a request
Handler that has access to the
application request response cycle
routing
this refers to how an application's
endpoint URLs respond to client requests
templating
it provides templating engines to build
Dynamic content on the web pages by
creating HTML templates on the server
debugging Express makes it easier as it
identifies the exact part where bugs are
now we'll see how to connect client-side
to the server side first we need to
create a folder I have created a folder
named react Express
let's see
go to your save file
here I have created react Express folder
now we will be using a text editor in
this video I will be using visual studio
code let's open it
then
we will add all the npm packages and
create a react application called client
open Terminal
new terminal
let's write some command
npx
it
react
app
lying
enter
this will take some time
until then just wait
yes so it's downloaded
now as you can see the client folder has
been created
with all the npm files
in this client folder you will see all
the npm files known modules
Json file also
yeah
now
we'll go to this folder
CD client
now to get this application running type
npm
Dot
enter
this command will start and compile this
application now it has opened a web page
localhost 3000
this is the first client-side
application startup page
this will be now working as a client
now let's create a backend application
for that first
clean this terminal
let's open a new terminal
type
npx
Express
engine
data
folder name
press enter okay
now this will take some time to install
press yes why
as you can see a API folder has been
created
now we'll go to that API folder see the
API enter
now we are in the API folder
let's install
all the packages in pm
install
press enter
this will again download all the
packages
so npm has installed all the packages
required to run this as you can see in
the packages.json file there are all the
repositories and files that I used
now let's terminate this terminal
terminal
now let's go to the client folder CD
client
press enter
now we are in the client folder
npm
this command will start and compile this
application
now
we'll see the standard express
application that has got installed will
again go to the terminal
delete this terminal
create a new terminal
and this will go to the API folder
npm start
when we start the terminal
press enter
now
we'll go to the Chrome
localhost 3000 very fresh it
you will see the standard express
application that has got installed
for this typescript typescript is an
object oriented programming language it
is a strongly typed superset of
JavaScript and all the code of
typescript is compiled with JavaScript
only
it is developed and maintained by
Microsoft
typescript was created to develop large
applications
it is mainly used to simplify the
JavaScript code so that it can be read
and debug easily
what is node J
no change is an open source cross
platform JavaScript runtime environment
and it runs on a web application outside
the client browser node.js is used by
the developers to build server-side web
application
notice is perfect for data intensive
application since it uses an
asynchronous event driven model
what is express.js
express.js is a node.js framework
designed to build apis web applications
cross-platform mobile apps quickly and
easily
XYZ is unopeniated
it is high performance fast lightweight
framework of node.js express.js makes
the node.js code easy as it is used as a
server-side scripting language
now we'll see how to set up node with
Express and typescript open your Visual
Studio code
new folder which I have created in this
C drive typescript
it's an empty folder
I'll show you
open the terminal
I will show you if it is empty LS
those folder is empty
now
will make a project inside it
will simply write npm
in it iPhone y
for all the default values
press enter
so you have seen
the package.json file has been installed
in this package
it is clearance
now the first thing you need to install
is typescript
type npm
PN
d
this will install the typescript
dependencies
now I will install two more dependencies
please write npm I
guess if a node
I will also install nodemon
mode
enter
this will install all the dependencies
there will be need in this project let's
clear the screen
now now we have to install Express
npm
install
Express
let's wait for a couple of seconds the
npm express has been created
open the package or decent file here you
see
all the dev dependencies
Express
nodemon and TS node
has been successfully installed
now we need to create a project inside
this folder for that we need to write
npx
hyphen in it
wait for a couple of seconds here we go
here the screen
now we'll execute npx
hyphen
foreign
yeah
now we will be creating a source folder
for that
right mpdir
C
enter this would be containing all our
typescript files here
you can see it's empty
let's create a file here
Dot
everything we're going to write is
inside this file only
so you set up for typescript with
Express in node is ready
you can write anything here
the first thing you need is node.js
let's see I have created one for me you
can create it by just entering a command
make directory in the terminal
and entering your folder name it can be
ABC or something you need
and like this it will be created but I
don't need it so I'm going to delete it
and this
I will open the terminal again
I'll write a command
npm
in it
what
this will create a Json file for us
like as you can see here
the Json file has been created here
clear the screen
now we will install express.js in this
folder for that write a command in VM
install
Express
and press enter this will install
express.js for us
you can also see here the independencies
Express has been successfully installed
and all the other modules are here
so
let's clear the screen now
now we will create a server file here
let's name it app.js
here we'll write all our code
so let's create a simple Express folder
right
const
Express
require
keyword
all over
modules will be here
the
in this we are requiring express.js
now we will also be meeting
port
Al
processes dot EnV
y dot port number that we'll gonna write
here
using port number 3000 you can write
anything
this will be a port number now
create an app
Express function
you have created an instance for express
now we'll create
it listen to our code
that's right app Dot listen
Board number it will read by its own
function
control log
but we are gonna see about it
server
started at http
localhost
dollar sign
to get the data of the port
and we'll write the code it will fix the
number of the port
here it goes
now we have created a front end of this
I repeat now we will create a front end
of this registration form so let's
create it
foreign
public
in this folder
let's create two files index
dot HTML
and
uh
second one will name as style.css
now in the index folder
we'll write all our front end code so
open
index.html page
ride dog and enter this will create a
HTML template for you
in the title
yes
will write
registration
form
you know
in the body part
will write
heading for this
H1
right heading you just
have the action will be class
heading so we can style it afterwards
everything
now we'll create a form
function
okay
class will be formed
now we'll create an input types first
we'll create input type will be
text
will be the right first name
this folder
sorry
this username will be come inside the
text box this first name
his name
now we'll create few more like this for
password
last name age number
let's copy this input
[Music]
first one will be first name second one
will be
last name
so we'll write the email
for this
this looks good
let me write that email
will write password
placeholder will write
it will be empty so no one will see our
password this will be an empty
it's ready here
and we'll write
in the placeholder password
let's go to another one
and let's create a first name last name
email password and let's create one more
that will be a
h
for this we have to write here
number
name I guess
let's write this here
page
this folder what we see inside this box
in the front end
right
let's create a submit button
type of the button will
please submit
so we can
give it styled
excuse
me
so our form is ready
uh yeah
we'll write require
D so
one will be left empty
this will help us to
to require every field because
everything is important
we cannot
make it empty so we are writing required
so
our HTML page is ready
here let's see how it looks open this
HTML page
here
a registration form look like this
let me show you what require is doing
as you can see please fill out this
field this is what required function do
submit
is
now coming back to vs code
will write some CSS code for styling
here we will write
padding for the page
will be zero
we don't have to write percent
margin
we'll also write 0 for the overall page
now we'll go to the
body part
so the
height will be 100
pH
width will be
100 BH
this place value will be
legs
in the direction of the flex will be
bottom
right just if I content will be in
Center
alignment
items to
this is how we will
write a body part
coming to the
form of the speech
from
all right
everything will be a single copy this
it's pasted here
don't want the height of the phone this
much
it could be let's create a 40.
40 percent
width will be 100 only
this place legs will be here
direction or this will be column only
just if I contains
let's see in the I mean
okay
to our code
let's make it not Center
let's make it as
space
around this let's make it space between
you can style it as your own
as you want
heading
display will be in line block
this will make our
page registration Page look
more clean
perform
okay
input
the output it will be
needed
heading we can do
then passing from this side
input is okay
now we'll go to
let's do something with the button
button
it will be
padding will be
10 percent from this
right
yes
save the color for this
e
bro
color will look like this
it's not an issue
is in
the summit button
uh
box
this will look cool
brown color
of the summit button will be black
and the text which is inside it will be
White
so it looks clean as a
registration form
it's done
can also
first save this file go to the file
a registration form look like this
isn't it cool uh let's make this a
little up
The Heading part will
operating for 40 percent
if this is fine
go to the form and see
yeah it looks good now
let's see everything is working fine
yeah
coming back to our vs code
now
so our front part is ready if there will
be any changes we'll do it later now
coming back to our backend part
of this registration form we'll make our
first API routes
here
dot get
on
excited
request
response
the other function
let's write here the response that the
form will send
we will write the directory name
of this HTML file
it's right here
directory name
because
public
x dot
save it
coming back to our
68 post method also here
just
bomb post
and response
will be here
request
body
here in this part it will face the data
in the body of the HTML page
now
let's create an API middleware
for that
to use
Trace dot Json
here we are accepting the data in Json
format
this will
.use
Express
dot URL encoded
function
this is basically to decode the data
sent through HTML form
Dot View again
this will Express
dot you will write static
starting function will will be public
folder
public
this will use the public folder for us
now
we'll save this file first
open your HTML file
and write in the form part
itions
here
will declare the file name app.js
com
class form
and we'll write method which will be
closed here
everything looks
good it forgot to write inverted commas
here
save this file
now open the terminal
and write node
app dot Js
press enter
so our code is running fine let's open
it
yeah
everything looks fine
hello Learners simply learn brings you a
post graduate program by Caltech in full
stack web development which is the
ultimate resource to equip you with the
knowledge and tools you need for Success
you can find the course Link in the
description box below to learn more
about this course welcome back to
another video by simply learn and in
this video we will be creating a user
registration form but before we begin if
you haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and press the Bell icon so you
will never miss any update from Simply
learn so without further Ado let's begin
for this tutorial we are using visual
studio code
the first thing you need is node.js
let's see I have created one for me you
can create it by just entering a command
make directory in the terminal
and entering your folder name it can be
ABC or something you need
and like this it will be created but I
don't need it so I'm going to delete it
and this
will open the terminal again
I'll write a command
npm
in it
what
this will create a Json file for us
like as you can see here
the Json file has been created here
clear the screen
now we will install express.js in this
folder for that write a command in VM
install
Express
and press enter this will install
express.js for us
you can also see here the independencies
Express has been successfully installed
and all the other modules are here
so let's clear this screen now
now we will create a server file here
let's name it app.js
here we'll write all our code
so let's create a simple Express folder
right
const
Express
require
keyword
all over
modules will be here
the
in this we are requiring express.js
now we will also be meeting
port
Al
processes dot EnV
y dot port number that we'll gonna write
here
using port number 3000 you can write
anything
this will be a port number now
right
create an app
Express function
you have created an instance for express
now we'll create
it listen to our code
let's say app Dot listen
port number it will read by its own
a data function
and so long
but we are gonna see back it
server
started at http
localhost
dollar sign
to get the data of the port
and we'll write the code it will fetch
the number of the port
here it goes
now we have created a front end of this
I repeat now we will create a front end
of this registration form so let's
create it
foreign
public
in this folder
let's create two files index
dot HTML
and
uh
second one will name as style.css
now in the index folder
we'll write all our front end code so
open
index.html page
right dog and enter this will create a
HTML template for you
in the title
yes
we'll write
registration
form
foreign
part
will write
heading for this
H1
right heading you just
have the action will be class
heading so we can style it afterwards
okay
now we'll create a form
function
okay
class will be formed
now we'll create an input types first
we'll create input type will be
text
will be right first name
this folder
sorry
this username will be come inside the
text box this first name
his name
now we'll create few more like this for
password
last name age number
let's copy this input
[Music]
first one will be first name second one
will be
last name
so we'll write the email
for this
oh
this looks good
right email
will write password
placeholder will write
it will be empty so no one will see our
password this will be an empty
let's write it here
and we'll write
in the placeholder password
let's go to another one
and let's create a first name last name
email password and let's create one more
that will be a
h
for this we have to write here
number
name is
let's write this here
page
it is folder what we see inside this box
in the front end
right
let's create a submit button
type of the button will
please submit
so we can
give it Style
d
see you
something
so our form is ready
uh yeah
we'll write require here
so
one will be left empty
this will help us to
to require every field because
everything is important
we cannot
make it empty so we are writing required
so
our HTML page is ready
here let's see how it looks open this
HTML page
here
a registration form look like this
let me show you what require is doing
as you can see please fill out this
field this is what required function do
submit
is
now coming back to vs code
will write some CSS code for styling
here we will write
padding for the page
will be zero
we don't have to write percent
margin
we'll also write 0 for the overall page
now we'll go to the
body part
so the
height will be 100
pH
width will be
100 BH
this place I will be
legs
in the direction of the flex will be
bottom
right just if I content will be in
Center
alignment
items Center
this is how we will
write a body part
coming to the
form of the speech
Bond
right
everything will be a single copy this
is paste it here
don't want the height of the phone this
much
it will be let's create a 40.
40 percent
width will be 100 only
this place legs will be here
direction or this will be column only
just if I contains
let's see in the I mean
okay
to our code
let's make it not Center
let's make it as
space
around space let's make it space between
you can style it as your own
as you want
heading
display will be in line block
this will make our
page registration Page look
more clean
perform
okay input
the output it will be
needed
padding we can do
then passing from this right
input is okay
now we'll go to
let's do something with the button
button
it will be
padding will be
10 percent from this
right
yes
color for this
e
oh
the color will look like this
it's not an issue
amazing
the summit button
uh
box
this will look cool
brown color
of the summit button will be flat
and the text which is inside it will be
White
so it looks clean
the registration form
it's done
you can also
save this file go to file
a registration form look like this
isn't it cool uh let's make this a
little up
The Heading part will
the operating for 40 years
inside
go to the form and see
yeah it looks good now
let's see everything is working fine
yeah
coming back to our vs code
now
so our front part is ready if there will
be any changes we'll do it later now
coming back to our backend part
of this registration form we'll make our
first API routes
here
dot get
on
excited
request
response
the other function
let's write here the response that the
form will send
the directory name
of this HTML file
it's right here
name
because
public
x dot
save it
going back to our
158 post method also here
foreign
post
and response
function will be here
request
body
here in this part it will face the data
in the body of the HTML page
now
let's create an API middleware
for that
to use
Trace dot Json
here we are accepting the data in Json
format
this will
do it again
dot use Express
dot URL encoded
function
this is basically to decode the data
sent through HTML form
dot again
this will Express
dot will write static
starting function will be public folder
public
this will use the public folder for us
now
we'll save this file first
open your HTML file
and write in the form part
itions
here
will declare the file name app.js
form
class form
and we'll write method which will be
post here
everything looks
good it forgot to write inverted commas
here
save this file
now open the terminal
and write node
app dot Js
press enter
so our code is running fine let's open
it
yeah
everything looks fine
Janu is a popular framework nowadays and
you must have heard it
almost every websites and web
applications users Django and somewhere
other for their web development so in
today's session we'll discuss what is
Django framework
let's start by discussing what is a web
framework
a web framework is a software framework
that is created to support the
development of dynamic site web services
and web applications
it supports creation development and
Publishing of the web applications and
websites hello Learners simply learn
brings you a postgraduate program by
Caltech in full stack web development
which is the ultimate resource to equip
you with the knowledge and tools you
need for Success you can find the course
Link in the description box below to
learn more about this course hi guys I'm
Anjali from Simply learn now if you have
been following our playlist on python by
now you have probably completed all the
basic concepts of python so today we'll
use these basic concepts in creating a
website using python again now this
application is called Django and before
we move into actually developing the
website let's better understand what
Django is so Django is a high level
python web framework so when you compare
Django to many of its other counterparts
such as flask which also uses python it
provides very limited freedom but then
again this limited Freedom does mean
that it makes Dev development much
faster and that is the goal of Django so
if you are a complete beginner with web
development and also start off with
python this is the place to start so
Django has a free and a paid version but
since you're just learning how it works
we can go for the free version in fact
the paid versions only required when
it's utilized by companies where they
perform a lot of modifications to the
point that it's actually unrecognizable
now some of the companies which are
using Django are Instagram bitbucket
Pinterest and even NASA now this another
important thing that we need to
understand about Django which is its
design pattern so Django follows the MTV
design pattern where MTV stands for
model template view these terms may seem
very remote to you right now and I don't
think there'd be a point of me
explaining what they are as of now so
once we move on to the demo where I'll
be teaching how you can create the web
framework we can better understand how
this design pattern works and with that
we are finally ready to move into
actually create creating our website so
there are certain prerequisites to
Django to perform these open your
command prompt so the first thing we
need to ensure is that your system has
python installed now of course if you
are learning Django you probably already
know Python and for this purpose you
would have had python installed
previously itself we'll just check so
type in Python version and if you do
have python installed your version
number will appear here now the other
thing we need installed is PIP so once
again pip would also be installed on
your systems it comes with python itself
and so yeah I have Pip 19.0.2 version
now once those two things are done we'll
move on to a virtual environment so a
virtual environment is basically this
environment that we create to isolate
our application now this is necessary in
Django because often we make
applications we have completely built
the application and now we do not want
to touch them we do not want to create
anything new we do not want to update
any packages that are already being used
so if you're creating a new application
for which you need to update the
packages we don't want the
implementation of that to hamper with
the implementation of a current
application so this is why we completely
isolate them so for that the first thing
you do is you need to install the
virtual environment wrapper we'll use
the PIP command to do so so pip install
virtual EnV wrapper so if you're using
any other systems such as Linux systems
and then press enter but in case of
Windows put a dash and win which
signifies windows so I already have my
virtual environment installed so now we
have python we have our pip and we have
the virtual environment now let's create
a virtual environment so to create the
virtual environment type in MK virtual
EnV and the name for your virtual
environment so previously I had made a
virtual environment py1 this time I'll
go with py2 and that should create your
environment so virtual environment is
created which is py2 and as soon as it's
created you'll notice that now your
commands start running in py2 so when
you're creating an application the
application itself is not created at
this place it's just the environment
files that's stored in here so now all
this is done the final prerequisite is
of course to have our web framework we
need to install Django so let's get to
that pip install Django so now that
Django is installed we are finally ready
to start our project so the command to
run to start your first project Django
Dash admin start project and followed by
the name of your project so I'll just
name my project the Django project so I
just cleared my screen now if you go to
this location where we created our
project you'll see the project folder is
created here and inside the folder
there's yet another folder with the same
project name and a manage file now this
manage file is usually what we will be
running to compile our programs and then
within the folder you have certain
python files so we'll open all this in
our ID D and I'll be using pie charm but
you can go ahead with any other python
ID in fact you can even use a notebook
so you can select your project from here
the panel on the left or you can opt for
open browse through your folders and
then select your project so the project
we created just now is the Django
project which is this one so I'll open
it and and your project will appear on
the left side panel here you can see
within it there's another folder with
the same project name and they see
manage.py file now within this folder
again there's another folder dot idea
and then there is the init settings URL
and the wsgi file although we won't be
making changes on modifying any of these
files so we'll check out what these
files are one by one although we won't
be making modifications to most of them
the idea folder probably won't be
existing in your project you can
completely ignore that now we'll have a
look at what each of these python files
do so the first file which is the init
file as you can see it's empty the
reason is that the very presence of this
file is only to inform that this package
here this is not any ordinary folder
it's a python package so you don't
really need any content within this now
the next file that we have here is the
settings file so the settings file is
the central configuration file this is
modified only when your application goes
into the real world other than that we
just leave it as it is so some of the
values that you would be modifying is
for example the debug value now when the
debug value is true which in our case it
is whenever an error occurs in any of
your code and you're trying to run that
page all the errors appear on the page
but now if you are putting your website
into the real world you do not want that
all your errors will be displayed on the
page for obviously security reasons so
then you can just change this value to
false just before you upload your page
next you have the URLs page as from the
name it's very clear the URLs page is
very you have your url stored so
basically this file Maps the URL of a
page to the function that the page will
be performing so now you have the wsgi
dot py code file so this page contains
an application callable which the
application server uses to communicate
with your code and finally we have the
manage.py page this is the page used to
interact with your project so we never
ever touch the manage.py page the
settings page does change when your
website goes into the real world the
URLs page we will be actually modifying
during the course of our project again
the wsgy Dot py Page we leave it
untouched so now that you know the
basics of what each file already present
does we can start our demo so before we
start coding our website there's a dummy
development server which is provided
with Django so we'll just check that out
first just go to your command prompt and
move into the path of your project and
then you just type python manage.py run
server and as you can see here the
development server has started and it's
at Port 8000 so go to your browser open
any browser of your choice localhost and
at 8000 port and as you can see here
since we have installed our Django and
we ran our server so our Django page has
appeared here and it says that our
installation worked successful so so far
all good we can now start building our
project so what website are we creating
well I was thinking of a very basic
website where you'll have the front page
the first page would have probably like
three four genres and within each owner
you'll have a piece that is an article a
novel or even a poem of that particular
genre so the user gets to click the
genre on the first page and the minute
he or she does so we move on to the next
page where we have our article within
that genre displayed we'll also in
include a registration page just to see
how that works with Django so before we
move on guys I want to tell you that
this tutorial will completely
concentrate on how Django worked so we
will not look much into the details of
how our page is displayed that is we
won't go in depth into HTML CSS and so
on but rather just stick to Django and
its functionality and another thing that
we need to know about Django before we
start developing is that every page in
Django is called an app so when you go
to a website say Facebook for instance
you have multiple tabs right so there's
a tab for the profile you click on it
and it immediately takes you to your
profile now if this entire thing that is
Facebook was built on Django then your
profile would be one app and then
there's another tab which takes you to
your messages the page where all your
messages are displayed that would be a
second app so that's how Django works
every small thing every component or
every page of your website is an app and
you need to ensure that you can describe
exactly what an app does in one or two
sentences so a page should not have
multiple things happening on it if a
page is for displaying messages that
should be the sole purpose of the page
so yeah that's the basic of apps and how
they are a part of Django so how do we
create this app just open your command
prompt move on to the path where your
project is stored now in here you'll
type in the command to create your first
app so that's python manage dot py start
app and then the name for your app so
I'll name my app genre so basically on
my first page I want all my genres to be
displayed and every article is put under
a particular genre hence the name enter
and your app should be created so I go
back to my pycharm and as you can see
here we have our app genre created in
here now under this app there are more
number of files so what do these files
do we'll discuss that first well first
is our migrations folder now inside this
migration folder there'll be a number of
files which will be created once we go
through our project we'll see every time
we execute a particular command a new
file is inserted into the migrations
folder so this basically connects your
database with your source code and that
might seem very complicated but actually
Django makes it extremely easy and then
you have the admins page now this admin
file or this admin page that Django
provides is extremely useful so it's
like the zummy admin page where you can
actually go and you can view your entire
database there in a very formatted way
you have all the models that you created
there you can insert more values you can
delete values you can edit values which
are already present so right now the
admin page will not be existing there's
no point of us going and checking it
right now since we have not created any
models yet again what is models I'll
come to that too so that is the next
file I'll be telling you about now if
you have gone through objective oriented
programming by python or Java or any
other object oriented programming as a
matter of fact you probably know the
concept of classes now over here in our
models file we create classes and each
of this class is actually a model and by
that we mean it's a database so when we
create a class we have a number of
attributes in this class and each of
this attribute forms a column in our
database so that is what will be
happening here and once we create a
class or what we call model that is when
we can actually view the admin page and
we'll see how this page is extremely
helpful the next important page is the
viewers page so guys if you remember
initially I told you that Django has a
design pattern which is the model view
template where model is already
discussed they are the classes template
as you probably guessed is the look of
the page so that's basically a HTML
files and what brings the model and the
template together that is the view so
View adds the functionality now whenever
you receive a request from the user for
a particular URL you will describe the
response for this request but view is
not responsible for giving the response
that is another file that we'll be
creating as you'll see in some time so
now when I go back to my web page here
there's no URL for this this is just a
domain name but once we start creating a
website the very existence of each web
page is linked to a presence of a URL so
that is exactly where we'll start
building under a Django project folder
we have this URLs page there's already a
URL path present here it says admin
which is as you guessed it's the URL to
the admin page that is by default
provided by Django and over here there's
this another parameter so what this
parameter is it's the response that is
to be given for the request that you
receive now just in this manner we need
to add the URL for our first page which
is going to be the genres page so I say
path Jonas and then in here I'll insert
the action so I've not created any
action yet so I don't know what to put
in there either as of now but guys think
about this so if our website has 10
pages does this mean that we'll have 10
different URLs going in here that would
be quite half a sad wouldn't it so we
need a more organized way of doing this
and for that very purpose we will use
genres the app as our base app so if
from genres we are moving on to our
second page so say our genres has our
three genres which is fiction
inspiration and something else so user
clicks on fiction and this immediately
takes the user to the second page where
the content in fiction is displayed so
then our second page should be a sub
page of genre in a way and every other
page that we move to from our first page
should be the same so for this purpose
what we can do is we'll go to a genres
app the package we'll create another UI
URLs file within genre and in this URLs
file we'll Define the URL for a second
page with reference to our genres URL so
how is that done well the first thing
you need to do is you must copy paste
the statement here into our URLs page
for this page we do not really need to
import include so I'll remove that part
out and I also need to Define my URLs
pattern so copy paste this too but again
admin is already defined there
completely we do not require that now
here we'll see if the user wants the
page on us this is going to be my first
page that is my front page so what will
be the response to this the response
will obviously be defined in our views
page right now we have not created
anything in our views page but we will
soon and we will name the response for
the URL join us as index since that is
usually what the purpose of the front
page is it's usually to display the
index so we'll have View U dot index and
then following this we'll also give a
name to this very particular call and
the purpose of that I will explain later
just name this index for now it's not
view it's views and also we need to now
import views okay so we Define that if
the user goes to the space genre then we
will be displaying whatever is defined
under views.index of course we have not
created that yet and we'll move on to
that in a while now the problem is every
request that is made by the user the
first thing Django does is it checks the
URLs page under your main project which
is this page and under this page we have
not defined the action for genres and it
would be very repetitive to Define this
again so what we do instead is we'll
just include the file where we did
Define the function for genres and that
is genres dot URLs so the user gives a
request for the genres page Django
checks out this main URL speech it sees
it matches the URL to this very
particular pattern here and for that it
knows that the response is to include
the genres.url page so it includes this
page and within this page we of course
have the function or the response
defined so now the next thing is to
create the response so now under this
views file we'll create a view the first
thing is we need to import the HTTP
package the request is always HTTP and
this time the response that we are
providing is also a HTTP response we'll
change this later because we'll need a
more defined response but for now we'll
stick to a very basic display on our
first web page so let's import Django
dot HTTP import HTTP response and now we
can define a function which will tell
what response to provide for the
particular URLs now here we say that if
the user gives a request for this URL a
response is views.in index So within
views we need to define a function named
index So Def index and this one takes
request as a parameter and returns a
HTTP response and that response could be
a Simple Text of course you can also
have HTML tags and just for the purpose
of formatting so that our text looks
pretty bold I'll put this into a header
just say hello world so that's done this
is the response that we'll be providing
for that particular URL now the thing is
we have this page here settings and in
settings if you scroll down you'll see
there's a list of apps which are
installed and in this list our app genre
is not mentioned so before we run our
server We'll add our app to this list so
that's done now go to your web page the
one where you ran your localhost first
and this time okay so my server is not
running I need to start my server first
type in your command python manage dot
py run silver and it says that there's
no issue and a server is currently
running so you go back to the page where
we run our Local Host so the last thing
we ran a local host currently your page
would still be on that if you have not
done any modifications I did a few in
between hence I got this page now if you
check out localhost again you'll see
that there's an error this is because
now we started defining the URLs in our
URL page so when you don't give any URL
as such Django checks out the two URLs
defined here and sees hey what you typed
in here whatever your request was does
not match any of the URL patterns so now
we want to check out the genres page and
enter and as you see here hello world is
displayed so of course this is a dummy
page we need to do something way more we
need to create a web page and that is
what we'll get to okay so now that we
viewed our dummy web page the next thing
we need to do is actually populate this
app with some data now to populate the
app with data data of course we need to
first store the data and that is stored
in a database so with Django you would
have probably already noticed here
there's this file called sqlite3 so this
is the database management system that
comes along with Django it's already set
up to be used just a small command a
small tweak that we require and
everything will work perfectly fine so
what this does is basically all the data
that you enter through your model will
work along with this so that means that
there should be a communication between
your sqlite and your source code now if
I go back to the terminal where I ran my
server you'll see here there's an error
line which says you have 15 unapplied
migrations and your project may not work
properly right now what we designed
worked right because we didn't have any
data stored but from now on we will be
storing data so we need to ensure that
the migrations are done right and by
migrations we mean that our database
management that sqlite is synced pretty
well with our source code so first of
all stop your server and now you run a
command to do the syncing which is
python manage dot py migrate and as you
hit this command the syncing is
happening so when you say that the
migrations are complete what you
actually mean is when Django looks at
your installed apps this is an app that
we created and we just added it a while
back to this list of installed apps but
everything else in here in this list was
already present so these are some
default apps for Django or this project
in particular will already work with and
many of these apps require to access
some databases it could not do that
until now but now that we've finished
our migrations when Django checks out
these apps and needs to run them it can
easily access the database take whatever
data is required from there and perform
its functions again if we go back to our
Command Prompt and run the server again
you'll see that this time and we do not
get the error of the unapplied
migrations so that is how you sync your
database with your source code now once
we create our models it means that we
have added some new classes there are
some new tables which are going to be
added so again we need to perform the
migration function which we'll look into
later now let's get to creating our
classes so as I mentioned earlier models
are basically classes now there are two
classes that we will be creating for
this particular project the first class
will have all the genres and the second
class which will hold all the Articles
so let's begin coding now my first class
I'll call it collection and every class
needs to import from Models dot model
now within this class all we need to
Define are its various attributes so
I'll explain this again the class is
basically a table and all your
attributes of the particular class are
the columns so the first thing is the
collection name or the genre name now
the collection name would be something
like of fiction or inspiration or
non-fiction could be anything and all
these are strings so when you're
inputting them so in Django basically
that's the cash field type so you say
models dot car field and a compulsory
parameter here is you have to insert the
maximum length I'll give it 100
characters next thing we'll have a
description for each genotype that again
would be careful enter a max length give
it 500 and then we'll also have an image
or a cover for each of the collection or
each of the genre so that would be a
take call cover as in collection cover
so this again will be a care field type
as I'm going to enter the link for the
image over here now the Links would be
pretty large so I'd say a length of 1000
so that's our first class now we'll
Define a second class which is for the
particular articles or the pieces which
are inside the collection so here we'll
just go for one article within a
collection and I'll name this class as
peace as in a piece within a collection
again this class 2 imposter models.model
and we will enter the column names now
so every piece will have a title which
would be the name of the piece and that
too would be of care field type give
this a 200 and then all of these will
have a particular type that is whether
it's a book it's a novel it's a poem or
it's a blog post that is what will go in
a type variable next we'll have the
artist name for a book that would be an
author for a poem that would be a poet
so we'll go for the general term which
is artist the year it was published now
the year would be an integer so we have
a different field type here the integer
field and that does not require a max
length and finally again for each piece
you'll have a cover so I'll name that
piece cover again we'll pass the link of
an an image here so care field with the
max length of 1000 and yeah so our two
models are created here class collection
and class piece now once again we'll do
the migration and what will happen is
that the database will link with this
model and then we can finally view the
admin page and see what exactly that
admin page is that we've been talking
about all this while but before we move
on we are missing out on something so we
have a collection and we have each piece
how do we link the piece with the
collection well this is where the
concepts that you probably learned in
database is Gonna Come into use this is
where we'll use a foreign key so
although we are writing a code here this
is exactly how a table in a database
will be created so every item would have
a primary key and now we are going to
use foreign keys in a class piece to
link each piece to a particular
collection so if I say dandrum account
book origin so that should be linked
through the foreign key with our
collection fiction so let's create our
foreign key and I'll name it collection
but this time with a small C models dot
foreign key so to the foreign key you
pass the table name to which you're
making the reference first which is
collection and then you pass on an
action as to what will happen to a
particular piece if the collection that
it's linked to is deleted so what we
want is if suppose fiction is deleted
then automatically origin which is tied
with fiction should also be deleted and
that is called a Cascade delete so you
say on delete models dot Cascade and now
we are finally done creating our models
so now that our models are created we
know these particular models are created
for our application or our app genre so
you go back to the settings page and
here we had previously inserted this app
genre but back then it was not actually
required it was just that there is this
other app that is not included in the
default apps given by Django so let's
put in the name there but now that we
actually have a database associated with
this app we need to specify this app in
its complete structure that is the
configuration so if you go under genres
and then there's this file apps and
under apps you can see this class genre
config copy this go back to settings so
genre dot apps dot genreconfig so now
when you run your server Django will
check the list of installed apps and
will be able to access the database
associated with our newly created app
too but there's more to it than that
remember how previously we made
migrations so we can link our database
with the source code now we got to make
those migrations again because now we
created new models so every time you
create a model or you make some changes
to your models you you always need to do
your migrations and this time since our
migrations is specific to a particular
app the syntax is slightly different so
you can also use this terminal down here
it works just the same and python manage
dot py make migrations and your app name
enter and as you see it says the models
collection and piece have been created
now what this migrations exactly does is
it converts these models that you have
written in coded format into an SQL form
so that's where your tables and
everything stored and now if you check
your migrations folder you'll see
there's a new file under it that is a
current migration that you attempted so
now that the migrations are made you can
finally run your project so once again
an overall migrations so I'm back to my
command prompt since the black
background makes it easier to see the
text break out of your server and we
finished our migration so now we can
rana's server no issues and there's no
error with the migrations either let's
now check out our genre page of course
it'll look the same because although we
created our models what the models will
be reflected in is the database the
overall look of the page so far has not
been changed so it's the same so I'll
repeat that once again every time you
make a change to your model or you add
some new class to your model first run
the migrations for that particular app
that is python manage.py make migrations
and your app name and then you run a
migrations in general so that's python
manage.py migrations and then you can
run your server okay so our database is
created but right now it's empty so next
step is to populate our database for
that again open a command prompt and now
you need to enter into the sql's shell
so the command for that is python manage
dot py shell but before that I'll just
go to the path where my project is
stored and now in here I'll execute my
command so once you get these three
arrows you know that you have entered
the shell and over here you can execute
your SQL commands now before we input
values into our tables what we need to
do is we have to import these tables
because even within this project there
are multiple number of tables there are
some tables which were in there by
default too so from genre dot models
import collection come up piece which
are the name of our tables and enter so
our tables are now imported now first
we'll populate our table collection okay
so collection has three columns there's
the collection name there's a
description and there's a cover image so
go back to your shell so we'll have an
object here collection one which will be
equal to collection so this would be the
Constructor for our class collection and
we within this we'll insert our values
so our first attribute is collection
name and that's equal to fiction a
second attribute is the description and
we'll say enter the world of fantasies
for the description of fiction and
finally we have the attribute called
cover which is the collection cover and
in here I'll just enter the URL of an
image I found online so that's it we
have entered the values for our three
attributes now press enter now let's
view if this actually is stored in a
database so for that you execute the
command your table name which is
collection dot objects dot all and it's
empty so what's wrong we created an
object in which we inserted all the
values but then still our database seems
to be empty so this is because so far
this collection object that we created
is only stored in our Shell's memory we
have not actually committed this to the
database so the command for commenting
this to the database would be our object
name which is called one dot save and
once again we'll execute the command to
check everything that's present in our
database collection and now you can see
finally that there is an object present
and now we can also check the value of
the various columns in our table
collection for this particular object
you can say call 1 dot collection name
and gives you the collection name
similarly you can also check its
description now as I mentioned
previously every object that you create
in a table has a primary key associated
with it so the primary key basically
holds the uniqueness of that particular
row so we can also check the primary key
for a particular row or an object just
go for call one dot PK and it says the
primary key is one now the primary key
is also known as the ID of the object so
you can identify it as id2 again you'll
get the value which is y one now if you
want to change the value of any of these
columns that can also be done very
easily on the shell so suppose I want to
change the description say call 1 dot
description and initially it was enter
the world of fantasies I wanted to be
welcome to the world of fantasies so
welcome to the world of fantasies and
now if I check the value of call one dot
description the value has changed so
that's pretty simple isn't it now if you
think this is simple there's a much much
more simpler way of adding values to the
database which we'll see just in a while
and that is where we'll put in more
objects we'll have a few more genres and
we'll also add elements to our table
piece so now we can look into how to
create our admin page so now that we
learned how to input or populate our
database through the Shell let's go for
the easier and the more efficient way
which is through the admin now before we
do that we need to create an admin and
for that go to your command prompt out
of the shell now in your command prompt
type the command python manage dot py
create super user okay so once you do
that they'll ask you to create a
username and we'll just go for admin
since we are creating ourselves as the
admin enter enter an email ID just go
with admin123 at admin.com and a
password so since this is not a
production environment I'm gonna just
bypass the password validation but if
your website is going into the real
world then make sure things are secured
enough and our super user is created
successfully so now we can go on to a
browser and here we'll just type admin
so this is our admin page you can see
here there are two tabs groups and users
but the main thing the main reason that
we require the admin page doesn't not
seem to come out here we expected there
to be our database tables present here
so we can directly go and edit them or
add some values to them but it's not
there so what is missing is that we need
to go back to our python page and over
here go down to the admin file so here
we need to add the models that we want
to appear in the admin page basically we
need to register those models with the
admin page and for that the first thing
we do is we have to import the model so
from dot models import and our two
classes are collection and piece so we
have not added anything to our table
piece yet we will later on but any how
we'll just register both of them at one
shot and you type in here admin Dot site
dot register collection copy paste this
and change the collection to piece which
is our second table and that's it so
with just these two lines of code you
should have your collection and your P
Stables appearing in the admin page now
when I move back to the admin page and
refresh this you'll see that our tables
have appeared here click on collection
and there's one collection object here
click on that you can see the values of
the attributes and through this admin
page now I'll show you how you can add
more objects so just press on Save and
add another here we can enter our second
collections name which in my case is
inspiration and description would be be
inspired to do more and for call cover
which is the collection cover I have
another link that I just took from the
net save and we'll add one more so we'll
have three collections now and our third
collection would be horror the
description let's say the fear is real
although we hope it's not and finally we
have the collection cover paste the link
here save this too so now we have three
objects under collection now as you see
here all our collection objects just say
collection object with the number in
bracket in the similar manner when we
were also going through our shell every
time we executed the command
collection.objects.org we got just the
name collection object and a number but
we want something more meaningful so
when I look at this table of collections
I know that the first one is the
collection fiction the second one is the
collection inspiration and so on so for
that go back to your code so go under
your models.py file and under the class
collection we'll Define a special method
which is double underscore Str now this
is an overriding method that is this
method already defined but the value
returned by this method is not of much
meaning to us as of now so now over here
we'll return something that we actually
want to see when we look at the objects
in our table collection and what I want
is I want the collection name to appear
that would be quite clear as to what
object is at which position so I say
collection return self dot collection
name and that should do it now in the
similar manner we can have the same
function for piece 2 and for peace what
we want to return is the title so that's
it now if I go back to my admin page
refresh this as you can see we have
something much more meaningful under our
table collection now the objects
actually have a name well the objects
don't actually have a name but we are
displaying one of the attributes of the
object and that gives more clarity as to
what the object holds so now we'll start
creating our views now as I mentioned
earlier our website would be such that
the first page that the user goes to is
probably going to be the genre page
which will have the URL genre slash and
with nothing following it so the
function for that particular URL or the
response for that particular URL we
defined in here in our URLs page under
the genres app which is we'll be calling
the index function in views that is this
function now from that page there will
be certain links and when the user
clicks those links he or she can move to
another web page and that is the web
page where the particular article
present inside our collection would be
displayed so I'll just put down in
comment what pattern of the URL we are
matching for each of these path so the
first one that we are matching is just
genre followed by nothing now our next
PATH would be genre followed by a number
now this number one here is actually the
ID of the collection that the user
chooses so if the user chooses the
collection fiction which is our first
collection that has a primary key one so
immediately the user should be sent to
the next web page which is genre slash
one where one represents the ID of the
collection chosen by the user so now for
path let's pass the expression that will
match this particular URL and that
Expressions actually just an integer
number since the front part that is
genre slash is already matched and this
integer number we are going to store it
in a variable because we'll require that
variable later so you can just say int
colon and collection ID now when you do
this and Jonas ID so when you do this
what happens is that this one gets
stored in this variable genre ID and
this pattern will match this URL now
when this URL is matched what response
do you want to give that is what you
want to display on that particular web
page that will be defined in another
function we'll Define underviews we'll
name it details for now of course
details is not defined we'll do that in
a while and give a name to this too
which will be the same details so now we
are able to recognize this URL what we
need to do is next we need to Define
details which will give a response to
that URL so go to your views page and
you create your details function now
what is displayed in this details
function greatly depends upon the genre
that is chosen by the user in the first
page which is stored again in genre's ID
so over here you pass not only the
request but also genre ID and inside
you'll return a HTTP response The
Collection the genre ID is the HTML tags
also need to be within the codes copy
paste that in here have quotes here too
and now one more thing we need to do is
so genres ID is an integer but we cannot
concatenate an integer with a string so
we need to convert this to a string and
that's it so let's go back to our web
page and run this page so the first page
which is genres displays hello world now
if I enter genre slash one which is what
we created newly run the code you see
here the genre ID is one in a similar
manner even if I enter 5 although we
don't have a collection five and let's
play the genre ID is five now these are
dummy web pages so this kind of a
display is fine of course once we
actually start building our view which
we will do very soon things will be more
defined now let's get to actually
creating a good view so what we want
here is uh first of all we do not want
to display any large text so let's
delete that off we need to import our
models because this is where our
database is and of course we need to
fetch information from our database to
be displayed on our view so from dot
models import collection and piece now
in a index function what we'll do is
we'll first collect all the objects from
our table collection we'll have a
variable which is all collection and
then to collect all the objects we'll
use the same SQL command that we used so
so that's collection dot objects so all
your objects in the collection table
will be stored in all collection now
we'll store this as a dictionary so that
we can iterate over these objects and
display them one by one so we say
context equal to all collection is the
key and the value would be our variable
all collection so that's done now we
need to iterate over this so do we do
that within our views itself but there's
no point of doing that because while we
are iterating over every object in our
collection table we also need to display
them in a certain format that means that
we need these objects to be somehow
embedded in a HTML file and this is
where we create our very first HTML file
for our first page which is the genres
page so to create a HTML page inside
Journal create another package and you
name this package templates now inside
templates create another folder and give
this package the name same name as your
app name that is genre and now inside
genre we can create a HTML file I'll
name this file genre template so all our
template or our HTML files will be in
this path okay so before we actually
develop the genre template HTML file
we'll go back to our view and complete
the section off so now what we are
seeing is that we have a template we
have a HTML file and that file will
Define how we need to display the
objects in our collection database or
our collection table all we need to do
here in our index function is actually
pass these objects to our HTML file so
for this we have a function render and
before we actually use the function we
need to import the library Django dot
shortcuts under which we have this
function render this is already imported
on top I'd not see that so I'll just
remove that part out and now that you
have the render function you use that to
pass your object so what this render
function does is basically we'll pass
context to it it will type context with
the template name that we pass and it
will return a HTTP response object so
you pass your request you pass the path
to your template that is Geno slash
templates slash Geno slash genre
template dot HTML so now you have passed
your template to and finally the object
which is context so that's pretty much
all you need to do for your very first
view under the views file now we need to
develop our genres template so for our
HTML file first thing we'll change the
title let's display our app name so in
this particular case since I'm making a
dummy website I'm not giving it a name
or anything just going with our app name
okay so now we need to display our
objects which have been passed from the
views folder now the render function
basically passes an object which is
called object underscore list so we'll
create a for Loop say collection in
object underscore list so this way we
can iterate through all the objects in
our object list and now see this is an
HTML file but this line of code here
this is the python code so pretty often
this will happen that you need to embed
a python code within your HTML file so
what you do is you insert your python
code within curly brace followed by the
percentage sign this will tell your
compiler that hey although this is a
HTML file this line here is actually a
python instruction so now we're able to
extract each genre in fact I'll name
this variable as genre obj now we need
to decide how exactly we want to display
these objects so what I want is first I
want the image of that particular
collection or the genre to be displayed
which is what I have stored in one of
the variables and then just below the
image I want the name of the genre to be
displayed now this name should be
clickable so that the minute the user
clicks on it we can move on to another
page and then just below the name I want
the description for that genre to be
displayed okay so first we have the
image IMG source and in here I need to
insert the link for that particular
image so the link I actually really
already stored in my database as I
showed we did that through the shell and
then later on through the admin page too
so how do we access that particular link
well just like you would in a python
code you can access it through the
variable name and every time you are
accessing or you're displaying just the
value of a variable you insert the
variable name within double braces so
double braces and then genre obj dot
call cover and now I'll give it some
height and width to make it look a
little more appealing we'll have minimal
formatting here because the objective of
this tutorial is not to show you how to
write your HTML code but how Django
works and next I'll have the name as I
said this particular name would be
clickable so inside href I will insert
the URL of the page the user should be
taken to once he clicks on the name so
that URL is what we defined here okay so
it's Jonah followed by the primary key
or the ID of the category that he
clicked so that would be genre slash and
we stored it in genre ID so that's the
link the user will be taken to and now
the name that will be displayed and then
after that finally we have the
description to be displayed so that'll
be in a H3 header again double braces
because we are going to just print out
the value of a variable and then after
each object's details are displayed
we'll break a line for better formatting
what I'll do is I'll have all of this
embedded within a div and have it
aligned to the center so that's it we
have created our HTML file here one more
thing I'll just say end for so that's it
a HTML file or our complete display for
the first page has been created so once
again I'll explain what will happen in
the case of a first page only when the
user enters the URL slash genre followed
by nothing Django will first check this
URLs page the main URL page it'll see
the path has matched here and the action
for this has been defined as you include
the genres dot URL page so it goes to
the genres dot URL page includes this
and in this there's a function defined
as a response for this particular URL a
very well defined function which is in
our views file so it goes to the viewers
file and in the views file we have
completely defined our function index
over here we collect all the objects in
our collection table we convert that
into a dictionary so that it's iterable
then we pass it using the render
function so the render function will
take your template and it will tie that
along with the context which is the
dictionary and it will pass an object a
a response object to a HTML file this
response object will be called object
dot list and it is iterable so we'll
iterate through the object we will
display each object in a sort of
formatted way and that is it and then
the render function will pass this
object all collection to our template
and over here we will iterate over the
oil collection which is the dictionary
and using this HTML code here we'll
print out the objects in all collection
in a formatted way so that's it and one
more thing make a small correction back
in the views file so initially I had
inserted the entire path to genre
template dot HTML so the thing with the
render function is that it automatically
knows that it must look into the
templates folder so you have to only
give the path after the template that's
genre genre template now let's go back
to our browser
and in here put in your url
and there you go so that's our first web
page you can see the image for our genre
is here and then you have the name and
then you have the description okay so
that's redirecting us to a page where
there's an error that says that this
path is not found so when you look at
these error guys you will understand
better as to how the matching of the URL
patterns take place first this URL
pattern just this part after your port
number that is checked against the URL
in your main URL file that is Django
projects.url file where we have defined
just genre and then after that it will
check the files that we included in the
genres URL file that is genre followed
by the the genre ID now we had defined a
dummy page for this previously and that
was being displayed too so I'll go back
to the code and figure out what the
error is the error is here of course I
wrote owner ID which does not signify
anything as such now because here we
have this object genre obj that is where
all the objects from The Collection
table are stored one by one so what we
actually need to access is the ID for
genre obj now I'll go back to my browser
so now I'm back to my browser and as you
can see here we still have our front
page click on fiction and yeah we got a
dummy page back so now our next step is
to design this page go back to your code
and again
designing the page means we need to
start putting content into our details
function now before we start designing
this function we need to populate the
piece table so again let's go back to
our admin page We'll add the data
through the admin page since that's much
easier here you have peace and click on
the add button
first we'll add for fiction the title
will give let's insert the book origin
so the artist would be done round and
it's a novel and the year is 2017.
that's the year of publication and for
the pace cover I'll just put the book
Origins front page cover I'll just put
in the image here a link save and add
another
now for inspiration I'll put in the poem
If and type would be poem artist is
Rudyard Kipling Kipling with single P
the year of publication would be 1895
and for the peace cover another link
and finally We'll add one to horror the
title would be the pet symmetry
written by Stephen King
and again this is a novel it's published
in the year 1983
and then link and we save this so we are
done for each of the categories for each
of the genre we have added a single
article so now that our table piece is
also populated we can start designing
the view for this
so for our Details page let's start with
removing this HTTP response here so
first what we need to do is we need to
extract the object that the user
selected from our genres page so we say
collection
dot objects
dot get
p k equal to genre ID so what we are
doing here is as you can see above we
use the query
collection.objects.org which returned
all the objects in our table collection
now here we are telling that okay I want
just one object from my collections
table and that particular object is the
one whose primary key matches that
stored in the variable genre dot ID and
since genre dot ID is defined in this
file and it's basically the ID of the
genre that the user selected
this
will be a number either one two or three
that is one for Fiction two for
inspiration and three for horror so now
that we got that object we will use this
object C item
to extract from a piece table so for
that we say piece dot object dot filter
and to this we pass
and the category that we filter on is
the collection and that is our foreign
key so remember when we created our
table piece we had a foreign key named
collection so we're seeing if collection
is equal to C item then extract that
particular object from a table piece and
then we will return this again through
the render method
pass the request
and in here we'll have the path to an
HTML file just like we did in the
previous case but this time a different
HTML file because we want to display
this slightly differently
and then finally we need to pass the
context so we haven't created the
context yet which we will now although
this is just one item every time you are
passing it through the render function
you need to make a dictionary out of it
so just copy paste this here name this P
item
item
and just now I did create a HTML file in
the same path as before that is under
templates you have the genre folder and
under that I created a HTML file called
detail template nothing's filled yet but
now that we have created a file we can
put in the path here
so just copy paste this and change the
genre to detail so that's done too now
all we have left is to actually code the
HTML file
so I'll just copy paste this
here and then make the required
correction
so in P item
and this would be piece object
you align its Center and piece obj is
the cover we do not really need a href
here
so delete that part out because this is
the final page we are not redirecting to
any other page from here of course when
you're building a complete web page this
ideally when you click on the name of an
article the article should open
we wouldn't be including that part here
though because it does not bring out any
new functionality of Django
peace obj and here so peace obj dot
title
Dash and then we'll print out the author
or the artist name so peace obj dot
artist
and finally we can have the year
also what this particular article is
that is the type
so that's pretty much it we'll change
the title to
[Music]
so now that
this is done we'll just end the for Loop
also this is not call cover but now
we're going to change it to piece cover
and now we'll go back to our browser
so this is genre page refresh it once
again and we'll click on one of the
genres and yeah as you see
the particular piece related to that
genre gets displayed the patch Symmetry
by Stephen King which is a novel
published in the year 1983. so now we're
back to our code and well our first Anna
second page is designed it's working
fine so now we are not going to create
something new instead what is already
created let's modify that now so far the
functions that we wrote work just fine
but Django provides this thing called
generic classes or generic views what
this does is it makes writing these
functions extremely easy so now you have
four lines of code the exact same thing
can be done in like two or three lines
of code in fact it's not just the easier
method this is also recommended
so I'll tell you how that is done first
of all we need to import the generic
package so from Django
dot views
import
generic and now let's delete this entire
thing
so our first function is basically
listing out all the objects in the table
so you have multiple objects all of them
are being listed out now this kind of a
function
would belong to a generic class so far I
was defining functions now I'm speaking
about class so is it a function or a
class well it is a class
it's definitely a class but I'll show
you how this class is called as a
function so first we'll finish writing
the class now we have the class index
and this particular Class Type is a list
view because you're listing out objects
now under this first we'll have a
template name which is the path to our
template
and now to return our query set so
previously we were always returning a
dictionary now we can return a query set
we have a function diff query set
and under this we just say return
collection dot objects dot all the same
query we were using previously but now
we do not need to take the objects from
the query and then convert them into a
dictionary then pass it on using the
render function we can simply do this
one statement and all our objects will
be sent to a template
where now in the template so far we were
seeing all collection because that is
the key that we were using in our
dictionary but that is no more we are
not using the render function anymore
when this query set passes an object
it's received by the template file
in a variable named object list
so you replace your previous variable
with object list
and that is it with that we finished
the method for displaying our first page
now we'll move on to the second page so
the second page is slightly different
because this time we are not listing out
multiple objects we just have one object
and we are basically giving out the
details of the object that means that
this class
which we'll still call details is a
detailed view class so we say generic
Dot
detail View
let's delete all of this first now the
function of this detail view is
basically to display the details of an
object
so what we need to do is first we need
to define a model now our model is
collection
because we are receiving the primary key
from the collection and each of this
object actually is a part of a
collection the object would not exist if
the related or the counterpart genre of
that object did not exist so a model is
collection and our template name will be
again the path
so that genre
detail template
dot HTML and that's it so this is even
smaller than our generic view now in a
detailed template initially we had the
name of the key in our dictionary again
this time we don't have a dictionary
pass so what is the value here well the
value here would be collection dot peace
underscore set dot all so this will
return all the pieces related to that
particular collection
and everything in small this time
now we are almost done go back to your
views and you see this is a generic
detail view now the thing about the
detail view class is
it always accepts one parameter go back
to your URLs file as you are passing
here a variable gen uh genre underscore
ID of in type you don't need to do that
anymore you can simply say PK and PK
will be passed to this class and now
that's the problem so here we were
calling functions but now we have
classes Define not functions anymore so
we need to figure out a way of calling
this class as a function so for that you
just say as underscore view for both of
these classes
and that's it as simple as that now you
can call your classes as a function and
since you use the generic view now
things have become so much more simpler
much smaller our code looks very neat
now let's go back to our browser go to
our front page let's see if everything
is displayed right yes it is so a
changes worked out just fine click on
one of these tags and as you can see the
page has loaded so much less code very
few lines of code but things work just
as fine as before so web page is all
built but let's add something new over
here to make it look a little more like
a website one of the most common things
that you find in every website you go to
is a navigation bar so let's add the
navigation bar go back to your code now
in here
we need a navigation bar in both our
pages so typically what you might think
is the way to go about it is add the
code for navigation bar in your genre
template and detail template but as you
know whenever you code repeatability is
something that you should be always
against minimum repeatability
so instead what we do is under genre the
same folder that has all our templates
create another HTML file and name this
base so this will be a base template and
we will add the code for creating a
navigation bar in here and then we'll
just include this base in our other
templates so first let's create our
navigation bar now we'll be using
bootstrap to create the navigation bar
and every time you work with bootstrap
the first thing you need to do is in
your head section include these three
links so if you have worked with
bootstrap you've probably already know
you need to go to the bootstrap website
copy these links paste them here so
you're basically able to access some
style sheets which are stored in some
other system and once that's done you
can start building your navigation bar
it's in your body
you have nav class
navbar and navbar default
so this is the class for creating your
basic navigation bar
but actually we'll go with inverse
instead of default so this has a dark
theme navigation bar it will look better
on our white background website
within this create a div tag
of container fluid so basically what the
container fluid does is that
your navigation bar will occupy the
entire page
and it'll fit according to the page
width
now under this you have
the navpa brand class
and the first icon I want is
my home
okay so I put in home here and when I
click on home whatever I want to be
redirected to
whichever page I want to be redirected
to put the link for that or the URL for
that in here
and I'd like to be redirected to the
genres page since that's our home page
now other elements we can include in a
navigation bar
we put them as list elements so class
navbar
and we want these elements to the right
of a navigation bar so we say nav bar
right now I'm not going into the details
of this since again this is not a part
of the Django tutorial so we'll quickly
just create the navigation bar now every
element to the right will be listed out
and I'll have a registration button so
that will be under genre slash
register now I have not created the view
for this URL yet in fact this URL is not
even identifiable yet
but for now I'll just put that in and
we'll run it all together
and finally add the very right and
corner of my navigation bar I want to
display the username that is whichever
user is currently going through my
website now yeah right now we have not
designed the features for all of this we
don't have a registration form itself so
a user does not mean anything to us
right now but very soon I'll show you
how you can create a registration form
you can have users register to it so
then this will start making sense
so we'll say I like class and in here
the way you can extract the current user
of your website is you say request dot
user
and that's it that's pretty much all we
need right now
just check all the tags again we have
the navbar inverse which is the type the
look of our navigation bar container
fluid and here we actually need to
specify that it's a header so we say div
class
navbar header
well this would be closing right in the
end
so I'll just format this once
and finally down here you insert two
python statements you say
block content
content is a variable so you can have
any other name here just say block
content and then end block
so write this I'll explain to you in a
while
so basically this entire part creates
your navigation bar but you require this
navigation bar to be present in multiple
pages so here when you say block content
and N Block it's basically the content
that will fall in each of the pages so
if I go to my genre template page I can
simply include the base template here
and then everything inside the genre
template page all this instruction to
actually create that page will come
under a block
so what we'll do here is we'll go to our
template pages and here we will extend
our base.html file so extends
Jonah slash
base dot HTML
and then
the body the instructions within the
body will be the content of the block
so you say block content
and then end block
now we do the exact same thing with our
detail template
so now this way we created a common base
file for a navigation bar and the
content for each of these templates will
be by Tone included within this tag here
so we'll have the navigation bar present
for every page
now when we move back to our browser you
see the change here there is a
navigation bar if you click on home will
be redirected to a genre page and then
click on one of the categories
and you have been redirected to the next
page the navigation bar is still present
so we also have a user here currently
the only user we created the super User
it's the admin this will change soon
once we start registering people
so next step is to create a form where
we can actually have users register so
for our registration page the first
thing we need to do is we need to create
a URL
and go in here
let's copy this line
so the recognizable URL would just say
register so it would be genres slash
register
and that would call
a views function
called user form
and we obviously haven't defined this
class yet so yeah this is also going to
be a class we are going to use the
generic view to create this two it's
going to be pretty simple but since it's
a class we need to call it as a function
so as view will still exist and we here
we'll have user form
but before we start actually creating a
view for the registration page or
writing a HTML file we need to create a
blueprint for the form so why a
blueprint for the form when we did not
create a blueprint for our other Pages
I'll tell you why but first we need to
comment this particular line because it
will result in an error and now we'll
check out our admin page
yes so this table here is what we'll be
using to store our usernames so the
tables already present here we'll just
tweak it a little that is we'll take the
username we'll take the email address
and we'll take a password field all of
these actually have a password if you
click on them you can see here the
password is hashed so these are the
three fields that we'll collect from the
user so we'll use the basic form
just selecting exactly what we need so
for that purpose we need to create the
blueprint so to create the blueprint
under genre create a python file calling
it forms
and now in here
we'll import that table we just saw that
database
so we say Django Dot contrib
dot or
dot models
import user
got two Imports here so
and then we'll import the module forms
okay so now we can create a class called
user form
which will import from
s.modal form
and in here we'll have a class called
meta So Meta basically means the
definition or a description of your
class so inside our class user form
we'll have a description for our class
and in the description we give a model
name so model name is user because we'll
be using that particular model I just
showed you and then we'll specify the
fields that we'll be using from this
model because we are not taking all the
fields we are going to ignore a few of
them so we say fields
create a list here and within the list
we'll enter the name of the attributes
that we'll be actually using for our
particular form so we have username
email and we'll take a password now
unlike username and email password is
not just any care field so over here we
have to specify the password type
so you say forms dot care field and
within brackets you say widget equal to
forms.password import
so password input so from this your
Django will know that here we basically
need to take the hashed values and not
just store what the user inputs as
characters
so that's it with that we have created
the blueprint of our form next thing is
we can actually go to the Views and
begin writing
the view the Class View for a form so
the class to create a form
would be called user form View
actually before we proceed we need to
import this so let's do that first
import user form
also need to import some other packages
here we'll import a few packages for
user authorization that's authenticate
and login
and now we can begin writing a user form
view class
so to user form you you pass the object
View
and we also need to import a class for
this so let's do that
chango
Dot views.gendrick
import View
okay so the first thing we need to
define a class for this form
and that would be the user form
and once again a template for this form
which will Define the Outlook this form
has so you give a template name which is
a variable name actually you can have
any variable name here just something
that makes sense
now I don't have a template page already
so I'm not as in I've not created
another HTML file for the form
specifically but I know that I'll be
creating it the part genre slash and the
name of the HTML file
so that would be form template now the
minute we are done writing this view
I'll show you how we do the template
that's just basic HTML codes I'm pretty
sure you know how to work with that too
now with forms there are two things
there's the get method that is basically
when the user wants a form so you give
the user an empty form and there's a
post method that is when the user puts
in his or her details into the form
so with our class with a generic classes
these methods are already defined and
within two three lines you can
completely define the functionality of
these so first is the get method to
which we pass self and request
now the first thing is you provide the
form to the user and this form is empty
so you say self dot form
Plus
and you pass nothing to this because as
I mentioned earlier too the form is
empty
and now what you do is you return this
object
through the render function so basically
when you do this
the form is combined with the HTML file
and an object is returned
so basically when you do this what
happens is as I mentioned earlier too
the render function works in the same
way it passes the object of the form the
content of the form to the template and
it basically sends out a HTTP request
so that's your template name and then
finally the form itself
and as we did previously this will be a
dictionary
and that is the get function
now we'll move on to the Post
again you pass self and request
now when the user enters the data and
then hits the submit button that's when
the post function will be called all the
data will be stored in a particular data
variable and that is what we'll be
defining in the first line so form equal
to self Dot
form Plus
and request dot post
so all your data will go into this post
variable
now the next thing that the post
function has to do is check if the data
entered by the user does make sense
so for that you say if form dot is valid
so if the form is valid
save this data
so you say form dot save
so where exactly are we saving this well
as I showed you previously uh Django
provides this table for user this
database for storing the users and the
group users so that is exactly where
we'll be storing the data received
through this particular form
now if the data is valid we can
separate out the various Fields receive
the clean format
so first we have our username say
username equal to form Dot
cleaned data
and that will be username
and then you have the password
so remember when the user entered the
data itself it was stored in these
fields but now we're getting a clean
version of that data and storing it in
this these variables username and
password and now unlike how we can
usually put the equal to sign and assign
values to certain variables this kind of
a process is not possible for passwords
because passwords are not just storing
some CAD field data it has a hash value
I'll show you that once again so you see
here you go to the users
admin and if you check this out the
password is not actually stored as just
characters it's hashed using some
algorithm and then it's stored so in
this particular case we cannot say that
password is equal to this value there's
a certain function through which you
pass the password such that it's stored
in the required format
so for that you see user dot set
password
and then you pass password variable and
finally you see user dot save
so guys over here actually we are saving
the data
in the Shell not in your database and
once a data is cleaned and everything it
is then that we are saving it into the
database so that's why we have two save
statements here so now that the user has
entered their data and they have hit the
submit button we have saved the data in
our database what's next well now what
we want to do is we need to redirect the
user to the index page basically once
the user is done with the registration
process there's no point of the user
staying on the same page again so we
redirect them to the index page now
along with this we'll also combine login
so if the user's password and username
are authenticated and the user is an
active status that means that the user
has logged into our website so now we'll
see how this is done Creator object new
user and this object will hold a user if
the username and the password that we
pass here to this authenticate function
is actually valid and they match
that is the form of that is the form of
pair so the username will be the
variable username
and password will be the variable
password
so if the new user does exist
that is if new user
is not null
if the new user is not none
we'll check the status of the new user
so what is the status again I'll take
you back to that database
go to users
well since we're in the middle of the
code we cannot access this page but
basically this database or this table
which stores the usernames Has a Field
called status which you probably would
have noticed and next to the active user
there's a green tick so if the user has
that green tick if the user is active
that means his session is in progress so
it's basically like logging in
so you say if new user
dot is active
you log in the user if you send request
and the new user object
and once the user has logged in you
return the user to the index page and
this is where you need to use a function
redirect before we use that function we
need to of course import it
so here a redirect is within this same
shortcuts Library
we'll just add and redirect here
so index Pages basically called Geno so
that's where the user will be taken
now if this user is not authenticated
that is there is some invalid data
entered
we basically give the user back a form
an empty form give them another chance
to fill it
so for that we just copy paste this line
here the render
put that down there
and that's it with that we are done
creating a view for our user form now
what we are left with is actually
creating this HTML file so let's do that
again go to genre your main folder and
create a HTML file now remember what we
named
a HTML file in this view that's form
template make sure the same name
so let's start creating the form the
first thing we do is for the form two we
want to add the navigation bar so go to
your go to any of your HTML files and
copy out these lines here
registration
then you have the block content which is
exactly where you'll be putting all your
content
that goes here and then we'll start and
then we'll add the N block
again copy paste that too
okay so now we can start typing out our
HTML code
so first is a form tag
now there's going to be a extremely
simple straightforward form
and now the thing with Django is
whenever you're having a form an
interactive form make sure to include
this csrf token here so csrf stands for
cross-site request forgery
that can be sent actually from and it's
a type of cross-site scripting attack
that can be sent from malicious site
through your visitors browser to your
own server so to prevent this Django
provides a very simple technique which
is where you provide this csrf token now
make sure you're always providing this
whenever you have a post method and
you're not redirecting or you're not
using the URL of or you're not using an
external URL because that means that
your current page csrf token is being
sent to an external web page and
obviously that kind of a leakage would
hamper the security
okay so we'll be taking a username
again email is also type text
and finally the password
and after all the fields you have
finally the submit button
and that's it
so our HTML page is also ready now
so now you need to move on to the URLs
page
and uncomment this because now we
actually have a response
also this is called user form view now
I'll just stop the server and run it
again although it's not really necessary
if you just go back to your page refresh
it everything works fine
okay now we will move on to our web page
okay so home page is working fine just
like before next you click on register
and here's your form so as you can see
here the navigation bar is present for
the form tool
now we'll create a new user
name simply with the email ID simply one
two three gmail.com
and password
that's it now click the submit button
and the minute we click the submit
Button as you can see you got
transferred back to the home page and in
here if you see the right hand corner
you'll notice that we had admin before
but now it's simply so that is because
we just now created a user simply and
the minute you create a user by default
that becomes the active user now to
check this we will move on to the admin
page
and this is our landing page so now what
happened is that since the other user
that we newly created is the active user
that means we got logged out of the
admins profile and to view the admin
page of course we need to be logged in
as the admin so I log back in and as you
can see here under the users group
you'll notice we have a new user created
simply with the following email ID hello
Learners simply learn brings you a
postgraduate program by Caltech in full
stack web development which is the
ultimate resource to equip you with the
knowledge and tools you need for Success
you can find the course Link in the
description box below to learn more
about this course hello everyone welcome
to this video tutorial on SQL basics for
beginners by simpler in this session we
will learn about the database and the
need for a database then we will
transition to SQL and see some basic SQL
queries after knowing whether School
query is we will see the features in
application superscript query and then
we will have a hand on some of the basic
SQL queries so hey everyone I'm Amisha
from Simply learn and welcome to this
video when SQL basics for beginners but
before we begin if you love watching
Tech videos subscribe to our Channel and
hit the Bell icon to now miss an update
let's start with database a database is
a vast collection of data that is stored
and retrieved electronically from a
system in today's world data has become
the new oil which has mandate companies
and businesses to rely on an excellent
database to store the vast amounts of
data
every millisecond the tech Giants are
accumulating vast amounts of data that
need to be stored the database comes
with features to update and effortlessly
manipulate data and not only that these
database provider companies ensure the
data to be safe and secure they also
provide tools to extract useful
information to help the companies make
meaningful decisions
after knowing about the database let's
see how SQL communicates with the
database to get desired results
SQL stands for structured query language
the structured query language is the
standard language used by database
operators and developers to carry out
different operations from manipulating
updating and retrieving data from
relational databases
now let us see how we write a basic
query there's a customer table with
columns customer ID customer name age
gender date of purchase address item and
price
and we need to extract the customer ID
and customer name from this table
so we will write a query select customer
ID comma customer name from customers
semicolon when we will execute the query
in MySQL workbench we will get the
desired result that is the output table
with customer ID and customer name this
is how we write a query to extract the
information from the database we'll see
some more queries as the session
proceeds
now we'll see what the features of SQL
are
SQL lets you access any information
stored in a relational database with SQL
queries data is extracted from the
database in a very efficient way the
structured query language is compatible
with all database systems from Oracle
IBM to Microsoft and it doesn't require
much coding to manage databases
now we will see applications of SQL SQL
is used to create a database Define its
structure implement it and let you
perform many functions SQL is also used
for maintaining an already existing
database SQL is a powerful language for
entering data modifying data and
extracting data in a database SQL is
extensively used as a client server
language to connect the front end with
the back end the supporting the client
server architecture SQL when deployed as
data control language DCL helps protect
your database from unauthorized access
afternoon SQL with its features and
applications let's go through some basic
queries in SQL
that is ddl data definition language DML
data manipulation language DCL data
control language TCL transaction control
language ddl or data definition language
consists of the SQL commands that can be
used to define the database schema let's
see ddl commands create command is used
to create the database or its objects
like table index function views store
procedure and triggers drop is used to
delete objects from the database
truncate is used to remove all records
from a table alter is used to alter the
structure of the database
DML or data manipulation language
consists of the SQL commands that deals
with the manipulation of data present in
the database insert into command is used
to insert data into a table update is
used to update existing data within a
table delete is used to delete records
from a database table select this
command helps you to select the
attribute based on the condition
described by the where clause
aclo transaction control language these
commands deals with the transaction
within the database commit commands
commit a transaction
roll back command roll backs a
transaction in case of any error occurs
save point it sets a save point within a
transaction set transaction it specify
characteristics for the transaction
dcn or data control language it consists
of the commands such as Grant and revoke
which mainly deals with the rights
permissions and other controls of the
database system
Grant command gives user access
privileges to database
revoke it will draw users access
privileges given by using the grant
command now we will have hands on some
basic queries in my SQL workmench if
getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scale up by simply learn
click on the link in the description to
know more
now we'll see some basic queries
executing in MySQL workbench
so we'll start
and first query we will run will be use
sys that is the database
this command is used to select the
database
in which you want to create or
manipulate any data now we'll see
another command that would create a
table
thank you
now we will add attributes to the
customer table that would be the columns
first would be the customer ID
and we will
act it it as a primary key
The Next Step will do that would be
customer name customer underscore name
and its data type would be better
next item that would be age
within data type
next attribute will be gender
with character data type
okay
next we will add as date of purchase
with date data type
now let another attribute that would be
addressed
with data type where care
next we will write the attribute item
that will be the item purchased with
data type webcam
next would be the price
okay for price we will make it as float
and let's shift this to next line and
now we'll execute this command
foreign
for that we'll write a command insert
into
customers
values
and I have all the reports written in
the notepad
so I will copy these
and paste it here
these are 20 records
like all the attributes they are in the
order so we have written all the records
in the order only like customer ID that
will be 101 customer name that would be
Joseph age that would be 22 gender May
date of purchase this is the date of
purchase address Pune
item that is vegetable purchased price
that is 80. so now we will run this
command and all these
records they would be inserted into the
table
and these are 20 commands 20 reports
you can see insert into customer values
the command has been executed and they
have been inserted into the table
now we'll see
the table
for that we'll write the command select
star
from
customers
here you can see the table
in the output grid
okay I will make sure you will see the
whole table
with all the 20 codes
yeah
you can see
all the 20 reports they have been
inserted
now see another command
and for that we would just
get the output as customer ID and
customer name in the output grid for
that we'll write the command select
customer ID
comma
customer name
from
customers
semicolon
and we'll run this command
and we will get both the columns
customer ID and customer name
in our output grid
now we'll see another command that would
be drop
the drop command just removes the
component from the database
so we'll write
drop
table
and table name that would be customers
and semicolon and we will execute this
command
now the table has been removed from the
database
to verify whether the table has been
removed from the database or not we will
run a command select star from
customers semicolon and execute this
command
and what we will get is Select start
from customers error code table says
customers doesn't exist the table has
been removed from the database so the
drop command worked here
now we don't have any table that is the
customer table has been dropped from the
database so we have to create that table
again
so we'll go at the top
okay
yeah
and we'll create the table again
and we'll insert all the records again
into the table
because the commands have run
now we will
run this command to see whether the
table has been created and the reports
have been inserted into the table or not
both commands have worked
now we'll see another command
that would be truncate
the trunk it command just manages all
the records from the table
truncate table
name
semicolon
and just run this command
the command has been executed
now we'll see
yeah you can see that all the records
from the table has been vanished so the
truncate command worked here now to
carry other operations we have to insert
all the records again into the table
we will do that
we'll again go put
and when this command
insert into customers values and all the
records
and we'll execute this command and like
command has been executed and all the
records are again in the table so we'll
run this command and check it
yeah you can see all the records then
threaded into the table
foreign
that would be alter
alter command is used to update any
record into the table you will see alter
table
name that is customers
and now what we should do uh okay we'll
drop the column H from the table
so we'll write command group
column
each
semicolon
I will run this command
the command has been executed
and now we'll check whether the each
column has been dropped or not
select star from customers
semicolon and we will execute this
command
yeah you can see the age column has been
dropped off the table
so the alter command has been executed
successfully
okay so now we'll see another thing like
if you want to comment something during
the execution you can do that
just write two minus signs and the text
this would be the command
and you can also use
slash
start and let
text
inside it and start and Slash
so this is also the comment section
you can write comment with this syntax
or with the syntax they both work
now we'll see another command that would
be update
this is also used to manipulate data in
the table to update any record into the
table
so we will write update table name that
would be customers
and but we should update okay we will
update a record
we will change the customer name and
address
and we have the primary key as customer
ID so we'll use that so update customers
set
customer name
equal to
James
coma
and address
equal to uh poster
where
customer ID
equal to one zero one
okay you can see here in the table 101
customer ID the customer name is Joseph
and the address is Pune we have updated
command and we will execute it see okay
okay
we have an error here
uh yeah so it's correct we will execute
just command
yeah the command has been executed
successfully and now we check the table
with the command select star
from customers
you can see the row has been updated the
customer name is James here and the
address is Boston so the command has
been executed successfully now we'll see
another command that would be delete
so delete command is used to delete any
particular record for any particular row
so we will write the command delete
from
customers
where
customer ID
equal to one zero two
semicolon
so the second row that is with customer
ID 102 that would be deleted when we
will execute this command
now we check into the table
yeah you can see
the record has been deleted
now you'll see distinct command that is
used to return different values
so we will write command select
distinct
and the column name for which we want
different values to be in the output
grid
we would select address
Chrome
customers
and we will execute this command
yeah
these are the address so these are the
cities in the address
which are different and which are unique
and we have get that through the
distinct command
now we will see minimum command minimum
command is used to get the records or
get the data that is minimum of all the
data
so for that we will write the syntax
select
minimum
McMain in bracket we will write the
attribute name or the column name
for which we want the data to be minimum
as
less price
this would be the attribute name
from customers
so we will execute this command
and what we would see is that 60 would
be the less price
like the customer table they have the
column price and in that we all we have
all the prices and from that the minimum
price is 60 and we have kept it at less
price
similarly we have the maximum command to
get the maximum amount from the column
we will use the maximum command
select Max
in bracket to write the attribute name
as
Max price
from customers
and we will execute this command
and what we get is 3400 it's the maximum
price from the price column
now we'll see another command that would
be count
command it Returns the number of rows
according to the query so we will run
the query and see like how it works
we'll write select
count
and the attribute name
that would be a customer ID
customer ID
from customers
semicolon
and when we'll run this command
we will get 19 as a result that is it
counted the number of customer IDs that
is 19 in the table
now we'll see another command
that would be average
so it just gets the average of the
numbers and how we do it write the query
select
AVG and the attribute name for which we
want the average
from table name
semicolon
and we'll execute this command and we'll
get the average of the price
from the customer stable
now if you want to add up all the prices
from the customer table you can use the
command sum so how you will execute that
command
select sum in bracket we would write the
attribute name that would be price
from
customers semicolon
and we'll run this command
I will get the sum of the prices from
the customer table
now we'll see where command where
command is used to filter records let's
see through syntax
so we will write select
star
from customers
where
address
yeah we will
where address equal to
Pune semicolon
and then we will run this command
and yeah this is the taper we will get
the records with addresses Pune
so this is the functioning of where
command
now we'll see Group by command
that is used to just group the number of
rows that have the same values we will
see it through the syntax
like we will write
select
count
attribute name that would be customer ID
comma
address
from
table name
and group by
accordingly with address
yeah this is the command select count
customer ID comma address from customers
Group by address
when we will execute this command yeah
we will get this table
that would be these are the different
addresses and these are the number of
times number of persons who live in this
address with the count with respect to
customer IDs
now we'll see having close with the help
of an example only
select
count attribute name that will be
customer ID
comma
address
from table name that would be customers
group y
address having
count
customer ID
greater than unit 3 view 44323
semicolon and then we will execute this
command
and you can see
the output we have got through this
command that is Group by command
close this and when we have added having
closed having count customer ID greater
than 3
foreign
count with four
now we'll see another command
that is order by
select star from table name that is
customers
and we will order this output by address
semicolon
we have got the output with respect to
the address
the address has been assigned
alphabetically here
so what exactly is mongodb
it is a document oriented nosql database
it was initially released in August 27
2009.
mongodb replaces the concept of rows of
conventional relational data models with
something called as documents it offers
developers the flexibility to work with
evolving data models since its document
based mongodb allows embedded documents
arrays and represents complex
hierarchical relationships using a
single record it is also schema free
which means that the keys defined in the
document are not fixed as a result
massive data migrations can be ruled out
but you must be wondering when there's
something like SQL why is no SQL or
mongodb used
there are a few reasons why mongodb is
widely used
first up is flexibility
mongodb's notion of documents that can
contain sub-documents nested in complex
hierarchies is really expressive and
flexible
flexible query model a user can
selectively index some part of a
document or a query based on attribute
values regular expressions or ranges
next up is native aggregation native
aggregation allows its users to extract
and transform data from mongodb and
either load them in a new format or
export it from mongodb to other data
sources it makes it extremely compatible
lastly as mentioned earlier the schema
free model now applications get the
power and responsibility to interpret
different properties in different ways
now that you know what mongodb is and
why exactly it's used let's have a look
at the characteristics of mongodb
firstly it's a general purpose database
now mongodb can serve heterogeneous
loads and multiple purposes within an
application
again it has a flexible schema design
document oriented approaches with
non-defined attributes that can be
modified on the Fly is a key contrast
between mongodb and any other relational
database
next up is scalability and load
balancing it's built to scale both
vertically but most importantly
horizontally using sharding an architect
can share load between different
instances and Achieve both read and
write scalability
when it comes to load balancing this
happens automatically and transparently
to the user by the sharp balancer
again we have aggregation framework now
mongodb offers an extract transform and
load framework that eliminates the need
for complex data Pipelines
native replication now data will get
replicated across a replica set without
complicated setup
security features both authentication
and authorization are taken into account
in mongodb
next up is Json now Json is widely used
across the web for front-end and API
communication and as such it's easier
when the database is also compatible
with the same protocol
lastly we have mapreduce now again
mapreduce is an excellent tool to build
data pipelines and mongodb uses
mapreduce readily now let's quickly have
a look at the working of mongodb
data is stored in documents with the
help of key value pairs now the data is
stored in the bson format at the back
end mongodb converts Json data into a
binary format known as bson
mongodb also makes provision for nested
data now all of these documents are
stored in a collection these collections
hold multiple documents and since
mongodb is schema less the documents in
one collection need not be similar now
again these collections are stored in
the entire mongodb database as mentioned
earlier mongodb makes provision for
nested data this makes fetching of data
extremely efficient when compared to
other databases now you must be
wondering where exactly mongodb can be
applied or used so let me help you with
that several areas of Technologies use
mongodb as their dbms currently some of
them are Internet of Things mobile
applications real-time analysis
personalization catalog management and
content management
now all said and done let's look at some
of the companies that use mongodb
currently
companies like Toyota sap AstraZeneca
Adobe verison Cisco Barclays and Google
among others readily deploy mongodb as
their database management system in this
video I'm gonna help you install and set
up mongodb on your Windows system
you will have to navigate to the
official mongodb website
and here you can see
software
so go ahead and click on community
server under software
and you can see that the current version
is 4.4.4 and the platform is Windows and
make sure that the package is MSI all
right now go ahead and press download
so this could take a while
all right so once it's downloaded
go ahead and install it
now since it's already installed on my
system uh the installation process will
be different but you just need to follow
the steps there and finally install it
so once you're done with the
installation you can go to your C drive
and here you can click on program files
and you can see that mongodb is
installed and inside of it you have the
server folder and then you have the 4.4
folder and then you have the bin folder
right so here you have the application
that is your and the mongod
applications both are executable files
now the D file or the application
is the daemin process now this is the
background process that makes sure you
retrieve the data from the database
access the data so it does all the
background tasks so after the
installation now you need to create a
path to this file by doing this you
don't have to always go to the bin
folder and then execute the file you can
directly execute the file on your
command prompt right so for that let's
just
go to our environment variables
but before that let's just uh
copy this path
right and here under the user variable
section
click on path and say edit
and go ahead and just paste it right
I've already pasted mine so just go
ahead and paste it and click on OK
and
say okay
right so now you've created the path
successfully now let's head to our
Command Prompt and run the file so
here you can just directly type
since the path has already been created
so just go ahead and say
and here you can see that your
server has been generated
and with this you know that you're in
mongodb has been successfully installed
and your server is up and running right
so just for confirmation let's see if
there are any databases and how much
space they've occupied so you can right
now just type show DBS
and when you click on it it says admin
config and localhost and all of it is
zero so with that you have successfully
installed mongodb on your system and
it's up and running
all right in this particular tutorial
here we will be learning what mongodb is
all about and their advantages and some
practical demonstrations so let's get
started now
yeah so here in mongodb we would like to
discuss about what is the mobile DB so
as we know the mongodb is known to be a
call a traditional
document based database okay which
stores the data in a document
okay nosql means it doesn't say like no
to SQL instead it says not only SQL that
means it is not only SQL but it is
supporting the other approaches too okay
so the document based when you talk
about it actually represents the typical
hierarchical relationship using the
single records that means how the
records are related with each other so
that's how exactly it represents and it
is a pure schema free environment so
that you really do not need to have a
schema before you go and develop this
program so it is a pure schema less
involvement due to that it is giving you
far more better flexibility when you
talk about completely unorganized
environment
so what is nosql so the huge idea about
a nosql so it is completely into the
non-relational database like
traditionally if you see any
non-relational database uh you talk
about uh typical nosql uh it's purely
into the document base here no SQL does
not use any tables like in rows and
columns a traditional rdbps approach if
you see there they are using a complete
table structure like they talk about
columns they talk about rows and are all
about
so here in nosql it stores the
relationship data in the documents so
the different type of nosql databases
are available like you talk about called
document based you talk about key value
base you talk about white column based
and glass based different options are
available for the nosql but the one
which we are using it momodb it is a
purely document based database
now here we would like to go ahead with
some demonstrations like talking about
like how mongodb installation works and
the other aspects
okay everyone so now we're going to
start working on the first option called
mongodb installation
okay see mongodb installation is very
simple if you open a website and go for
this website name called
MoGo DB download
if you talk about Chrome mobile DB
download you're gonna see the official
website called mongodb Community
download is available
when you click here
so you can see it is taking the current
version to 4.4.6
Mac OS at by default detected my
platform however you can select depends
on which platform you have it and after
that you will be clicking on this
download
okay so it will get ready for if you are
from Windows
I would say in this Windows you can
select appropriate option like two
options are available you can talk about
MSI or talk about zip my recommendation
is you can stick to the zip power
portion because it won't start any
mongodb Services behind the scene
that is really helpful because you
really do not want more videos to be
there running unnecessary even if it is
not required my situation is to stick to
the zip file so here once the bongodb is
there so you will be seeing there are
two files available inside of mongodb
folder inside the bin so once you
download the zip you will find two
different type of files are available
let me mention those
so inside the bin folder you will see
two files one is called mongod
okay another file which is available
called Momo
T is to basically start a mongod server
and the Mobile T Mobile is actually the
client which will connect with the
bombodi
clear so if you are in
Windows environment so once your Insight
is bin folder of your zip file you will
get the mongodb so you have to double
click on this it will start a new
command prompt
so you do not need to do anything
further just minimize this command
prompt and go inside the bin folder
again and click on the another binary
file called so to get start as a
client
okay since I'm using the MacBook here
the concept is little different about
how mongodb can be used
okay so this is just a basic way of how
the mode is being used into your code
okay everyone so now
as we are in the Macbook so here to
start mode we have a very special way to
start with so here I'll start with my
terminal and here I would like to paste
on very simple command to start my
mongodb database that is called mongod
and after that you have to say hyphen
iPhone DB path it is a place where your
database will be starting and one more
important thing I forgot to mention like
mongoli would not start automatically
inside your
Windows machine unless inside your C
drive you have to create a new folder
name called data and under this you have
to create a new folder in equal DB
because automatically when the mode
starts it looks inside the C drive data
inside a DB folder there your all
records will get stored so do not forgot
whenever you're trying to use the mongod
so you must make have you must have this
particular fold structure in place in
your local machine otherwise this is not
gonna start every time I restart your
mongodb without this
location it automatically terminates So
to avoid those make sure that you have
this data DB folder ready with you
however you can also change the location
of this particular folder structure for
which we will discuss it little later on
but as of now we can see I'm giving my
location that is called hyphen iPhone DB
path slash data DB I hit enter you can
see now my mobile DB is starting now
and since it's stuck so I have to start
the new terminal now
so here I open the another tab
and type
and then what I type more mode now you
can see it is now connected with my
mongodb and now it is ready
that's the first thing you need to
remember
okay now to check
which are the databases are available to
you so you can just type show DBS
so it will show you the number of
databases which are already there inside
your existing
newly installed mongodb
but you can go back and create new
database too here you can see some
databases are already present however
you go back and create the new databases
into your system
and to create this database
be a very simple option available here
name call
use
simply DB
if I say use simplydb it automatically
creates this database and take you
inside let's see now you can see you say
you simply DB it automatically creates
though it is not there but automatically
takes you in while creating those
okay so that means your current database
name for simply DB
so if you're not sure which database you
are in we can just type DBS
or DB
and it will show you that your current
database is simply DB
that's it so your database is set and we
are all good to go ahead with our next
level development
hello everybody and welcome back in a
previous videos you have seen like how
to create a database and how to identify
whether my database is there or not so
if you remember previously we have
created our database using use keyword
so if I just see my databases which we
have created is last time so how we can
check this out we can say show
space DBS
okay so you can see we have a got
database list but we do not have any
database which we have created last time
is registered here the quite surprising
because when we have created our
database it should be listed here but it
is not let's do one more time I'm saying
use
uh asset DB
and I'm saying switch to sldb
now when I say once again show DBS
so I still don't see my database is
listed here there is a reason the reason
is according to the momodb rule unless
we have minimum one
record or collection is stored inside my
mongodb it really can't show in the list
now I want to tell you what a few
important things
now
here when we talk about called mongodb
in this mongodb compared to the
relational database here the table which
is actually in rdbms it is called here
it is called
collection
okay
DB is still called DB here
okay that means the database will be
still called database but row what you
use this word in a traditional rdbm is
here it is known as code document
if you remember I told you like it is a
document based database so here every
single record what you try to insert it
is not called
a typical row it is instead called a
document so every table is called
collection and every single row it is
called
document that's what exactly the
difference is
okay
now here once it is ready we will go
ahead and talk about our next feature
now
well we have to basically go and create
a new collection okay so what you can
say DB Dot
create
collection and here I can pass my
collection name I can say
demo
collection so once it is done
I can see it is collection is created in
typical language I can say the table is
created and now when I try to see same
show DBS
I can see my database is now listed
okay that's how exactly it works so the
very simplest way of how we use in my
code
well in our previous examples we have
seen like how we can create a collection
and we can give the name and I can see
the details are listed when I say show
DBS but there's a again another
alternative option a variable where you
can just do that without even saying DB
dot create collection
well
if I want to create a collection I
really don't need this particular
functionality called create collection I
can directly use this statement name
called DB Dot
DB dot SL
udent
dot insert and here we would like to add
the property like a name and here we can
say
admin
now what does that meaning is when you
say DB dot SL student dot insert
and I hit enter you can see this
uninserted one and surprisingly when you
try to say
press enter you will see this SL student
is not a collection which we have
created earlier
so what this line does this line not
only create the collection for you but
also add a record inside with this
property called name because that is a
mongodb and mongodb is always following
the Json based structure and due to that
it goes with the key and value pairs
so DB is a predefined keyword SL student
is a collection name insert is a command
through which you are trying to insert
the record
now to check how many collections are
there
okay so we have one property call show
collections when I say show collections
I can list down those number of
collections also I can set tables in a
typical rdbms language which are there
added in my system
so as a student in which I can see the
record is inserted so if I want to
confirm I can simply say
DB Dot SL
udent DOT fine find is a function
through which I can list out those
number of Records which are added I save
file and you can see that the records
are received at the same time when I say
DB dot the name call Demo correction
okay
db.democollection dot find
I'll find no record reason because this
collection was created but there was no
record which was inserted in
but you will see when I
write this command called SL student dot
insert it not only create a new
collection for me but also insert the
record into my table also called a
collection
that's where exactly it is giving you
the advantage when you want the
collections to be created along with the
data this is the way how you can really
do this
clear but
whenever you talk about DB dot create
collection many people always think
about what is the significance of having
this DB dot create collection
look DB dot create collection is having
its own significance we never recommend
this technique
okay to create a collection because when
you create a collection you always bring
some restrictions some terminology which
missed out whenever you talk about this
line
so having this DB dot create collection
you can also offer some
additional capping which is not possible
when you use DP tour
collection inputation search so you
might be thinking what those cappings
you're talking about let me try to brief
you when I say DB Dot
create
collection and here we are providing the
first name call support student
okay when I say student
so after this student additional
parameters what we can pass is this when
I say
capped colon
shoe
what we say cap coolant true so you are
enabling the capping after that the next
parameter I'm gonna pass that is known
is called size
in this size we are providing the size
suppose I am saying 5 2
4 and also we are saying two double
eight zero that is the size of 5 MB and
here we are giving call Max colon
five what exactly that meaning is see
the meaning is very simple whenever we
try to bring this create collection
option so capping true means you are
enabling the capping so what does that
meaning is it is trying to say in this
particular collection name called
student
maximum number of documents
can be either 5 or less than five
clear and the collective size of
documents cannot be increased to more
than 5 MB that means you're trying to
say either by adding the total number of
five records the collective size of five
document will reach to 5 MB okay or else
the maximum number of five documents can
be is stored so whichever fills earlier
you may have a total number of four
documents which are pretty heavy and
they
reach to the size 5 MB and beyond that
the next document won't be added or else
you can have the five documents which
has not yet even reached so any option
will help you to achieve this
so that's where exactly you can offer
the capping but this is only possible
when the user is trying to say DB dot
create collection this option is not
possible when you're trying to use this
so that's the benefit of having this DB
dot create collection and this is what
we always recommend
well now we would like to talk about our
next feature here inside the same
mogodb so we now know how to create a
collection how to create a database and
how to switch from one database to the
another database
now we will tell you like how to insert
a document so far we have already seen
how to insert a document inside the
mongodb now we would like to also show
you how we can insert the documents
using multiple techniques
so remember one thing
MoGo TV comes with two different type of
documents
one is called relational document and
second is called embedded document
mostly while working with mongodb we
always recommend you to use embedded
documents because that helps you to
scale up your application without any
hurdle
okay the embedded documents means what
that means the
I would say the parent record as well as
the child records both stores in the
same location
fine so how exactly that is let's take a
look about this example
here we would like to insert some
records by saying DB Dot
student I do not have a student
collection or I'm just telling you DB
dot student Dot
insert
here we would like to add
some records what I'm trying to say the
registration number
I'm just saying
uh one two three four you can give
anything now the next one we will talk
about call name
this name we can say
student one
followed by the next one I'm talking
about which course the student has
registered so we can say
course inside this course we would like
to say the course name let's say
course name we are given the course name
call
MCA
okay followed by another property called
duration
okay I'm giving this duration
is called
free
use like that
after that
this curly braces is closing that means
see the idea is like you see the course
is an embedded document because from
course you have about few more
properties like in course name and
duration
I am closing this and starting the
another property and that is called
address
okay
sorry let me remove from here and from
address and address we can say one more
curly basis and inside this address we
can say City
giving the name called what
Bangalore
the another one we are using that is
called state
[Music]
um
let me remove this state
colon
ke
okay and the third property we're using
that is known is called country
here is saying IE that is called India
so it is closing here
okay and it is closing here so the inner
documented how to document both are
closed hit enter and now you can see the
records are inserted one thing you might
notice
the course
and the address these two are embedded
documents and they do not have
any primary key of its own instead the
course and address both are directly
dependent on
the student object
or the student database so
I will say student have the registration
number
five
and the primary key so the primary key
will be associated with the most outward
document and the inner documents are
directly
associated associated with them and now
when I try to say DB Dot
student
dot find
you can see now the records are
fetched
I can understand many of you are
thinking every time
while adding the record we do not add
any object ID
and here you might have observed and
there also your option then what exactly
that ID is now let me brief you this ID
is nothing but a unique primary key your
mongodb has offered you
that means mongodb says whichever data
you are inserting it so by default with
every single document
mogodb will associate this by default
property called underscore ID which you
can't even ignore
however you can override I haven't
provided any underscore ID is a property
because this is a predefined property
associated with every single mongodb
document if you want to override it you
can override
from this value to any value because if
you do not pass any value
this value will be automatically
provided that is a typical hexadecimal
value however if you want to override it
you can overwrite the value of
underscore ID but you can't change the
key name let's try with some
another record so same record if I try
to add
School
I'm using call
student2 and here I'm saying one two
three four five here if I want to
override it I can just say underscore
ID
colon I can get the value called what
one zero one
this you need to remember for I'm
overriding this value with 1 0 1 now
adding it now records are added now let
me call find now you see this time the
records when I fetched so in this record
the first record contains a default
underscore ID in a second record it is
the one which I have provided
and remember one thing in Momo DB you
really can't offer any property other
than underscore ID as a primary key
here there is no concept of having the
cons like a composite key which you used
to do in Tradition
rdbms here you have only underscore ID
and this is the only property which you
can override it else by default the new
value will be given to you so this is
the first way of how the insert document
has been done we'll be telling you the
another ways where the other documents
are also added Okay so
in the previous examples you have seen
like how we can add the records but I
also tell you there is another
alternative options are available if you
want to insert the records in a bulk
that option is also possible in mongodb
how we can do let's try to understand
here
here we would like to use one very
simple concept for one
my
EMP equal to now starting with
a typical object like this and after
that I mean adding this and within this
I'm adding the first property called EMP
ID
colon one
after this okay now you can see it is
not understanding because that is the
challenge when we talk about call uh you
know the logical part
because you go with multiple lines it is
not supporting however you have to
follow the same lines now
empid1 and we just give the second
property called EMP name
so
amp ID I just
remove this I just say EMP ID and I say
amp
Name colon
admin
okay adding it here
so
first record here again I'm adding
another one I'll call
amp ID column two
okay and now
colon
manager
okay again
colon 3
and
colon
Cuba
added
okay and this curly process is closing
after this
your square bracket is also closing and
once it is done you come down and say DB
Dot
new amp
dot insert
okay and here you pass the name of the
object called my AFB
and you can see now it is telling you n
inserted three that is known as called
work insert we are inserting multiple
records in a single shot
see how easy it is for you
okay now you simply use DB dot The
Collection name is what your new EMP
dot find
and you can see now all three records
are inserted with its default object ID
okay
okay so that is a really nice idea to
have
the ID to be provided
okay remember this statement so you
understood finally how we can
add the records in a bulk going forward
we will also talk about which is related
to your update as well as delete in your
upcoming demos okay but here that is the
first thing which you realize it how we
can perform those kind of operations in
very very simple and straightforward
manner okay everyone so now we have got
three records with us and in case if I
am planning to perform update on any of
my records how will I do this now so we
have a predefined functions a variable
name called update function let's see
how this update function can really work
so which use this statement name called
DB
dot what is my collection name which is
known as call a new EMP new EMP
okay dot
update
okay so what I will do I will say TP dot
new EMP Dot
update here
okay now when we talk about called
update we have a
statement available
okay what is that that is called
EMP ID we call EMP name so we say
wherever the EMP ID is this I want to
change what the name how can I do this
now very simple uh
to perform this what I would like to do
now I want to basically add few more
records to give you some more better
idea
uh you can see now here we have a call
admin ID name
so I just do one thing I just change the
IDS
one two three I just say four
I said five
message six
okay and I
call this
again the three records are inserted now
let me try to call find now we have
total number of
six records are available where admin is
repeated manager is repeated QA is
repeated
now let me try to update the record
okay now I want to say DB Dot
new EMP
eror
Dot
update here I would like to perform the
property like in what
uh
name as a EMP name
amp Name colon if I say admin
okay
so I just close that and I use another
curly braces with dollar
set means you want to set the new value
here we are giving
EMP name
okay what I want to do I say variable
the name is admin change to what
foreign
that name I want to change it
closes close this
and run
now you can see it is saying n matched
one
and the record fields are updated like
this let me check
well here I will see uh the value called
admin new is updated but I have one more
admin called admin it is not changed and
there is something which you need to
notice
what you need to notice is notice is
like when you try to perform update so
what mongodb does it starts from the top
find the first record
change the value or modify the value and
come out from the loop it doesn't carry
forward its search process for the next
level of results and that is something
which is
I really want to do that so in case if
you are planning to change those values
multiple times so what you need to do
let's take a look here in the similar
example here we have a call name admin
second property we will call manager
let's try to say
the managers are repeated twice we just
want to change to
foreign
manager and I want to update multiple
values so what I will do here
I will put comma and say
multi colon should
okay same multicolon true that you want
to say hey I want to update multiple
search or multiple repetitions hit enter
this time you can say it is saying and
match to and modify 2 that means two
records found and two records are
modified let's check
there we go we have got new manager is
updated in both the location
that's something which is really awesome
because this is how you try to perform
the multiple changes
well in our previous examples you see
like how we can perform the update part
but we have a more beautiful feature
available inside the mobile DB and that
is called how exactly we can perform
absurd
clear let's talk about absurd upset is a
combinations of update and insert let me
try to show you one magic here
here
when we talk about called update part
you see now here we are trying to say
uh
this point
yeah you see about multi-true we have
used
now here
this uh multi-true
is we're trying to update but let's talk
about something called manager 2.
enter now you can see it is saying no
records formed
clear now no records found
but there's a whole concept available in
called absurd absurd means if I try to
perform up certain means if the records
are not available it will insert the
record
I want to show you one simple example
now here we are using multi Troop
okay so as I can see we're using
something called name and we're
performing this update part
so in this update part we are using this
dollar set new manager so here rather
than using multi-truth
piercing
up circuit when I say abstract rules
what happened now they say n matched 0
and up inserted 2 and modified with ID
this that means when I try to call this
find function you will be seeing now we
have a god
the another record has been added are we
clear now
as a new record
so Absa does what upset says like if the
records are found
I will update it if it is not I will
insert it that means if I try to call
the same thing manager 2
fine it is added as a new manager now if
I just try to say
uh
not manager 2 I will call QA
QA and here we're saying EMP equal to
new
underscore QA
and now you can see it is saying
unmatched one and I've sorted zero and
modified one so it is clearly telling
you like hey I did not find any uh
inserted part but yes I matched one
record I found one record and the one
record is updated now that is very very
beneficial feature when you really want
to perform absurd so that is a
update plus insert
very important feature that depends on
the requirement if you want to add you
can certainly add this so the way we
have tried to add this upserted part we
can also try to perform the delete part
also
okay so mongodb also helps you to
perform the delete part and how you'll
be trying to add it now let's try to
understand here in my code if I want to
perform any delete path I have this
statement name called DB
Dot the option we are using it that is
also collection name EMP
a new EMP sorry
dot we have option name for remove
in this remove we would like to offer
the property
okay and what we're talking about now
here let's try to add the ID here or the
name which you would like to import so I
want to say like EMP name admin new so
we just say
okay
name
okay
and then
name is scoreboard
admin new
okay EMP name admin name when I say
remove
we can see it is record removing the
first record
so you can see now the records are
removed
fine because there is only one admin
name is available
okay now in a similar way if I try to
remove
the property call a new underscore
manager new underscore
management hit enter now you can see the
three records are removed so it's not
like update which removes only one sorry
update only one record it can also
eliminate more than one records at the
same time
that's the benefit of remove so now you
can see we have already implemented some
records
as I seen earlier like we have performed
the delete part now
now when I try to say DB
Dot
new EMP dot find
three records are available with me
three four and six
now when it comes to C in third part we
have seen update part we have seen
delete part we have seen now it's time
to basically fetch the records
so find function we've already seen But
in find function we also have some
conditions so called queries so in case
if you want to limit the number of
Records into your application you can
also do that let's see DV Dot
uh new EMP
Dot
find
clear now so in find you can also
pick up the specific records too like
when I'm saying dot find and here we can
just say name
colon
sorry
here to put curly braces
it says there is no record with a name
called admin
because it is the EMP name not a name so
let me change back to
now I can say it finds one record so
like that you can also apply a condition
okay enter your code now in a similar
line if you really don't want to offer
any condition
okay but you want to limit the number of
Records to be shown so you have this
function available name call
limit
2 2 means only two records now I can see
though I have three records but it is
only showing me two records because I
have limit those number of Records into
my code
also we can perform sorting in case if
you want to perform the Sorting in the
sending and descending order that also
you can also do so here rather than
saying limit
with this put this option name called
sort and in this sort on which property
you want to sort it that also you can
mention so we can just say PMP name
okay and using ascending button or
descending order so you can just say
um minus one well you got descending
order
hit
now you can see it is showing in a
descending order now if I just say
-1 if I just say 1 that is showing you
in an ascending order so you can pick up
the specific property we have on which
you can tell it should be either on
descending order or ascending order so
that option really works very fine
okay
so that's like how you can perform the
queries but remember one thing you can
also
search the records based on the embedded
columns too because if you see in a
previous records we have
some records added okay that is
uh let me try to say show
collections
our call SL student
and student
okay DB Dot
Dot
find
okay
you can see we have records which are
embedded records now if you want to
search the records based on their
embedded properties like I am talking
about address this is one property name
called City
fine so if you would like to pick up
those records these are also possible
so how you can do this very simple so
you say TV DOT
student
Dot
find
okay so inside this file you can provide
the specific properties like my
outermost property name is called what
address so we are using this option
called
address dot dot City
so we see City
are we clear colon I'm giving the city
name called what Bangalore
here let me close this
and that's it
okay
so we have to start passing
another curly places here hit enter and
you can see now I find two records
because both the records belong to what
Bangalore so I'm getting this City
Bangalore with me
that's really awesome like you can also
pass the city accordingly
a part of that we also have the other
details also okay in which you can
have the conditions based on less than
greater than or whatever values you
would like to make it is available and
possible
okay so that's how the conditions are
satisfied
so suppose if you would like to pick the
users
I'll be clear where the range which you
would like to consider so those are also
possible like you can see we have this
property name called what amp ID3 and 6.
I just want to pick up only those
records whose ID is greater than what
two so what I can say DB dot new EMP
okay dot find
and inside this file we can say
the property okay so what's property
we're using empid we are saying EMP ID
here colon here we'll be using dollar GD
GC stands for what greater than colon we
are giving the value called what one
why close this
run you can see you have received three
records three four and six
in case if I just look forward for
higher than 5
you will see only one record so greater
than
let's call GT
okay
same option if I just say LT
you can see we have found
two records so less than greater than
okay so that's how exactly you offer it
okay and also you can provide the
condition so called limit as I can say
find EMP ID the way we provided so here
I will not use less than
okay instead I'll be providing another
property let me show you what
so here in empid whatever we have taken
so let me try to take the property call
file and here we are providing EMP
ID and then
we use another curly braces and we're
using Dollar in is very important
property Dollar in Colon here you
provide the details I'm saying uh inside
so the properties three four six we are
saying
3
comma 6.
close this
and you can see we got two records
which matched with three and six that's
the benefit of having
this okay everyone so in our previous
example we have already seen lot many
activities this time we are trying to
offer you something very interesting
feature and that is known is called
working with indexing see momodb is one
of the most popular tool
and one of the reason why it is very
popular because it is having the
facility of having indexing now what
exactly the index does so friends main
job of having this index is to basically
give you the concept of like how uh one
particular uh document which is huge
document in case if you would like to
perform any sort of indexing inside this
how you will be applying this
so to apply indexing into my code let's
try to understand why index is really
required without indexing and with
indexing how you'll be making a
difference into the code
so to make it happen we would like to
insert some records
to confirm
okay
so what I will do is in Step number one
previous records if I see I have got
four six three four one depends on what
earlier records we had it so we had a
call
new EMP
so DB dot new EMP
dot find
so we have total number of three records
are available so it's okay we can have
this three records with me now let me
try to apply indexing without indexing
if I want to find the result what
outcome I'm gonna receive so to know
about how much time it's gonna be taking
if if I have a got large number of
records with me I'll be using this
statement name called DB
dot the name is called New EMP
Dot
explain and here I will be using one
predefined functionality called
execution starts
execution starts
okay now here after the execution starts
you'll be using Dot
find we'll be using the first property
here
okay and
what user would like to find it that you
need to basically offer it so we are
giving the name called EMP name
colon putting the name call
uh QA
okay let's close
okay now when I pressed hit enter
execution starts is a predefined
functionalities which will tell me
when the query was executed what exactly
the query plan was hit enter and now you
can see a lot of details
are available with me
like you can see
pass query winning plan and everything
one thing you need to Remember by
default
here when I try to run it says and
return one
Advance or need time
total everything it is showing me but
one important thing which you will see
here
is
total number of documents scanned
so it is telling me total number of
document examined is 3.
clear now
and return one that means one result is
returned and the total number of
documents examines three in order to
find this record
just imagine a use case here
when I say total number of documents
examine 3 in case if I ever got millions
of records with me that means to search
the record it will examine all the
Millions number of Records to search the
result which certainly gonna be taking
huge amount of time
and that's where exactly when you try to
search the record
fine when you have no indexing is
available
okay so you need to understand one
important thing is
by default index is applied on your
underscore ID DB Dot
new EMP
um
yeah DB dot newmp dot
when I say DB dot new emp.getindex is a
predefined function it tells me like hey
by default index is applied or
underscore ID
that's the fact because by default index
is applied on underscore ID not on the
other properties
so I need to identify which of the
properties are required to be get
indexes mongodb advantages it is
supporting multi-column indexes and
that's what exactly we would like to see
so let's see in our next demo now we
will try to apply indexing on our own
property
okay so to apply the index what we need
to do we have to say DB
Dot
certainly we will be talking about call
collection name call
new EMP
Dot
create index
here you have to pass two things number
one
on which property you would like to
apply
okay and it has to be ascending or
descending so I am trying to apply on
EMP
and I want the index to be applied on
ascending order
okay so here
colon one
detector you can see now it is telling
me like uh
number of indexes before one and number
of indexes after two that means earlier
index was available only on one
particular property now it is applied on
two properties
if you want you can check now you can
see there's another property is added
called EMP underscore
now if I try to execute a similar query
which I executed earlier
give it now you'll be seeing there's a
different statistics altogether
here if I see
in my code
See it'll tell you total document
examine one see now earlier the number
of document examine were three but since
this index is applied not is telling me
the total number of document examined is
one so performance is certainly improved
so to search your document it won't be
searching the complete
collections
okay rather it will search what only
that particular column in which it is
actually applied for so that's the
benefit in fact I would say when you
will be using these kind of indexes into
your code
okay so hope we all are clear and
understood about this concept so let's
go ahead and get this implemented into
our system
well this is the first way of how the
index can be applied so you can also
apply index on multiple properties
clear so that we will show you one by
one how it is
okay everybody so we have already seen
in our previous example how we have
applied indexes in our existing mongodb
application
so it is also a possibilities where we
want to also apply the index on other
number of properties too as you can see
in our existing database
okay an existing collection my
collection name is new EMP which
contains two different properties one is
called EMP ID and second called EMP name
just now we have applied index on our
EMP name but in case if I want to apply
index on EMP ID I'll be using the same
technique okay let's try to apply index
on the same so first of all get indexes
I'm having this index applied on two
different property now we would like to
say DB
Dot create
index
and here in this DB dot create index we
can just
I will say DB dot collection name so our
collection name is called New EMP new
EMP
dot create index first parameter is
certainly the name of which property we
are applying so here we are saying EMP
ID
and in this EMP ID we will just offer it
has to be ascending or descending let me
decide descending order
so we are saying
-1
okay now let's press enter and check the
status okay now you can see earlier
indexes which we have created that was
two and now it turns to three so it is
very clear that index is improving now
let's check this out
uh DB Dot
new MP dot get indexes now we have a
total number of three indexes are
available
so you can apply index of n number of
columns if you want
okay at the same time the way we have
created the index in case if I want to
drop an index so we can also drop so
what we can do DB dot new EMP
dot drop index
drop
index
and in this drop index we have to
provide
which particular index we would like to
draw
remember this point in case if you're
planning to drop any sort of index so
you need to provide which index so you
should have that particular index name
okay so here we are providing my index
name so it should not be uh I would say
the traditional name called EMP ID no it
has to be EMP ID
underscore minus 1 or
so this should be the name I'm saying
EMP
in case if you try this
you see it is saying index not found
with the EMP name because internally it
maintains with this name
let's try this out we say EMP name
underscore one let's try
and now you can see new index was three
okay one
okay
now you can see we have a call empid and
underscore ID
so now we have
only two indexes left there's no EMP
name anymore this is how exactly you can
drop the indexes
so it is very simple and straightforward
way of how in mongodb you can perform
your activities hello everybody and
welcome back
in a previous examples of mobodb you
might have considered
we have used lot many operations in our
last video we have seen how to utilize
indexing into our code now in our next
journey of our momodb we will see how
aggregation Works see in mogodb
aggregation plays a vital role and
aggregation comes with so many handy
functions with mongodb which will help
you to perform
and to apply some very simple code
Snippets into your ongoing
uh I would say the requirement which can
make your query so much seamless now we
will see how this aggregation really
works and to work on an aggregation we
have taken some default database name
called aggregate DB and here we have a
call student as a by default collection
in which we have some set of records are
already added
now if I just want to apply aggregation
now I would like to tell you about what
exactly the aggregation is see ideally
when you talk about call aggregation
okay so aggregation is nothing but a
call aggregate like rdbms if you see we
have to call aggregation there see the
Unix command like you talk about shell
pipeline means the possibility to
execute an operation on some input and
use that output as an input for the next
command
that means the output of one particular
execution becomes an input for others
so mongodb also supports same kind of
concept in aggregation framework there's
so many type of functionalities are
available which we will see one by one
into our next code
okay now here we want to confirm about a
few important things now here let me try
to bring some of the important
well-known
I would say the functionalities of our
aggregation framework first we use the
terminal called dollar project
the project is basically designed for
select
specific
specific fields Donald project is
designed to select what is specific
fields from a collection we used to talk
about called what
dollars match the match is responsible
to filter out the operations
are we clear now it is designed to
filtering out the operations
you talk about dollar group
talk about called dollar group so it
does the actual aggregation fine we talk
about call Dollar sort
okay it basically sort the document okay
like that there's so many operations are
available which we will see one by one
in our aggregation Behavior now my first
example the one which I want to execute
I have a call student record with me
which contains a student name okay the
section
and the marks and the subject on which
subject the person or the student
disappeared now here my first
requirement is we want to filter
data based on a section A because
students belong to the different
sections as you can see now it is they
belong to the different section section
A B C D so I just want to filter the
data based on a section A
okay so for filter out I would like to
use dollar match let's see how it works
so I just would like to filter out only
those students who belong to the section
A
so how we would like to use it now I
will say DB Dot
student Dot
aggregate and inside this we would like
to use this
square brackets and then curly braces
and then use
dollar
match
with this I would like to use another
curly braces and I say
section
a
okay and I close this close this close
the square bracket close this
okay so DB dot student dot aggregate
aggregate should be always associate
match is no aggregate functionality
section a hit enter and you can see now
it lists down all those students who
belong to the section 8.
okay very simple and straightforward
example
now we would like to use the second
example so we want to find out all the
records where this section is a and we
are using and operator Max is greater
than 80 there are so many students who
have a different marks like 1719 and
whatever
so we want to use both the conditions
together so how are you going to be
using this now remember not only the
section A but also marks were greater
than 80. so similar thing we have a call
match
okay after this match we are starting
this curling braces
okay so after this match we would like
to bring and
reset all
and and again colon
again we are starting this square
bracket now
okay we talk about what
section A
number one and after this the first
curly braces we would like to use marks
we say
marks colon and once again
we would like to start curly braces and
here we use
dollar
GT that is called what a greater than
colon
80.
okay all are closed so you see like here
we have got this square bracket in noun
brackets
so
what else is left
so we have a call 80 we are using
another curly braces needs to be closed
here
and then
square bracket
okay and followed by again curly braces
again curly braces
again
square bracket again round brackets
okay
let's see where it is going on
so we're using this DB dot student dot
aggregate we have used this
yeah square bracket then curly braces
then we use dollar match
okay after the dollar match
we are using another curly braces and we
have a call and operator
after this and we have a call
risk now square bracket then curly
braces section A
outer section is getting closed we are
using another curly braces marks
colon dollar GT
okay and we are using what
colon
80. after that we are closing this
and using two more curly which is coil
packet in this
okay so this where exactly you can
utilize that so DB dot student dot
Aggregate and like this it will be able
to get it now okay so in a previous
example that was the only missing point
was after this
uh this dollar match we didn't apply
this curly braces
that was only missing point which was
there and now we have applied another
code is giving me this outcome and I
have only one user who's scoring greater
than 80. well that was the first thing
which we have it now
along with this I would like to go ahead
and talk about few more things now I
just would like to bring selective
Fields not all the fields like as you
can see we have a call student name
section marks everything I'm getting it
so I really don't want to bring all the
properties from this document I would
like to selectively take specific
property so
let's talk about how we can use this so
we'll be using project you remember
about project is responsible to select a
specific record
so I just use this statement name called
DB
Dot
student okay dot
aggregate we are using it now after that
square bracket
then curly braces now we are trying to
say dollar
project
what you would like to use dollar
project and colon we are trying to use
student name
okay colon
okay remember one thing one means I want
to zero means I don't want so whichever
property will be enabling it by giving
the one as a digit that means it is
it is expected to be displayed so I'm
saying one
comma I'm saying section
colon 1 okay and I'm also
looking forward for marks
call it one
that's it so now
you can see now I am once again picking
up only those
like student section and marks now if I
go back and remove some properties like
I only want
student and section you can see I have
only students and sections are used
here if I just use this statement name
call
underscore ID column 0.
now you can see only
the names and sections are visible ID is
not because I really don't want ID by
default ID is shown but if I say 0 that
means the ID will not be visible here so
like that you can select
The Columns or the properties
accordingly that was the one way now the
other thing I would like to use
what if you want to find out the student
name section and marks from student once
again we want to find out the student
name section and marks from the student
collection where the section is a
okay so here it will be the combinations
of match as well as the project
how we can use this let's take a look
towards my implementation
the previous one what we have used here
you remember about we have used this
statement called aggregate match
okay so now we would like to go back and
utilize
after this total match
this is a curly basis I'm giving
section
colon
a
okay section colon a and after this I'll
close this
okay and close this again
I'm opening it up
by using this option call
project dollar
project we are picking up the project
right now and here with this colon
symbol we can use again and say
student name
student Name colon we are using one
comma
section colon 1
and
1.
Max colon one and now
closing this
now I can see I got those so the
requirement was
we want to find out the student name
section and marks from student
collection with the section is a so you
are not only using the match
okay but also using what the selective
details like this you can implement it
okay that's where exactly the projection
really works so projection gives you lot
many opportunities which you can utilize
it for your own and also it comes with
lot many predefined functions like in
some AVG and on so let's talk about
those functionalities too so this is the
first thing which we have seen
aggregations are taken place now in case
if you would like to perform the group
like if I want to find out the total
marks
Group by
okay section like each and every section
I would like to confirm the total marks
in every section then how will I
basically do that
so let's try to get this example also
so here
let me try to
go back
and we will not be using match here
because I would like to use a group part
so
after this curly braces we want to use
dollar
group
okay let's go Group by in rdbm is how
you use it here we use this curly braces
again here we are passing this
underscore ID
okay you have to provide underscore ID
in a group because you cannot skip it
that part you need to be always remember
you really can't skip dollar ID whenever
you're trying to talk about code group
this is a compulsory field you need to
have it after that
I'm using this
section
in this section
we are saying dollar
section
because we would like to make it on a
section basis
after this
closing
and here we are using what
total marks
colon here curly braces
again
uh dollar
sum
okay colon on which we have I want to
use in Mark so I can say dollar
marks
naming convention is very important
because it is a JavaScript so it is the
case sensitive
okay then
and you can see now section wide I'm
able to get all the marks
isn't this an amazing that's where
exactly the aggregations are playing
very important role while retrieving
such kind of Records
so hope you are clear about how we
utilize this together
so in a previous example we got it like
how we are basically taking this marks
in my application fine so we are clear
about how we are picking that up but
what in case if I would like to take a
marks for the specific section
so it is also possible so we'll be using
the same group but only thing is what
will be bringing the match between
because here we are trying to get the
all the section marks but if you would
like to bring it only for the specific
section we know it variable what we need
to do so here
before I talk about called dollar group
we can use one more curly braces here
okay so we can use this option called
dollar match
okay and here we are using this
uh option called section A
sorry
here in dollar match we are giving this
call
section
here we're giving a
so closing this
closing this
followed by
the other areas like in group which you
want to start now
so you can start with this curly braces
hit enter and you can see now only the
specific section we are able to receive
the records
and that's very simple now okay so
that's where exactly would like to
perform and there's another option like
in case if you would like to perform at
an average suppose if you want to fetch
the count of student in each section and
total marks and average marks as well is
so total marks as well as the average
marks we want to get it so how are you
able to take it now
so it is very simple as you have seen
earlier also into our code how we have
taken call group underscore ID section
talking about section
total marks with the sum we are also
using this after that we can also use
the average
Okay so
this is we have taken group underscore
ID sum so here on which we will start so
when we say sum marks after that we can
just put curly braces
and we can just use count
okay and after this we'll be using this
colon
curly braces and use
dollar
sub
okay colon one
okay and after that I'll put
comma here and we use
average
and insert is average I will use
in curly braces we can say
dollar AVG
okay colon of what
dollar
marks
very simple
so curly process is closed
okay so total how many three curly
braces will be closed
one square bracket and all brackets and
now you can see you got the average
markings
in each and every section
so just imagine how easy it is for you
to deal with the aggregations so
aggregation seems to be very very simple
approach provided by mobo TV that really
create a difference of how the
aggregation changes the way how you
react to
okay everybody so after going through uh
the idea of like how we can utilize
the concept of
or aggregation it's time to talk about
like how
when it works with mogodb mobile DB is
properly known for
I will say for replication that is
called high availability and that
feature comes by default with mongodb
you really don't need to install any
software for this because it is a
built-in feature for the mongodb uh so
when you download that it comes along
with this so no additional
configuration setup is really required
when it comes to the mongodb part okay
so let's get started and talk about how
mobile DB can offer the replication see
the idea behind the application is what
the idea behind the application is like
you are replicating it
okay
so we talk about replication you are
replicating your data to wear to the
multiple child so here in mogodb we have
one concept available
okay that is known as called master
okay and
slaves
okay Master is one and there will be
multiple sleeves okay so these slaves
where your records are actually stored
and this is a master which will be
responsible to replicate the data to all
its Childs when the request comes due to
that in case I have one particular
node fails so automatically the data
will be taken from the other nodes
that's the beauty of having this master
and node slave process so to make this
possible we have a very simple option
available
in mongodb we have one concept like call
momodb Atlas so there we can go and get
our cluster ready so here we start with
the concept name called
DB Atlas
let's search for mongodb Atlas and here
I see mogodb Atlas database as a service
see this is a free tool it's the cloud
environment where you really don't need
to install mobile DB in your local
machine it is a cloud-based mongodb
support which is free to use with a
limited amount of space but yes for the
testing purpose it is the best suitable
so I can start with the start free or
else I can say the login here
okay from there onwards I can go ahead
now it is getting ready
now this is a place from where you can
start working on your cluster see as
I've told you like initially when you
will be working on this
mobile DB it will ask you to create a
cluster
initially
okay since I already have a cluster with
me
okay so I really don't need to create it
and as a free tier it will not allow me
to have more than one cluster setup
ready
so if I say create a new cluster
okay and I say by default AWS
okay I'm already closed on this
notification AWS you can select any
other cloud provider and uh
8GB Ram Cloud backup cluster name you
can see now it is taking me
0.54 per hour reason being because I
already have a cluster with me hence
more than one cluster is not allowed in
a free tier cluster so I have to cancel
this but
you can go and create a cluster the way
it was offered there so if you want to
create you can just go ahead and do
nothing just select by default AWS
select your location okay give the name
of the cluster you want to give anything
you can give it here otherwise let it be
the by default name cluster and say
create cluster it will take a while
minimum two to three minutes depends on
the availability it creates a cluster
for you and your cluster once it is
ready it looks like that
Okay so
here in this application you have to go
back and understand what is there any
questions when I click on cluster zero
you can see now here we have a chord
three nodes available one is called
primary node which is called Master as I
suggested earlier
and now we have called slaves
automatically when the Clusters are
created inside this mongodb by default
it will be three node cluster where the
one will be the primary in two will be
secondary
based on your package whichever you have
taken it you can increase the number of
nodes later on but as a free I am gonna
get I will be receiving total number of
three nodes available here
so record whichever will be stored it
will get stored automatically in both
the nodes
secondary notes and from the primary I
can insert the record and secondaries I
can read the records remember you can't
insert records into the secondary so you
can only insert a record only in your
primary record secondaries are not
allowed
to insert
so this is your replica set okay these
are the nodes which are available to you
so when you click on this primary here
you will see
it is telling you node whatever no data
available no data available
nothing is there because I haven't
stored any records as such
so I just go back to my cluster
so initially I would like to go back and
create few things now okay I would like
to go back and set up few initial things
at a time of creating the cluster
because when you cluster is created
clear now so in that point of time no
setting is configured you have to do few
settings now first setting is you have
to put it and remember the steps First
Step will be your network access so in
network access you have to go and you
have to say add IP address and in this
add IP address you have to select this
option
from which location you would like to
accept
only those IP addresses will be
whitelisted otherwise what you can do
you can see here in my options I have
given 0.0.0 that means all IP addresses
are
acceptable so all IP addresses are used
okay so this you have to enable it
otherwise you won't be able to get
this network access from any third party
locations
next you have to talk about call
database access which is required for
you to create a new user there are
already some new users are created but
it is recommended that you to go and
create a new users here
okay so you can go back and add a new
user so by default it is username and
password is given so you can go back and
create a new user when I say add user
okay give the username as well as the
password as per your own convenience so
new user I'm going to create it it is
called SL okay user
and here we're giving call
admin
one two three so SL user admin123
remember this will be the username and
password I'm saying add user
new user is automatically added as a
user admin one two three
so
once you have provided this network
access database access
next you have to create a new data
so what you need to do when you go back
to your
statement okay network access database
access it will ask you like you want to
create a new database so just go back to
my project zero
collections
you have to go back and create a new
collection here
now it is retrieving the list of
databases
now you can see there are already some
collections are there on my DB is one of
the database which is there
demo DB is there lot many databases are
there so you can go back and create some
new database and connect through
so which is a create database I already
have a simple and DB with me
user app is already when collections are
created so creating a database in
correction is very easy if I give you
the quick demo I say create database
give the collection name call SL demo
okay and give the username call
amp
acceptable employee exec create
now you can see SL demo create it is
there with me so there's no record right
now and once it is there ready so
remember asset demo and employee I'll go
back to my uh
code again project zero
and from here I can say connect
because I want to connect it so to
connect it from because your mongodb is
already there so you want to connect it
through so to connect it through here
very simple option available you can
just click on this
correct option multiple options are
there through share connect your
third party applications
so since I already have a shirt
with me so Mac OS I have this Mac OS
with me so we can just use this line
okay so if you have a window you can
select your window since I have this Mac
OS I'm selecting this line but I need to
replace with this
you can see this username
okay and you have to give the username
here I'll I'll selected this I open my
terminal
okay and this is I'm just closing this
and opening up
other terminal here
since I want to correct to the mobile
shell now so what I need to do here in
this
I'll just paste that the command which I
have right now
username is
you remember I told you
you call
some users which you have already
created
let's check
here
SL user
I see
Excel user I hit enter it asks me the
password so I've given the password
admin
and now you can see it is connecting
with me to this particular
see
now see it is connecting me to this a
particular replica set you can see in a
logs it is telling you very clearly
okay saying that it is a username 4.2
and you can see it is correcting with
your sharp cluster the cluster which is
created and this is where exactly I have
it with me
so I'm connecting with this environment
so primary is there if I just want to go
back and say
show
collections
so I can go back and create a new
collection here
okay so it's up to you now by default
collection which is her employee so I
can say DB Dot
employee Dot
insert
and now here we can just add
um
name
okay
now you can see some exception is raised
so
you understand
now you can see the records are added
into my primary cluster so if I just go
back and
go back to my project zero where we have
got
collections
here you will be getting
the
SL demo employee
loading the documents
if it takes time to get this but this is
where exactly you see the records will
be stored
okay so that's where exactly it works
fine for all of you so we have this
record okay so when I say
show collection so we have a call
employee when I say TV DOT
employee Dot
find
so I can see we have got new collection
name call
this is added right now
okay so like this you have got the first
connection established and the records
has been inserted hello Learners simply

Link in the description box below to
learn more about this course
hey everyone my name is ishan and I
welcome you all to this session in this
session we will have a look at the
basics of GitHub before diving deep into
the subject let's first have a look at a
use case
the used case we will consider today is
the world's largest Sporting Goods
retail brand decathlon
decathlon has 1600 stores spread in 52
countries with around 100 000 employees
the IIT team of GitHub consists of 1000
members that helps decathlon to bring
its Shoppers journey to their devices
so here we will first see the problems
that they faced and then we shall see
how did they sort out that problem
in the beginning decathlon worked on the
data center with the help of a VPN and
using a VPN was a huge challenge in
terms of workflow visibility and
avoiding redundancies so the first
problem is how to maintain workflow
visibility and avoid redundancies
then since there are so many stores
located at so many different places
hiring of developers seem to be a
difficult task as a physical workplace
was always needed so the second problem
is how would they hire developers now
let's see how did decathlon solve these
two problems one after the other
in the first case the entire decathlon
shifted from any other remote repository
to GitHub
GitHub turned out to be an amazing open
source Community as the code became more
visible across the organization and now
anybody could contribute to it
then let's talk about the second case
for hiring the Developers
as we know GitHub is an open source
community so it had been collaboration
with any developer all over the world
the potential developers could now
contribute to benefit the global
community
now the question arises what made this
contribution possible so the major
contribution role was played by the
Version Control System this was just a
single case amongst many others there
are many organizations that have
benefited from GitHub now when we have
realized how GitHub has revolutionized
the market let's start learning more and
more about GitHub
as we move forward let's have a look at
what is Version Control System
Version Control System are the software
tools that helps in recording the
changes made to the files by keeping a
track of modifications done to the code
there is one repository and each user
has their own working copy the changes
are committed to the repository which
are possible to be seen by others
the two most important things to make
changes visible are you commit and they
update
as we discussed it is a system that
keeps a track of different versions of a
file and hence a specific version of a
file can be called whenever needed this
makes the collaboration amongst
developers easy and also provides the
members of the team to work on the
latest version of the file
moving forth let's see what is git
now when we have learned Version Control
System the next thing we need to know is
what is git
git is the most commonly used version
control system that helps in tracking
changes made to the files hence we may
have a record of all the changes that
have been made to a file and we can also
revert back to a specific version
git simplifies the process of software
development with the help of easy source
code management
git is not only helpful and popular
among developers but also helps
non-technical people to keep a track of
all the files they have been working on
get further helps in the process of
collaboration and permits changes made
by multiple people to all be merged into
a single source
then it automatically merges the changes
so two people or two different sources
can even work on different parts of the
same file
and later on merge those changes without
losing each other's work this is
specially useful when the projects are
really big and many people are involved
in it
now when we know what is version control
system and basics of Git it is time for
us to jump on the topic what is GitHub
GitHub is a service hosted on the web
where all the projects are stored
every project on GitHub has its own
repository and its unique URL git
provides a graphical interface to store
the files and helps team members to
coordinate on the project from anywhere
GitHub provides several access control
and collaboration features like wikis
and basic task management tools for
every project
let's now have a look at the features of
GitHub
the first feature we will see is easy
project management
GitHub help project managers and
developers to coordinate better on the
project
the work can be easily tracked and
updated which makes sure that the
project is on schedule and as entitled
second feature is increase safety with
packages
the packages on GitHub can be published
as desired they can be published
privately or within a community or can
also be published publicly
the packages can be easily downloaded
from the GitHub to use and reuse them
next feature is the effective team
management
now as all the team members can stay
updated with all that's happening on the
project so this helps them in staying
organized and well coordinated the pull
request and other modification tools
make sure that the team focuses on the
code
moving on the next feature is improved
code writing
with the help of GitHub the quality of
code has significantly increased now
with the help of gitpool command one can
review improve and propose new codes
along with that suggestions or
modifications may be discussed before
changing the original code
the next feature is increased code
safety
GitHub uses code ql which is the
industry's leading semantic code
analysis engine this tends to find risks
in the code which other tools tend to
miss
the last feature we shall see is easy
code hosting as the name suggests the
codes and documentations are hosted in
one place
we also know that there are thousands of
repositories on GitHub so each
repository has their own set of tools to
release and host the code
finally let's have a look at the
competitors of GitHub there are several
competitors in the market here we have
just put the most common ones first is
atlasian bitbucket
then comes fog bugs followed by surround
SCM and gitlab then we have buddy and
finally followed by Beanstalk for
today's session the topic of discussion
is how to become a back-end developer
so if you're wondering how to become a
backend developer what skills are
required and what the responsibilities
are then you're in the right place
but let's wait for a while for more
people to tune in
I'd also like to thank all our viewers
for actively participating in these
sessions
all right so uh whilst you're at it if
you haven't subscribed to our Channel
already make sure to hit the Subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update okay so I see a lot of people
tuning in
all right so I think we're good to begin
now I'm sure all of you use social media
applications now every time you click on
a video scroll through a feed perhaps
search for something the corresponding
information is displayed on your screen
now these applications provide an
excellent user experience
but how is this achieved
you must know that every application
comprises of two parts does the front
end and then there's the back end
the front end is what the user deals
with and the back end is what makes this
happen
in other words the back end includes an
application a server and a database the
backend application fetches the data
from the database and processes all
client requests the result of this is
made visible to the user
so now the question arises who is a
back-end developer
a back-end developer's role is to focus
on details like building an effective
website architecture scripting and
writing code that serves as a means of
communication between the website's
database and the browser
and lastly to ensure data integrity and
consistency
so now let's look at the skills required
to become a pack-in developer
it is vital for you to have good
understanding of programming Concepts
like data structures and algorithms
this includes Stacks cues linked lists
trees and graphs sorting algorithms and
search algorithms
next up is programming languages and
Frameworks one of the most critical
skills of a back-end developer is a
depth of knowledge in back-end
programming languages
this includes Proficiency in JavaScript
and its environments like node.js and
express.js
next is Java this language was
particularly built from the ground up to
be run on server side
popular Frameworks include spring and
Java server faces
next up is python which is the most
popularly used language today it is
flexible and easy to use Python
Frameworks like Django and floss are
used for back-end development
and lastly there's C sharp and its
Frameworks like asp.net core and asp.net
MVC
other languages include Perl PHP and
Ruby now because backend and front-end
developers work so closely together it
is also helpful to have a foundational
understanding of front-end web languages
like HTML and CSS
now proficiency is essential not only
for performing daily tasks but also for
working alongside front-end Developers
for developing Solutions
next we have database Management Systems
a back-end developer writes code that is
used to perform relational mapping to
fetch data from the database
some popularly used dbms or MySQL SQL
server and postgresql next up is Version
Control
again popular ones are get and
subversion they help manage the project
files and keep track of the entire
history of things that the developer is
working on
and lastly This Cloud hosting platforms
these platforms allow you to deploy your
product on the cloud service provider so
that it can be accessed from the World
Wide Web
most popular ones are Amazon web
services Google Cloud platform Heroku
and Microsoft azure
of course there are non-technical skills
that are required of back-end developers
those who choose this profession should
be comfortable with analytical processes
have well-developed problem solving
capabilities be interested in emerging
technologies have good communication
skills and be able to work independently
and sometimes as a part of a
collaborative team
now that you're familiar with the skills
let's have a look at the
responsibilities of a back-end developer
first up is forming an understanding of
the performance needs and goals of the
website to develop effective successful
Solutions
development and management of
application programming interfaces
development of systems for websites to
accept and securely store data such as
those required for payment processing
systems
then there's writing code testing and
development solutions for correlated
issues
then this organization of system logic
other responsibilities also include
development of site architecture using
proper methodologies like agile scrum
framework and also providing solutions
to system problems
lastly let's have a look at the salaries
of a back-end developer
the average salary of a back-end
developer in the United States is around
102 000 US dollars per year the average
salary of a back-end developer in India
is around 7 lakhs 23 000 Indian rupees
per annum let's get start with the
agenda for today's session
so first of all we will understand how
to add programming projects to a resume
and then we will go through different
types of projects like portfolio project
web scrapping projects API based
projects games e-commerce Etc we'll go
through each of these projects and
understand why these projects are
important so having Web projects on your
resume whether you are new to coding or
a seasoned programmer emphasizes your
technical skills and experience to
companies while helping you stand out
from the crowd this tutorial will teach
you all you need to know about choosing
and presenting programming projects on
your resume so let's first understand
how to add programming projects to your
resume
so the recruiters and hiring managers
don't have much time to go through the
entire resume so in order to make them
notice the best projects you have worked
on you have to include them in proper
place in the resume you can include
technical projects in your work
experience section so that the hiring
managers can see them when they examine
your resume also if you have the prior
employment experience include your
programming projects and the extra
experience box
you can mention the description of the
projects the Technologies you have used
while creating the project and your
responsibilities and achievements for
the project you must include the most
important technical project you have
worked on and can also use the relevant
resume keywords in your programming
resume listing relevant programming
projects allow you to get passed through
applicants tracking systems so use
proper resume keywords by carefully
reading each job description and
adapting your resume achievements and
experience to meet the particular
qualifications that firms are seeking
for
so this was about how to add the
programming projects in your zoomi now
let's go ahead and have a look at some
projects that we can add in the resume
which will increase your chance of
selection during the recruitment process
so now let's go ahead and have a look at
some projects to add in resume
the first would be portfolio project so
one of the easiest projects to start
with is a portfolio project it enables
you to demonstrate your abilities and
create a personal website that is as
simple as and as complex as you choose
if you create a personal portfolio that
you can immediately show on the website
it will be easier to deliver and
showcase programming work to recruiters
including portfolio projects on your
resume can be especially valuable if you
apply for a creative field such as
design writing or marketing
in these fields a portfolio can provide
a tangible example of your work
now next project to add in your resume
is
web scripting
companies will be impressed if you
demonstrate your master web scrapping to
scan and capture data from a website
web scrapping is a practice of obtaining
information and content from a website
it is especially prohibited to do this
for publicly unavailable domain
including web scrapping skills on your
resume can be a valuable asset
particularly if you are interested in
careers in data analysis data mining or
software development
web scrapping can be useful tool for
collecting and organizing data from a
variety of sources
python web scrapping projects are
popular among beginners these days our
Channel already includes a python web
scrapping tutorial you can check that
tutorial the link will be added in the
description box
next we have API based project as a web
developer using search inputs is an
important skill to have so consider
adding an API to your list of
programming projects API or application
programming interface which is an
intermediate between software that
allows two apps to interact with one
another
APS provide an easy way to retrieve and
distribute data within and across
companies there are a lot of apis
available on the internet including
twitters API Amazon API and various
other apis
creating an API based project allows you
to manipulate data understand client
server architecture and obtain data from
HTTP servers
it is necessary to have basic
programming knowledge to create this
type of project and it will take around
two to three weeks to complete this
project now before moving forward let me
ask you a quick question
according to you what was the main
reason for Twitter to lay off so many
employees do let us know in the comment
section below you can take your time
now coming to the next project that you
must have on your list
games so games are an excellent way to
demonstrate your knowledge of basic
concepts and algorithms including games
on your programming resume demonstrate
your knowledge of logic data structures
and algorithms a game project can
showcase various skills such as
programming Skills game design skills
graphic design skills and project
management skills not only that using
game engine software such as Unity
Visual Studio or Unreal Engine
you can modify or develop an original
game with unique 3D characters and story
lines overall a game project can be an
excellent addition to your resume
because it showcases various technical
talents in great demand in the gaming
business
it can also be a great opportunity to
demonstrate your creativity and passion
for a game development next project on
our list is chatbot chat Bots are
extensively utilized to save time on the
recurring conversation on corporate
websites smartphones applications and
social media Pages a chatbot is a piece
of software that mimics human
communication or chatter via text or
voice interactions to make one you can
use a popular programming language such
as python Java or PHP
these are significant commercial
projects and the recruiting manager
would like to learn more about you
now coming to the next project which is
an e-commerce project
so the majority of the websites and
application with which we interact are
and e-commerce platforms and e-commerce
websites is one that allows you to buy
things online
some examples of e-commerce website is
Flipkart Amazon zomato
OU big basket growfers Etc
including an e-commerce project on your
resume can be a perfect way to
demonstrate your technical skills and
experience working on a complex project
depending on the specific Rule and
responsibilities an e-commerce project
can showcase a range of skills such as
web development skills ux design skills
project management skills and business
skills also so this was all about
projects to add in the resume
if you have any doubts regarding this
video you can put them in the comment
section so what's your opinion on our
list feel free to let us know if you
missed out on something important hello
Learners simply learn brings you a
postgraduate program by Caltech in full
stack web development which is the
ultimate resource to equip you with the
knowledge and tools you need for Success
you can find the course Link in the
description box below to learn more
about this course so here are the
Technologies covered
first up we look at questions on node
moving on we'll look at a few questions
on PHP
and then we'll go to database management
system like SQL
and then we'll look at Docker Jenkins
maven and selenium so I hope these
questions help you and let's Dive Right
In
hello this is Matthew and we're going to
be going through some of the simple
questions that you would be asked during
a node.js interview what we're going to
do is we're actually going to break out
the section into three key areas
there'll be beginner questions there
will be an intermediate questions and
advanced questions and the expectation
is as you go through this video is that
these questions could be pushed together
as you're going through the interview
kind of think of it like this is if
you've answered the beginner questions
that you would get asked at the
beginning of the interview with
confidence and Surety then the client is
going to then jump to those intermediate
Advanced questions quite quickly and
they're looking for people who can help
them serve and solve their problems at
that more intermediate and advanced
level so let's just get started
so the first question you're probably
going to be asked is you know you know
what is node.js you know do you know
what it's for and essentially node.js is
and one of the most popular if not the
most popular uh open source
cross-platform JavaScript programs and
it allows you to build out web
applications that run on the server it's
extremely flexible it allows you to
implement a lot of solutions outside of
just the the core programming runtime
and it allows you to build Solutions
extremely quickly in an open source
mindset for devops
it is used essentially for creating
client-sized web applications we'll see
this later on and you may want to talk a
little bit about using express.js and
how you can build out apis uh to work
with node.js and connecting to databases
such as mongodb
and that is also really good for being
able to store a data intensive
applications that are asynchronous and
event driven in their model and this is
important when you're talking about
creating applications that can scale
rapidly
so you can then ask be asked you know
how does node.js work well node.js
itself is actually built on the V8
engine and the V8 JavaScript engine is
the same engine that runs JavaScript in
your Chrome web browser extremely fast
it allows for high output and
non-blocking uh through your i o input
outputs and is is single threaded event
Loop
so you're going to be a van asked you
know where can you use node.js and and
the reality is the applications for
node.js keep expanding but there are
some core applications that you can work
with node.js right now so such as web
applications distributed system and
network applications uh probably
referencing the web applications is a
really good starting point because here
you can actually talk about maybe some
examples that you've done where you're
building out some of these web
applications indeed one of the things
that you want to be consistently doing
and peppering your answers with is
examples of work that you have done now
it doesn't matter if those examples are
purely experimental or training examples
that you've done the fact that you've
actually worked with node.js and created
a distributed system or a web
application is really valuable because
it shows that the person that you're
meeting with that you have knowledge and
understanding and practical experience
of applying the theory of working with
new Js with the practice of working with
node.js
so we asked about you know and
essentially the i o refers to the
transfer of data in and out of a system
and that's really it you know there's a
reason why Google calls that conference
i o it's the transfer of data in and out
of our brains at that conference the
application is same here it's about
moving data in and out of systems
through using node.js and that every um
event can be tracked and whether it's on
a physical device a network or files
within a system again it's input and
output
so let's go through and you know you're
going to be asked you know can you
explain the difference between front end
and back-end development and this is a
question that I can ask a lot when I'm
meeting with clients and you know people
get really confused about what is the
difference between front-end and
back-end development bottom line front
end is what gets resolved inside of your
web browser or the app on your mobile
device backend is what gets resolved
essentially um what we call the the back
office or server-side applications but
it's becoming more and more synonymous
for what gets running the cloud
so web applications
um really get a lot of the functionality
of the web application gets run in the
front end and I think with CSS HTML5 uh
client-side JavaScript so we can get
right on the front end everything else
such as connecting to a database gets
run behind the scenes in the back end
and uh so you know anything that's going
to have like Graphics is going to be on
the front end apis are going to be run
on the back end and then just finally
some of the scripting languages are
using on the front end so HTML CSS
JavaScript those are all Common Core
scripting and languages that you would
use you can use Frameworks such as
angularjs and react.js or View and those
would be a front-end Frameworks uh
back-end Frameworks will include Java
PHP Python and node.js are some of the
back-end Technologies you'd also throw
in their dot net as well I mean it's
just the whole you know Litany of
front-end and back-end Technologies and
Frameworks that you can use and this is
a actually a good point to kind of
explain the experience you have outside
of just working with node.js but other
technologies that you've been working
with that potentially that the client is
also using
so another question you're going to be
asked when you're looking at node.js is
you know can you tell me about npm and
so when somebody asks you what is npm
the first thing you're going to respond
is do you mean node package manager and
the reason why you want to respond like
that is that you want to qualify that
question with understanding that you
know what they're talking about but you
want them to verify that and so node
packet manager is npm
and it's responsible for packaging all
of your modules that you're working with
in node.js and we have a whole series of
videos that we've done on node.js and
every single one of them includes
references to npm
so you're going to be asked you know so
okay you tell me what it is you know can
you go into a little bit more um details
you know so you can provide two main
functionalities and so one of them is
being able to manage online repositories
or modules and packages
um so you can go to like
search.nodejs.org and you can find a
packages that you can install Into Your
solution such as express.js and it also
provides a command line utility that
allows you to manage your packages very
quickly through terminal window or
command line
I use vs code a lot Visual Studio code
and it has a command line utility built
right into it that allows me to interact
with npm
so what are some of the modules in
node.js and so you know modules um in
node.js they're essentially like
JavaScript libraries so you can think of
some of the JavaScript libraries that
you may have used the functionality is
somewhat the same but they're designed
for node.js and to run on the server and
there are ways in which you can go ahead
and create some of those modules so for
instance if we're creating a web server
you can actually use the require
commands to be able to require that the
server be there so the example we have
on the right hand side shows that we
really do need to have HTTP which is a
web server and we require that to be
installed and so that if you're running
that npm package it will actually
install the HTTP server and then you can
actually write some code to actually
then listen on the localhost port 2000
for where you'll be running your app
application
and there are just you know there's a
whole bunch of modules like I come with
node.js now right out of the gate and
here are some of the modules that you
have and we also referenced that just
earlier on HTTP is a core module for
running a web server uh you have a
utility function that is useful for
developers to assess features within
your node.js project you have a URL
module for any URL passing you'd be
doing
and you also have a stream which allows
you to be able to stream data in and out
of your system and be able to manage how
that's been worked and then zlib which
allows you to compress and decompress
files so that you can keep your storage
of files to a minimum
so a question you're going to be asked
is you know why is node.js being
preferred over back-end Technologies
such as Java and PHP and particularly
with gyro it's a very mature stable
language it's been around for more than
20 years you know PHP
um runs some of them the most powerful
and largest websites out there such as
Facebook so why would you use node.js
well the first response is kind of a
gimme but it is really fast and if you
watched any of the videos that we've
done on node.js building out Solutions
and developing the solutions you'll see
just how fast it is the second is the
really kind of the secret sauce with
node.js is the node package manager and
no package manager allows you to install
additional functionality such as Express
or as a database into your
solution really quick green and there's
over 50 000 bundles available for node
package manager
if you're building out a real-time
application that's data intensive and
you need to have apis quickly developed
then node.js is another great it's
really the great solution for you it
allows you to build out these Solutions
really quickly
and there is a easy synchronization
between the server and the client due to
the code base
and then finally because the structure
of node.js is Javascript if you are
making the pivot from being a front-end
web developer to node.js it's just going
to make it a lot easier for you to pick
up node.js because you have that common
language of JavaScript and on top of
that JavaScript is the world's most
popular scripting language
so let's talk about some of the
differences between angular node.js and
so and the reason why this question may
come up is the person interviewing you
is seeing whether or not you do know the
difference between a front-end framework
and a back-end framework and this is one
of those questions where you can go well
there are differences but the
differences are because they complement
each other so angular is a front-end
development framework whereas node.js is
a server side in framework other
differences though between the actual
Frameworks themselves is that angular is
written in typescript which is a
modification of JavaScript node.js is
written in C and C plus plus
anger is used for building out single
play client-side web applications and so
that's the keyword there is client-side
whereas node.js is about building out
fast and scalable server-side Network
applications uh so uh again the two
complement each other
uh angular splits web applications into
the MVC and model view control
components whereas node.js generates a
lot of database crazy it does more than
that as well but you can think of
node.js as that glued to your database
let's talk a little bit about when
you're connecting to a database with
node.js and so you're going to probably
ask you know what is the most popular
database used with node.js and there are
a couple mongodb is largely the most
popular nosql cross-platform database
MySQL is also very popular and that's a
more traditional relational database
you would go with mongodb for really
more modern solutions when you're
looking at creating an application
that's going to really scale into just
managing masses and masses of data that
has to be created red updated and
deleted very very quickly
for some of the other popular libraries
that you use for node.js express.js is a
very popular one and I really like
working with express.js allows me to
build out web applications really
quickly more importantly it allows me to
build out apis very quickly and which
you know apis are essentially web
applications themselves but being able
to do that very quickly with a framework
like express.js is very useful uh
Mongoose is an application that makes
connecting to a database really
easy so here is an example of express.js
which is a in itself really a flexible
but a solution that you can do lots with
and Mongoose which is a more focused
solution which allows you know to you
make it easier to connect to your
databases
so you know what are the pros and cons
of working with node.js there's lots of
ways we explain this earlier on that you
can actually build out applications that
run on the cloud why would you you know
what's are the pros and cons so a pro is
that node.js is extremely faster
processing thing and event based model
uh it really is fast I can't is if you
have something that is a very heavy
computational task it's not so good at
that now I will caveat that this is that
node.js is getting better all the time
and so you might have to be provide an
example of what a very heavy
computational task is and that may be uh
calculating a risk on an insurance
application against many many variables
that maybe something that's seen as
computationally very heavy but what you
can do in that example is you can then
offload the task to another a solution
that's designed for it and use apis to
pass the data back and forth Pro
JavaScript is used for building out your
applications with node.js great lots of
people know JavaScript
a restriction and again this is evolving
as JavaScript itself evolves is that
when you do a callback you may end up
doing lots of nested callbacks
um if you're doing something that's very
complicated again another way around the
con and so this is one of the things
that I always look for is if you have a
blocker or a barrier how do you get
around that barrier and so for instance
when you're talking uh to your recruiter
you can say look the reason why I use
node.js is that it's fast it's event but
it's driven I can use JavaScript there
are some challenges and but what I do to
get around those challenges are and
that's where you can say that you know
you may run the complex script off and
you may write that in net or Java or PHP
and then use an API to do the response
back into node.js so you get the
benefits of Both Worlds but minimize the
investment in having to manage a complex
environment such as Java versus a
relatively simple environment with
node.js the node package manager makes
it extremely easy to access just an
awful lot of functionality with over 50
000 packages there's a package for that
so from being able to have a a tool that
creates unique identifiers that you
might need to have for generating
content that gets posted into a database
through to being able to connect to
databases through you know to running so
many different solutions and the npm
package manager with its access to so
many different packages makes it great
for
um getting access to all that content
now Khan is working with relational
databases with node.js isn't as easy as
a nosql database now you can do it and
there are ways around that and what I
would do when this question comes up is
always kind of pivot to say hey this is
how you can actually then get around
building out that application
designed for streaming huge amounts of
data in and out a con is that node.js is
single threaded and so it can be CPU
intensive but again there are ways
around that and a good way around that
is getting your solution and elastic
environment such as the cloud
so what is the command used to import an
external library and so to import an
external Library the command is the
require command and so an example we
have here is uh you can assign a
variable and the variable is going to be
for HTTP and you're going to then
require the HTTP service and that means
that the application itself won't run
unless the external Library the HTTP
library is installed
okay so those were our introductory uh
questions for node.js this kind of pivot
and take a look at the intermediate
questions that you would be asked
so what does event driven programming
mean so event driven programming means
that if something happens something else
will happen in response so for instance
if you click a mouse that Mouse click is
an event that means something has to
respond to that event just think of it
as cause and effect it's just the basic
motion of physics so that's what a vent
driven programming means
you also look at it as a callback
function so that when an element is
executed something will happen in
response
so what is an event Loop in node.js so
an event blue in node.js is when you do
an asynchronous call and what that
essentially means is that you are
sending out data and then a non-blocking
input output from node.js is pulling
data back in
what is an event emitter in node.js so
an event meta has really two areas of
focus one is that it manages uh the
classes that hold all the objects within
your event and we have an example of
this on the right hand side and then
whenever an event actually is thrown the
functions are then called on that event
synchronously so for instance we have in
our example on the right hand side we
create an event and then we have the
functions and that executed in a series
from that event
so let's talk about the API functions in
node.js so there are two types one is an
asynchronous non-blocking function and
the second is a synchronous blocking
function and the difference between the
two of them is asynchronous is that
there is no structure to the order
if I have the API is resolved
synchronous means that when the feedback
from the API is received you have to
execute the response in a series for how
the response is sent to you
so what is a package Json file so the
package Json file is at the heart of our
node.js package when we actually will
initialize a solution a folder to be in
node.js package
you'll find that the package itself
holds all of the metadata that's
particular to the project you're working
on such as project name version
requirements it is you have to have it
installed in the root of the directory
for the project and again look at any of
the videos that we have on node.js we do
have demonstrations within those videos
that actually then go through and break
out how to create that root package and
you'll see how you can actually then go
ahead and update the instructions or the
metadata within the package so here we
have an example of what that metadata
looks like so again this kind of
continues that question of what is a
packet Json file and you may be asked
you know what is the metadata and why is
it important and the metadata is a basic
Json collection of pairing of key
details such as name version description
and then and the custom version that you
put so for instance under name you could
create a name for your project there
can't be any spaces what is the version
and the description and what is the main
or starting path and for Via solution
typically that would be index.js but it
could be anything.js but index.js is
typical simply because
index.html is the starting point for a
typical web application
so how would you use a URL module in
node.js
so with a URL module what it allows you
to do is really two things one is that
it provides the resolution passing of a
URL for Utilities in your application
and then it allows you to extend your
module with built-in Solutions and split
up the web address into a readable
format
so in this example we have the URL and
the response it would would give for
that URL which would then be a year and
month and it'll be in a readable format
so they would read out as 2020 and then
the month
so what is express.js and you've heard
me mentioned this a couple of times in
the video and we actually have a
separate video on express.js
um I would express.js is a web
application framework that allows you to
build out Web Solutions for both mobile
and traditional desktop right inside of
node.js so it's very easy to use
being able to install and web.js is as
simple as requiring Express to be
installed in the example that we have
here on the screen it's a full solution
of showing how to actually build out a
solution with web.js so in this example
you start off the first two lines
required Express to be installed and the
store comes from node packet manager
then we have a simple application that
will then send to the browser window a
hello world message confirming that
Express is up and running and then the
third block of content starting with
vars server actually will Define the
port where your application is going to
run so in this instance the port is
going to run on localhost and the port
will be Port 8081 and so you can
actually go to localhost colon 8081 and
when you do that that will trigger the
Apple application that will forward up
the message hello world and it's all
coming from express.js
so what are streams in node.js so
streams are objects that allow you to
read and write data continuously back
and forth within your application and
there's really four different types of
streams there's readable writable duplex
and transform
the readable one streams for which data
can be read
the writable streams that you can
actually write to a duplex is a stream
where it is both readable and writable
and transform our streams that can be
manipulated the data while it is being
read or written
so how do you update and delete a
dependency so say for instance we want
to install something like Express so if
you wanted to install Express what you
would do is you would just write them
inside of your project you want to go to
terminal window and write in the command
npm install Express
if you want to update the dependencies
within your node package manager to
update all of them all you have to do is
write the command npm update all
dependencies
and then if you want to explicitly
uninstall a dependency such as
express.js that's using the uninstall
command and so that would again be going
to terminal window and you would type
npm uninstall Express
and again it's really easy to create a
simple server in node.js that will run a
simple command the HTTP service is
actually built into node.js you don't
need to use express.js I typically use
express.js when I want to do a web
server because typically what I find is
that I will want to go and do something
more complicated but if you want to do
something that illustrates just the core
functionality within node.js you can
actually just require the core HTTP
service that actually comes as part of
node.js and then you can actually then
go ahead and tell it to create a service
and then to write in plain text I
command or text string such as this case
it'll be hello world and that would pop
out and then the final line is to then
listen that if you go to a web browser
that's on
port127.0.01 or localhost and go to Port
colon 8080 once you actually go to that
that will trigger this application and
you'll get the text hello world pop up
on your screen
so explain synchronous and non-blocking
apis in node.js
so all the apis in node.js are
asynchronous which means that they are
non-blocking which means you can run
them continuously and scale around that
which is just fantastic it's one of the
reasons why node.js can scale so fast
and the eighth means that the apis can
return data send data after it's been
called and really increase the
efficiency of events as they are
triggered Within node.js
so how do you implement async and
node.js and so the example that we have
on the left hand side allows us to
trigger async and it's using the async
function and as you can see in this
example it's actually something that can
be done very quickly in this example
we're actually making a command to
localhost and an app that's running on
Port 3000 and then depending on what we
get if there's an error message and then
we'll have error message go to the
console log which is the terminal window
and if we get a response to an
application then we'll actually get a
positive response which would be fetched
response so again very quick and easy
that you use the async function to be
able to build out and you to get your
asynchronous code
so what is the purpose of module exports
so a module export is a way to
encapsulate your the entire code for a
solution in a single package in a single
file and then you can then share that
with other developers so you're all
working from the same environment
so what is a callback function in
node.js a callback function is
essentially that once you run and you've
Trigon events and the response has been
given uh you want to be able to then
have a callback to validate that the
task is complete
all right let's move on to the final set
of questions which is Advanced node.js
questions
so what is rapple in node.js so Rebel
stands for read eval print and loop and
this is a reference to the Unix and
Linux background that node.js has
so Rebel will form the following tasks
the read will be actually passing the
JavaScript it'll read that and store it
in memory eval takes and evaluates the
data structure print will then print the
results often on the console window or
onto a web page and then Loop Loops the
above command until the user presses
Ctrl C twice
what is the control flow function so the
control flow function is a piece of code
that runs between several of the
asynchronous functions and that's it it
actually controls how those functions
execute
so how control flow controls the
function calls and it does it through
four ways one is it controls the order
of execution uh it collects the data it
limits the concurrency and then it also
calls the next step in a program again
this is a management tool for how your
functions are called Within node.js
so what is the difference between fork
and spawn methods in node.js
so the essential difference between the
two of them is that if you use the fork
method it will actually trigger and
create a new instance of the V8 engine
the engine running node.js and we'll
then run the application in that new
instance with spawn
it's somewhat similar it doesn't
actually generate a new V8 instance so
it's actually creating a new process but
it's within the same V8 instance as the
previous application that it was spawned
from
explain to me what is the use of buffer
class in node.js
so with the buffer class what you're
looking at doing is you're actually
controlling the raw data of a set of
arrays and integers and the memory
allocation outside of the V8 Heap buffer
classes used because pure JavaScript is
not compatible with binary data
what is piping in node.js so piping is
the ability to connect the output of one
stream to another stream that could be a
data stream it could be any stream that
you're working with but it does normally
get used to pass data from one stream to
another
so what are some of the flags used in
the rewrite operation files so our Dash
is used for read WS for opening a file
for writing
a dash that is opening a file for a
pending so the collection that you have
here you don't have to really memorize
all of them but to have a few of them in
the back of your mind is always a good
reference point
so how would you file using node.js
so the syntax you would use would be the
fs dot open and that would then open up
a file
explain to me what callback hell is so
callback house and known as the Pyramid
of Doom is when you have too many nested
unreadable and unmanageable callbacks
intensively cycle within each other and
they're constantly reading to each other
and they're not able to resolve the
solution
and uh this is a you know it's a big
problem and this is what why it's called
callback how because you're not able to
finalize the the app you are in
what is a reactor pattern in node.js
and so a reactive pattern is a concept
of non-blocking i o operations
can you explain to me the test pyramid
for node.js so the test pyramid and this
is standard for testing uh for all
devops is really split into three key
areas you have unit tests integration
tests and then end-to-end or e2e tasks
the unit tests are tests that you're
actually doing your raw code that you're
working on and the goal there is to be
able to validate that the code you're
writing is consistently working
integration allows you to um have tests
that integrate your raw code that you're
working with in your application with
other areas of an application and then
end to end is the whole system the whole
interface as it were for your solution
describe the exit codes of node.js
so Alexa code is a specific code that
identifies the end of a specific process
and examples of exit codes are unused
uncode fatal exception fatal error
internal JavaScript evaluation area
these are all good examples of exit
codes
so what is a middleware can you explain
the concept of middleware in node.js so
with middleware it is the ability to be
able to connect to a system and get data
from it that's outside of node.js so
this may be executing a type of code or
updating a modifying request in response
to a specific type of object
finishing the request response cycle
can you explain to me what other types
of HTTP requests that you may use when
working with node.js there are actually
quite a lot but four of them that you
might use would be get post head and
delete and these are if you've done any
web application before particularly if
you worked with forms inside of a web
application you're probably very
familiar certainly with get and post
again it's the request to retrieve data
post is generally used for changing
stating and data ahead is similar to get
but also asks for a response if there's
no body content so if you're using if
you're developing an API this would be a
good one to use and delete is used to
delete the predetermined source
so how will you connect to mongodb
database and with node.js and you use
that using the client and the
example we have on the left hand side
illustrates that
what is the use of node underscore EMV
and so the node underscore Envy is an
environmental variable that stands for
node environment in Express server so
the example we have on the right hand
side allows you to illustrate how you
would do that for say a production
environment
so what are some of the various timing
features in node.js so the timing
functions that you could use here set
timeout and then clear timeout and you
to schedule code execution that you'd
have inside of your application
you also have set interval and clear
interval to execute a block of code
multiple times in your application
set intermediate and clear intermediate
to execute code that is at the end of
your application we'll discuss some of
the frequently asked questions in PHP
interviews now the questions are
categorized in two sections beginner and
advanced questions so without any
further Ado let us get started with the
beginner questions now the most basic
question is what is PHP so PHP stands
for hypertext preprocessor it is a
server-side scripting language that is
embedded into HTML and is generally used
for dynamic web development php's also
have very compatible language that is it
also works efficiently with almost 20
different databases such as MySQL post
resql Etc next question what is a
session in PHP now sessions in PHP are
used to store data for users under a
unique ID which can be then used across
multiple web page use of a website next
what is peer in PHP now peer stands for
PHP extension and application Repository
it is a framework and repository for the
reusable components focus on reusable
components of PHP containing code
Snippets and libraries next is PHP
considered a case-sensitive language so
this is a very often asked questions in
interviews so PHP is partially case
sensitive since variables in PHP are
case sensitive while functions and user
defined functions are not next name
different types of data types in PHP so
different data types in PHP include
integer float string Boolean array
object null and finally resource so
there are total eight different data
types that exist in PHP next question
how is Echo different from print
now Echo it can output multiple strings
at a time while in case of print it can
output only a single string now Echo
does not have a return value while print
always returns 1. that is the reason
that is Echo is faster because it does
not have to return a value while it is
print is slower in comparison to Echo
because it always returns a value now as
you can see both of these commands Echo
and print are used in the exact same way
next what are the rules for naming a
variable now there are certain rules
which you have to follow or certain good
coding practices which you have to
follow while naming a variable in your
PHP code so variable name must always
begin with underscore or a letter so it
cannot begin with
or a special character for that matter
next variable names can include numbers
but not special characters so suppose
you want to name your variable number
one to three so you can use this
variable but you cannot use number at
the rate one two three since special
characters are not included next a
variable in PHP is declared using this
dollar sign followed by the variable
name now as you can see this is how we
declare a variable dollar my underscore
variable you can also put a number in
between or at the end while naming a
variable just not at the start next name
some popular PHP Frameworks so some of
the popular PHP Frameworks include
Symphony code igniter Cake PHP and
laravel moving on
how to check if a defined variable is
null or not so is a thank function is
used to check if the defined variable
has any value or not so to use this
suppose you have this block of code in
front of you so suppose you want to
check if this x variable that you've
defined is null or not so what you do is
you put the is it function inside the if
condition and it will return true if
it's
not null while it will return false if
it is a null value since it is not null
it returns true and we can display Echo
as variable X is not null while in the
case of variable y it is a null value
since so the if condition will be false
and it will not display anything next
how are objects in PHP passed so objects
in PHP are always passed by a value not
by reference next question how to
display output directly to the browser
now in cases you want to display your
output directly onto the browser while
running a piece of code you can use it
use these special tags to display an
output directly to the browser now as
you may notice these tags does not
contain the PHP written you can use them
directly and replace PHP within equal to
sign followed by what you want to
display and end it with a question mark
and a closing bracket moving on what is
defined function used for in PHP now
Define is used to declare a constant in
PHP also in contrast to the variables
there is no need for a dollar sign
before declaring a constant since the
value of a constant does not change now
this is how you can use the defined
function to declare a constant suppose
we want to declare the value of pi as
3.14 throughout your PHP code and which
cannot be changed so we can use Define
for that next question is related to
this question since what is constant
function in use for in PHP then it's a
constant function Returns the value of a
constant it is not used to define a
constant but it Returns the value of a
constant so suppose you define a
function constant using this defined
function and you want to return this
value you can use this constant function
for that next is multiple inheritance
supported in PHP so PHP only supports
single level inheritance which means a
class can be extended from only one
class using the keyword extended now
next what are the different types of
Loops in PHP so PHP consists of a while
loop a do while loop a for Loop and
finally a for each Loop so PHP consists
of total for Loops next question
how to concatenate two strings in PHP
now two strings can be easily
concatenated using the dot operator in
PHP now to do that I'll show you with
the help of a code suppose you want to
concatenate or join these two strings
str1 hello guys and the second string
would be and welcome to Simply learn and
want to display these strings together
so to do that you need to use this dot
operator in Echo as you can see this dot
operator so first you write this name of
the first string Then followed by the
dot operator I've given this space and
then the next dot operator because this
is also considered as a string and then
the third string variable and this is
how you concatenate two strings next
question what is the use of function num
AR arguments now this function as you
can see is used to return the number of
arguments passed in a function so
suppose you pass a certain number of
arguments in a function and want to know
how many values or arguments per past
you can use this function for that so
suppose in this sample code you want to
know how many arguments were passed in
this sample function so to do that we
declare a variable number of arguments
and we will equal it to the function of
number function number arguments now we
will display it and this sample has
passed three arguments so the output
would be 3. moving on
what are super Global variables in PHP
now some predefined variables in PHP are
known as super Global variables because
they are always accessible from any
function file or class regardless of the
score so in all in all they are globally
accessible so suppose you write a piece
of code and you declare a variable
inside it it would be a local variable
and could be accessed only in that part
of the code but in case of super Global
variable they are accessible throughout
the entire code they include Global
server request posts get files EnV
cookie and session moving on how to
invoke single line and multi-line
comments now a single line comment in
PHP can be made using this hash followed
by the command or double slash followed
by the comment while in case of
multi-line comments you can use this
hash star and write your comments in
multiple lines and enclose it with a
star and slash what I'm going to do now
is I am going to show you the use of
these comments in actual vs code now let
us take this block of code for example
now suppose you want to add a com single
line comment after this variable so what
you will do is you can use this double
slash this is
uh variable
also you can use slash
this is also a variable so this is a
single line comment now if you try to
write something else after this in the
next line it will take it as part of the
code not part of the comment so what do
you do
when you need to write multiple lines of
comment so suppose you need to write two
three lines about this line of code what
you will do is you'll use a slash star
now write the comment this is displaying
simply learn
so this is a three line comment which
you can end simply by start and a slash
this is how you write single line and
multi-line comments now let's move on to
the next question that is name some
common applications of PHP so some of
the most commonly used PHP applications
are system functions form handling so
PHP is very commonly used to handle the
fonts that you see on the web pages
correct tasks now crud tasks are create
read update and delete so when you will
be working with databases this is a very
important part of using databases that
is crud and PHP is used very commonly in
that next accessing cookies variables
and set keys and finally data encryption
PHP provides security through some of
its Frameworks which can be used and is
used very commonly throughout a lot of
websites so now that we have gone
through the beginner level questions
that are frequently Asked in PHP
interviews let us now move on to the
advanced level questions so the first
question would be how can you execute a
PHP script from the command line now a
PHP script from a command line can be
executed by by opening the command line
and inside the command line you have to
specify the name of the script or name
of the PHP file that you want to run
suppose you want to run a PHP underscore
script.php so you type in the name of
the PHP script that you want to run and
that particular PHP script will be
executed next differentiate between a
dollar variable and double dollar
variable so what is the difference
between the two now in case of a single
dollar variable is it is a simple
variable that is simply used to store
data so as we discussed earlier it is a
variable that we Define to store
different data types such as integer
float strings Etc while a double dollar
variable is a reference variable of
variable so this is used to reference
already existing variables now to you
Choose Or to understand how these two
work
you can see this particular block of
code here now in this code what you need
to focus on is this is a simple variable
hello which contains the string welcome
to Simply learn and we have defined
another variables as well which contains
a string hello now in this Echo as you
can notice what we are doing is we are
using this also before that you need to
notice is this is the same string as the
name of this variable so first we are
displaying this variable and then we are
referencing this variable here so what
it is doing is it is referencing the
value to another variable so hello
variable is being referenced so when you
execute this block of PHP script what
you get the output is hello since this
is the variable hello and after that
what you'll get is welcome to Simply
learn since this variable is a reference
to this variable
next differentiate between get and post
method now get method is used to submit
form data while post method is also used
for the same feature so the difference
between them is get method sends data as
part of PHP page URL sorry web page URL
while a post method sends data through
HTTP header in get the data since the
data has been sent through the URL it is
displayed in the URL of the web page so
it is not secure while in case of post
method it is a secure form of data
transfer hence When developing a website
for some security purposes usually we
prefer post method next up how to
connect to a database using a PHP script
now suppose
if you are asked this question in an
interview what you need to do is you
need to just write this block of code
and explain it to the interview now
suppose we have a PHP script and we want
to connect it to a database what we need
to do is we will create three different
variables at a server name username and
password now what we're going to do is
we will create another variable con that
will be used to connect it and then
we'll use the mysqli functions which
will then pass these variables to create
a connection so these variable values
are localhost username password these
other default values now to check if the
connection is connected what we're going
to do is we will
use an if condition if the con variable
gets and connect error we will display a
error message that is connection field
if not we will display connected
successfully now as you can see here
these names can be the name of the
server that you're trying to connect I
have used localhost username password
for the default values you can use the
name of the database that you're trying
to connect your PHP script to next up
what does final class and final method
mean in PHP now a final class in PHP
means that the class cannot be extended
while a final method means that it
cannot be overridden now as you can see
in this block of code we have used the
final keyword for a class and the final
keyword for a function now suppose
this final class is being inherited by
this child class what the program will
return is an error because once you use
this final keyword this class cannot be
inherited and similarly suppose this
function is trying to be overridden by
this part of the code it cannot be
because we have used the final function
next question differentiate between
function overloading and overriding now
function overloading the same function
is used for different purposes based on
the number of arguments inside the
function while in case of function
overriding the same name and same
argument function is used in parent and
child class respectively to change the
behavior of parent class method now let
me show you and demonstrate the
difference with an example so let us
look at this code so suppose you have a
function named show title which does
have contain a single parameter and
displays when called upon using this
parameter displays function 1. now if
you want to use the same name of the
function for a different purpose what
you can do is you can increase or change
the number of parameters inside the
function that is it now contains two
parameters so when this same function is
called using two parameters it will
function differently and display
function overloading so this is how
function overloading works next from
this piece of code we can understand 1
function overriding suppose you display
a function demo in a base class and you
want to override this demo function
inside the derived class so what you do
is you make another function with the
same name inside the derived class with
some different properties as you can see
it displays something different now you
create an object for the base class and
when you use this Base Class object to
call this demo function you can use the
properties of this function here while
if you create another object that is
object 2 for the derived class and you
use this object to call upon the same
demo function you are overriding this
Base Class demo function that was
inherited instead what it will use is it
will use the properties of the derived
demo function so that is how you over
load or override a class function in PHP
now let's move on to the next question
that is differentiate between equal to
equal to and triple equal operator
so a double equal operator is generally
used to check if the value of two
operands are equal or not it is
generally used in case of conditional
statements while a triple equals to
operator performs a type save comparison
which means that will that it will only
return true if both operands have the
same type and the same value so you can
understand this more with this piece of
code so suppose in this case since they
both are equal it will return true while
in this case they both have done same
type hence it will return true now let
us next check this equals to equal so
since they both are 1 and in PHP it will
display as true since they are equal
while when you are type checking that is
you are checking if they're equal with
the same type and same value it will
display a false since one is an integer
and the other one is a string value also
if you check two different strings with
the type shape it will also display true
next question
how does exception handling work in PHP
so when an exception is thrown code
following the statement will not be
executed and PHP will attempt to find
the first matching catch block so if an
exception is not caught a PHP fatal
error will will be issued with an
unquote exception an exception can be
thrown and caught within PHP so what we
do is we use this try and catch
method to try the code and if an error
occurs we can catch if an exception
occurs we can throw it and the catch
function will catch the exception and if
this we do not include the catch
function it will result in a fatal error
next up differentiate between require
and include now require if a required
file is not found it will throw a fatal
error and stop the code execution while
in case of include if an essential file
is not found it will produce a warning
and still execute the remaining scripts
so as you can see both of these include
and require I use in the exact same way
with different functions next up explain
different types of errors in PHP now PHP
consists of mainly three errors notice
warning and a fatal error now notice is
a non-critical error which means that
something minor went wrong during
execution and
a lot of times you just don't pay
attention to it a warning is a critical
error now it is given in condition where
suppose an include function that we just
discussed in the previous question when
to retrieve a non-existent file so
suppose you use an include function and
the file does not exist it will display
a warning and final is a fatal error so
it is a critical error resulting in
termination of the code so as we
discussed in the try and catch part of
the question if an exception is thrown
and we do not have a catch function for
it it will display a fatal error which
will return in termination of the code
next question
how to call a function by a reference so
Ampersand sign is used to call a
function by reference now in case of
reference the actual value is modified
if the value pass inside the function is
also modified while in case of value the
value of the original value does not
change
so this piece of code here is an example
of how you can call a function by
reference here as you can see this
Ampersand sign will call this function
by reference and any changes made in the
variables here will affect the original
ones next question
create a Singleton class in PHP so how
do we create a Singleton class in PH
before that let's have a look at what is
a Singleton class now a Singleton class
in PHP is a class that can have only one
object and hence provides only a single
point of access so in generally
generally in class you can create as
many objects as you want and it will in
turn create different access points into
that block of code so in a Singleton
class you can only create a single
object hence Singleton so this piece of
code as you can notice is used to create
a Singleton class now in to create a
Singleton class you need to have the
Constructor function private now here as
you can see a Singleton class is created
using this private construct and it then
checks if there's only one instance
created and if it is it functions
properly and displays initialize only
once next question how to encrypt a
password using PHP so PHP can be used
for encryption techniques now the
password underscore hash function
creates a hash password from the
password string using hashing algorithm
so suppose you create a password string
and enter your password as password at
the rate123 and you put it inside the
password has hash function so what it
will generate is we are echoing this
generated hash so what it will generate
is this so this is the This Is Random it
changes every time you generate the
password since it is encrypted and same
when you pass this password to the
database using hashing algorithm even in
the database the password will not be
visible so your data is secure next
question
mention different sorting functions for
arrays in PHP now let us understand this
question in the vs code so PHP consists
of different sorting functions which you
can use to sort and give an array
automatically so if you want to sort an
array in ascending order what you need
to do is use this sort function so it
will sort this array in ascending order
now if you want to sort it in descending
order use R sort that is reverse sort
similarly suppose you want to sort an
array in terms of value in ascending
order so you need to use a salt function
that is this so in terms of value what
in terms of value means is suppose in a
given error there are keys and values so
it will sort the array based on the
values that is this 22 27 and 37 so the
error will be the same since the values
are already sorted now if you want to
sort the array in according to key that
is this you can use case or that is key
sort function that is provided in PHP so
in case of key sort what it does is it
will sort the array in key that is the
first one would be D that is Duke second
M Mac and the third r that is raw
now if you want to sort this array in
descending order in terms of value you
use instead of a sort you use a reverse
sort similarly if you want to sort an
array in terms of key in descending you
use K instead of K sort k r sort that is
K reverse sort so these are the
different sorting functions that are
inbuilt into PHP moving on
what will be the output of the following
code now if this code is given let me
give you some time and try to pause this
video and think of what will be the
output of the following code
so the output of this code will be 21
comma 21 or 2 1 comma two one how did it
happen but before that if you got it
correct congratulations
but if you want to understand it see
a is a variable that contains the value
1 while a b is a variable that is
getting the value of a variable through
reference now we make changes in the B
variable with 2 followed by this
variable again which is calling the
value of a by reference so if we make
changes here we also make changes in the
value of a now if we display this since
the value of a is already changed by
reference it will display 2 1 that is
the value here and again since the value
of B is already 2 1 it will again
display it to 1. moving on what a
construct function and destruct function
in PHP so a Constructor or construct
function is automatically invoked when a
new object of a class is created and
then can be used to initialize value in
class so when you create a object an
object for a class A Constructor
function is automatically invoked but
this can also be so it does not contain
any value when it is invoked but you can
also use this construct function to
initialize some properties to give some
properties to the class which will act
as its default properties if nothing or
no new properties are given to the class
next is a destruct now a destruct is
automatically invoked when an object of
a class is distracted suppose you end
the part of the code of a class you want
you are destroying the object when
you're ending the piece of code a
distract function is automatically
invoked to clean up the resources next
is how can PHP and JavaScript interact
now PHP and JavaScript can not directly
interact with each other since PHP is a
server-side scripting language while
JavaScript is a client-side language but
there is a way that these two wonderful
languages can interact with each other
so we can swap variables since PHP can
produce JavaScript code to be
implemented by the browser so yes you
can produce JavaScript code from PHP
which can then be implemented by a
browser and then it is probable to pass
those precise variables back to PHP via
a URL next question is explain type
hinting in PHP now in PHP type hinting
is used to specify the expected data
type that is array object interface etc
for an argument in a function
declaration now during a function call
suppose if argument does not match the
expected data type the runtime will
display an error and probe that is a
fatal error and the program will then
terminate now in this code here what we
are doing is we are type hinting so this
is this code is for string type hinting
and this code is for integer type ending
now if these particular set of functions
that have already specified the type
they are expecting does not receive the
same type of variable inside them the
program will return in a fatal error and
it will terminate so moving on to our
final question of this video write a
class so yes this is a an assignment a
kind of assignment for you guys so what
you need to do is you need to write a
class to solve the following question
which I'm going to say so Implement a
class named basketball we all like
basketball right so Implement a class
name basketball with an attribute named
baskets so you have to create an
attribute name baskets and initialize it
to 0 as the starting position and then
create a method names core now when the
score method is invoked the baskets must
increase by one so let's see the
solution now so this is how you create a
class that is basketball
now inside this class what we are going
to do is we are going to initialize the
number of baskets that is this variable
as 0 as the starting position so to do
that what we're going to do is we will
be using construct function as we
discussed to initialize some default
properties for the class so this
construct function is used to initialize
this baskets variable to zero now
suppose we do not call this function
score which is increasing the number of
baskets the default value will be
displayed as 0 every time now suppose we
invoke this core function every time a
basket is code this will increase the
number of baskets by one so this is
pretty simple and this is how you create
a simple class which will perform the
following question so this brings us to
