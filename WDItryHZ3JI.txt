2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,400
so hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,640
tutorial my name is t Baki and this time

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,480
we're going to be going over how you can

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,000
use the IBM Watson knowledge studio in

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,359
order to create custom classifier models

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,519
for the natural language understanding

8
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,560
service even though you can actually use

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,280
it to create custom models for many

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,360
other services and now let's talk about

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,960
how this works so let's actually begin

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,440
now to start off what is the I Watson

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,680
knowledge Studio well the I Watson

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,800
knowledge studio is basically as the

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
name suggests a studio where you can go

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
to train Watson services that can

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,120
normally not be trained for example the

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,719
natural language understanding service

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,120
now if you're not familiar with the

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,079
natural language understanding service

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,879
well it's actually a quite new service

22
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,800
and it's basically a rebranding of

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,840
alchemy language from the Alchemy brand

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,119
to the IBM Watson brand and to bring it

25
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,840
into the Watson developer Cloud family

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
where it fits in with all the other apis

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
so that's what IBM is doing with the

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
natural language understanding service

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,200
and they're now deprecating Alchemy

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,240
Language by using the same engine that

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,799
powers Al Alchemy language uh inside of

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,759
nlu natural language understanding and

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
so basically uh what I'm here to tell

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,040
you today is how you can actually use

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,640
that very IBM Watson knowledge studio in

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,680
order to train natural language

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,560
understanding service even though it

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,840
cannot be trained so let's talk about

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,720
that now before I actually get into how

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,360
we're going to be training the natural

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,240
language understanding service let me

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,119
talk a little bit about what the nlu

43
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,880
does by default so for example if I were

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,439
to take a sentence like um oh I don't

45
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,439
know um Tim Cook

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,960
is

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,239
the

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,640
CEO of

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,200
Apple

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
and

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
was

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
born

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,239
on

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,239
November

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,960
first first

56
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,179
[Music]

57
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,239
1960

58
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,879
okay so it's happening here is we've got

59
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,040
this sentence that has information that

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,280
Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and was

61
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,480
born on November 1st

62
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,760
1960 now we've got a lot of information

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,640
here and what the natural language

64
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
understanding service will do is it will

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
actually label this information so that

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
we can actually make use of it and use

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,080
it in our applications in order to make

68
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
decisions so what it's going to do is

69
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,560
it's actually going to label Tim Cook in

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,879
the text as

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,480
person and it'll name

72
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,360
CEO as job

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,920
title and it'll name apple as well as

74
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,760
you guessed company

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,439
okay and I'll talk about the rest in

76
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,280
just a moment but the nlu service is

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,720
basically going to tag all the important

78
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,480
pieces of text from this sentence and in

79
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,360
fact that's actually what my application

80
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,040
ask tme uses in order to give people

81
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
their answers now in case you're not

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,120
familiar with ask tan may ask tan May is

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,319
actually this nlqa system or natural

84
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,799
language question answering system that

85
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,760
can take your questions uh and answer

86
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,879
them for you and it's powered by IBM

87
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,799
Watson's natural language understanding

88
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,799
service and the way it works is by

89
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,760
running an eight-step algorithm but the

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,239
the core step basically uh once it once

91
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
it create some candidate answers from

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
which to you know choose answers from in

93
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,000
order to filter out those answers the

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,199
main filtering is done by nlu by saying

95
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,120
okay if the user is looking for a

96
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
company we shouldn't be giving them job

97
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,440
titles or persons instead we should only

98
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,320
be giving them company results results

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,960
and that's what the nlu service will

100
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,400
help us do but you see there's just one

101
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,919
thing let's just say I wanted to program

102
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,520
ask 10 May to actually give date answers

103
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,639
it can say you know when was Tim Cook

104
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,400
born and it'll return November 1st

105
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,840
1960 but currently that's not possible

106
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,160
and the reason is because the nlu

107
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,800
service does not support giving you

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
dates it will not classify this as a

109
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
date because it doesn't understand this

110
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,639
as an entity date entities are not

111
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,840
supported with Alchemy language or the

112
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,600
natural language understanding Service

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
as they were in the past with

114
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,039
relationship extraction which was then

115
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,120
replaced by Alchemy

116
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,440
language and so basically what the

117
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,240
Watson knowledge studio will let us do

118
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,639
is it will actually let us train our own

119
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,520
natural language understanding service a

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,960
custom model for the service which will

121
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,360
have date as an entity and we will train

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,720
it to understand dates and sentences

123
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,759
where they usually show up sentences and

124
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,479
how to recognize a date and the way this

125
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,080
is going to work is we're going to give

126
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,400
it many examples of sentences like these

127
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,840
and we're going to label

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
this as the date in every

129
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,000
sentence and eventually what's going to

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,039
happen is let's just say we do this 10

131
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,400
times the Watson knowledge studio will

132
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
train the nlu service using its machine

133
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,560
learning capabilities so on to actually

134
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,360
understand where the date occurs and

135
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,639
then we can implement it to as t a

136
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,800
feature to give date answer types

137
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,120
because now it can find the date as an

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,759
entity within natural language with the

139
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,599
nlu service and that's what the

140
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,440
knowledge studio will let us do it's

141
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,400
going to allow us to find those entities

142
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,479
in our text using the natural language

143
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,479
understanding service before this the

144
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,560
Alchemy language service was uh of

145
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,919
course uh compatible uh with this but

146
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,319
the only thing is the Alchemy language

147
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,319
service is now going to be deprecated

148
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,000
and so there's practically no point you

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,520
know ching how to do it with Alchemy

150
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,319
language instead we're going to be doing

151
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,919
with the natural language understanding

152
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
service which is now in general

153
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,080
availability phace this can also be used

154
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,039
to train Discovery and of course there

155
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,960
will be in future videos train telling

156
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
you how you can train the discovery

157
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,919
service to understand your text using

158
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,000
the knowledge Studio but for now let's

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,919
go over to the coding part where I'm

160
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,479
going to show you how exactly you can

161
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,520
use the knowledge studio in order to

162
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,440
create a date parser through natural

163
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
language with the natural language

164
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,479
understanding service all right let's

165
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,879
get to that now all right so welcome

166
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,720
back to the coding part and now I'm

167
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
going to be showing you how you can

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,960
actually train the custom model using

169
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,800
the Watson knowledge studio so let's

170
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,759
begin by actually opening up the

171
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,199
knowledge studio so as you can see over

172
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,080
here I've got the knowledge Studio open

173
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,599
and once you've actually signed up for

174
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,479
trial or maybe even actually bought the

175
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,039
act the real version of the knowledge

176
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,639
Studio whatever whatever floats your

177
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,080
boat here uh once you have access to the

178
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,120
knowledge Studio then you're ready to

179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
begin in building your project so to

180
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,639
begin what you're going to do is you're

181
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,720
going to create your project by clicking

182
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,199
on this little create project button now

183
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,000
in this case our project is all about

184
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,960
parsing date from natural language so

185
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,440
we're going to call this the date

186
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,400
knowledge Studio

187
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,800
project once that's done we're going to

188
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,599
keep the language of documents as

189
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,639
English and then click on

190
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,560
create wait for a moment while it

191
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
creates our project and once it's done

192
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,199
creating the project it will

193
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,960
automatically take you into the project

194
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,000
View and inside of this view you are

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,280
able to of course modify really all the

196
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,120
attributes of your project and of course

197
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,960
deploy it to the natural language

198
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,479
understanding service now to begin

199
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,879
though we have to first Define what

200
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,199
exactly is going to be inside of this

201
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,360
project so in this case entity types

202
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,919
basically what we mean by this is

203
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,440
basically what types of entities this uh

204
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,560
this classifier or this uh this natural

205
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,520
language understanding model should be

206
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,599
able to uh to identify

207
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,879
so what we're going to do is we're going

208
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,919
to click on the add entity type button

209
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,800
here and we're going to give the entity

210
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,760
type a name called date because we want

211
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,240
it to be able to select or uh of course

212
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,200
parse out dates from our natural

213
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,519
language once you're done that click on

214
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,720
Save and don't give it any subtypes or

215
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
roles it'll automatically fill those out

216
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,440
for you and once that's done you should

217
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,240
have a new entity type called

218
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,959
date now before you go any further you

219
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,240
have to have some training data and this

220
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,760
is where this little Tech file comes in

221
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,440
I've actually prepared some training

222
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,200
data that can be used with the knowledge

223
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,399
studio in order to train it as you can

224
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,959
see it says I was born on March 17th

225
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,680
1987 Apple was founded on 0104 1976 or 1

226
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,560
April

227
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,519
1976 IBM was created by Charles ranlet

228
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,600
Flint on June 16th of 1911 in New York

229
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,519
City tanay was born in 2003 tanway

230
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,959
teaches Tam's YouTube channel was

231
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,680
created on 1225 2011 etc etc it

232
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,079
continues on quite a few examples here

233
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,200
and this is actually very very small

234
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,440
training data compared to what you

235
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,519
should be feeding into the knowledge

236
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,480
Studio you should actually be giving it

237
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,920
a lot more data but just as an example

238
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,959
of how you can use this this is what

239
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,680
we're going to be using today all right

240
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,680
so once you've got that down then you're

241
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,399
ready to head over to the knowledge

242
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,440
studio and once you're there head over

243
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
two documents on the top right corner

244
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,079
here uh and so basically beside the type

245
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,640
system which is where you're currently

246
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
at there should be a button called

247
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,800
documents click on to it and you'll

248
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,519
switch over to the documents pane over

249
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,120
here click on import document set and

250
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,720
click on the import gray

251
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,360
boundary then what you need to do is

252
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,120
import your knowledge Studio training

253
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
data and then click on the import

254
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,560
button once you've imported that text

255
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,240
then you're ready to do something called

256
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,279
create an annotation set an annotation

257
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,800
set basically means that the this is a

258
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,600
document that we're going to be

259
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,519
annotating basically what we're going to

260
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,079
do is we're going to tell it to take

261
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,560
100% of all the documents we have which

262
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,120
in this case we only have one document

263
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,079
full of training data and what we're

264
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,040
going to do is we're going to set me as

265
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,519
the annotator and we're going to set

266
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,839
this as the date

267
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,800
annotate and so what this is going to do

268
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,560
is it's going to assign me as the

269
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,000
annotator for this document over here

270
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
that we've imported and tell me that I

271
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,360
have to put in the data from inside of

272
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,240
this

273
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,760
document once that's done click on

274
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,720
generate and it will create an

275
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,880
annotation set once you're there you can

276
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,600
skip dictionaries and rules because

277
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,360
we're not doing anything preset we're

278
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,839
doing you know machine learning stuff

279
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,920
here and Skip right over to human

280
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,880
annotation here what we're going to do

281
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,639
is we're actually going to annotate that

282
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,160
document that we just uploaded as

283
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,120
training data in order for the natural

284
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,079
language understanding service to find

285
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,240
patterns in where dates are and what

286
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
dates are in in our sentences in order

287
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,839
to do this click on add task and enter

288
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,320
in date annotation task that's just what

289
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,120
I'm calling this this

290
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,279
task you can set a deadline if you wish

291
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,760
and click on

292
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,320
create make sure you you select your

293
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,040
annotation set that you created at the

294
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,600
beginning and then go ahead and click on

295
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,560
create

296
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,880
task once that's done then go then click

297
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,680
on the task itself

298
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,160
and click on the annotate

299
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,320
button once you're there it'll take you

300
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,440
to this new page and this new page will

301
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,880
have our document click on the document

302
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,600
and it'll open up this annotation view

303
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,680
once you're in The annotation view then

304
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,760
click on the date button on the side

305
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,399
here the right side and this will mean

306
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,680
that you are now tagging date entities

307
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,639
within your text once that's done then

308
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,199
start clicking on the dates that are

309
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,199
inside of your text for example this

310
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,160
first one is I was born on March 17th

311
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
1987 so what I'm going to do is I'm

312
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,079
going to click on March I've clicked

313
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,720
March I'm not I'm not you know currently

314
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,760
clicking or anything and then once

315
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,480
that's done I'm going to just separately

316
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,079
click on

317
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,320
1987 click the space bar and it'll note

318
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,199
this as a date do the same thing for the

319
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:52,480
rest of the dates in your

320
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,399
text and once you've noted all of your

321
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,600
dates then you should be good to go as

322
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,279
you can see I've noted all of the dates

323
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,880
in this text each line has one date and

324
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,320
there're in many different formats and

325
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,279
in many different places in sentence and

326
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,959
with many different wording formats in

327
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,880
the sentence as well this is going to

328
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
give the knowledge Studio a good idea of

329
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,440
what a date actually is and not just say

330
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,240
oh well if the word born isn't a

331
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,920
sentence then well whatever comes at the

332
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,000
end is a date no it'll actually

333
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,680
understand the concept of a date and

334
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,000
then give you your results because it

335
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,560
has that variation in the data once

336
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,760
that's done then just click on Save here

337
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,440
click close And then click submit all of

338
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,920
course if you have more documents then

339
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,399
you're going to annotate all those

340
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,920
documents and then click on submit

341
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,600
all once that's done click

342
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,560
okay and then you are done you can now

343
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,600
close this new tab that was opened and

344
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,279
come back here and click on

345
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,160
refresh as you can see this has now sub

346
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,519
been submitted but now we have to

347
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,320
actually accept the changes in the

348
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,560
annotations that I've made into the

349
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,920
training data so I'm going to click on

350
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,279
this annotation set and click on accept

351
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,959
because I know I did this correctly I'm

352
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,800
going to accept it and click okay to

353
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,680
confirm that I want to accept the data

354
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,600
that has been now been completed and it

355
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,880
is part of the ground truth we can now

356
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,600
go to the annotator component tab of our

357
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,839
knowledge studio and create a new

358
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:25,240
machine learning annotator this is going

359
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,199
to allow us to actually deploy a new

360
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
machine learning annotator to the

361
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,880
natural language understanding service

362
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,600
and you can of course use the rule

363
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,199
dictionary or alemy language pre-

364
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,480
annotators or annotators but I'd

365
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,639
recommend just using the machine

366
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,079
learning one for now and that's what I'm

367
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,800
going to teach you how to do so I'm

368
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,079
going to create this type of

369
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,199
annotator and of course since we only

370
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,079
have one document uh we're going to

371
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,959
select the document set and of course

372
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,759
since as I as I was saying since we only

373
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,920
have one document we have to use that as

374
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,519
our training document and we have no

375
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,320
test set and no blind set so 100% % of

376
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,360
our documents are going to be in the

377
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,199
training zero in the test set and zero

378
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,680
in the blind

379
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,639
set once that's done click on

380
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,759
next and then what's going to happen

381
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,160
just keep everything here default and

382
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,880
click on

383
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,240
train once you click on train it's

384
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
actually going to start training your

385
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,079
knowledge Studio service here and once

386
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,720
it's done training this machine learning

387
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,839
annotator then we will actually be able

388
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,639
to deploy it to natural language

389
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,720
understanding in the meanwhile let's

390
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
actually head over to Blum miix and in

391
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,920
your Blum miix catalog you're going to

392
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,560
go over as I said to the catalog and

393
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,480
you're going to search up for the

394
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,639
natural language of

395
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,639
understanding

396
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,820
Lumix

397
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,279
[Music]

398
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,759
oops okay so we're going to search up

399
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,519
understanding and find the natural

400
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,279
language understanding

401
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,199
service click on the Serv service I'm

402
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,639
going to be choosing the free plan and

403
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,319
then we're going to call this service uh

404
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,079
let's just say something like Watson

405
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,319
knowledge

406
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,000
Studio date parser nlu for natural

407
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,959
language understanding we're going to

408
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,600
leave this Unbound to any application

409
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,240
choose the free pricing plan and then

410
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,759
click on

411
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,279
create now what's happening is it's

412
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,360
creating our our natural language

413
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,120
understanding service and with this

414
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,680
we'll be able to actually use that

415
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,000
custom

416
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,920
model all right so we've created our

417
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,880
natural language understanding service

418
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,839
and now that we're here we're ready to

419
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,639
actually use the service and in order to

420
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,040
do this you're actually going to head

421
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,279
have to head over to the API Explorer

422
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,279
for Watson and open up the natural

423
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,639
language understanding API Explorer page

424
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,000
now in the natural language

425
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,680
understanding API Explorer page you can

426
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,079
basically create requests to the natural

427
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,720
language understanding services run them

428
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,959
and and actually test them out on a web

429
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,160
interface but before you do that you

430
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,120
actually have to fill out your

431
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,439
credentials so go back to Blu miix and

432
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,199
find your service credentials for the

433
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,559
natural language understanding service

434
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,480
so as I was saying you have to copy the

435
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,240
user name into the username field here

436
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,000
and then go back to Blu miix and copy

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,559
your password into the password field

438
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,640
once you filled out those credentials in

439
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,959
the API Explorer you're ready to

440
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,440
continue and

441
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,880
analyze now what you're going to do is

442
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,480
you're going to actually click on one of

443
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,200
these analyze buttons here and this will

444
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
call the analyze service for the natural

445
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,840
language understanding service once

446
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,320
you're here you can actually just use

447
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,520
these default filled out uh these filled

448
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,559
out Fields here and the text we're going

449
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,880
to be giving the nlu service is my name

450
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,120
is t or uh my name is Tim Cook or just

451
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,400
Tim

452
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,080
Cook is the CEO

453
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,159
of

454
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,320
apple and was born on

455
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,750
November 1st of

456
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,880
[Music]

457
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
1960 so as you can see what we've done

458
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,880
is we've given it a date we've given the

459
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
job title the company and the entity

460
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
which is person and then what we're

461
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,080
going to do is we're going to tell the

462
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,480
natural language understanding service

463
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,200
to only return

464
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,400
entities and then from there to actually

465
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
try it

466
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,559
out now as you can see in our response

467
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,039
box we get Tim Cook as a

468
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,400
person we get CEO as a job title and we

469
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,320
get apple as a

470
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,440
company but the thing is we don't get

471
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,159
our date and that's because we haven't

472
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,320
told the nlu service to use our custom

473
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,520
model to train with or to use as you can

474
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,240
see the knowledge studio is still

475
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,679
training so what I'm going to do is I'm

476
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,559
going to actually let this train and

477
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,320
once it is done training we will be

478
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,960
right back in the video and then I'll

479
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,880
show you how exactly you can integrate

480
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,559
this with a natural language

481
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
understanding service all right so as

482
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,200
you can see the knowledge Studio says

483
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,080
that it is now done training this

484
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,720
machine learning annotator so I can then

485
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,640
just click this little close button here

486
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,480
and as you can see it says we are

487
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,799
complete now what we can do is we can

488
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
actually head over to the details pane

489
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,000
here and we're going to click on create

490
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,559
takes snapshot what this is going to do

491
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,280
is it's going to take the first version

492
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,240
which is the only version of this

493
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
annotator that we've created and it's

494
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,120
going to take a snapshot of it we're

495
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,400
going to give it a small description

496
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,320
maybe something like date

497
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,000
parser nlu

498
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
V1 I'm going to click on

499
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,320
okay and then what happens is it creates

500
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,960
that 1.0 version creation date and etc

501
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,200
etc gives it a description and what

502
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,320
happens is it creates a 1.1 version and

503
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,240
it allows you to take a snapshot but

504
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,760
instead what we're going to do is we're

505
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,280
actually going to click on deploy and

506
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,919
what this is going to do is for version

507
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,520
1.0 this will deploy it and what we can

508
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,360
do is we can select natural language

509
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,480
understanding to have it deploy to well

510
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,200
natural language understanding I'm going

511
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,320
to click on next and once I click on

512
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,120
next I can actually choose my space in

513
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,360
bluex and the instance that I'd like to

514
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,720
deploy it to once I choose those options

515
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,159
click on

516
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,880
deploy and then as you can see it's now

517
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,840
deploying to the natural language

518
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,360
understanding service you can then take

519
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,960
this model ID which is the ID of your

520
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,000
custom model that you've just created

521
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,280
and click on okay go back to the Watson

522
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,320
API

523
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,840
Explorer and you should see something

524
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,799
called entities. Model inside of

525
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,919
entities. model paste in your model ID

526
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,600
and once you've pasted in your model ID

527
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,320
go down and click on try

528
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,880
it now you should get an error and this

529
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,200
is error code 500 and it says model

530
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,559
temporarily not available and this is

531
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,000
because it's currently working on

532
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,159
deploying this to the natural language

533
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,000
understanding service it's been trained

534
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,880
it just needs to deploy so what I'm

535
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,280
going to do is again I'm going to take a

536
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,120
quick break for around 2 or 3 minutes

537
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,080
wait for this to become available and in

538
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,200
around 3 minutes I will be right back

539
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,320
and then we will be able to actually use

540
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,080
this service I'll be right back all

541
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,520
right so let's see if the model is now

542
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,039
available with the natural language

543
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,440
understanding service let's click on try

544
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,000
it out once

545
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,559
more and as you can see the model is

546
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,960
available and it gives us back the

547
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,880
entity of type date November 1st of

548
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,679
1960 and this is absolutely great

549
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,200
because we've again never given this

550
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,840
exact sentence to it in the training

551
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
data yet it was able to parse out the

552
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
date which proves its machine learning

553
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,880
capability and now if we were to give it

554
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,480
a lot of different types of dates it

555
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,559
would eventually generalize the concept

556
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,159
of a date and it would be able to it

557
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,120
would be able to parse a date from

558
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,600
almost any sentence you would give it

559
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,159
and that is exactly how this application

560
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:04,039
works I really do hope you enjoyed this

561
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,919
video and hope you were able to learn

562
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,600
something from it but all right that's

563
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
going to be it for this video today

564
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,720
really hope you were to learn something

565
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,600
and hope you enjoyed and if you did
