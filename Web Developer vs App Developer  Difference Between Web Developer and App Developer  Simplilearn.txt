foreign
increasingly relies on technology the
demand for skill developers continues to
grow
however the field of software
development is incredibly broad with
many different specializations and areas
of expertise
two of the most popular specialization
within software development are web
development and app development
web developers and app developers both
work in the same field but their roles
and responsibilities can be quite
different so hey everyone welcome back
to another video by simply learn in this
video session we will understand about
web developer and app developer and
learn about the difference between web
developer and app developer and many
more topics like skills needed to become
a web developer skills needed to become
an app developer which career should you
choose
Etc
but before we begin let me ask you a
quick question
so which website was the first website
ever created and what was its purpose
option A is google.com to provide search
engine Services option b is facebook.com
to provide social media Services option
C is
info.7.ch to provide information about
the World Wide Web project option D is
amazon.com to provide online shopping
services
now you can pause this video and answer
in the comment section below
all right so now let's begin with the
first topic that is what is a web
developer
so web developer is someone who builds
websites and web applications they use
different programming languages like
HTML CSS and JavaScript to create the
visual layout design and functionality
of a website
in simple terms a web developer is like
an architect who plans and Designs the
structure and layout of a building they
use different tools and materials to
create a website that looks good and
works smoothly they also make sure that
the website is easy to use and navigate
so that people can find what they are
looking for quickly and easy so there
are three main areas of web development
front end back end and full stack so
front-end web development is concerned
with the visible and interactive
components of a website which are
presented to the users
the backend development focuses on the
underlying infrastructure that supports
the front end including servers
databases and applications
full stack web development encompasses
both front-end and back-end development
combining the elements from each to
create a comprehensive approach
so this was all about web developer now
let's understand the skills needed to
become a web developer
so the following are some of the skills
needed to become a web developer first
is familiarity with front-end Frameworks
and libraries
front-end Frameworks and libraries like
react Anglo and vue.js are essential
tools for building modern web
applications
next is back-end development you should
be familiar with vacuum development
Technologies like node.js python Ruby on
Rails Etc
the third one is database management
knowledge of database Technologies such
as MySQL mongodb and pgsql are essential
next is knowledge of web development
tools
you should be familiar with the tools
like git webpack Gulp and grunt
the fifth skill is responsive design
you should be familiar with the
responsive design techniques which
enable websites to adapt to different
screen sizes and device types
at last we have user experience and user
interface design
you should have a good understanding of
ux and UI design principles to ensure
that your web applications are easy to
use and navigate
so these were some of the skills of a
web developer now let's have a look at
the next topic which is what is an app
developer
so an app developer is a person who
creates software applications that can
run on mobile devices like smartphones
or tablets or on computers
these applications also known as apps
are designed to perform specific tasks
like helping you stay organized play
games or communicate with others
app developers use programming languages
like Java or Swift to write the code
that makes an app function
they also design the user interface that
you interact with and ensure that the
app runs smoothly and without errors
mobile app development are tasked with
developing and maintaining user-friendly
mobile applications that are fully
functional
they typically conduct thorough research
design develop and touch mobile
application to ensure that they must
meet user needs before releasing them
after the application is launched mobile
developers provide ongoing support by
examining the application identifying
issues and making Necessary updates to
enhance its performance
so this was all about app developer now
let's understand skills needed to become
an app developer
to succeed as an app developer one must
possess both Technical and non-technical
skills some of the key competencies
necessary for mobile development roles
include Proficiency in programming
languages
app developers need to have a strong
understanding of programming language
such as Java Swift kotlin and Objective
C
then there is knowledge of mobile
platforms
you should be familiar with both Android
and iOS platforms and have an
understanding of the unique features of
each platform
next is understanding of software
development
you need to have a deep understanding of
software development principles
including software architecture design
patterns and development methodologies
the next skill is user interface and
user experience design
create engaging and intuitive apps you
need to have an eye for design and be
able to create compelling user
experiences
following this problem solving skills
as an app developer you will encounter
various challenges and you need to be
able to solve them creatively and
efficiently
next up we have communication and
collaboration
so app development is a team effort and
you need to be able to communicate
effectively with the team members
stakeholders and clients
then at last continue slowly
the technology landscape is continually
changing and you need to stay up to date
with the latest trends and Technologies
to create cutting-edge projects
so these were some of the skills that an
app developer must have by earning these
skills you can become successful app
developer and create Innovative
user-friendly apps
now let's understand the difference
between a web developer and an app
developer
so it is a common misconceptions that
the roles of web developer and mobile
app developers are largely
interchangeable but in reality they are
distinct professions
the first point of the distinction is
platform
so the app developers create
applications for mobile devices while
web developers create websites for
desktop and mobile devices
second is language
app developers use programming languages
such as Java Swift kotlin and Objective
C for iOS and Java kotlin and C plus for
Android apps
in contrast web developers use languages
such as HTML CSS and JavaScript
third is focus the app developers focus
on developing applications that can be
downloaded and installed on mobile
devices web developers focus on creating
websites that can be accessed via a web
browser
fourth is functionality
so the app developers need to create
applications that are optimized for
mobile devices with features such as
touch control location based services
and camera access whereas web developers
need to create websites that can handle
user interactions and dynamic content
next is app stores
app developers need to comply with the
rules and guidelines of the app stores
where their apps will be available for
download
web developers do not have to worry
about the App Store release
next is updates app developers need to
release updates for their apps which
users can download and install
web developers can update their websites
immediately without requiring users to
download anything
now Point number seven is user interface
app developers need to consider the
specific user interface requirements for
different devices and platforms
whereas web developers need to ensure
their websites can be viewed properly on
different web browsers and devices
next up
development environment
so the app developers typically use
integrated development environments that
are specific to the platform they are
developing for
whereas web developers can use any text
editor or IDE that supports the language
they are using
ninth is security
app developers need to consider security
issues specific to mobile devices such
as data encryption and Security Storage
web developers need to ensure their
website is secure from attacks such as
cross-site scripting and SQL injection
last is testing
app developers need to test their
applications on a variety of devices
with different screen sizes and
operating systems
whereas web developers need to test
their websites on different web browsers
and devices with different screen sizes
and resolutions
so these were some of the differences
between a web developer and an app
developer
now let's understand which career to
choose among web developer and app
developer
so choosing between web development and
app development as a career depends on
your interests and skills and long-term
goals
both careers have their own advantages
and disadvantages so it's important to
consider your strengths and preferences
before making a decision
web developers primarily focus on
building and maintaining websites and
web applications they work with
Technologies such as HTML CSS JavaScript
and server-side programming languages
like PHP or python
app developers on the other hand design
and build software applications that run
on mobile devices like smartphones and
tablets
they work with programming languages
such as Java Swift kotlin to create apps
for Android
and for IOS operating systems
if you prefer working with virtual
design and have an interest in creating
user interfaces app development may be
better fit for you
if you enjoy problem solving and working
with web Technologies web development
may be a better choice
another consideration is the job market
both web and app development are in high
demand but the specific skills and
Technologies required can vary
web development tends to have a broader
range of job opportunities while app
development may require more specialized
skills
ultimately it's important to choose a
career that aligns with your interest
and skills
if you're passionate about web or app
development you can build successful
career in either field
now let's get back to the question which
we asked in the beginning of the video
which website was the first website ever
created
you have to answer the correct option
so the answer of this question is
the first website ever created was
