1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,270
so and welcome to another tutorial my

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,400
name is Tammy back and this time we're

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,680
going to be going over IBM Watson I'm

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,710
with my mentor Rob hi here hello my name

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,080
is Rob hi I'm the CTO for IBM edge

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,540
computing formerly did CTO for IBM

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,480
Watson hello my name is Tanmay Bakshi

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,430
I'm an algorithmic and I love to

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,789
architect machine learning algorithms

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,650
have you ever wanted to take your coding

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,109
skills to the next level have you ever

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,429
wanted to learn how to integrate

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,009
cognitive and AI solutions into your

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,219
applications well it's time to answer

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,399
those questions with IBM Watson I'm

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,320
thrilled to say that I've had the honor

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,930
of co-authoring a book with my mentor

18
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,450
rawhide so now instead of struggling

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,360
with documentation examples and loosely

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,579
string together guides authored a

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,100
comprehensive start-to-finish guide to

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,930
understand the Watson API is in the form

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,390
of a book called how you know competing

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,640
with the IBM Watson I don't want you to

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,350
think about this book is just another

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,600
reference material for a bunch of rest

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,450
api's rather this book explains the

28
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,619
ideas the structures and high-level

29
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,810
algorithms that go behind machine

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,090
learning and it teaches in the way that

31
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,180
we find best by example this book

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,009
actually has you build real machine

33
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,450
learning powered applications that

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,360
Watson and IBM cloud for free wait no

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,960
longer

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,850
get your copy today and be proficient

37
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,360
with the next level of coding AI and

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,009
machine learning with Watson
