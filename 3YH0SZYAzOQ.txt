1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,280
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,240
tutorial my name is hry bshi and this

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,600
time we're going to be going over well

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,480
the second part for my tower of Hanoi

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,759
series now this is just the second part

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,400
so now I'm going to be explaining the

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,799
algorithm and showing you a little

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,600
implementation of it in Swift again this

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,720
uses trees and so yeah I'm just going to

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,800
be explaining it to you so let's get

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,279
started let's dive straight into this I

12
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,400
have really nothing to explain yet

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,199
however as I said already like a million

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,320
times we're using trees for this to

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,480
happen and I have the Whiteboard ready

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,800
here as you can see so what I'm going to

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
be doing now is I'm going to be telling

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,840
you how we can use my custom algorithm

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,039
to solve the Tower of Hanoi uh for four

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
discs okay so that's four discs we're

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,800
going to be solving using this method

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,359
first of all as you can see this is

23
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,359
going to be the tree area but uh this

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,480
green shaded area over here Will be an

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,399
array basically of all the instructions

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,119
that we have gathered thus far so let's

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,439
just dive straight into it now basically

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,920
what we're going to be doing is we need

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,840
to uh make a set of steps that we're

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,400
going to be taking so what my current

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,000
plan is we want to first of all

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,479
move four

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,720
diss from also uh yeah uh I'm going to

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,399
be referring to Peg one as Peg a peg two

35
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,360
as Peg B and Peg 3 is Peg C in case you

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,200
were wondering so now what I'm going to

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,759
say is we're using four

38
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,479
diss from

39
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,439
a to

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,039
c however we can use B in the middle if

41
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,479
we need

42
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
to okay

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,439
perfect now this is our beginning like

44
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,000
what are we going to be doing from now

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,400
on basically what we have to do is we're

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,519
going to take three discs now we're

47
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,760
going to move it from uh Peg a to Peg B

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,760
the first three discs then the remaining

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,519
disc on Peg a will be moved to Peg C

50
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,080
then the remaining pegs on Peg B will be

51
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,920
moved to Peg C and then like that all

52
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,840
four discs will be on

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,720
pegy so now how are we going to do this

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,720
we know that we have to move three discs

55
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,280
first of all let me just make a little

56
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
line so you can see first this is the

57
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,239
first tree that I'm first line that I'm

58
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,959
making we know that we have to move uh

59
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,280
three

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,840
discs from actually uh just give me a

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,480
sec

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,000
so you can see that a bit better I'm

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,080
just going to make it a bit

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,760
bigger okay so now we're moving three

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,440
discs from Peg

66
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,640
a to Peg B using Peg

67
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,560
C now you might already start noticing a

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,599
pattern but next we're going to be

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,720
moving Peg I mean one dis from Peg a a

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,799
to Peg C using

71
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,920
B again you're getting this

72
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,159
pattern and then finally what we're

73
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,080
going to be doing is we're going to be

74
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,560
moving those three discs from Peg B to

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,680
Peg C using Peg

76
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,239
a it is that simple now here is our

77
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,319
pattern essentially what we're doing is

78
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,480
we're taking our beginning uh for

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,680
example node this is one node in our

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,400
tree now this node has four for its dis

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,799
value a for its from Peg B for its using

82
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,320
Peg and C for its two

83
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,359
Peg now the first thing that this node

84
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,600
wants to do is move three diss from A to

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
B and so essentially what we're doing is

86
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,320
we're saying 4- 1 is 3 then we're just

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,000
swapping these two over here B and C we

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,199
swapping to make CB meaning a CB A to B

89
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,520
using

90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,400
C then over here basically what we're

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,840
doing on the middle on the second node

92
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
is we are just saying okay we're going

93
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,120
to move one disc from a to c using B

94
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,840
that one disc on a going to

95
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,800
C then finally what we're going to do is

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
we're going to move the three diss that

97
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,320
we moveed to B back over to C using a

98
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,800
it's that simple now if you don't

99
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,039
understand this yet that's probably

100
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,320
because I haven't filled in the rest of

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,639
the table now I'm going to be filling in

102
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,400
the rest of the table with you then I'll

103
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
explain what this tree means then I'll

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,080
explain the actual algorithm then we're

105
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
going to go going to go to the Mac part

106
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,160
okay so

107
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,120
now from 3 ACB what are we going to be

108
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,880
doing first of all we know that the

109
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,240
first node over here is just diss minus

110
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,080
one okay so the diss number for this

111
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
specific

112
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,520
node will be 3 - 1 which is

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,360
2 okay so we had two discs we've

114
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,840
determined that then we know we have to

115
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,759
swap the using Peg and the two

116
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,440
Peg so ACB will become

117
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,639
ABC as you can

118
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
see

119
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,599
now we know that the second

120
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,120
node will have always one

121
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,759
dis uh so we can just write a

122
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,840
one right and we know it'll have the

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,560
exact same setup as these three

124
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,840
pegs so it'll have ABC or sorry

125
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,560
ACB because it's coming from this

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
node

127
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
then finally the third

128
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
node which will have again diss minus

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
one which would be two in this case and

130
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
then the two I mean the FR Peg and the

131
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,400
using Peg have to be

132
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,880
reversed and so I'm going to say c a

133
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,199
b now we have constructed

134
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,879
a little we've gone in one

135
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,840
depth but first of all we know one

136
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,400
cannot be extended like that's the

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,319
simplest thing you can do just move one

138
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,280
disc from a to c you don't need

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,120
instructions on how to do that but

140
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,360
moving three discs from A to B you need

141
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,800
instructions so this will be continued

142
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,919
this is just going to stop right here

143
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:23,759
and I'm going to tell you what we're

144
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,720
going to do with this but this is again

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,680
three not one so we're going to extend

146
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,440
it further so now let's just um bring it

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,840
further now 3 - 1 is

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,440
2 now b a c we have to uh switch over

149
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,120
the two and using p the pegs so this

150
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,520
will become B

151
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,680
CA so I'm going to write uh or sorry

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,199
yeah b c

153
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,759
a boom next what we're going to do for

154
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,680
the second

155
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,960
node is we are going to say again we

156
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,120
just know that it's one disc with the

157
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,599
exact same Peg set up so we're going to

158
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,560
say 1 BAC

159
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,599
C okay it's that simple next the third

160
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,319
node which will be down

161
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,919
here so what we're going to do is we're

162
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,240
going to switch the from and using

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,479
nodes and we're going to remove one from

164
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,760
the discs so that would be two

165
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,519
discs and if we swap b and a that would

166
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,880
be a

167
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,800
BC

168
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,399
perfect okay so we are making progress

169
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,880
with our tree but we still have a few

170
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,920
more things to do because as you can see

171
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,000
we have a two which is not to which we

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,240
do not know how to solve we have another

173
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,880
two we and we have two more twos so now

174
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,959
we have four more things to

175
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,279
expand and then theoretically we should

176
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,320
have a set of instructions right well

177
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
let's

178
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,920
see so we see we're starting off from

179
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,440
here we have two from a to c using B so

180
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,760
if I expand we know that 2 - 1 is 1 of

181
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,120
course and so the number of discs will

182
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,839
be

183
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,360
one

184
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,920
okay next we have to swap the using and

185
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,959
the two pegs so that will be

186
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,200
ACB a

187
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,240
CB okay then we're going to do our

188
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,440
middle Peg or our sorry our second

189
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,480
node get confused between those two

190
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,680
sometimes uh and so we know that's of

191
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,760
course just one uh dis but it's the

192
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
exact same Peg setup so we're going to

193
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,320
say dis one with the exact same Peg

194
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,600
setup which is

195
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,079
ABC then finally our third

196
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,920
node which 2 - one is one

197
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,519
dis uh and then A and B reverse that

198
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,399
would be b a

199
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,279
c and

200
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,360
perfect now we've solved this now let's

201
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,440
solve this node so now this node's first

202
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,240
node child node actually will be let's

203
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,800
see 2 minus one that's one for

204
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,959
Diss and then A and B reversed that

205
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,360
would be

206
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,279
CBA

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,800
perfect next what we have is the second

208
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,320
node okay so now we know it's the exact

209
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,760
same Peg setup with just one disc

210
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,240
instead so that would be c a b

211
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,279
finally the third node child node of

212
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,560
this node uh and so we know that's 2 -

213
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,600
one that's one

214
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,600
dis then we have C and A have to be

215
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,399
reverse so that would be

216
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,639
ACB and

217
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,680
perfect next we're going to solve this

218
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,839
one and this one and we'll be done okay

219
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,600
so 2 BCA 2 - 1 that's one so we know the

220
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,560
number of discs for this first child

221
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,839
node will be

222
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,000
one then we know C and A flipped will be

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,560
uh a so b a

224
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,480
c then I'm going to create the um

225
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,560
basically second node child node for

226
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,720
this parent

227
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,880
node which will have anywh

228
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,760
uh the one dis and the exact same Peg

229
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,000
setup so one

230
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,120
BCA then we're going to go for the third

231
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,519
child

232
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,160
node which will be 2 - 1 that's

233
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,160
1 and then B and C flipped so it will be

234
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,480
CBA and now just really quickly let me

235
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
just tell you this will work with both

236
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,839
even and odd discs because as you can

237
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,120
see here we have a node that has an odd

238
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,360
number and it's still working over here

239
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,320
it's working fine it's just that I

240
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,000
wanted a slightly bigger um pet um discs

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,839
uh for this example so you can really

242
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,000
see how this tree is formed and if I

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,959
were to choose something like five

244
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,760
however this would just be gigantic so

245
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,279
I'm not going to go so huge as to five

246
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,279
but I want a moderately big uh tree so

247
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,079
that you can really see how it's going

248
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,680
to three how it's going to two how it's

249
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,519
going to one etc

250
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,519
etc okay

251
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,600
continuing now that we've solved this

252
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,600
node's child nodes we don't need to do

253
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,480
it for this one because that's a one

254
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,240
then we can do it for this one however

255
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,519
this

256
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,360
node now this is 2 a BC so 2 - 1 we know

257
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,440
that's one so it's first nodes uh number

258
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,920
of discs should be one then B and C

259
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,120
flipped is CB so AC CB

260
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,600
okay uh then the second node we all know

261
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,040
that this is just going to be uh a one

262
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,959
dis with the exact same Peg set up so

263
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,720
that would be one

264
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,519
ABC uh next the third child node so

265
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,000
let's just do

266
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,560
that now we know 2 - 1 is 1 so that

267
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,680
would mean the number of discs is one

268
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,199
and then A and B flipped is ba a so b a

269
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,000
c meaning this will be the end

270
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,600
result and now we have completed our

271
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,240
tree now basically this is a this is how

272
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,040
you can take it into like consideration

273
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,880
this is a fully grown apple tree now we

274
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,880
need to pick the ripe apples off

275
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,600
essentially and the ripe apples are the

276
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,720
ones with one disc and it has to be done

277
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,440
from most top right down okay just top

278
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,759
right from here down now you may be

279
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,440
wondering wait a minute are these just

280
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,480
the instructions that we're going to

281
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,959
pick off no and you'll see what I

282
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,920
mean so essentially what I'm saying is

283
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,079
whenever you see a one in this

284
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,720
tree and then it's uh discs

285
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,600
these

286
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,880
diss are essentially what we're going to

287
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
take out and put into the

288
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,440
instructions for example 1 a BC will be

289
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,519
taken as a to c by our program and then

290
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,680
given to the user but we can't just take

291
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,519
this in any random order that just

292
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,279
wouldn't work however what we are going

293
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,399
to do is let's just say I get a marker

294
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,880
we see we're going here we have this

295
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,480
initial node

296
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,800
it has its own first node then it has

297
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,279
its own first

298
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,240
node now it has its own first node and

299
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
then it ends here this is the last one

300
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,680
so this is the first uh basically uh

301
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,800
node that I've encountered that has one

302
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,519
dis on it so I can say I can note down

303
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,959
a I can I can put that into my array as

304
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,120
a to

305
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,639
B so I'm going to note that down as a

306
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,199
to B so we got one instruction down now

307
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,480
as you can see we have to go back

308
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
because we cannot go forward that that

309
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,399
would just be nil so we have over here

310
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,199
the second node for this okay so this

311
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,680
node has a second

312
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,800
node this is the second time we've got

313
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
over with a dis with a uh instruction

314
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,920
with one it and we can see it says a to

315
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,360
c so we're going to follow what it says

316
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,399
and move from a

317
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,560
over 2

318
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
C then we're going to go back and we're

319
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,360
going to say okay come down over here

320
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,360
and we see oh third node this also has a

321
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,959
one so it says B to C that means note

322
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,720
down from B to

323
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,440
C

324
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,319
okay now we go back we see oh we checked

325
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:53,240
all these all the child noes for this

326
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,399
node now we have to go back now we see

327
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,959
for this node what's its second child

328
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,279
node because we're done the first oh it

329
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,039
has a one so well we say A to B perfect

330
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,439
note it

331
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,559
down a to

332
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,880
B

333
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,240
perfect now we cannot expand further

334
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
than this again that would just be nail

335
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,240
so we say okay come back over here and

336
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,120
we're done the second child node for

337
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,840
this node so go down

338
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
here

339
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,600
and so from here we have a first

340
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,440
Noe so this is a one and we're going to

341
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,080
say C to a so we just note down C to a

342
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,760
perfect then we go back in the second

343
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,799
node C to B perfect C to

344
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,480
B then we go back and we say oh third

345
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,840
node A to B perfect no put that

346
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,400
down a

347
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,640
to

348
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,720
B come back come back come back because

349
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,400
we are done

350
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,919
basically we've gone into this

351
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,120
node and we've gone into its first node

352
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
and we've completed all of its three

353
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,080
child nodes now we're coming back then

354
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,400
we grab an apple from here then we come

355
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,120
back and we grab all of these three

356
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,960
child nodes and we just noticed just

357
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
like we got all the three child nodes

358
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,280
from this we got it from this node so

359
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,880
now this node is no longer needed by us

360
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,080
so either we can just delete it but why

361
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,720
would you want to delete it when you can

362
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,440
just keep it and go to the next and now

363
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,480
since we are initiating this from this

364
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,799
node we have to look at its second node

365
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,600
which is a one dis and this is a to c so

366
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm going to note that

367
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,720
down a 2

368
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,799
C perfect

369
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,880
there now we're going to look at its

370
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,080
third node which is again a

371
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,679
three now this has a first node which

372
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,840
has its own first node but then that's

373
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,280
the end of the line so that's B to

374
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,799
C again going back oh this has a second

375
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,799
node beat

376
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,960
a now come back this has its own third

377
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,760
node which is c a

378
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
okay which I can just note down

379
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,679
conveniently coming back we see okay

380
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,360
perfect uh we're done the first node and

381
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,679
all its three child nodes now we have to

382
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,840
do the three's second

383
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,159
node uh so uh wait just really quickly

384
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,159
note if you were if you want to if you

385
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:54,000
make this connection from the other part

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,679
one that I just made uh actually Four

387
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,480
discs will require 15 turns because uh

388
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,720
actually 2 to ^ 4 16 - 1 is 15 meaning

389
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,520
it'll take 15 turns uh so that's why I

390
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,440
have exactly 15 elements in this array

391
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,919
over here uh so that we can see if we

392
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,120
have the correct number of moves anyway

393
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
continuing now we've gotten back from

394
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,960
here here here now we're going to the

395
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,559
second node which is B to

396
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,200
C so I can just write that

397
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,520
down B to

398
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,000
next we're going to go to its third node

399
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,720
which has its own first node which is a

400
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
to

401
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,480
B then it has its own second node which

402
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,000
is a to

403
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,919
c then it has its own third node which

404
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,360
is B

405
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,280
Toc now we can go back say back back

406
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,760
back and now once we've returned this to

407
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,840
this initial node we know that we've

408
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,480
gone through all this

409
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,600
tree and that means we have a perfectly

410
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
good set of instructions to solve four

411
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,320
discs in the tower of noo in the minimum

412
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,840
number of moves possible hope you

413
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,720
enjoyed that now what I'm going to do is

414
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,919
I'm going to be taking a picture of this

415
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,080
I'm going to move it onto my Mac and I'm

416
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,760
going to show you that these moves will

417
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,320
actually solve a tower of hanoy game

418
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,039
okay so that was actually pretty much it

419
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,400
for the Whiteboard part of this video I

420
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,559
hope you enjoyed now we're going to be

421
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,840
going to the Mac part where I'm also

422
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,600
going to be showing you an

423
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
implementation of this and Swift hope

424
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,720
you enjoy let's get to it so welcome

425
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,840
back to the Mac part now I'm going to be

426
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,400
cropping this image so we can only see

427
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,440
the instructions then I'm going to be

428
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,520
going to the Tower of Hanoi simulator

429
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,320
online The Flash simulator uh and then

430
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,559
we're just going to be seeing how it

431
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,640
works I'm going to show you the Swift

432
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,840
implementation and then we'll be done

433
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,200
okay so let's get started with uh this

434
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,120
white board image over here make my face

435
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,240
smaller uh come over here and I'm just

436
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,480
going to select these instructions that

437
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,600
we have created on the Whiteboard and in

438
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,000
case you didn't already know this if you

439
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,080
select something in preview and then you

440
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,000
click command K crops that right out

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
okay then I'm going to use l capitan's

442
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,279
Main feature I guess I'm going to press

443
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,159
this down actually I guess I have to

444
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,679
have these uh in small view uh I'm going

445
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,200
to press this down put this over here

446
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,840
put this over here make this a bit

447
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,760
bigger and here we are ready so now as

448
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,679
you can see I have the tower ofy on one

449
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,000
side and then I have the instructions on

450
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,400
the other so again this is for four

451
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,360
discs and let's get started now first of

452
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,080
all it tells us to solve a to B so uh

453
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,960
we're on a to B over here on the first

454
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,760
one so A to B boom then it says a to c

455
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,400
okay I'll do that then it says B to

456
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,480
C then it says A to

457
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,960
B then it's telling you to move from C

458
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,159
to

459
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:12,640
a again as you if you really look at

460
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,080
this pattern and if you watch part one

461
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,880
you realize that we're using the exact

462
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,720
same algorithm it's just the computer

463
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,559
found out these

464
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,080
moved again in case you haven't watched

465
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,520
part one this website is mathisfun.com

466
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,159
that allows me to simulate the Tower of

467
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,559
hooi uh and there's a flash version and

468
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,559
an HTML version The Links will be in the

469
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,080
description

470
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,440
continuing now after we've moved from C

471
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,679
to a we can move from C to

472
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,480
B then from A to B and we've we've

473
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,279
solved the first seven and as you can

474
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,279
see we've moved three diss from A to B

475
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,279
using

476
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,080
C okay now it tells us to move from a to

477
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,159
c

478
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,440
interesting then it says B to C okay

479
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,919
okay I'll do that then it says b to a

480
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,440
okay then C to

481
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,200
a interesting B to C not very surprising

482
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,720
then a to

483
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,279
b a to

484
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,360
c and finally B2

485
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,400
C now that was quite simple and we have

486
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,720
solve the the game in exactly 15 moves

487
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,360
now when I was explaining this to you

488
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,360
you may have realized oh God this is

489
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,159
going to be really expensive to program

490
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,240
and this is just going to be too much

491
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,520
but you're mistaken this is actually

492
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,039
quite simple to actually make it's just

493
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,679
that the implementation of it uh is

494
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,960
really easy just creating a command line

495
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
interface isn't that easy but we'll get

496
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,399
into that later first what we have to

497
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:56,960
get into is the

498
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,200
Noy so as you can see over here this is

499
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
a simple version of an implementation in

500
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,960
Swift as you can see it's very very

501
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,760
little code and if I say uh I want

502
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,840
number of discs as for example three it

503
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,120
gives us the result first of all move a

504
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,720
to c uh or actually you know what let me

505
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,679
just actually follow these steps so a to

506
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,600
c

507
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,720
first just to really quickly show you

508
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,440
this works a to c then it tells us to

509
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,520
move a to B

510
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,200
then it says C to

511
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,840
B then it says a to

512
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,200
c then it says uh B to

513
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,279
a and then it says B to

514
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:51,919
C and then it says a to c and as you can

515
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,559
see we've solved it in seven

516
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,360
moves so that was actually quite simple

517
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,919
uh and that proves that this actually

518
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,760
works we can also do it for

519
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,120
four and it'll give us the instructions

520
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,520
five I think we might need a debug uh

521
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,760
console now uh we can do it for six I'm

522
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,279
just quickly scrolling through these um

523
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,919
see how it

524
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,000
works as you can see it eventually

525
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,559
starts taking uh some time to

526
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,200
calculate uh moves because of course

527
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,279
there are tons of moves for like nine

528
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:30,240
different discs but anyway so now okay

529
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
it got that um there was an earlier

530
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
version of this that I programmed in

531
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,640
that would actually use the first

532
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,799
algorithm that I used in part one and

533
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,600
that could at Max do around five discs

534
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,000
because it was very memory intensive but

535
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,679
this is recursive yet it's not that

536
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,159
memory intensive so as you can see this

537
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,039
is a very efficient algorithm and let's

538
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,559
get straight into coding this now now

539
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,120
first of all this is an implementation

540
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,000
of it in part three I'm going to be

541
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,960
showing you the cui or how to create the

542
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,760
command line interface for

543
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,440
it okay so now let me make my face a bit

544
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,200
bigger and so now I can just uh comment

545
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,159
this line out so we don't have all this

546
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,679
random execution going on and hide the

547
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,440
debug

548
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,039
console so let's get into it by saying

549
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,840
that first of all we are creating a

550
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,600
class called Hanoi node and also a quick

551
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,039
tip uh if you're using a playground

552
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,760
really basic uh functionality like not

553
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,840
even framework functionality just no UI

554
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,520
kit whatsoever or anything you don't

555
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,880
really need to spend excess memory

556
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,480
importing framework or UI kit when you

557
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,440
can just import Darwin and it takes up a

558
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
bit less memory so that's just a quick

559
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,799
tip for you anyway continuing inside of

560
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,159
the Hanoi node class we are noting the

561
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,960
diss from using and two

562
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,240
pegs so basically uh when I would show

563
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,440
you uh over here on preview if I just

564
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,720
control command Z that uh each one of

565
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,600
these was a node this was a node this

566
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,960
was a node this was a node it had a

567
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,559
diss

568
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,120
from Two and using

569
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,519
value which were the pegs that it was

570
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,960
from using in

571
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,320
two and so now these are stored as

572
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,039
strings because of course you can name

573
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,600
your

574
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,600
pegs then what we're doing is we we have

575
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,559
three computed properties in case you

576
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,679
don't know what a computed property is

577
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:35,600
well uh I do have another tutorial with

578
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,320
my AAR pathfinding that will explain

579
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,039
that but anyway let me just give a quick

580
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,000
explanation but if you are wondering

581
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
what a star pathfinding is a link will

582
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,919
be in the description for sure okay so

583
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,679
basically computed property will allow

584
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,880
you to it's just a variable but when you

585
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,760
get it the propert the value inside of

586
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,559
this property is computed each time uh

587
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,000
so for example uh let's say I created um

588
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,360
a variable a which is equal to something

589
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,320
the user can enter and variable B which

590
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,480
is also something the user can enter

591
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,360
variable C if it was a computed property

592
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,039
whenever you would get it it would

593
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:14,279
automatically already be equal to the

594
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:18,159
value of a plus b that's simple so that

595
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,760
you don't need to calculate it then use

596
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,120
it no just use it straight up and it

597
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,120
gets calculated like a function but it

598
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,799
has some limitations like it can't take

599
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,120
parameters it's that simple okay

600
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,440
continuing so

601
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,840
now we have Leaf one leaf 2 and leaf

602
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,159
three which themselves are Hanoi nodes

603
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,120
now you may be thinking if a Hanoi node

604
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,360
contains a variable of a Hanoi node and

605
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,240
that itself has more Hanoi nodes doesn't

606
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
that just break my own rule of the

607
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,760
barrier recursion that I talked about in

608
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,559
my other recursion video which there

609
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,799
will be a link to in the

610
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,360
description well no because this is

611
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,840
optional meaning at any time I can make

612
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,120
this nil meaning there will be nothing

613
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,600
after that that also means that I was

614
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,519
lying to you a few minutes ago not lying

615
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,960
just I'm sorry but uh as you can see

616
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,799
whenever you have one on the board the

617
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,559
tree doesn't just end there there's

618
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,360
actually a nil after this but you

619
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,679
usually ignore that due to the fact that

620
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:21,440
it's just nil doesn't matter it's just

621
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,399
nil I guess uh and same thing for all

622
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,840
these ones there's a nil after this

623
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,760
there's a nil after this there's a nil

624
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,120
after all of these because it can't just

625
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,640
abruptly end it can't just stop at a

626
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,600
Hanoi node that's impossible so that's

627
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,360
just a quick uh explanation of that for

628
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,720
you anyway continuing now when you get

629
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,080
Leaf one we are creating a new Final

630
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,440
constant which is equal to a new Hanoi

631
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,399
node which is the discs of this Hanoi

632
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,919
node are equal to our diss minus one the

633
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,080
current diss minus one the from value

634
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,519
will be same from but we're swapping the

635
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,000
using Peg and the two Peg uh so we're

636
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,639
for the using we're giving two and for

637
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,399
two we're giving using that

638
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,600
simple next we are returning uh then

639
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,760
we're using a quick uh conditional uh

640
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,440
we're checking if final do diss greater

641
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,399
than zero meaning it is one or something

642
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,399
bigger than

643
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,080
one then we on to return that final

644
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,880
variable meaning continue good job or

645
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,159
else nil because we do not want an

646
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,440
endless loop of

647
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,760
recursion next in leaf two we're doing

648
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,679
the same thing with the optional Hanoi

649
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:44,679
node we're still creating the final

650
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:47,840
constant however this time for the diss

651
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
we're just straight up giving one

652
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,480
because we I taught that to you in the

653
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,679
trees uh then we are keeping from using

654
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,120
into two the exact same then we're doing

655
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,000
exact same thing with the discs however

656
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,880
instead of checking finals discs because

657
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,960
we know that's going to be one we're

658
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,760
checking our own discs so that we can

659
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,159
see uh if we should actually uh continue

660
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:10,960
and create this

661
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
node finally Leaf three in which we are

662
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,200
still creating finyl we are putting the

663
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,159
diss minus one however we are swapping

664
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:22,720
from and using and we're keeping two the

665
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,120
same then we're just check then we're

666
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,279
just checking if the final discs are

667
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,000
greater than Z Z if so then return final

668
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,840
or else

669
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,919
no then we just have a really quick

670
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,720
initializer for this class which takes

671
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,840
the diss from using and two and sets the

672
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,279
values to them that was quick then we

673
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:45,880
have a global variable named ins or

674
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,600
instructions uh which is a string array

675
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,120
then we have a Hanoi function now simply

676
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,159
put this function is going to do all the

677
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,960
dirty work for us it's going to to

678
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,159
create the Hanoi node class go through

679
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,240
the tree and basically grab all the

680
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,360
values it'll pick all the

681
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,840
apples and so this function will take

682
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,120
the diss the name of the peg a the name

683
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,120
of Peg B and the name of Peg

684
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,559
C then we are creating a starting Leaf a

685
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,480
constant we are creating a hanoy node in

686
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,720
this of course we're setting the diss to

687
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,120
the dis that the user gave us in the

688
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,919
function declar ation from as a using as

689
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,960
B and to as C of

690
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,720
course then what we're doing is we're

691
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,480
checking if let L1 is equal to leaf.

692
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,919
Leaf one meaning does this Leaf have

693
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,960
Leaf one if it does then say if L1 do

694
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,760
diss is equal to

695
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,360
one what what's happening now is we're

696
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,919
checking is this ripe essentially uh if

697
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:00,960
it is tick it or else call yourself on

698
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,760
this

699
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,440
Leaf I'll explain what that means

700
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,440
now meaning if the discs are one then

701
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,760
just take this instruction and append it

702
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,560
into our instructions

703
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,879
array as Leaf one from then Leaf one to

704
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,240
so if it were to say a one ABC meaning

705
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,800
one disc from a to c it would actually

706
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,879
just depend AC into to the

707
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:34,919
array or else if it's actually a um real

708
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:39,520
U uh dis if it's the you call it if it's

709
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,000
not one it's two or three or something

710
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,079
greater than one then we're just going

711
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,839
to call ourself on diss minus

712
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,639
one with the same from using and two

713
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,640
values that we got from this

714
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,680
leaf then we do the exact same thing for

715
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
leaf two and the exact same thing for

716
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,160
leaf three no difference whatsoever

717
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,359
except that in leaf two if uh the discs

718
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,599
are not one then we call ourself with

719
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,560
diss minus one and a is just a b is just

720
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,560
B and C is just C it'll eventually stop

721
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,960
we know that

722
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,960
okay now this function works but it

723
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,920
isn't too convenient to code in this is

724
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,440
due to the fact that you need to give it

725
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,839
the discs the a value the B value and

726
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,800
the C value and it doesn't return

727
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,920
anything now order to fix that I've

728
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,280
actually created another function called

729
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,520
Hanoi just straight up Hanoi not Hanoi

730
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,280
underscore and so what's happening is

731
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,200
this uh function only takes uh the diss

732
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,440
as an integer and returns an array of

733
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,800
strings or the

734
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,480
instructions then we just call Hanoi on

735
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,800
the discs that you gave us with the the

736
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,440
a peg named a the bpeg named B and the

737
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,920
cpeg named C then we just return those

738
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,200
instructions that uh are created uh once

739
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,760
uh you use the Hanoi function and then

740
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,000
as you can see if I just fill this in

741
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,599
with let's say three

742
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,200
diss it worked and that was actually all

743
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
it for part two I hope you enjoyed if

744
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,560

and yeah that's going to be it for this

754
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,079
video again part three is coming out

755
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,280
really soon and part three will have how

756
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,000
to create a little simple uh cui not GUI

757
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,880
command user interface not um graphical

758
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,800
user interface for this program and

759
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,440
that's going to be it for this video

760
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,440
goodbye
