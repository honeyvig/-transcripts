Learners say about us learning is
growing and we not only decided to grow
together in life but learn and succeed
together as well I successful
and I was able to grab new opportunities
in my current organization and also
receive a 10 salary hike hey I am
swamijit Basu I am a senior QA engineer
at Encore Inc and I am shomi and I work
as a senior quality Analyst at
doodleblue Innovations we started our
upskilling journey together which simply
learned and certainly we made the right
choice after our marriage I had to
relocate to Bangalore and take a year
Gap after working 45 years but I decided
to restart my career again and make a
switch to software domain so I enrolled
myself in full stack Java developer
program from Simply learn seeing my
wife's passion for learning every day
inspired me to take up a course on
simply learn as well I've always been
passionate about technology and learning
devops was always in my bucket list when
I saw simply learns collaboration with
Caltech ctme I decided to take a course
on PG devops after the course I not only
switched my career to full star Java
development with a 15 is an increment in
the salary but now also I can work from
home since it's a software domain and
being the new mom that's the best thing
one could ask for to spend time with
little one during these early years
for me learning devops was fun and
fulfilling at the same time earlier I
had to rely on others at work but after
upskilling myself I single-handedly can
set up the entire blueprint on my code
base alone and get the desired output
and because of that I could grab new
projects in my organization with a 10
percent salary high we enrolled to
upscale ourselves when we were expecting
our first child so upscaling Journey
with simply learn would be undoubtedly
very special to both of us while doing
the course we did come across a lot of
challenges due to the pregnancy but my
wife show me was a great inspiration for
me as she was handling it all together
and she kept motivating and inspiring me
all the way moreover the recorded
classes and the weekend class helped us
maintain the balance between work and
learning apart from work we love to
spend time with our little one learning
with simply learn was quite a fulfilling
experience for both of us we believe
that growth doesn't happen overnight
rather it's a journey of several
monsters and upskilling is one of them
so without further Ado let's get started
what is typescript
typescript is object oriented and
strongly typed programming language
which is superset of JavaScript
typescript code is converted to
JavaScript which can be executed
anywhere JavaScript is supported in a
browser or node.js and any other
application
script was designed by Anders hygelsberg
at Microsoft the limitations of
JavaScript for the development of large
scale application at the Microsoft and
among its external customers led to the
creation of typescript due to the
difficulty of working with the
complicated JavaScript code there was
demand for custom tooling to make
developing JavaScript components easier
typescript is Javascript with some
additional features to support a strong
interaction with your editor typescript
adds additional syntax to JavaScript
typescript is a scripting language that
understands JavaScript and uses type
inference to provide powerful
capabilities without the need for
additional code
why typescript compilation JavaScript is
an interpreted language there is no need
to compile it as a result it must be run
to ensure that it is genuine if there is
an error that implies you write all the
code to find out an output as a result
you will have to spend hours looking for
the faults in the code so error checking
is provided via the typescript
transpiler if typescript detects any
syntax mistakes it will compile the code
and generate compilation errors this
AIDS in the detection of mistakes prior
to the execution of the script
typescript provides an optional type
system for JavaScript code when a client
doesn't have a value for a parameter he
can pass a null optional arguments or
features of typescript we can declare
some arguments in the function optional
by utilizing optional parameter features
so that the client is not necessary to
supply a value to optional parameters
strong static typing JavaScript does not
have a powerful static typing system
does the TLs typescript comes with an
optional static typing and type
inference system the TLs that is a
typescript language service can deduce
the type of variable defined with node
type based on its value
supports object-oriented programming
such as classes interfaces inheritance
and other object oriented programming
principles are supported by typescript
typescript supports type definitions
existing JavaScript libraries can use
typescript type definitions external
Javascript libraries are defined in
typescript definition files as a result
these libraries can be included in
typescript code
now let us look at the difference
between typescript versus JavaScript
typescript is an object oriented
programming language whereas JavaScript
is a scripting language
and typescript supports static typing
whereas JavaScript does not support
static typing
errors can be found and corrected during
compile time in JavaScript errors can be
found only during the runtime as it is
an interpreted language
there is a concept for ES3 ES4 es5 and
as6 in typescript whereas no support for
compiling additional ES3 ES4 es5 or as6
features in JavaScript
functions can have optional parameters
in typescript whereas this feature is
not possible in JavaScript
converted into JavaScript code to be
understandable for browsers in
typescript in JavaScript this can
directly be used in browsers
in typescript proper build setup is
required for static type definitions no
build setup is required in JavaScript
now let us look at the features of
typescript
typescript supports other JavaScript
libraries typescript is a new Microsoft
language that is highly typed superset
of JavaScript with support for object
oriented programming and other current
features like decorators
because browsers and nodes comprehend
JavaScript typescript compiles to
JavaScript
typescript is portable typescript is
cross browser cross device and cross
platform it can run in any environment
that supports JavaScript typescript
unlike its competitors does not require
dedicated virtual machine or a specific
runtime environment to run typescript is
superset of JavaScript
it's a strong syntactical superset of
JavaScript with the addition of optional
static typing typescript is a large
scale application development language
that transcompiles to JavaScript
typescript is static and typescript is
object oriented language
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can personal optional
arguments are a feature of typescript
when it comes to object oriented
programming with JavaScript JavaScript
shines because of the class keyword it
makes object oriented programming look
quite similar to programming in other
object oriented languages like c-sharp
or Java
applications of typescript
typescript can be used to develop
JavaScript applications for both
client-side and server side execution
typescript can be deployed instead of
JavaScript language since it adds more
features and gives error directly with
the code
typescript is used for building large
scale application for Enterprises
advantages of typescript
highlights error at the compilation time
during the time of development
in typescript it runs on any browser or
JavaScript engine
typescript has a namespace concept by
defining a module
typescript supports strongly typed or
static typing
disadvantages of typescript
typescript takes a long time to compile
the code
typescript does not support abstract
classes
typescript has extra compilation step
for converting typescript into
JavaScript typescript has an overly
complicated typing system
consider the postgraduate program by
Caltech in full stack web development
and master those necessary skills which
simply runs full course you will dive
into the world of game changing language
that combines the best of JavaScript
with powerful static typing in this
immersive learning experience you will
be guided by industry experts who will
unravel the mystery of typescript
through interactive live sessions you
will get Hands-On practice with real
world projects sharpen your skills and
gain the confidence to tackle any coding
challenge that comes on your way but it
doesn't stop there our live master class
is led by instructors will expose you to
advanced concepts and Industry best
practices you will gain insights into
building scalable and maintainable
applications ensuring your code is
reversed and future proof
setting up development environment
firstly we need to go to node.js
official website and install node.js
after installing go to command prompt
and type the function node space hyphen
V to check if the node is installed
properly
to install typescript run the command
npm node package manager install
globally typescript in the command
prompt and this will install typescript
so let's jump to the browser and see the
installation of dole.js and typescript
then we will go to visual studio and see
the different components like Loops
variables data types with examples
choose from over 300 in-demand skills
and get access to 1000 plus hours of
video content for free visit skillup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more so to install
node.js come to the website
nodejs.org here come to the downloads
and from here you can install node.js
node is an open source server side
execution platform for JavaScript code
no it is commonly used for real-time
applications like chat news feeds and
web push notifications because it allows
for a persistent connection from browser
to the server
node.js is a JavaScript runtime based on
V8 JavaScript engine from chrome
node.js is an asynchronous event driven
JavaScript runtime for building scalable
Network applications
to install for Windows click on Windows
if you have Mac OS click on Mac OS to
install
so I'll click on Windows here we go
node.js is getting installed since I
have already installed in my device I'll
cancel it
so once the installation is complete and
you have installed the node.js next go
to command prompt
in the command prompt run the command
node
hyphen V to check if whether theme
node.js is installed properly
and here it shows the version of node.js
installed in our device
so here we can see that node is
installed properly next we need to
install typescript
to install typescript we need to run the
command npm node package manager install
hyphen G globally typescript
if you run this command the typescript
will be installed
the typescript will be installed
worldwide with this command this implies
that each project you create on your
computer can use typescript dependencies
without having to reinstall the
typescript package
so after running this the typescript
will be installed since I have already
installed I'll clear this
so after installing typescript to check
if whether the typescript is installed
properly
to check if the compiler is installed
just type DSC typescript compiler space
hyphen version
and here you can see the typescript
compiler of version 4.5.4 is installed
now that we know how to install node.js
and typescript now we will go to visual
studio and see the examples
so let us see the different types of
variables available in typescript so for
variable declaration typescript follows
the same rules as JavaScript variables
can be declared with the commands like
variables
or we have let
and we have constant const
so these are the three types of variable
declarations available in typescript
we'll see them one by one
variables can be declared in typescript
using the VAR keyword just like in
JavaScript the scoping rules are
identical to those in JavaScript
for example we can declare a variable
of parameter age
and it is of the type number
which is equal to say 45 Something Like
This
and similarly we have
let
so let is a ecmascript 6 introduced to
new types of variable declarations in
JavaScript using the keyword let and
const to solve the issues with variable
declarations
these additional sorts of variable
declarations are also supported by
typescript which is a superset of
JavaScript
for example we have let's say employee
name
is equal to John
similarly we have constant
constant variables are declared in the
same way as variable and let variables
are constant transforms available into a
constant whose value cannot be changed
the same scoping constraints apply to
constant variable as they do to the let
variables
for example we have constant
num
is equal to
100.
something like this
next we will look at the different data
types in typescript
we have different data types like number
string Boolean array
Etc
so number first we look at the number
just like JavaScript typescript Supports
number data type
all numbers are stored as floating Point
numbers these numbers can be a decimal
hexadecimal
for example
say let first
number
one two three
so
let's again
foreign
number
is equal to this is of the type now we
will write octal
and don't forget to put colon otherwise
it will show an error
let fourth
now we'll declare the number of type
say binary
so typescript Supports number data types
like the numbers can be stored in
floating Point numbers or decimal or
hexadecimal octal or binary so this is
basically a number
and this is
hexadecimal
[Music]
this is Octon
and this is binary these are the
different number methods in typescript
the method two exponential Returns the
exponential notation instant format two
fixed Returns the fixed Point notation
instance format
to locate string converts the number
into a local specific representation of
the number
two precession returns a sting
representation in exponential or fixed
point to be specified precision
to string returns listing representation
of the number in the specified base and
value of returns A Primitive value of
the number next we have string then the
data type which we have is string string
is an another primitive data type that
is used to store Text data string values
are surrounded by single quotation marks
or double quotation mark
for example
if we say declare it let employ
name
string of the type string
is equal to
Johnson
so this is of the type string
the different string Methods in
typescript are
method character act returns a character
at the given index concatenate returns a
combination of two or more specified
strings index of returns an index of
first occurrence of this specified
substring from a string and minus 1 if
not found
the method replace replaces the matched
substring with a new substring
in the method split split the string
into substrings and returns an array
two uppercase converts all the
characters of the string into uppercase
to lower case converts all the
characters of the string into the lower
case
the next type which we have is Boolean
Boolean values are supported by both
JavaScript and typescript and stored as
true or false
example for booleanese say let
here note that the Boolean with small B
is different from the Boolean capital B
so the uppercase Boolean is an object
type whereas the lowercase Boolean is a
primitive type
it is always recommended to use the
Primitive type Boolean that is a
lowercase Boolean in the code because
for JavaScript courses an object to its
primitive type the typescript type
system does not the typescript treats it
like any object type the another data
type is of the type array an array is a
special type of data type which can
store multiple values of different data
types sequentially using a special
syntax
typescript supports array similar to
JavaScript there are two ways to declare
an array One is using the square
brackets and the other is using a
generic array type
example
this is one type to declare with the
square brackets
and the other type is to use the generic
array type
both methods produce the same output
arrays can contain elements of any data
types numbers things or even objects
arrays can be declared and initialized
separately these are the different array
methods in typescript
we have pop that removes the last
element of the array and returns that
element and push adds the new elements
to the array and Returns the new array
length sort sorts all the elements of
the array and similarly we have concat
index of copy within fill shift splice
and shift includes join
last index of if it Returns the last
index of the element in an array
similarly we have slice to string
and to locate string similarly we have
Tuple Union any word and never as the
data types in typescript next we will
look at the if statement in typescript
and if statement can include one or more
Expressions which return Boolean if the
Boolean expression evaluates should
prove a set of statements is then
executed and in if else condition an if
else condition includes two blocks if
block and an else block if the if
condition evaluates to true then the if
block is executed otherwise the else
block is executed
and we also have else if so the lcf
statement can be used for if statement
next we will see Loops in typescript
typescript supports for Loop the for
Loop is used to execute a block of code
a given number of times which is
specified by a condition
so this is the fourth Loop
the first expression is executed before
the for Loop starts and the second
expression is the condition for the loop
to execute and the third expression is
executed after the execution of every
code block here in this example I is
equal to 0 declares and initializes a
variable the second condition I is less
than 3 checks whether the value of I is
less than 3 or not if it is less then it
exits a loop the third statement
increases the value of I by 1. this Loop
will execute the block 3 times until the
value of I becomes 3. now that we have
seen Loops we'll see the functions in
typescript functions are the primary
blocks of any program functions are the
most important part since it is a
functional programming language it
functions we can implement the concepts
of oops like classes objects
polymorphism and abstraction functions
ensure that the program is maintainable
and reusable and organ organized into
readable blocks while typescript
provides the concept of classes and
module functions still are integral part
of the language for example we have
function
sum
so this is the example of function
classes in typescript now let us look at
the classes in typescript
so in object oriented programming
classes are fundamental entities used to
create reusable components typescript
has been primarily a functional
programming language where inheritance
is prototype based functions are used to
build reusable components let us see an
example for the classes
employee name
so we'll create a class employee
and provide employee
ID
employee name
foreign
script compiler
will convert the class to the JavaScript
code using the closure
and the Constructor is a special type of
method which is called when creating an
object in typescript the construction
method is always defined with the name
Constructor
so in this example the employee class
includes a Constructor with the
parameter employee ID
in the Constructor members of the class
can be accessed using this keyword
example this dot employee ID
it is not necessary for every class to
have a Constructor
first up what is Javascript
now JavaScript is a powerful client-side
scripting language
it is mainly used for enhancing the
interaction of a user with the web page
in other words you can make your web
page more lively and interactive with
the help of this language
JavaScript is also being used widely in
game development web development server
development and Robotics among others so
talking about why JavaScript is being
used first up is that it's open source
next as discussed earlier it has
excellent user interaction
meaning the scripts are basically
written in HTML pages and are executed
automatically with embedded JavaScript
also JavaScript offers a wide range of
libraries and Frameworks some popular
ones are react angular view.js among
others
and some other key features of
JavaScript include excellent speed
cross browser compatibility that is
Javascript code runs on all browsers
like Google Chrome Firefox Safari you
name it
and lastly simple things are done simply
it offers simple semantics allowing a
seamless developer experience
then what exactly is typescript
now typescript is an object oriented
programming language which is a superset
of JavaScript
it's basically JavaScript with other
impressive additional features
all the code written in typescript gets
compiled to JavaScript ultimately
now let's look at some of the key
features of typescript that make you
want to use it
firstly it's a superset of JavaScript as
mentioned earlier typescript is a super
set of JavaScript
now it supports all JavaScript libraries
and apis in fact angular which is a
JavaScript framework that is used to
build single page applications is
completely written in typescript
now typescript uses object oriented
programming Concepts with the increase
in code complexity JavaScript had to
fulfill the requirements of object
oriented programming hence typescript
was introduced to bridge the gap
typescript helps with quicker code
development thus improving performance
and lastly as mentioned earlier it adds
several additional features to
JavaScript making coding excessively
easy
now let's look at some of the advantages
of typescript over JavaScript
typescript always points out the
compilation errors at the time of
development
now because of this at the run time the
chances of getting errors are very less
however in case of JavaScript it's an
interpreted language and all errors are
shown during runtime
next type script supports static typing
this means that all the variables that
are used in your program are basically
known during compile time
now since this feature is used it leads
to better code completion type checking
tooling and refactoring
as mentioned earlier typescript adds a
lot of features to JavaScript right so
typescript adds features like interfaces
generics namespaces null checking and
access modifiers
and lastly it provides excellent tooling
with intellisense which provides active
hints as the code is typed
moving ahead I'm sure you must have
gathered the differences between the two
languages however let me just brief them
up for you
for sleep typescript is object oriented
language while JavaScript is a
client-side scripting language
now typescript supports strongly typed
and static typing feature while
JavaScript does not support it
in case of typescript errors are
highlighted at the time of development
making it easier for codes to run
however JavaScript makes sure that it
highlights errors at run time
now typescript code is always converted
to JavaScript and then run on browsers
while JavaScript directly runs on
browsers
now typescript supports prototyping
while JavaScript does not support
prototyping
lastly as mentioned typescript supports
modules generics namespaces access
modifiers Etc
while JavaScript does not support these
features
so lastly which one should you choose
now what are the developers around the
world using
according to Google Trends
growth in typescript has plateaued in
the last 12 months while JavaScript
still has a large user base so with that
you can gather that a lot of developers
out there prefer JavaScript over
typescript but if you wonder which one
suits you better
well if you're an experienced developer
and work on smaller projects then
JavaScript is ideal
but if you prefer a statically typed
language and you are working on a new
library or a framework or if you're
working in a big project with multiple
Developers
then typescript would be a better option

what is typescript generics
typescript generics is a tool for
creating reusable components in
typescript
rather than working with a single data
type it builds a component that can
interact with various data kinds it
enables users to consume these
components while also using their own
kinds
generics ensure that the software is
both adaptable and scalable over time
safety is provided via generics without
sacrificing performance or efficiency
the type variable in typescript is used
to denote types and uses generics
generic functions have the same type as
non-generic functions with type argument
specified first as in function
declarations
why use typescript generics
consider the below code without generics
the identity function is a function that
returns whatever is sent in as a
parameter we could either provide the
identity function with a specific type
or identity function with any type
while the use of any is generic when we
use any the function accepts any kind
for the type of argument as a result
when function returns we lose
information about what the type was the
only information we have is that any
type could be produced if we pass in a
string
we need the means to capture the
argument type in such a way that we can
use it to signify what is been returned
as well we will utilize a type variable
here which is a form of variable that
deals with types rather than values
the identity function now has a type
variable called type this type allows us
to capture the type of data the user
supplies for example a number or a
string so that we can use it later we
are going to utilize the type as a
return type once more
we can use two methods to invoke generic
identity function after writing it one
method is to pass all the parameters to
the function including the type argument
the other method is to utilize type
argument inference
now let us look at the typescript
generic types
generic functions have the same type
parameters as non-genetic functions with
the type parameters listed first as in
the function declarations
we can call the generic type parameter
in the type by whatever name we like as
long as the number of type variables and
how they have utilized match the generic
type can also be written as a call
Signature of an object literal type
typescript generic classes
a generic class resembles a generic
interface in appearance
following the name of class generic
classes contain a generic type parameter
list enclosed in angular brackets
although this is relatively literal use
of the generic number class you will
notice that nothing restricts it to
using only the number type instead we
may have used string or even more
complicated objects
a Class Type has two sides a static side
and an instant site generic classes are
only generic on the instant side not on
the static side hence static members
can't use the glass type parameters
while working with them
although this is relatively literal use
of the generic number class you will
notice that nothing restricts it to
using only the number type instead we
may have used string or even more
complicated objects putting the type
parameter on the class itself like the
interface ensures that all of the
classes property functions with the same
type
typescript generic constraints
typescript generic types allow you to
work with any data type we can however
use constraints to limit it to a
specific types
a type parameter can be declared that is
limited by another type parameter for
instance in this case we would like to
retrieve a property from an object based
on its name we will put a constraint
between two types to ensure that we are
not obtaining a property that does not
exist on the object
now let us jump into Visual Studio code
and understand typescript generics more
better so here we are in Visual Studio
code the prerequisite is we need to
install node.js and we need to install
typescript
so let's get started
let's call a function
identity
identity function is a function that
returns whatever is sent in as a
parameter we could either provide the
identity function with a specific type
or with any type
so this is the identity function with
specific type so if we had to write the
same in the identity function with the
specific type so what we'll do
we'll write it with the specific type
so to write it with any type what we
have to do is we'll write any
in place of string
so while the use of any is generic when
we use any the function accepts any kind
of the type of the argument as a result
when the function returns we lose the
information about what that type was the
only information we have is that any
type could have produced if we pass in a
string
so we are passing of the type string
here and maybe we can pass this type as
number as well instead of string so I
can make this function generic by
passing the type any but this will lose
information about what type was passed
so for that we need the means to capture
the argument type in such a way that we
can use it to signify what is been
returned as well so we will utilize a
type variable here which is of the form
variable that deals with the types
rather than the values
so for that we will write the code as it
will create a function
identity
so here the identity function now has a
type variable called the type
this type allows us to capture the type
of data the user supplies for example a
number or a string so that we can use it
later we are going to utilize a type as
a return type once more so we can use
one of the two methods to invoke the
generic identity function after writing
it
so I have written a few lines of code
with generic type function
so here I have written a few lines of
code in this example the type variable T
is specified with the function in the
angle brackets get array so the type
variability also is used to specify the
type of the arguments and then return
the value this means that the data type
which will be specified at the time of a
function call will also be the data type
of the arguments and of the written
value
so we call generic function get array
and the pass numbers array the strings
array for example calling the function
as get array number and we have passed
the numbers as 16 and decimal number 2.0
and 55.
this will replace t with the number and
so the type of the arguments and the
return value will be the number array in
the same way forget array string we have
passed the values as hello world the
type arguments and the return value will
be a string array so now the compiler
will show an error if you try to add a
string in number array or a number in
string array thus we get the type
checking advantage
so it is not recommended but we can also
call a generic function without
specifying the type variable the
compiler will use the inference to set
the value of t on the function based on
the data type of the argument values
now let us run this code and check
so let us go to the terminal and let us
first run the command
typescript.cmd and the file name type.ts
enter
now let us run the file node type.js
and here we go
it's showing the number array as
1.5 to 36 and 400 we have pushed two new
values one for the number array it is
value 400 and for the string array hello
typescript
what is react
react is a JavaScript library for
creating user interfaces that is
declarative efficient and customizable
react allows to build complicated user
interfaces out of components which are
small independent pieces of code
react was first open sourced in 2013 By
Facebook and has since become one of the
most popular libraries in the front-end
world
with Frameworks like Redux react can
simply be extended to integrate
functionality like routing and State
Management patterns
features of react
react is an open source library and is
developed by Facebook
react apps are fast flexible modular and
scalable
react is powerful JavaScript libraries
that creates interactive interfaces
popular libraries of react are Redux
material design and chest Redux helps
manage state in JavaScript deducts is
the most popular of all react libraries
because it easily tracks the state as
the application size grows
react has a robust developer community
and variety of libraries
the ACT is declarative and component
based declarative views make the react
code more predictable and easier to
debug
and react is component based that is
react letters built encapsulated
components that manage their own State
and compose them to make complex uis
advantages of using typescript with
react
in a react project typescript allows us
to write HTML code directly typescript
delivers Superior intellisense and code
completion for jsx when used with react
JavaScript XM is abbreviated as jsx
when using Ides like Visual Studio
Visual Studio code Autumn webstorm
eclipse and others typescript comes in
handy this allow better development by
improving autocomplete and snippet
generation
foreign
typescript has code that is easy to read
and understand
typescript is statically typed language
the distinction between statically and
dynamically typed programming languages
is when type checking occurs variables
in static language are type checked
while creating react tab complex type
definitions can be defined as interfaces
in typescript this is useful when you
wish to use a complex type in the
application such as an object with
multiple properties
Microsoft supports typescript an open
source programming language
millions of developers all over the
world enjoy and use it this implies that
if you get stuck while learning or using
typescript you can easily obtain help
and answers on the community portal
we can integrate typescript into our
existing react projects for this we can
configure the typescript compiler
installing and configuring typescript
and react
okay before we install typescript we
need to install node.js
go to the node.js official website and
you can install node.js from there once
you install node.js go to the command
prompt and run this command npm install
hyphen G typescript
this command is used to install
typescript globally
once you have installed typescript to
check if the typescript is installed
properly run the command TSC typescript
compiler
hyphen V to check the version of the
typescript compiler
next we need to install react for
installing react and creating a react
project go to the command prompt and run
this command
npx create react app this command will
create a simple folder structure of the
application then install all the
necessary modules and get the project up
and running for you first of all we need
to install node.js to install node.js go
to the official website of node
nodejs.org
go to the downloads in downloads here
you can install the node.js if you have
Windows if you have Mac OS you can
install it from here so I have windows
so I'll install Windows since I have
already installed so I'll cancel it so
once you have installed node.js then go
to the command prompt
in command prompt we need to install the
typescript to install the typescript run
the command npm that is not package
manager installed
hyphen g g stands for installing
globally
and then types
what this command does is it installs it
typescript globally
run this command once you run this
command the typescript will be installed
since I have already installed
typescript I'll cancel it so after you
have installed typescript to check if
the typescript is installed properly run
the command typescript compiler TSC
space
hyphen hyphen B
and press enter
and this will show the version
and this will show the version of the
typescript installed so I have version
4.5.4 installed in my device
so after this to get started with the
project after successful installation of
node.js and typescript
let us create a new folder to create a
new folder type the command make
directory
and we'll name the folder as typescript
hyphen
react
so enter
so we have created the new folder next
we'll change the directory to the folder
which we created so CD
to
TS react
so after this we need to initiate the
project so to initiate the project we
will run the command npm
init
it is asking for a package name just
click enter
and
click enter
then is this okay click s
after this what we need to do is create
react app
so to create react app run the command
npx
space create
reactor
and enter
so this command will create a simple
folder structure for your application
and then install all the necessary
modules and get your project up and
running for you
so this is the project folder which I
have already created
I have DBS code folder wherein I have
settings.json file in this then I have
installed all the node modules
then I have the source folder
in Source folder I have app.tsx file
counter.asx
index.html declarations
index.tx file
to install webpack just run the command
npm install webpack
space webpack hypher CLI indic terminal
this will install the webpack
so I'll show you a simple hello world or
hello everyone program
so in app.dsx
we'll just type hello everyone
and will give the color as green and
align the text at the center input since
we have imported the counter
file so in counter file will just type
in subscribe to Simply learn with text
align in the center and with the color
red
so we'll just run this
here we go we have the message hello
everyone and subscribe to Simply
what is node.js
node.js is an open source server-side
execution platform for JavaScript code
node.js is a JavaScript runtime based on
the version 8 JavaScript engine from
chrome
node is an asynchronous event driven
JavaScript runtime for building scalable
Network applications
although node.js is excellent for
developing server side apps it lacks
several current features such as type
checking it can also be difficult to
manage a node.js code base
node is commonly used for real-time
applications like chat news feeds and
web push notifications because it allows
for a persistent connection from the
browser to the server
the current coding methods such as
static typing and type checking are
supported by typescript
it's designed to create complex and high
level applications that's why having
typescript as a primary language for
supporting node.js capabilities would be
idle
this also allows us to develop
server-side apps with rigorous type
checking avoiding run type errors and
other typescript benefits while
maximizing node.js capabilities
consider the postgraduate program by
Caltech in full stack web development

that combines the best of JavaScript
with powerful static typing in this
immersive learning experience you will
be guided by industry experts who will

classes led by instructors will expose
you to advanced concepts and Industry
best practices you will gain insights
into building scalable and maintainable
applications ensuring your code is
reversed and future proof
now let us see how to set up the
development environment for typescript
with node.js
the prerequisites are we need to have
typescript installed in our device and
node.js
to install node.js go to the official
website
go to node.js.org and go to downloads so
here you can see
we have node.js for different browsers
for Windows Mac OS and source code
so go to Windows if you have Windows PC
and click on install
click on Windows and here you can see it
is getting installed since I have
already installed in my device I'll
cancel it
so once you have installed go to the
command prompt
and just enter
node.v to check if node is installed
properly
so here you can see the node is
installed in my system
to install typescript just run the
command npm
node package manager
install
globally
typescript
run this command and typescript will be
installed since I have already installed
typescript in my device
to cancel this so once you have
installed typescript to check if
typescript is installed or not to see if
the compiler is installed just run the
command
typescript compiler space
version
here you can see it will show the
version of typescript compiler
so now that we have installed both
typescript and node.js let's see
example program for typescript with
node.js
so let's jump into Visual Studio code
one more prerequisite is we need to have
Visual Studio code installed
so create a new folder and create a new
project
so we'll run an example program we'll
create a function
we'll write a program to add two numbers
so sum
number one
comma number two
will return number one and number two
console.log
will call the function sum
and will provide the arguments
so we'll provide the value
9 comma
5.
so let's save
and run this program
first we'll run
typescript.cmd type dot TS command
then we'll hit
then we'll run node and the file name
here you can see it's showing the value
showing the output as 49 plus 5 the sum
of 9 plus 5 is 14. so we'll delete this
and
write another program
to show a Hello message or a welcome
message
so we'll create a function
we'll name the function as welcome
message
and will return
let user
is equal to
simply learn
control log
will call the function welcome
and pass
so here we go we'll save this and check
whether we have an error
foreign
welcome to Simply learn
what is express.js
express.js is a node.js web application
framework that is free and open source
it is used to quickly and easily design
and create web apps web applications are
applications that can be run through a
web browser because express.js simply
requires JavaScript programmers and
developers May create web applications
and apis with little effort
created Express which is now maintained
by node.js and several open source
contributors
to construct our applications Express
provides a simple interface it gives us
the resources we need to create our app
it's adaptable because there are a lot
more modules on npm that can be directly
integrated into Express
let us look at some of the features of
express.js
server side development is made easier
with Express it's possible to create
single page multi-page and hybrid web
apps with express.js
Express enables middlewares to respond
to http request to be configured
middleware is primarily responsible for
the orderly structure of express.js
various functions
Express JS has a comprehensive routing
mechanism that uses URLs to maintain the
state of a web page
it establishes a routing table that is
used to carry out various operations
based on the HTTP method and URL
express.js has templating engines that
enable developers to create Dynamic
content for web pages by creating HTML
templates on the server
Express JS simplifies debugging by
offering a debugging mechanism that can
pinpoint a particular area of the web
application that is causing problems
advantages of express.js
express.js makes developing node.js web
applications quickly and easily
express.js is simple to set up and
personalize
it allows to Define application routes
using HTTP methods and urls
express.js includes a number of
middleware modules that can be used to
execute additional requests and
responses activities
it is simple to interface with a variety
of template engines including
it allows us to specify a middleware for
handling errors
Express is used to make a rest API
server and it's simple to provide your
application static files and resources
databases such as mongodb redis and
MySQL are simple to connect to
express.js
consider the postgraduate program by
Caltech in full stack web development
and master those necessary skills which
simply runs full course you will dive
into the world of game-changing language
that combines the best of JavaScript
with powerful static typing in this
immersive learning experience you will
be guided by industry experts who will
unravel the mystery of typescript
through interactive live sessions you
will get Hands-On practice with real
world projects sharpen your skills and
gain the confidence to tackle any coding
challenge that comes on your way but it
doesn't stop there our live master
classes led by instructors will expose
you to advanced concepts and Industry
best practices you will gain insights
into building scalable and maintainable
applications ensuring your code is
reversed and future proof now let us
look at the demo on typescript Express
the prerequisites are we need to have an
editor maybe Visual Studio code then we
need to have node.js installed and a
package manager installed such as npm or
Yan
so we'll jump into Visual Studio code
here I have created a new folder
named Express typescript then we will go
to the terminal
next we'll run the command
npx
typescript
hyphen init will initialize typescript
next to initialize the node.js
application we will run the command yarn
init
once we have initialized the node.js
application we just need to click enter
just click enter
and we have successfully saved the
packet.json file next we need to make a
new directory
it will make a new directory source
next we'll install the touch CLI
globally
with the command npm install
touch
CLI
so after installing this we'll run the
command
touch
Source inside the source folder we will
create the file app.ts
so here you can see we have created the
file app.ts inside the source folder
so after this we will install typescript
to install typescript run the command
yarn
add
typescript
node
Dev
type script
okay friendly
so after this we need to install Express
to install Express run the command yarn
space add Express
next we need to add node modules and
express modules for that and the command
yarn add
type slash node
type slash Express
so let us now go to the app.ts file and
run the code
we will close this
so I'll copy paste a few lines of code
here
wherein I have imported Express
module
the consent app creates an Express
function
and we have express.json
and we have returning a message hello
world
so we'll save this and we are running it
on the Local Host with port number 3000.
so we'll save this
and
run it
to run it we'll just
run the command yarn
Def
so application is listening at the
localhost 3000 so we'll copy this
and open in the browser
where we got showing the message hello
world
similarly we have routing
like this example with app.get and
app.host the app object provides a
collection of functions that attach
callbacks to http request made to Define
destinations
and other HTTP methods such as post put
patch and delete can also have callbacks
attached to them
the router object is another approach to
setup routing you can call the get put
and patch and delete methods on a router
object just like you do on a app object
and similarly we have request and
response so the request object holds
information about HTTP request including
headers query strings and parameters
when when an HTTP request is received
the response object represents the HTTP
response that the application provides
similarly for response the send method
is the most significant one it sends the
HTTP response to the client so that it
can be received
the function accepts a variety of data
kinds including strings objects arrays
and buffers
the cell method finishes the response
process with data but you can
alternatively use the end function to
end it without any data
the request in the response objects are
accessible to middleware function it can
join the request response cycle at any
point
a third argument that middleware
receives is the next function
the get callback which processes the
HTTP get request that we wrote in this
example is an example of middleware its
highly unique middleware that only works
in one situation they can also carry out
more General duties
we'll first look at type assertions
type assertion is similar to type cast
in other languages but it does not do
any additional verification or
restructuring it has no effect on
runtime and is only used by the compiler
typescript expects that you the
programmer have completed the necessary
and specific checks
so there are two types of assertions
one is the as syntax and the other one
is the angle bracket syntax both
versions are identical choosing one over
the other is primarily a matter of
preference however only as style
assertions are allowed when combining
typescript with jsx
type aliasis type aliases give a type a
new name type aliases are similar to
interfaces in that they can be used to
name Primitives unions tuples and any
other kind that you would have to Define
by hand otherwise
aliasing doesn't truly create a new type
instead it gives the type a new name
aliasing A Primitive isn't very useful
however it can be used for documentation
purposes
type aliases like interfaces can be
gentle all we have to do is add type
parameters and utilize them on the right
side of the Alias declaration
this is the Syntax for type aliasis
type generics
type generics is a tool for creating
reusable components in typescript rather
than working with a single data type it
builds a component that can interact
with various data kinds it enables users
to consume these components while also
using their kinds genetics ensure that
the software is both adaptable and
scalable over time consider the below
code without generics the identity
function is a function that returns
whatever is sent in as a parameter you
could either provide the identity
function with a specific type or the
identity function with any type
while the use of any is generic when you
use any the function accepts any kind
for the type of argument
as a result when the function returns
you lose the information about what the
type was the only information you have
is that any type could be produced if
you pass a string
so for that we need the means to capture
the argument type in such a way that we
can use it to signify what has been
returned as well
we will utilize a type variable here
which is a form of variable that deals
with the types rather than values
the identity function now has a type
variable called type this type allows
you to capture the type of data the user
supplies
for example a number or a string so that
you can use it later you are going to
utilize type as the return type once
more
next we look at the in operator
the in operator serves as a type
narrowing expression
the true Branch Narrows to types that
have an optional or required property n
and the false Branch Narrows through the
types that have an optional or missing
property n for a n in X expression
where N is a string literal or a string
literal type and X is the union type
below is an example code for inoperate
none and undefined are two special types
in typescript that have the values null
and undefined respectively they are not
particularly useful much like void
null and undefined are subclasses of all
other types by default that means you
can give things like number null and
undefined values
when the strict null checks flag is set
however null and undefined can also be
assigned to unknown any and the
respective types this helps you avoid a
lot of frequent errors you can use them
as Union type string null and undefined
if you want to send in either a string
null or a undefined
next we have index types
using index types we can get the
compiler to check code that utilizes
Dynamic properties names by using index
types a typical JavaScript pattern for
example is to select a subset of an
object's property
we may build and use this function in
typescript using the index type query
and index access operators let us jump
into Visual Studio code and understand
index types more better
so consider this code as an example for
index types here key of T the index type
query operator for any type t e of T is
the union of non-public property names
of t
and T of K the indexed access operator
is the second operator the type syntax
reflects the expression syntax in this
case
and T of K can be like index type
queries be used in genetic environment
which is where its truly potential can
be seen all we have to do now is make
sure that the type variable K extends e
of t
in get property o
T and property name k so that means of
property name the compiler will initiate
the actual type of the key after you
return T of K result therefore the
return type of get property will change
depending on which property you request
index signature
index signature interact with the key
off and the T of K
the type of an index signature argument
must be either a string or a number
if your type has a string index
signature e of T will be a string or a
number
because in JavaScript you can access an
object property using either a string or
number
T of string is simply the index
signature type
below is the Syntax for index signature
if you have a type with number index
signature e of T will just be a number
map types
taking an existing type and making each
of its property optional is a typical
undertaking because this happens
frequently enough in JavaScript
typescript has a new feature called map
types that allows you to Define new
types based on existing ones
the new types turn each property in the
old type in the same way in a map time
for example make all the properties
optional or the read-only type
it's important to note that this syntax
refers to the type rather than the
member you can use an intersection type
to add more members
this is the simplest map type and its
parts the syntax is similar to the index
signature with a 4 in the middle
there are three sections in total the
type variable K is assigned to each
property one by one
the little Union of string the names of
the properties to iterate over are
stored in case and third one the
properties type is a result
next we have conditional types
based on the condition given as a type
relationship test a conditional type
chooses one of the two alternative types
when T can be assigned to you the type
is X and when it can't the type is y
because the condition depends on one or
more type variable a conditional type T
extends U
so X is to Y and is either resolved to X
or Y or delayed
whether to resolve to X or Y or to
differ when t or U contains type
variables is determined by whether the
type system has enough information to
conclude that t is always assignable to
you
in conditional types we also have
distributive conditional type
that is a conditional type in which the
check type is bait type parameter during
instantiation distributive conditional
types are automatically distributed over
Union types
supporting libraries from node modules
typescript includes a series of
Declaration files to guarantee that
typescript and JavaScript support works
well right out of the box
and typescript includes a series of
Declaration files however there are two
drawbacks to using this declaration
files with typescript
one drawback is since while upgrading
typescript
we must also deal with the changes of
typescript built-in declaration files
which can be difficult when the Dom apis
change so regularly
and the other drawback is that
customizing these files to meet your
needs and the demands of project
dependencies is difficult
so to overcome this a new feature like
types was added that allow us to
override a specific built-in library
then we can update typescript and lock
the file in dependency management
ensuring that it utilizes the same
version of Dom types as a result we can
update the types on our own schedule
then with
then with typescript 4.5 we can update
typescript and log file in our
dependency management
await type and promise improvements
the weighted type is the new utility
introduced in typescript this type is
intended to represent activities such as
await in async functions and the then
method on promises notably the way they
recursively unwrap promises
existing apis such as JavaScript built
in like promise dot all promise dot race
and others can benefit from awaited type
in fact some of promise.all inference
concerns provided as foundation for
awaited promise that all combine certain
traits with awaited to produce far
superior inference results
tail recursion elimination on
conditional types
one typescript identifies potential
infinite recursion or any type expansion
that take a long time and damage your
editor experience it oftenly fails
as a result typescript includes
heuristics to ensure that it doesn't run
off the tracks while deconstructing an
indefinitely deep type or working with
types that provide a lot of intermediate
results
let's jump into Visual Studio code and
look at an example
the trim left type for example removes
spaces from the beginning of string like
type when provided a string type with
space at the beginning trip left Returns
the reminder of the string to the user
this type is Handy but it will throw an
error if a string contains more than 50
leading spaces
this is problematic because these types
are frequently used in modeling
operations on strings such as parsers or
URL routers to make matters worse a more
powerful type useful generates more type
installations resulting in even
additional input length restrictions
time left is returned in such a way that
it is still recursive on one branch when
it calls itself again it Returns the
result instantly and does nothing with
it
because these types don't require any
intermediate outcomes they can be
constructed more rapidly and without
activating many of typescript built in
type recursion heuristics
next we have assert signatures
the asset signature features allow us to
construct functions that operate as
typed guards as a side effect instead of
returning their Boolean result
explicitly
consider a below example
after asserts ring typescript has no way
of knowing if you have guaranteed the
type of input to prevent this most
people just make the parameter input
string which is fine
it also moves the type checking problem
somewhere and in circumstances where you
just want to fail hard having this
option is beneficial
if this function ever returns typescript
can filter the type of input to sting
exactly like it would be if it were
inside an if block with a type card to
make this safe the assert function must
either give an error or not return at
all if the assert assertion isn't true
and lastly we have recursive type
aliasis
the ability to recursively reference
type aliases has been limited the reason
for which is because each type aliasis
must be capable of substituting itself
for whatever it aliases
because this isn't always possible the
compiler rejects some recursive aliases
interfaces can be recursive but their
expressiveness is limited and type
aliases cannot that involves combining
the two creating a type Alias and
extracting the types recursive
operations into interfaces
interfaces can be recursive but their
expressiveness is limited and type
aliasis cannot
that involves combining the two creating
a type Alias and extracting the types
recursive portions into interfaces it's
effective
by establishing an interface users May
write what was practically the same code
typescript has no trouble working with
the interfaces and other object types
because they introduce a level of
indirection and their whole structure
does not need to be eagerly built up
however many found the workaround of
introducing the interface to be
inconvenient and there was nothing wrong
with the old version of value or array
that used array directly in Concepts
consider the postgraduate program by
Caltech in full stack web development
and master Zone necessary skills which
simply runs full course you will dive
into the world of game changing language
that combines the best of JavaScript
with powerful static typing in this
immersive learning experience you will
be guided by industry experts who will
unravel the mystery of typescript
through interactive live sessions you
will get Hands-On practice with real
world projects sharpen your skills and
gain the confidence to tackle any coding
challenge that comes on your way but it
doesn't stop there our live master class
is led by instructors will expose you to
advanced concepts and Industry best
practices you will gain insights into
building scalable and maintainable
applications ensuring your code is
reversed and future proof
this is the chart application where we
have two users and from the user one we
will send the message hello
and the user 2 will receive it and from
the user 2 will send the message hi
and the user will precedes it so this is
basically a simple chart application how
we can create
how are you
so this is basically a simple chart
application which we can create
so in this video we will learn to make
this chat application from the scratch
but before we begin make sure you have
subscribed to our YouTube channel and
clicked on the Bell icon so you never
miss an update from Simply learn watch
the video till the end so that you don't
miss out anything so without wasting any
further time let's get started first of
all we will create a new folder so I'll
go to my D drive and I'll create a new
folder
I'll name the folder as
Charter
so after creating this new folder
so we will go to visual studio code open
a new window a new window will open the
folder which we created
we created the folder in D drive
we will first create the user interface
to create the user interface for that we
need to create a new file called
index.html
so I've successfully created the new
file index.html
so we'll change the title we'll name the
title as IO chat
next after this we'll open the link
before this we should know what is CDN a
CDN is a network of servers that
distributes content from An Origin
server throughout the world by catching
content close to where each end user is
accessing the internet we are a web
enabled device
the content they request is first stored
on the origin server and is then
replicated and stored elsewhere as
needed so we will use bootstrap CDN and
query CDN for our project
so we'll use the link tag the link
element allows authors to link the
document to other resources
we'll click on the link
so for this to get the bootstrap CDN we
will
go to the browser and type bootstrap CDN
so we'll copy this link
for bootstrap CDN and we'll paste it
here
bootstrap is the most popular CSS
framework for developing responsive and
mobile first websites bootstrap 5 is the
newest version of bootstrap and
bootstrap is free open source CSS
framework directed at responsive mobile
first front-end web development it
contains CSS and JavaScript based on
design templates for forms buttons
navigation and other interface
components
after this next we need jQuery CDN
next we will
next we'll get the jQuery CDN and write
it in the script tags
so I'll select script
the script element allows authors to
include Dynamic script and data blocks
in their documents
the element does not represent content
for the user to get the CDN for jQuery
go to the browser
and just type jQuery CDL
and open the first link
click on uncompressed
and
copy this
go back to the visual studio code
and
paste it
so after this is done
jQuery is far small and feature with
JavaScript library it makes things like
HTML document transversal and
manipulation event handling animation
and Ajax much simpler with an easy to
use API
that works across a multitude of browser
with the combination of Versatility and
extensibility
so after this we will take one more
script tag and this time we will include
the
we will take one more script tag inside
this script tag we will enter the client
set socket.io web API that will work
inside the browser you can go to the
browser and search socket.io you will
get all the information related to
socket.io
so just go and type
socket.io
here
just go to the browser and type
socket.ivo and on this website socket.io
you have all the documentation and all
the details to get started with
socket.io so you can go through the
socket.io here
so in the script tags
write source
and just type socket
slash
socket Dot io.js
so after this will create a new div tag
so the diff element has no special
meaning at all it represents its
children it can be used with the class
language and title attributes to markup
semantics common to a group of
consecutive elements
so inside this div we'll create a new
class
new class container
so class is basically a space separated
list of classes of the element classes
allow CSS and JavaScript to select an
access specific elements via the class
selector or functions like the method
document get Elements by class name
so after this
we will create another div
class
okay
inside this we'll create one more div
class
this scholar medium for this class is
used when the device size is medium or
greater then 768 pixel and the maximum
width of the container is 720 pixel and
you want the width equal to four columns
that is when we use this function column
medium 4.
text we'll create another div
class
well
so after this will provide the heading
H3
the history element represents a section
heading
so in this we'll provide the heading as
online users
you can change the headings whatever you
want to but I'll keep it as online users
so after this we'll create an unordered
list
in this class
list group
okay
and ID
so after this we'll create a one more
diff
foreign
class
will provide column medium
of size 8.
this column medium 8 stands for large
columns
well then we'll create a div for another
div last chat
where ID
is equal to chart
then I'll create a form
the this form element represents a
collection of form Associated elements
some of which can represent editable
values that can be submitted into a
server or processing
perform ID
is equal to
for message form
this will create a div class
form group
next we'll create the label
so a label element represents a caption
in a user interface the caption can be
associated with specific form control
known as label elements label controlled
either using for attribute or by putting
the form control inside the label
element itself
so use the label element inside that
we'll write enter message
next we'll create a text area
the label text area
so inside text area we'll create a class
form control
and ID
message
foreign
plain text edit control for the
element's raw value the contents of the
control represent the controls default
value
after the text area
will
just
right
then we will create an input element
and put element of
will assign a type submit
class
button
foreign
so this input are basically it
represents a type data field usually
with the form control to allow the user
to edit the data
so we have finished with the user
interface we'll just save this
and run it in the browser right click
and open with live server
so here we go
we have created the HTML but
we we will now create assign few CSS
elements we just need the margin top
for the body so we'll assign that
foreign
Styles element
the style element allows authors to
embed style information in their
documents the style element is one of
the several inputs to The Styling
processing model the element does not
represent content for the user
so in the style
we'll just write this body
and we'll assign margin top
30 pixel
save this and we'll go to the browser
and just refresh
so till now we have created the user
interface
we will just go to the browser and run
this user interface
just right click and click on open with
live server
now we will create a new file called
server.js
and we'll go to the terminal
in terminal we will run two commands
first of all we need to install
socket.tivo for that we'll run npm
and there is one prerequisite we need to
have node.js installed in our device
so then run the command node package
manager npm install
IO is a library that enables real-time
bi-directional and even based
communication between the browser and
the server it consists of a node.js
server and a JavaScript client library
for the browser
after installing socket.io then we need
to install Express for that run the
command npm install
Express
is a minimal and flexible node.js web
application framework that provides a
robust set of features for web and
mobile applications
after installing socket.tivon Express
you will get these two files packet.json
file and package log.json
next go to the server.js
wherein I will paste few lines of code
in the line 1 creates an express
application the express function is a
top level function exported by the
express module
then we have const listen and then we
require and socket.io
then we we have created a variable app
Express method then we have created a
variable server
So This Server that is we use the module
http
so it creates a module HTTP to use the
HTTP server and client we must require
HTTP the HTTP interfaces in node.js are
designed to support many features of the
protocol which have been traditionally
difficult to use in particular large
possible chunk encoded messages the
interface is careful to never buffer
entire request or responses so the user
is able to stream data
then we have another variable IO where
we require socket.ibo server and
similarly we are listening in the port
3000
so in Port 3000 it starts a server
listening for connection a net dot
server can be in TCP or an IPC server
depending on what it listens to do
then we have app.get
here the request is declared but its
value is never read we have request and
response
then we are routing it on the localhost
3000
so in this line we are transferring the
file at the given path so automatically
sets the content type response header
field the Callback is invoked when the
transfer is complete or when an error
occurs be sure to check request response
sent if you wish to attempt responding
as the header and some data may be
already been transferred here we are
connecting the client to the server and
here we add plug details to the customer
array and here we are checking the
current connections
and then we disconnect from the server
using the disconnect function
next we delete the plug details and the
again we show the current connections
here on the socket dot on we send
messages function data and then we
console.log the data then we emit the
new messages
so then we have written console.log
server is listening
so now we will run this code and check
if the server is listening
now we'll check if the server is
listening for that will run the command
node server
okay
and here we go server is listening now
we'll just go and run the localhost 3000
on the browser
go to the new tab and just run localhost
3000 and here we go
it's running and when we come back to
the code
we can see it shows one socket connected
so again if we go and open it in a new
browser
and just run the localhost
and go back to the code it will show two
sockets connected
so we are almost done we just have a
small part left out we'll go to
index.html
and here
we'll just scroll down
and above body we'll just paste few
lines of code
so here basically we are just creating a
function to get data form
so we'll get message form and we'll we
are creating variables message and we
are creating variables chat so basically
in this line we will know form between
click event handler and
then we will prevent default from
submission next in this line we will tap
data for text box and call server then
we'll create clearly then we will clear
the form text box then we'll console.log
submitter
so our program is finished now we'll
just run and check the code
so we'll save this code
go to the browser
refresh it
so I have the two browsers I have opened
it into separate window we'll just check
if the application is working so we'll
send a message hi
and here we go we have received the
message so we can say hello
so the chart application is working
successfully

we'll first look at beginner level
interview questions
what is typescript
typescript is an object oriented and
strongly typed programming language
which is a superset of JavaScript
typescript was designed by Anders
hijelsberg at Microsoft the limitations
of JavaScript for developing large-scale
applications at Microsoft and among its
external customers led to the creation
of typescript because of the difficulty
of working with complicated JavaScript
code there was a demand for custom
tooling to make developing JavaScript
components easier
typescript code is converted to
JavaScript which can be executed
anywhere JavaScript is supported in the
browser or node.js or any other
application
typescript is Javascript with some
additional features to support a more
robust interaction with your editor
typescript adds additional syntax to
JavaScript typescript is a scripting
language that understands JavaScript and
uses type inference to provide powerful
capabilities without additional code
explain the features of typescript
typescript supports other JavaScript
libraries typescript is a new Microsoft
language that is highly typed superset
of JavaScript with support for
object-oriented programming and other
current features like decorators because
browsers are node.js comprehend
JavaScript typescript compiles
JavaScript
typescript is portable typescript is
cross browser cross device and cross
platform it can run in any environment
that supports JavaScript typescript
unlike its competitors does not require
a dedicated virtual machine or a
specific runtime environment to run
typescript is superset of JavaScript it
is strongly syntactical that superset of
JavaScript with the addition of optional
static typing typescript is a large
scale application development language
that transcompiles to JavaScript exists
in JavaScript programs are also valid
typescript programs because typescript
is a superset of JavaScript typescript
is static when a client doesn't have a
value for a parameter he can personal
optional arguments are a feature of
typescript you can declare some
arguments in the function optional by
utilizing optional parameter features so
that the client is not necessary to
supply a value to optional parameters
object oriented language when it comes
to object oriented programming with
JavaScript typescript shines because of
the class keyword it makes object
oriented programming look quite similar
to programming in other object oriented
languages like c-sharp or Java
what are export and import keywords in
typescript import keyword is used to
export declaration example export start
from module and the export keyword is
used to export any variable function and
type aliasis below is the example for
import keyword and Export keyword
can typescript be used for the back end
typescript can be generally used for
backend applications by using node.js
and having additional safety that the
language brings
how to declare a variable in typescript
let and const are the two methods to
declare variables variable names can
contain alphabets and numeric digits
they cannot contain spaces and special
characters except the underscore and the
dollar sign variable names cannot begin
with a digital is the example code where
we have declared a variable with let
method and we have declared a variable
inside a function
list the applications of typescript
script can be used to develop JavaScript
applications for both client-side and
server side execution
typescript can be deployed instead of
JavaScript language since it adds more
features and gives error directly with
the code typescript is used for building
large scale applications for Enterprises
how can a base Constructor be called
from a child Class A Base Class
Constructor can be called from Child
class using the super method as shown in
the example
what are Getters and sectors Getters and
sectors intercept access to a member of
the object they give us a way of having
finer grain control over how a member
access each objects a getter method
starts with the keyword get
and the setter method starts with the
keyword set what is the purpose of
tsconfig.json file
tsconfig.json file is a Json format file
in which we can specify different
options to tell the compiler how to
compile a given project this file in the
directory indicates that the directory
is the typescript's project root list
the advantages of typescript typescript
highlights errors at the compilation
time during the time of development any
browser or JavaScript engine can run
typescript it has a namespace concept by
defining a module typescript supports
strongly type.static typing typescript
has the advantages of being tightly
typed or allowing static typing it may
confirm type correctness at the compile
time because of static typing what are
rest parameters in typescript when the
number of parameters that a function
will receive is not known or can vary we
can use rest parameters we can pass zero
or more arguments to the rest parameters
the compiler will create an array of
arguments with the rest parameter name
how to compile typescript with Visual
Studio code Visual Studio code includes
typescript language support but does not
include the typescript compiler we need
to install the typescript compiler
either globally or in your workspace to
transpile typescript source code to
JavaScript the easiest way to install
typescript is through node package
manager the node.js package manager if
you have npm installed you can install
typescript globally on your computer by
using this command npm install hyphen G
typescript we can test the installed
typescript by checking the version or
help for this run the command TSC hyphen
hyphen version
list access modifiers supported by
typescript typescript supports three
access modifiers protected private and
public in protected all class members
can access them but the instance cannot
but in private it's only accessible by
members whereas in public it is
accessible by members child classes and
instance of the class
this is the disadvantages of typescript
the typescript takes a long time to
compile the code typescript does not
support abstract classes and extra
compilation step for converting
typescript into JavaScript typescript
has overly complicated typing system
how to debug a typescript file
to debug a typescript file a DOT JS
Source map file is needed to debug the
file compile the dot TS file with the
source map flag for generating Source
map file use the command typescript TSC
space hyphen sourcemap file.ts Source
mapping URL is equal to file.js.map
how can we convert a string to a number
with typescript in typescript conversion
from a string to a number can be done
using the following commands parse int
method and we have parse float method
and number method
explain type aliasis
type aliases give a type a new name type
aliases are similar to interfaces in
that they can be used to name Primitives
unions tuples and any other kinds that
you would have to Define by hand
otherwise
aliasing doesn't truly create a new type
instead it gives that type a new name
aliasing A Primitive isn't very useful
however it can be used for documentation
purposes type aliasis like interfaces
can be in general
all we have to do is add type parameters
and utilize them on the right side of
Alias declaration below is the Syntax
for type aliasis
what are nullable types in typescript
null and undefined are the two special
types in typescript that have the values
null and undefined respectively they are
not particularly useful much like void
null and undefined are subclasses of all
other types by default that means you
can give things like number null and
undefined values
when the strict null checks flag is set
however null and undefined can only be
assigned to unknown any and their
respective types the one exception being
that undefined is also assignable to
want this helps to avoid a lot of
frequent errors you can use the union
type string null undefined if you want
to send in either a string null or
undefined
what is in operator in typescript
the in operator serves as a type
narrowing expression
the true Branch Narrows to types that
have been an optional or required
property in and defaults Branch Narrows
to the types that have an optional or
missing properties in for a n in X
expression as shown in the example below
where N is a string literal or string
literal type and X is a union type
explain index types in typescript
using index types we can get the
compiler to check code that utilizes the
Dynamic Property names a typical
JavaScript pattern for example is to
select a subset of an object properties
we may build and use this function in
typescript using the index type query
and indexed access operators in this
example key of T the index type query
operator for any type T key of T is the
union of non-public property names of T
and T of K the indexed access operator
is the second operator the type syntax
reflects the expression syntax in this
case T of K can be like index type
queries be used in generic environment
which is where it's truly potentially
seen all you have to do now is make sure
that the type variable K extends to K of
t
what are map types typescript has a
feature called map types that allow you
to Define new types based on the
existing ones the new type turns each
property into the old type in the same
way in a map type
it's important to note that this syntax
refers to a type rather than a member
you can use an intersection type to add
more numbers as you can see in the
example it is the simplest map type and
its parts are type keys and type Flags
where syntax is similar to the index
signatures with 4 in the middle there
are three sections in total the type
variable K is assigned to each property
one by one and the literal Union of
strings the name of properties to
iterate over the stored in case and
properties type as a result
what is meant by contextual typing when
there is a type on one side of the
equation but not on the other the
typescript compiler finds out the form
we can omit typing on the right side as
typescript and work it out automatically
this increases the amount of work needed
to type code
distinguish between typescript and
JavaScript typescript is an object
oriented programming language whereas
JavaScript is a scripting language
typescript supports static typing
JavaScript does not support static
typing
in typescript error can be found and
corrected during a compile time in
JavaScript errors can be found only
during runtime as it is an interpreted
language
there is support for
ES3 ES4 5 and 6 in typescript
whereas in JavaScript no support for
compiling
in typescript functions can have
optional parameters whereas in
JavaScript this is not possible
in typescript converted into JavaScript
code to be understandable for browsers
JavaScript can be directly used in
browsers
typescript has proper build setup dot
package manager is required for static
type definitions no build setup is
required in JavaScript
what is jsx
jsx is an XML like syntax that can be
embedded it is intended to be turned
into digimate JavaScript though the
semantics of the transformation will
vary depending on the implementation
typescript allows you to embed jsx type
verify it and compile it to JavaScript
immediately jsx needs to be translated
into a valid typescript we use the jsx
file with the dot TSX extension
define static typing
static typing refers to a compiler
having variables parameters and object
members that are recognizable at the
compilation type this helps in detecting
early errors static typing as is an
important concept
static typing is when the compiler
enforces that the values use the same
time here's an example
what is meant by type inference
when you don't specify an explicit type
for variable typescript can infer it
type inference is the term for this this
is normally done during the Declaration
when the variables or parameters are
initialized
typescript recognizes that the variable
Foo is a string even if we don't mention
string as a type
here is an example
how to create objects in typescript
objects are collection of keys and
values that resemble a dictionary the
keys must be one of a kind this symbol R
is and are sometimes referred to as
associate arrays
an object type in typescript refers to
any value with properties it can be
defined simply by specifying the
properties and the kinds of these
properties as an example
explain different data types in
typescript
number both integer and floating Point
numbers are represented by the data type
number
Boolean has true and false values
string it is used to denote a string of
characters void is usually applied to
function return types
null it's used when an object isn't
worth anything
undefined indicates the value assigned
to an uninitialized variable any any
type of value can be assigned to a
variable if declared with any data type
what are the benefits of using
typescript
compilation JavaScript as an interpreted
language thus there is no need to
compile it as a result it must be run to
ensure authenticity if there is an error
you write all the code only to find no
output as a result you will have to
spend hours looking for faults in the
code
error checking is provided via the
typescript transpiler if typescript
detects any syntax mistakes it will
compile the code and generate
compilation error this AIDS in detecting
errors before the execution of the
script
the next benefit is it provides an
optional type system for JavaScript code
when a client doesn't have a value for a
parameter he can personal optional
arguments are a feature of typescript
you can declare some optional arguments
in the function by utilizing optional
parameter features so the decline does
not need to supply a value to optional
parameters
strong static typing JavaScript does not
have a powerful static typing system
through the TLs typescript comes with an
optional static typing and type
inference system the TLs can deduce the
type of variable defined with node type
based on its value
typescript supports object oriented
programming typescript Support classes
interfaces inheritance and other
object-oriented programming principles
typescript supports type definition
existing JavaScript libraries can use
typescript type definitions external
Javascript libraries are defined in
typescript definition files as a result
it can include these libraries in
typescript code
how to install typescript
typescript is a JavaScript programming
language for use in application
typescript extends JavaScript with
optional typeset support tools for
large-scale JavaScript application in
any browser or any host on any other
operating system to install typescript
globally with node package manager which
means you can run the typescript command
from anywhere in your terminal to
install the latest stable version of
typescript you just need to run the
command npm install hyphen G space
typescript this will install the latest
version of typescript
what are decorators
a decorator is a type of Declaration
that can be used to decorate a class
declaration method accessor property or
argument
decorators take the form expression
where expression must evaluate to a
function that will be called with
information about the decorated
declaration when it is called at runtime
what are mixins
combining simpler particle classes is a
popular approach of constructing classes
from reusable components for languages
like scalar you may be familiar with the
concept of mixins or characteristics
to extend a base class the design relies
on generics and class inheritance the
finest mix in support in typescript is
provided through the class expression
pattern
explain classes in typescript
classes are not supported in JavaScript
es5 or earlier this feature the
typescript inherits from es6
a class is a collection of items with
similar characteristics Fields methods
Constructor blocks nested classes and
interfaces are all included in the
classes
below is the syntax to declare a class
in terms of whoops a class is a template
for producing objects
what is a namespace and how to declare
it
the namespace is used to group
functionalities logically to enable a
single or a group of link
functionalities a namespace can include
interfaces classes functions and
variables
the namespace keyword followed by the
name space name can be used to construct
a namespace curly brackets can be used
to define all interfaces classes and
other objects
below is the Syntax for namespace
explain the components of typescript
internally the typescript language is
separated into three layers each of this
layer is further subdivided into
language compiler and language services
language it is written in typescript and
includes typescript language components
it includes syntax keywords and type
annotations
compiler the typescript compiler
converts typescript programs into
JavaScript code it also converts our
typescript code to JavaScript code
parsing and type checking it
it provides information that allows
editors and other tools to deliver
greater assistance capabilities like
automated refactoring and intelligence
it adds a layer of abstraction to the
core compiler pipeline
what are the recent advancements in
typescript
typescript 4.2 has been released and it
includes more flexible type annotations
tougher checks and additional
configuration choices and a few breaking
changes
rest arguments can now be placed
anywhere in triple type in type error
messages type aliases are no longer
enlarged resulting in a better developer
experience
typescript 4.2 brings the language one
step closer to its aim of accurately
typing JavaScript at any size anywhere
JavaScript is used
described as syntax in typescript
the as is an additional syntax in
typescript for type assertion it was
introduced as the original syntax
conflicted with jsx
while using jsx with typescript only as
style assertions can be used
Define Lambda function
typescript provides shorthand Syntax for
defining function Expressions a Lambda
function is an anonymous function
without a name
below is an example for Lambda function
what are conditional types in typescript
based on a condition given as a type
relationship test a conditional type
chooses one of the two alternative types
when T can be assigned to you the type
is X and when T can't the type is y
because the condition depends on one or
more type variables a conditional type T
extends to U
X is to Y and is either resolved to X or
Y or delayed whether to resolve 2X or Y
or to differ when t or U contains type
variables is determined by whether the
type systems has enough information to
conclude that t is always assignable to
you
what is an interface with reference to
typescript
the interface defines the Syntax for
classes to follow a class implementing
an interface implements all its members
it can be referenced but not
instantiated typescript compiler uses an
interface for type checking
what is a declare keyword in typescript
as JavaScript does not have typescript
declaration to use it in the typescript
file without any compilation error
declare keyword is used
the keyword is used for ambient methods
and declarations to Define a variable
that exists elsewhere consider the

interview questions
what are object oriented principles
supported by typescript
all object oriented principles
encapsulation inheritance polymorphism
and obstruction are supported by
typescript
encapsulation is a major component of
object-oriented programming language and
its method of structuring code so that
each block of code has its own set of
access points for external code
polymorphism occurs when many class
inherit from the same parent and
override the same functionality each of
those Kit classes is now responsible for
implementing a property or method but
they may do so it on their own unique
way
inheritance
typescript makes creating an object
model an inheritance chain a breeze to
construct classes simply use the
standard class keyword
obstruction is a method of modeling
objects in a system that separates the
responsibilities of the classes or type
from the code that inherits it
explain index signatures in typescript
index signatures interact with the key
of NT of K
the type of an index signature argument
must be either a string or a number
if your type has a string index
signature key of T will be a string or a
number because in JavaScript we can
access an object property using either
string or numbers and T off string is
simply the index signatures type the
index signature consists of the index
name and its type in square bracket
followed by colon and the value type
what are assert signatures
the assert signature features allows us
to construct functions that operate as
typed guards as a side effect instead of
returning their Boolean result
explicitly
after research string typescript has no
way of knowing if you have guaranteed
the type of input to prevent this most
people just make the parameter input
string which is fine
but it also moves the type of checking
problem somewhere and in circumstances
where you just want to fail hard having
the option is beneficial
what is Type assertion explain its types
a type assertion is similar to a
Typecast in other languages but it does
not do any additional data verification
or restructuring it has no effect on
runtime and is only used by the compiler
there are two types of assertions
one is the as syntax other is the angle
bracket syntax
below is the example for asyntax and
angle bracket syntax
explain how typescript files can be
supported from node modules
typescript includes a series of
Declaration files however there are two
drawbacks to using this declaration
files with typescript
one is while upgrading typescript we
must deal with changes to typescript's
built-in declaration files
and the other is customizing these files
to meet the needs and the demands of
project dependencies is difficult
a new feature like at the rate types was
added that allows to override the
specific built-in library then we can
update typescript and the log file
independency management ensuring that it
utilizes the same version of the Dom
types as a result we can update the
types on our own schedule
explain the typescript generics
typescript generics is a tool for
creating reusable components in
typescript it builds a component that
can interact with various data kinds it
enables users to consume these
components while also using their own
kinds
the identity function now has a type
variable called type this type allows us
to capture the type of data the user
supplies for example a number or a
string so that we can use it later we
are going to utilize type as the return
type once more below is the Syntax for
typescript generics
what is the recursive type aliasis
the ability to recursively reference
type aliases has always been eliminated
the reason for this is because each type
aliases must be capable of substituting
itself for whatever it aliases
interfaces can be recursive but their
expressiveness is limited and type
aliasis cannot
that involves combining the two creating
a type aliases and extracting the types
recursive portions into interfaces it's
effective
typescript has no trouble working with
the interfaces and the other object
types because they introduce a level of
indirection and their whole structure
does not need to be eagerly built up
explain tail recursion elimination on
conditional types
when typescript identifies infinite
recursion or any type expansions that
take a long time and damage your editor
experience
as a result typescript includes
heuristics to ensure that it doesn't run
off the tracks while working with types
that provide a lot of intermediate
results
the trim left type removes spaces from
the beginning of string like type when
provided a string type with a space at
the beginning trim left returns a
reminder of the string to the user
Advanced typescript removes tail
recursion from conditional types it can
prevent intermediary instantiations as
one branch of conditional type is merely
another conditional type
explain the awaited type and promise
improvements this type is intended to
represent activities such as a weight in
async functions and the dot then method
on promises notably the way they
recursively unbra promises
existing apis such as JavaScript
built-ins like promise dot all
promise.trace and others can benefit
from the updated type in fact some of
promise.alls inference concerns provided
as foundation for awaited promise dot
all come by insert and traits with the
awaited to produce far superior
inference results
