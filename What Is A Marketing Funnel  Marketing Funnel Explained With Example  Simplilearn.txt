Ado let's get started all right so what
is marketing
funnel the marketing funnel is the way
to visualize and understand the steps a
customer takes before making a purchase
think of it as a journey map that starts
when a customer first hears about your
brand and continues until they buy
something from you
this funnel is a strategic tool that
shows the entire buying process from the
customer perspective the main goal of
the marketing funnel is to help your
marketing and sales teams understand
this journey by mapping out each stage
they can pinpoint crucial moments or
touch points where they can engage with
the customers and encourage them to move
forward in the process this
understanding helps in creating targeted
strategies to guide the customer
smoothly from one stage to next
ultimately leading to a purchase so this
was about marketing funnel now let's
understand the stages of traditional
marketing
funnel so the traditional marketing
funnels outlines four key stages that
customer goes through before buying a
product or service first is awareness
the awareness stage is the very
beginning of the customer Journey the
wide open door of your marketing funnel
here potential customers haven't even
considered your brand as a solution to
their needs yet they might not even be
aware that they have a problem you can
solve your job at this stage is to
introduce yourself grab their attention
and plant a seed of curiosity about what
you offer here are the ways how you can
do it run a TV commercial during a
popular fitness show partner with a
fitness influencers on social media or
you can do is put up eye-catching
Billboards near gyms or Parks these
marketing tactics effectively Target and
engage audiences already interested in
health and fitness increasing the brand
visibility and credibility and sparking
curiosity and interest in your protein
bar ultimately driving potential
customers towards making a
purchase the second one is interest the
awareness stage has successfully
introduced your brand to potential
customers now in the interest stage you
have peaked their curiosity and they are
ready to learn more this is where you
transform a name into a viable solution
imagine that initial spark of interest
you ignited with your protein bars now
potential customers are asking questions
what flavors are there are they truly
healthy how do they compare to other
options here's how you can cultivate
that interest and nuture them towards
the Desir stage so by informative
website content develop a robust website
that delves deeper into your Brand Story
product features and benefits then there
is engaging social media go Beyond
Basics band promotion share recipes that
incorporate your bars post Interactive
polls your workout routines Etc then
there is targeted email marketing once
you capture email addresses send
informative newsletters featuring
product details all right so this was
about the interest stage now coming to
the desired
stage the awareness stage introduced
your brand and the interest stage ped
your curiosity now in the desired stage
you have gained a spark that transforms
mere interest into business desire of
your product this is where you convince
potential customers that your brand is
the perfect solution to their needs and
problems imagine those intrigued by your
protein bars they understand the
features and the benefits but are they
convinced do they need them here's where
you turn features into emotional
connections and benefits into must have
Solutions so compelling product
demonstrations showcase the
deliciousness and convenience of your
protein bars then comes customer
testimonials share stories of real
people who have benefited from your
product
then there is scarcity and urgency
limited time offers exclusive discount
or pre-launch promotions create a sense
of urgency and exclusivity all right so
this was about desire coming to the next
one which is
action now in the action stage it's time
to convert that desire into a purchase
decision this is where you nudge
potential customers across the finish
line and turn them into loyal customers
imagine that a potential customers who's
craving your delicious and convenient
protein bars they understand the
benefits they are convinced they need
them but will they actually buy them now
here's where scarcity and urgency come
into play so how can you do is limited
time offers highlight discount or
special promotions that expire after a
set period of time phrases like 40% off
on the next 24 hours this will work the
next is exclusive discounts offer
special deals or coupons to a select
group of customers such as email
subscribers or social media followers
then you can do is pre-launch promotions
for a new product generate excitement
with pre-order options or Early Access
discounts all right so this was about it
now moving on to the next topic which is
digital marketing
funnel so there is attract like we
previously discussed this is the first
stage where the goal is to draw people
to your brand think of it as a casting
of wiet to catch the attention of
potential customers you can do this
through blog post social media content
SEO and online ads the idea is to create
content that resonates with your target
audience making them aware of your brand
and what you offer once you have their
attention the next step is to keep them
interested all right so this was about
attract now coming to engage part once
you have attracted people to your brand
the next step is to engage them this
means keeping their interest and
starting a conversation you might use
interactive content such as quizzes or
pools and engaging social media post or
videos the aim is to build a
relationship and get them more
interested in your product or service
with their interest peed the next step
is to gather more information from them
and you can do this by capturing so in
the capture stage you want to capture
the contact information of your
interested audience this is typically
done through lead magnets like free
ebooks webinars or newsletters by
offering something valuable you can
encourage them to give you their email
address or contact details so you can
continue the
conversation now that you have their
contact information it's important to
nurture this
leads next is nurture now that you have
their contact information it's time to
nurture these leads this involves
building a deeper relationships and
guiding them towards making a purchase
you can use email marketing personalized
content and targeting offers to keep
them engaged and interested in your
product or Services the goal is to
address their needs and show them how
your offerings can solve their problems
after nuring the relationship the final
step is to convert these leads into
customers so the next stage is
convert the final stage is converting
these Ned leads into paying customers
this is where all your efforts pay off
you might use special offers discounts
or limited time deals to encourage them
to make a purchase additionally making
the buying process as easy as simp
schless as possible helps ensure they
complete the transaction once they have
converted you have successfully guided
them through the digital marketing
funnel and that's how the model digital
marketing funnel works by attracting
engaging capturing nurturing and
converting you can effectively turn
strangers into loyal customers all right

action that prompts user to take the
next step once they click on the ad they
are directed into the landing page P so

designed to capture the interest of
visitors who clicked on your ad this
page should be highly focused with a
clear message that matches the ads
promise it typically includes an
enticing headline informative content
and a form to capture visitors
information such as their email
addresses the goal is to convert
visitors into leads by getting them to
fill out the form after capturing their
information the next step is to guide
them to the sales page
the next is sales page the sales page is
where you can provide detailed
information about your product or
service this page aims to pursuade
visitors to make a purchase it includes
compelling copy customer testimonials
benefits of the product and a strong
call to action the sales page should
address any potential objections and
provide all the information needed to
make a buying decision once they have
shown the interest it's crucial to keep
them engaged through the indoctrination
emails so next is indoctrination emails
these are a series of of emails sent to
new leads to introduce them to your
brand and the products the goal is to
build relationship and establish trust

welcome message your brand story and
