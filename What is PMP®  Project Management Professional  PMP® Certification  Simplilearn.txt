so let's have a look at today's agenda
at first we will have a crisp
introduction to what is project
management
following that we will understand what
is a project
after that we will look into the
components of project management moving
towards the vital part of this video
what is a project's life cycle and at
last we will explore key focus area in
project management
so first let's have a brief introduction
on what is project management
now project management is the process of
fulfilling project activities that
includes analysis planning executing
monitoring etc where one's knowledge
skills tools and techniques to achieve
project requirements
the primary objective of project
management is to make the project
deliverable
in a finite time under an estimated
budget by understanding the need for
resources for the project undertaken
resources may be the human resources
like manpower technical resources such
as tools and machinery and financial
resources as an estimated budget for the
project
now the project manager should have a
clear idea of what the project is and
what is to be delivered to make the
project successful
a project manager should also ensure
that the project on what it is to be
delivered is covered and executed to the
maximum
now
let's move on and understand what is a
project
project management institute pmi defines
project as a temporary endeavor
to create
now a unique product service or result
the temporary nature of a project
indicates that the project has a finite
beginning and ending
now the output of every project is
unique which builds the capability to
deliver the service example cab or
internet services
so as we have understood what is project
management and what is a project now
let's understand the components of
project management
components of project management include
scope
now scope refers to the aim of creating
a project for a specific purpose whether
it may be for an organization purpose or
as a
service
next is time
time is the approximate time required
for the project from start to the end to
deliver the project within the mentioned
time frame
next is quality now quality of a product
or service features you as unique apart
from others making a better progress
towards the organization by repetitive
orders and services
then we have resources resources help
fulfill a specific task in a project in
the best way possible now resources can
be people equipment fund facilities or
anything else needed to meet the project
requirements
next we have is risk a risk is an
unexpected event that affects the
project's workflow now the risk may
occur in terms of people technology
process or resources
next we have is cost cost refers to the
process of estimating allocating and
monitoring the funds needed in a project
now let's understand the important part
of this video that is project life cycle
a project life cycle includes a series
of steps required for project managers
to manage a project from start to finish
successfully now the project life cycle
consists of five phases
let's understand them in detail so for a
better understanding let's go with an
example
meet mr alex
alex works in an mnc company which
manufactures soft drinks and beverages
he is provided with a task to come up
with a new drink to introduce in the
competitive market as per project life
cycle
now
the first step comes is initiation it
refers to the process of understanding
and collecting information about the
project that includes feasibility and
background checks that helps measure the
project's worth
initially alex and his team go within
discussion to analyze the current market
trend which include various factors like
currently which drink is the best
selling one or what makes the drink
special or why is the demand for the
drink
here alex and his team analyze and
gather resources to work on the provide
task the space is known as initiation
next we have is planning
so the planning phase deals with
creating a blueprint for achieving the
project objective that includes what to
be done how to be done and the result
so far as alex and his team have a clear
description of their product what they
have to come up with
and the feasibility checks including a
clear picture of the current market
trend
now
next alex prepares a plan which he and
his teammates undergo to complete the
provided task within the given time
frame which includes what should be the
drink like a carbonated drink or a fruit
juice etc or the design the product like
what product to use like a plastic
bottle or tetra packs or aluminum tins
what makes the product different from
others in the market and what will be
the result if introduced now
so this part of the project is called
planning
after planning next is execution phase
the execution phase involves the
allocation of resources and making the
deliverables to ensure that the right
resources are selected assigning the
right job to the right skilled workers
or professionals and managing the
project execution task as per the
workflow
now moving next as the plan of for the
project is complete next alex and his
team gathers the required raw materials
machinery and manpower to put the plan
into action and to produce the product
this phase is called execution
next comes monitoring
now in the monitoring phase a project
manager monitors and controls the
project's workflow
the manager must monitor and ensure the
process is going as per the schedule by
fulfilling scope quality matrix etc
whenever a deviation or change occurs it
should be considered and prioritized as
a part of deliverables
so as now the company is manufacturing
the product it is the responsibility of
alex to monitor the product and its
workflow by undertaking multiple checks
like is the product as per the plan
or is this phase completed within the
provided time frame is the product as
per the composition of raw material
mentioned etc and this phase is known as
monitoring
after monitoring we have closure
now the closure is the end stage of the
project life cycle where it is the
summary of the project including what
went wrong and what went right
throughout the process capturing the
details in all the aspects with right
and wrong details of the entire process
now the product is complete as per the
plan and is ready for sale in the market
now alex provides a summary of the
entire project life cycle which contains
a detailed description of what all right
and wrong went through the whole cycle
and this phase is known as closure
so with the help of project life cycle
alex and his team were able to fulfill
their task in the provided time frame in
an effective and efficient way
so moving on let's
have a look at the key focus areas in
the project management
at first we have
scope scope refers to the inputs
provided to the project from the first
step to the last step by determining the
features boundaries
budgets and deadlines of the project the
scope can be divided into two parts
first is product score that ensures
features and functionalities of the
products and then comes the project
scope that focuses on all the activities
like gathering resources templates and
other stuffs
next we have is time or schedule
it is a time estimate for performing a
specific work within a particular time
and achieving the desired objectives the
schedule for a project depends on the
sequence of activities to be performed
in a particular time frame time required
to complete a particular task
evaluating what activities to be done
while performing the time scheduling and
analyzing the dependency between one
task to another
then comes cost now cost refers to the
estimating allocating and monitoring the
funds needed for a project
a few actions are to be taken to ensure
that the project is on the right budget
so estimating or quoting the budget
based on various requirements including
technical and human efforts
also check whether the estimated budget
is right or wrong assumptions are
correct
post justification of the budget
resources used are monitored allocated
and confirmed
for the budget
next comes the quality
quality is the measurable term stating
what a customer or a stakeholder expects
from a project deliverables
now quality includes processes and
activities to be performed to meet the
objectives and requirements for which it
was undertaken
now the project manager must ensure that
the project objectives are delivered as
a project manager cannot become a
quality manager
now quality consists a layer of
processes including auditing the project
a quality control of the project
and lastly we have resource
resources help us carry out a specific
task in a project
in the best possible manner
resources can be in terms of people
equipment
fun facilities or anything else that is
needed to meet the project requirements
when each resource is gathered it is
followed by a series of sub steps which
helps to choose the best resource among
other available resources for example if
human resources are gathered then we
have five stages which is also known as
team dynamics
