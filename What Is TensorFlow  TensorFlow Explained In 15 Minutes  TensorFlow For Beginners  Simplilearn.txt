new jobs will be created while 83
million may be phased out so keeping in
this mind today we are going to learn
about tens of flow so you would be
wondering what exactly is tensor flow
actually tensor flow is an open-source
deep learning framework developed by
Google brains team in this video we will
explore how to get started with
tensorflow leveraging its capabilities
similar to numpy for numerical
computations we will cover generating
random tensors manipulating tensor
Dimensions performing various tensor
operations you will learn to change data

in the description box so let's get
started so guys let's start with
tensorflow as you all know that
tensorflow is an open-source machine
learning framework which is developed by
Google brains team it's designed for
building and deploying machine learning
models with a focus on deep learning
applications tensorflow offers a
comprehensive ecosystem of tools
libraries and Comm Community Resources
that make it easier to build train and
deploy machine learning models across
different platforms from desktops to
mobile devices and to the cloud now
let's get started with a tensor flow to
get started with the tensor flow let's
first understand some of the features of
tensorflow first of all tensorflow is a
versatile and flexible library of python
it supports wide array of algorithm and
it is adaptable to variety of tasks the
next one is it has a ecos system and
tools tensorflow provides a rich
ecosystem of tools that help researchers
and developers to deploy ml models more
effectively and finally it has a very
good community and support now to get
started with tensorflow you first need
to install it and this can be easily
done using pip you can use the python
package installer you can install
tensorflow using the following command
but before that let me give you a
highlight what we are going to do so
guys we are going to install tensorflow
then we will move with tensor flow with
numpy and then we are going to generate
the random tensors let us try to
complete this task so for the same we
are going to use Google collab so guys
as you can see all over here that we
have open the Google collab so this is a
cloud-based ID and it's a very wonderful
ID I will also recommend you to use the
same now let's get started so first what
we are going to do we are going to
install the tensorflow
so our first task is
installing tens
oflow so for the same I have used pip
install tensorflow now let us try to run
this but before that you have to connect
it so let it get connected so as you can
see it has been connected to Python 3
Google compute engine now let us try to
run this
so guys as you can see all way here that
our tensor flow is installed and we are
installing it using the PIP now let us
move to the next part the next step is
importing tensor flow as steer so let us
run
this okay now we have imported the
tensor flow let us move to the next step
now in the next step we are going to
check the version of tensorflow so first
the same I am printing TF do version now
let us try to run this so you can see
our version of tensorflow is
2.15 now we are going to use tensor flow
with numpy tensorflow can be used
similarly to numpy for numerical
computations in fact many tensorflow
operations mirror those found in napai
making it easy for those with numai to
transition to tensor flow now here is an
example of creating a tensor and
Performing some arithmetic operations so
you can see all over here I have created
a tensor with a equal to TF do constant
and parenthesis and inside that there's
a square bracket 1 2 and three similarly
I've created a tensor B now we are going
to perform an element wise addition so
for the same I have taken the variable C
all over here and I am adding TF do add
a and b now what is this TF guide
so remember this we are importing tensor
flow stf so for the same we are using it
now we are using a keyword called
constant all over here for creating a
tensor now in order to perform the
addition I'm using the add keyword and
I'm adding these tensors A and B now
similarly for multiplication I'm using
tf. multiply and a and b now let us try
to run this
so now guys as you can see all over here
that when I'm adding it it is printing
t.n 579 and it's telling it shape is
three and it is of data type integer now
similarly if I want to check for D so
you can see all over here it is going to
print 4 10 and 80 with of shape three
and data type as integer of 32 bits so
we have completed this part now let us
move to the next part
now guys in the next step we are going
to generate the random tensors
generating random numbers is a common
task in machine learning and tensorflow
provides various functions to create
random tensors for instance you can
generate a tensor of random values from
normal distribution or uniform
distribution so for example I have
distributed random tensor from a normal
distribution so I have declared a
variable random normal and tf. random
and I'm using tf. random. normal and
three and 3 are the values where mean
equals to 0.0 and standard deviation I
have put equals to
1.0 now let us try to run this so now
let us try to print it okay
print so you can see all over here the
tensor we are generating from the normal
distribution it's something like this
and similarly if I want to generate a
random tensor for uniform distribution
okay with minimum value equals to zero
and maximum value equals to 10 okay so
these are the parameters that you have
to remember for normal distribution it's
mean and standard deviation and for
uniform distribution you have minimum
value and the maximum value let's copy
this
now you can see we have randomly
generated tensor from the uniform
distribution the shape of 3 and three
and data type is float now let us move
to the next part we are going to add a
dimension to the tensor in many
scenarios you might need to change the
shape of your tensor by adding new
dimension and this can be easily done
using the tf. expand dims command now
suppose this is the code
so guys you can see all over here this
is our original tensor and it is
declared with a variable tensor equals
to TF do constant and we are adding a
new dimension which is expanded tensor
equals to TF do expand dims tensor zero
now we have added a new dimension all
over here so this is going to add a new
dimension at a specified index and it is
going to transform a 1D tensor into a 2d
tensor let us see so we are going to
print the expanded tensor
so you can see guys I have printed the
expanded tensor all over here now let us
move to the next part that is tensor
operation tensor flow provides a wide
range of tensor operations such as
reshaping slicing and mathematical
operations so here are few examples so
guys as you can see all over here so I
have declared a variable called tensor
all over here and then I'm reshaping a
tensor okay with the given tensor that
we have created and I have also added it
shape 3 and one now we are slicing the
tensor so tf. slice tensor indexing 0 to
two and we are also doing the
mathematical operation all over here
which is a sum tensor and we are
reducing the sum to tensor now now let
us try to run this code and see what is
our output so you can see all over here
that this is our original tensor with
the shape three and reshaped tensor is
something like this so it has a shape of
three and one okay now the slice tensor
you can see all over here that it is 1
and two and with a shape of two and sum
of the tensor is six the shape is null
now let us move to the next part that is
changing the data type of a tensor you
can change the data type of a tensor
using tf. cast this is useful when you
need to ensure that tensors have the
correct type for certain operations so
let us try to do this so you can see all
over here that I'm creating a tensor of
integers okay then I'm changing its data
type to float so I'm using the word
called cast okay now if I try to run
this okay so
print so you can see all over here that
it is coming 1 do two Dot 3 Dot and it
has a shape of three similarly we are
going to remove all the single dimension
to remove all single Dimensions from a
tensor you can use TF do squeeze and
this is particularly useful when you
have tensors with unnecessary Dimensions
let me show you
one so guys as you can see all over here
that I have created a tensor with a
single Dimension okay now I'm removing
all the single Dimensions all the way
here here now this is squeeze tensor so
you can see now we have 1 2 and three
and we have shape three and null so this
is how we have removed all the single
Dimensions now moving ahead we are going
to move on one hot encoding now guys you
would be wondering what is one hot
encoding basically one hot encoding is a
technique that is used to convert
categorial values into binary Vector
representation tensorflow provides tf1
do hot to perform this encoding so here
is a sample code for the
same now you can see all over here that
we have performed the one hot encoding
into the categories now we can see all
over here that one hot encoded equals to
tf. one hot and there's categories and
depth equals to three now
and this basically has completed our
objective of Performing the one hot
encoding on the categories so this was
our Tor basically and here we have used
the tf. one hot for performing the one
hot encoding on this given tensor with
depth equals to three so guys that was
