hello everyone
welcome to simply learns youtube channel
in this session
we will discuss a very widely used term
in statistics that is correlation
and we will see what is the significance
of correlation and where it is used
so
let's discuss the agenda for today's
session
we'll start this tutorial by
understanding what is correlation
then
we want to discuss the two types of
correlation
and correlation coefficient
after that we will see the limitations
of correlation and some real life
applications of correlation so let's get
started
what is correlation
correlation refers to a statistical
relationship between the two entities
it measures the extent to which the two
variables are linearly related
for example
the price and demand of a product is in
correlation they are linearly related
the value of correlation always lies
between minus one to plus one
there are mainly two types of
correlation the first one is positive
correlation
a positive correlation means that the
linear relationship is positive
and the two variables increases or
decreases in the same direction
the number of trees cut down and the
probability of erosion are in
correlation when one increases other
also increases and vice versa
negative correlation
a negative correlation is just the
opposite
the relationship line has a negative
slope and the variables change in
opposing directions
for example if you decrease the speed of
the car the time taken to reach the
destination increases
this is the negative correlation
correlation coefficient
the correlation coefficient which is
denoted by r gives us a measure of the
strength of the linear relationship
between the two variables
the value is denoted by the letter r and
it ranges from minus 1 to plus 1.
if it is less than 0 it implies that
there is a negative correlation the
minus 1 indicates there is a strong
negative correlation between the
variables
if r is greater than 0 it implies there
is a positive correlation and plus 1 is
the strongest
point of a positive correlation
when r is equal to 0 we can say that
there is no correlation between the
variables
there are also some limitations of
correlation
the first one is
correlation does not give you every
insight on the data mean and standard
deviation are still the important
parameters to get the insight of a data
the second one is the data will not
produce a straight line every time and
it will be difficult to predict the
value of r just with the straight line
or the slope of the graph
now let's see some real life
applications of correlation
if you take any e-commerce company whose
website is accessed by millions of users
all over the world the company can look
at all the data and they can measure how
much time was spent by the customer and
the respective money spent by the
customer we can also predict the unique
users that visited the website and how
it affected the sales in a day
the third application can be the patient
blood pressure and the medication used
the level of patient blood pressure and
the
effect of medication on it can be in a
correlation now let's jump on to excel
workbook to see how you can calculate
the correlation coefficient
so here we are on the excel workbook if
you see we have the temperature in
degree celsius such as 20 25 30 40 50
and 60
and the corresponding sales of ice cream
in the units to calculate the
correlation
we'll use the coral function now we have
array one and add a two
so we'll select the array one that is
temperature in degree celsius and the
adder 2 will be our sales of ice cream
so you can see there is a very strong
correlation between the temperature of a
day and the sales of ice cream unit
if the temperature increases the sales
of ice cream unit increases and if the
temperature decreases the sales of ice
cream rate decreases
so with this we come to an end of this
tutorial
