early forms of research were conducted
in fields like biology chemistry and
physics and focused on to looking into
things we could observe and even measure
but we have come a long way qualitative
research is concerned with why people
behave the way they do how are opinions
formed how and why cultures have
developed in the way they are now before
we dive into the topic we must
understand what qualitative data is
first but before we move ahead let us
discuss the agenda for today's session
we'll start this tutorial with a quick
understanding of what is qualitative
data and then we'll understand what is
the qualitative research method and up
next we will discuss various methods
using this qualitative method and once
we get familiar with what qualitative
data is and its various methods let us
discuss some advantages of qualitative
research method and finally we'll wrap
up this session by discussing some
disadvantages of qualitative research
method but before we begin if you're new
to the channel and haven't subscribed
already consider getting subscribed to
our Channel simply learn to stay updated
with all the latest tech content and hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from us now generally we categorize data
into qualitative
quantitative and mixed methods now
qualitative data focuses on text and
description whereas quantitative data
focuses on numbers and statistics which
can be called hard data but the mixed
method combines elements of both
quantitative as well as the qualitative
data now qualitative data is non-numeric
information such as videos notes images
survey results and text documents in
other words the data cannot be measured
or narrowed on with specific parameters
if it is not measurable then how it is
used what are the different methods in
it now for that we have to understand
qualitative research is about now
qualitative research aims to understand
ideas opinions or experiences by
gathering and evaluating non-numerical
data such as text video or even audio it
is used to discover complex details
about a topic or develop fresh research
Concepts now data is the new oil things
which are going to discover about
qualitative research are all related to
the data right so let me convey how
simply learn can help you master it
please check out the course on data
analytics in collaboration with IBM with
real life projects and business case
studies and also let us know have you
ever used any qualitative research
methods if yes please mention in the
comment section below where and where
you have used it now in general we have
five methods in qualitative research
first one is content analysis and then
we have discourse analysis next on the
list we have narrative analysis and
fourth on the list we have grounded
Theory and finally we have thematic
analysis so let us now talk about them
in detailed one by one let us discuss
about them in detail now first we have
content analysis now the research This
research method examines the presence of
certain words subjects and text in
videos images and audio files that are
completely non-numeric now this method
is conducted to examine or get customer
feedback about their experience and
opinion on the brand the method converts
qualitative data into quantitative one
and helps Brands to make reliable
conclusions now the most popular
application of content analysis nowadays
is in the analyzing social media field
now you will be surprised by the broad
range of content analysis software
Solutions today they assist you in
investigating nearly any sort of
business documents unstructured text
emails social media conversations
comments news blogs and much more we can
connect analysis manually too by using
tools like lexalytics to identify
communication patterns and create
conceptual analysis which is always
advisable
next let us discuss what is discourse
analysis the study of return or spoken
language with its social context is done
using the research method known as
critical discourse analysis it seeks to
comprehend how language is applied in
Practical context now discourse analysis
will appropriately interpret languages
in terms of any socio-political way they
are used in both primary as well as the
secondary data it can be used in
newspapers books government documents
broachers and advertisements as well now
it can be applied to oral language or
any non-verbal form of communication so
when to not use discourse analysis is
the main question now if your study is
narrowly focused and if you're not
concerned about the meaning of the
language used then it is the last choice
so let us now move ahead and discuss
what is narrative analysis is narrative
is omnipresent it is everywhere but it
depends on researchers on how to use the
narrative to their advantage now
researchers employ narrative analysis to
better understand how research
participants create stories and
narratives from their experiences hence
narrative analysis involves a second
layer of interpretation the research
subject first used storytelling to
analyze their own life the researcher
then analyzes how that narrative was put
together now the use of narratives in
narrative research might be taken from
journals letters dialogues
autobiographies in-depth interviews
transcripts focus group transcripts and
other various forms of relative
qualitative research so researchers
mostly use this analysis to write thesis
papers on any narrative now for instance
although it is a human nature to
construct stories and narratives when
analyzing one's own life some data
Gathering techniques are better suited
to your research participants of
self-narrative
all right let us now move ahead and
discuss what is grounded Theory analysis
now a qualitative approach called
grounded theory is meant to Aid in
developing new hypothesis and inferences
now researchers use any preferred data
collection method and then evaluate the
data to develop Concepts now they
develop theories by contrasting these
ideas so they keep going until they hit
sample saturation after which no further
data will cause them to revise their
Theory then they present the concluding
hypothesis it enables you to investigate
a specific occurrence or process and
develop new hypothesis founded on
Gathering and examining empirical facts
so the human resource department often
uses its to collect data from employees
about what a company lacks so they might
study why employees are facing certain
issues in that segment
and finally we have the Thematic
analysis studying meaning patterns is
what thematic analysis is all about in
other words it involves looking at your
data and its data sets theme to find
significance of it more significantly
because your research questions guide
this method you don't need to find
everything in the data in thematic
analysis you will use codes so the
basically concentrate on the important
components connected to your research
questions researchers may use any
desired method of data collecting and
then they will analyze the data to
create concepts by opposing these
Notions they create theories so it is a
good approach when you want people to
review a brand knowledge and experience
from a data set so there are two types
of it which is inductive approach and
reductive approach the steps involved
are Step One is familiarization it is
used to get to know the data now the
second step is coding next step is to
code the data say it about the
perception of the brand among let's say
100 customers I and finally we have to
generate a theme so we look over the
codes we have and then identify patterns
among them so that was all about the
various methods that are used in
qualitative research I hope you
understood this now every process comes
with both advantages and disadvantages
now coming to advantages of qualitative
research first we have room for more
research it changes the customer's
attitude towards the company as
engagement increases by conducting more
research on customer experiences
now it is a very flexible approach if
useful information has been collected
researchers can immediately change the
method or any other room for improvement
is always available in qualitative
research
it is also very cost effective as it is
a straightforward method but information
is collected from every customer it also
adds that it saves money and produces
faster results
now it acts as a Content generator as
well so what do you mean by content
generator here we have discussed how we
collect social economic data using
qualitative research so this raw data is
then turned into useful information to
create valuable content it also provides
perceptions that are specific to an
organization modern Brands can use
qualitative approaches generally to a
specific project for example you can
conduct research on clothing brand with
1000 participants or so
now what are the disadvantages of
qualitative research first one is
obviously loss of data now this is a
serious problem one faces during the
qualitative approach now data must be
collected and recognized initially by
the researchers researchers who cannot
see the data when they observe it will
lose the required data which lessens the
accuracy
it can be affected by buyers now you
might have heard about fake news most
frequently right so this term addresses
the bias that can be present in media
reporting and can be consciously or
subconsciously affect the data it can be
time consuming as well researchers take
longer to acquire data since they go in
many directions it also take time to
sort through all of the additional stuff
information as well so every data point
is analyzed subjectively and hence its
value is never certain which can be a
lot of time consuming process
sometimes it can create questionable
results because it depends on the
individual the researcher determines
what is included in the qualitative
research process and what is eliminated
because of this the data collection
procedure is quite subjective so these
are some of the advantages and
disadvantages of qualitative research
and with that we'll come to the end of
today's session and here is a reminder
to check out the data analytics course
on our Channel we will leave the link in
the description below so that was all
about qualitative research in nutshell I
