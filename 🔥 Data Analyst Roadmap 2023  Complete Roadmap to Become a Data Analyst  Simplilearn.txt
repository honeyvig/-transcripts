it so let us know the skills in detail
what are the basic skill sets required
for a data analyst
data analyst must know
basic mathematics and statistics
programming skills
machine learning and also data
visualizations tools so let us know what
are the basics that you need to learn as
a data analyst
mathematics it is always better to know
basic mathematics like linear algebra
and probability fundamentals linear
algebra is used in data pre-processing
and transformation which is the critical
process of every data analyst
statistics a branch of mathematics that
deals with collection analysis
presentation and implementation
probability we know that probability is
the study of How likely something will
happen which is essential for concluding
both probability and statistics are the
backbones of data analysis it is
feasible to become a data analyst with
only a basic understanding of these
three areas of mathematics but in order
to remain relevant and grow as a data
analyst once mathematical knowledge
should not be restricted compulsively
use some of the tools as a data
analystic what are that
first is Microsoft Excel it is the most
well-known spreadsheet software in the
world it also has computation and
graphic features that are excellent for
data analysts no matter your area of
expertise or additional software you
might want Excel is a standard in the
industry it's useful built-in features
include form design tools and pivot
table it also generate a wide range of
additional features that help simplify
data manipulation
as a programming language every data
analyst should know python it is easy to
learn and has a simple syntax python is
quite adaptable and includes a vast
variety of resource libraries that are
appropriate for a wide range of diverse
data analytics activities these
libraries help in numerical and data
computation the pandas and numpy
libraries for instance are excellent for
supporting standard data processing and
stabilizing highly computational
operations you can also choose between
Python or RR is a well-known open source
programming language much like python
data visualization tool as we previously
mentioned data visualization tool is
also necessary to become a data analyst
power bi is a user-friendly interface
makes building interactive visual
reports and dashboard simple its most
vital selling point is its superb data
integration it works flawlessly with
Cloud sources like Google and Facebook
analytics as well as text files SQL
servers and exit
Tableau is one of the best commercial
data analysis tool available it handles
huge amounts of data better than many
other bi tools and S is effortless it
has a visual drag and drop interface
however because it has no scripting
layer there is a limit to what Tableau
can do for example it could be better
for pre-processing data or building more
complex calculations
you might have heard about MySQL a lot
of time it is a standard language for
interacting with databases and it is
very helpful when working with
structured data SQL creates
user-friendly dashboards that may
present in various data ways and since
it is so simple to send complex commands
to databases and change data in seconds
it has commands like add edit delete
data in addition SQL is an excellent
tool for creating data warehouses
because of its Simplicity Clarity and
interactivity
overall I would suggest that to become a
data analyst you should work on
programming languages like python or R
plus MySQL to work on databases adding
to that Excel plus visualization tools
like Tableau or power bi you now know
what are the skills are and how it is
used what are you up to in an
organization as a data analyst
to create and evaluate the report using
automated tools like Tableau or
powerbeer
