1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,120
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,490
tutorial my name's sandy Bakshi and

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,740
today I'm joined by rich hire T so

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,059
welcome rich thank you for joining us

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:12,960
today would you like to quickly

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,570
introduce yourself lucky to be with you

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,490
thank you I'm rejecting I've worked for

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,210
IBM I'm a developer advocate working on

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,869
the Watson services so our role our team

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,570
have a small team we focus on the

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,040
cognitive AI side of things and our job

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,070
is to create assets for developers yes

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,360
so we go and create actual applications

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,300
that utilize a lot of lots of services

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,970
and we provide a lot of information

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,460
about how so developers can get started

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,600
a running start with pretty extensive

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,020
read B's and tutorials and blogs and all

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,550
that stuff that we'll get into later on

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,520
that's correct that so that we get

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
developers on to the Watson services as

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,290
quickly as possible that's nice thank

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,030
you very much this is really really

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,439
interesting stuff you just mentioned in

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,690
fact the tutorial today is all about the

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,580
Watson discovery service and more

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,800
specifically a new feature that's going

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,659
to be coming to all Watson discovery

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,150
service instances very very soon now

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,070
that's the step feature we'll talk about

31
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,600
in just a moment that allows you to get

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,490
structured information and knowledge

33
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,440
from your unstructured information which

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,810
is really interesting but for now I'd

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,700
like to begin by talking about how we

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,890
can actually use the Watson discovery

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,830
service in a much easier way using the

38
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,260
color patterns that enable you to create

39
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,030
Watson applications so right rajulun

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,320
tell us a little bit more about that you

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,540
discovery UI the in created as a code

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,500
pattern sure so what we did was we took

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,040
a real use case we we took it so first

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,549
of all Watson discovery is great it's a

45
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,110
ingesting unstructured data yes an

46
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,530
indexing it

47
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,200
enrichments so that it could be queried

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,020
in a number of ways that's the power of

49
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,590
discovery so what we did was we took

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,560
basically a thousand Airbnb reviews for

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,929
the City of Austin this is freely

52
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,230
available data yeah yeah so that's part

53
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,590
of the behind most of our code matters

54
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,020
we always use data that people can get

55
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,720
for free we have access to these

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,280
services that they can get on a free

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,560
trial basis okay so users never have to

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,920
pay for anything to get started right so

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,200
our code pattern basically takes a look

60
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,110
at that data you can we can use the

61
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,940
Watson discovery tooling to look at that

62
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,130
and try to try to get some information

63
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,040
glean some information from that through

64
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,620
the tooling a little bit ugly little the

65
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,570
interface just individual queries you're

66
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,970
not it's not formatted very well so what

67
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,920
the UI did was just put in a happy face

68
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,900
around that using the API is making the

69
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,820
same types of queries that users would

70
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,030
typically make presented in a nice UI so

71
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,519
people can see it and get some data

72
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,190
information about that way that's great

73
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,019
all right so now let's take a look and

74
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,060
how easy it is for you to get started

75
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,040
and actually use that new discovery UI

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,799
let's take a look at thousand Airbnb

77
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,110
reviews and take a look at what kinds of

78
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,459
insights were handling

79
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,730
okay so anyway this is the this is eek

80
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,700
developer code pattern home page which

81
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,150
is available at developer ibm.com so

82
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,709
this is where the landing page for all

83
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,540
of our code patterns so as a developer

84
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,610
this is where you'd come to just you

85
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,739
know you have a specific need or you're

86
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,390
trying to look for an example of this

87
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,060
specific service so you would come here

88
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,610
to find that that's great so we have

89
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,780
some some filtering over here or some

90
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,150
hints to get you to where you want to go

91
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,920
I'm going to go directly to the app that

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,610
I created so for each one of these

93
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,019
developer patterns we have this nice

94
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,250
page overview page which allows you to

95
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,950
view a demo try it out you can actually

96
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,110
run it without doing anything just

97
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,020
clicking the button you'll get there we

98
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,940
have a description of the of the code

99
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,280
pattern overview this is where you're

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,980
going to determine what

101
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,629
you really want to dig deeper or not

102
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,220
yeah hopefully it gives you enough

103
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,799
information for that as with all the

104
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,570
code patterns we have a diagram flow

105
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,340
describing the services and the

106
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,000
interactions between the pieces yes so

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,850
from there let's go ahead and get the

108
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,949
code that takes us to the github repo

109
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:29,870
again all of our code patterns are

110
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,320
housed on github publicly they're freely

111
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,440
open sourced so people can take them do

112
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,760
what they want with them they can

113
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,229
actually contribute to the code if they

114
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,350
find bugs they can log issues or

115
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,160
whatever so I'm gonna go to the github

116
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,750
repo here first page is always a detail

117
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,510
to read me so for this one we talked

118
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,280
about a little bit about what discovery

119
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,190
does for you this is the enrichment part

120
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,800
when we talked about where it pulls out

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,500
entities categories concepts keywords

122
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,320
and sentiment yes and we'll we'll dig a

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,850
little bit deeper in how you set that up

124
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,750
with your data mm-hmm here's that same

125
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,729
architecture diagram where we're

126
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:16,280
ingesting where we're feeding JSON files

127
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,330
into Watson discovery the API is

128
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,530
accessed as that discovery shows it to

129
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,860
the user mm-hmm

130
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,539
here's a little hand drawing of some of

131
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:27,950
them at the layout of what its gonna

132
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,590
look like I thought this was a pretty

133
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,419
cool this is what we thought about

134
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,580
additionally how we what we wanted to

135
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,560
show to the user yes

136
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,110
so these were all the UI components so

137
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,169
not only we showing you how to access

138
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,150
discovery but we're also going down and

139
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,250
showing and using specific obviously we

140
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,660
were writing codes we have to choose a

141
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,870
specific framework yes so what we like

142
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,849
about no this one's written to note what

143
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:54,500
we like about note is that it's a little

144
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,990
more freely open to other frameworks

145
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,710
it's not so cookie cutter you know you

146
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,800
have your choice of things in fact here

147
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,360
we talked about all the components this

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
one uses nodejs we based on react we

149
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,449
have an express back-end yes this one

150
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,639
uses semantic UI components which is

151
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,750
cool it uses chart and just for testing

152
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,719
that's nice so I can see that's all the

153
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,470
steps here are really neatly written

154
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,630
which I love so if I'm a developer and

155
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,620
it's just starting off with Watson

156
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,870
discovery I wouldn't need to you know

157
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,950
start from scratch entirely

158
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,440
documentation there's a clear list of

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,730
steps here that's gonna help me out so I

160
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,160
like that yeah and you don't want code

161
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,080
snippets right you want you want fully

162
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,580
functional code that's what's on the

163
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,250
liver so we have a video which you can

164
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,380
go click on I encourage you to do that

165
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,820
mm-hmm and if you link the only industry

166
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,330
actually good and that that's a deeper

167
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,060
dive into this thing so here's the steps

168
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,510
you talked about now for most of our

169
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,790
code matters we offer a deployed IBM

170
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,630
Cloud button which is convenience

171
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,980
basically there's some setup involved I

172
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,840
would recommend users who really want to

173
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,940
know this stuff to actually go through

174
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,470
the manual process without loading a

175
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,330
locally provisioning of the services

176
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,590
yourself yes that's the only where

177
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,980
you're gonna learn but there's we always

178
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,660
offer this option which does a

179
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,150
provisioning for you and pushes a code

180
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,760
and deploys it on the cloud and you can

181
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,300
access it that way that's convenient yes

182
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,890
so these are the steps I would recommend

183
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,440
running locally starts with cloning the

184
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
repo then we go through the creating of

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,330
the IBM cloud service in this case is

186
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,690
just discovery and we'll show you that a

187
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,390
bit the end result of what has house but

188
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,460
but essentially you you provision a

189
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,669
discovery instance and you have you

190
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,950
point to the data that you want to

191
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,729
ingest yes and this will give you your

192
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:55,910
shows kind of takes you through that

193
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,040
mm-hmm and they get ingested into

194
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,800
discovery so again these are the steps

195
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,450
involved with that at the end of that

196
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,800
you're going to have a set of

197
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,610
credentials that Watts provides for you

198
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,260
for to run this application you need to

199
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,320
plug those into what we are env file yes

200
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,140
and there's B&B file just for those not

201
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,690
familiar with that UJ and ojs would be

202
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,560
the environment file

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,370
yep telling you all the different

204
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,250
credentials yes so it's basically

205
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,810
username password and the pointer to

206
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,729
exact instance of discovery we want to

207
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:32,310
talk to and then you just run the

208
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,490
application and it's available on port

209
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,860
3000

210
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,930
so let's go to first let's go to the

211
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,690
discovery service

212
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,640
so here's those Airbnb ratings I've

213
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,530
already created the collection perfect

214
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,010
if we click on that you'll see that

215
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,300
we've loaded in 999 records perfect one

216
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,010
of the key things about the enrichment

217
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,310
is is done through a configuration file

218
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,510
so here's where you access that and you

219
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,030
notice here that for us we want all of

220
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,930
these enrichments to take place okay

221
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,580
another concept that we're going to go

222
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,610
into later with your with the knowledge

223
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,370
graph is that we need to add the

224
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,720
mentions like to this configuration

225
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,430
which isn't available which is not

226
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,590
available this tool so we had to do that

227
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,670
programmatically Juby API so if you take

228
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,200
a look at especially we take a look at

229
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,240
natural language understanding you'll

230
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,310
realize that under the egg teeth there's

231
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,040
also a specific kind of oh there's

232
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
another enrichment can I have been

233
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,550
mentions that's not available through

234
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,200
the tuning currently so you're gonna

235
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,520
have to add that manually but we'll get

236
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,900
into that in just a moment when we're

237
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,310
talking about the new feature that I was

238
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,690
telling you about the knowledge graph

239
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,360
right perfect

240
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,910
so here's the data and it pulls out

241
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,570
things like top entities these are what

242
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,380
we call aggregate information so it

243
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,260
takes a look at all the 999 of them and

244
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,610
it pulls out the things that it finds

245
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,860
most most often yes so we have related

246
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,560
concepts the hierarchies so it's all

247
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,990
cool stuff displayed to you you can

248
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,420
actually dig deeper look at some of the

249
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,990
the actual fields it pulls out mm-hmm

250
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,600
we can run queries through the tooling

251
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,640
yes wish I had a nice query I can run

252
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,290
it's about Airbnb ease and Austin so I'm

253
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,660
going to say near the college we'll see

254
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,690
what we get all right so we get some

255
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,220
hits about from the ratings themselves

256
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,270
again this is not easy to read it gives

257
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,870
you scores based on how well Watson

258
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,019
thinks it

259
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,939
meets the criteria for your search yeah

260
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:53,949
those kind of things so the whole

261
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:55,720
purpose behind the UI is to is to make

262
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,420
this more readable and accessible to the

263
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,769
user absolutely

264
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:05,980
so let's go to the UI so here it is I'm

265
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,610
running on port 3000 off that same data

266
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,279
these are all of the reviews and notice

267
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,899
we have those enrichments we talked

268
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,119
about as filters so this is what you

269
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,379
build with the kind of pattern so when

270
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,730
you actually go ahead download the code

271
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,799
pattern run it with NPM this is what

272
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,410
you're gonna get a little UI for Watson

273
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,949
discovery right so these things are

274
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:29,139
pretty obvious it talks about the

275
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,869
entities and it's in and or the

276
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:34,119
enrichments each category tells you the

277
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:37,569
number of hits what category it found we

278
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:41,049
have a nice tag cloud here with the top

279
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,329
entities or any of the other merchants

280
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,309
you want to choose we also have a

281
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,600
sentiment chart this is based on

282
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,009
Watson's determination of sentiment

283
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,470
which is different than a rating so the

284
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,740
user has rated the facility the Airbnb

285
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,929
rental but Watson has looked at the

286
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:01,179
actual text beyond text so the wording

287
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,459
of the rating and determined a positive

288
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:05,769
or negative sign yes not towards

289
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:08,529
necessarily the actual place but towards

290
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,360
the situation that was described in the

291
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,149
review yes and in this case you could

292
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,029
see most of them are favorable mm-hm

293
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:18,279
we have a nice trending graph here so we

294
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,920
could see how the term Austin has

295
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,730
trended over time I don't know if that's

296
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,860
very relevant one but I'm just going to

297
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,040
oh it's the actual scores over time

298
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,069
mm-hmm

299
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:37,269
so you can use different different

300
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,929
values here

301
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:44,529
yes I got a good one here so we can take

302
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,759
a lot of the concepts yeah we go and of

303
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,389
course we can also there's some other

304
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,799
niceties here we can filter the the

305
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,559
matches the actual ratings we can show

306
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,869
based on they go to the lowest rate the

307
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:01,089
lows are negative sentiments

308
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,040
there we go so as you can see there are

309
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,069
quite a few people that have negative

310
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,709
experiences with Airbnb but this one

311
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:12,649
over here about South by Southwest says

312
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,629
Lisa was great which is positive

313
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,939
welcoming cue bungalow and good

314
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:19,129
references for food around town okay but

315
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,509
this is where the negative part comes in

316
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:20,930
all right

317
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,720
when I broke a key she came armed with

318
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,850
bolt cutters and rescued my computer

319
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,279
from the locked cabinet above and beyond

320
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,379
now as a human you can tell this

321
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:33,230
technically positive but Watson took the

322
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,319
situation into context and said hey you

323
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,420
broke a key but luckily someone came

324
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,740
armed with bolt cutters but the

325
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,290
situation generally here was negative if

326
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,819
this hadn't happened it would be not

327
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,980
positive that's why Watson gave me

328
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,499
negative rating if you wanted to say

329
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,509
make this more relevant to Airbnb and

330
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:52,189
try and predict what someone's rating

331
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:54,589
would be based off of the text then in

332
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:56,149
that case you would probably have to

333
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:57,800
train your own model either a with the

334
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,389
Watson studio over the natural language

335
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,399
classifier or something that you seemed

336
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,540
fit but for the sentiment this is this

337
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,009
is what the sentiment understanding

338
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:09,470
currently does right great explanation

339
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:15,399
okay so let's go back to discovery and

340
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,290
let's talk about how we can further

341
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,660
enhance this data through building

342
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,490
relationships and they're not the

343
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,529
knowledge rap sounds good okay all right

344
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:25,879
so now once you get a little bit deeper

345
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,550
into Watson discovery by taking a look

346
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,339
at the knowledge grouse boy what does

347
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,439
the knowledge graph - well imagine this

348
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,199
for the Airbnb reviews we've got people

349
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,029
who are viewing different places at

350
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,550
Airbnb now let's just say we want to

351
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,980
extract some structured knowledge some

352
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,439
kind of facts so we're able to find from

353
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,569
that text and we want ballistically

354
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,879
display it in a graph like let's just

355
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:52,769
say we've got Fiona now Fiona

356
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,259
is someone who actually hosts guests on

357
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,720
Airbnb now of course these Airbnb

358
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,629
reviews are from Austin and so please

359
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,489
these are host two that are of course

360
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,519
Austin we know that already but if it

361
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,110
weren't as obvious to us like for

362
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,179
example if we were taking mobile reviews

363
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,129
into account we need information like

364
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:11,699
this

365
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,549
now one more thing fiona is hosting

366
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,649
people in downtown Austin

367
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,709
so downtown is technically considered as

368
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,559
a separate location by Watson and this

369
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,499
is downtown in the south of Austin so

370
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:29,160
cells is also a separate location now

371
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,199
this is how the knowledge graph works

372
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,689
all of this is a really complex

373
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,059
unstructured natural language but with

374
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,679
the knowledge graph you can go ahead and

375
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,480
determine relationships between all of

376
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,670
these entities we know that downtown

377
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,619
Austin and South are geo political

378
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:46,470
entities or locations and fiona is a

379
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,749
person and so fiona is located in Austin

380
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,939
okay so we Watson is able to tell us

381
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:57,809
that fiona is located in Austin Watson's

382
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,490
also able to tell us fiona is located

383
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,069
downtown and then Watson can go even

384
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,860
deeper and say downtown is located in

385
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,749
Austin and all of these relationships

386
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,839
are being found from simply natural

387
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,540
language and then it also tells us at

388
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,079
downtown is located in the south and

389
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,779
then all we need to do is build an

390
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,730
algorithm they can understand this kind

391
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,279
of graph but much much larger of course

392
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,559
because this is only a small snippet of

393
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,639
all the different knowledge that

394
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,309
discovery was able to uncover and just

395
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:34,290
like that we can understand unstructured

396
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,299
data through the Watson discovery

397
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,519
service using knowledge graph

398
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,619
unfortunately since it's in beta it's

399
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,749
only currently available to advanced and

400
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:44,970
premium instances so if you have an

401
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,709
advance or a premium instance of lots of

402
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,929
discovery great you can follow along

403
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:51,059
if not then highly recommend you take a

404
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,009
look at how it works just so you're

405
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,579
ready when Watson Isco

406
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,350
has this speech we're rolling out to all

407
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,899
the other kinds of instances as well all

408
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,639
right so now in order to enable the

409
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,019
knowledge graph feature with your

410
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,999
discovery instance you first will have

411
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,010
to give Watson correct enrichments for

412
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,289
its people to find out watch though the

413
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:10,089
knowledge graph so what I recommend you

414
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,250
do is you go over to the Watson swagger

415
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,169
interface now what this is it's

416
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,959
basically the API Explorer for Watson

417
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
you can find at the Watson API Explorer

418
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,789
Angela mix net there will be a link to

419
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:24,069
it in the description below now if you

420
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,899
scroll down you can see every single

421
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:28,750
different kind of API call that you can

422
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,399
make to the Watson discovery service

423
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,320
there are lots of them and they're

424
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,179
really useful but the one that we want

425
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,279
to use is actually get your

426
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,590
configuration now your configuration is

427
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,360
what tells Watson what exactly it does

428
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,919
with different data sources and how

429
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,779
exactly it enriches those data sources

430
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,669
so what you do is in the very top here

431
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:48,010
pasting your user name and password for

432
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,870
your discovery service then scroll down

433
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,360
and provide your environment ID and

434
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,820
configuration ID go ahead and click on

435
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,860
try it out and as you can see it's gonna

436
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,750
run the request and it's gonna come back

437
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,179
to you in response this is the whole

438
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,750
configuration now go ahead and copy this

439
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,330
response and paste it into the update

440
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,029
update API call now occurring you're

441
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,289
going to need to copy in your

442
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,720
environment ID and configuration ID but

443
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,799
you also need to paste in the

444
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,230
configuration if you pasted it and you

445
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,260
scroll up you'll realize that where it

446
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,130
says entities you will not have mentions

447
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,590
and mention types so what you need to do

448
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,889
is need to add mentions true and mention

449
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:36,399
types true there will be a there will be

450
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:38,980
a link to a github gist that contains

451
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,649
this whole configuration for you so you

452
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,750
don't need to put it in for yourself

453
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,630
manual and then what you do is fill out

454
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,789
the environment ID which I can just copy

455
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,700
from up over here from our last call

456
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,559
paste it into the update then go ahead

457
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,460
and do the same thing for the

458
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,700
configuration ID and then tell Watson to

459
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,770
update that configuration of course

460
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,750
I haven't need to add anything because I

461
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,640
already had it there but once you add in

462
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,200
your mentions just click on try it out

463
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,940
and just like that you've updated your

464
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,110
you've updated your configuration

465
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,540
response code 200 it's a success now

466
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,460
Watson knows exactly how it needs to

467
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,290
enrich the data now one thing you need

468
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,000
to make sure is that you upload your

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,790
documents after you do this step do not

470
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,830
do this step later because then Watson

471
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,240
will not be able to reinvent your

472
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,950
documents they're going to delete the

473
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,960
configuration or delete the environment

474
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,090
and do it all over again or delete the

475
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,910
collection all right so now that we're

476
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,830
back here and now of course we've

477
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,690
already had our mentions and Watson has

478
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,910
enriched the data now where do you take

479
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,010
a look at what the knowledge graph truly

480
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,950
does I'm gonna go over to this pane over

481
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,920
here the build queries pane now right

482
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,480
beside searching aggregations is

483
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,460
knowledge graph if you don't see if and

484
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,080
that means you're not running a premium

485
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,570
or advanced instance as of today which

486
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,930
is July 20th so now of course you can go

487
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,310
ahead and find some different entities

488
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,620
if you want to look for example well

489
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,360
let's just say I wanted to find a person

490
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,880
called Fiona I can go ahead and run the

491
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,620
query and it would give me entities that

492
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,650
match that Fiona and it gives me some

493
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,840
information about that entity but what's

494
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,330
more useful and what you want are the

495
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,700
relationships now of course it gives you

496
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,200
a watching discover is going to give you

497
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,580
a list of all the different entities

498
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,830
inside of its knowledge graph that it's

499
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,410
built inside the system and so all of

500
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,940
these entities are related to other

501
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,660
entities in some way or another so now

502
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,640
that we're here let's take a look at

503
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,560
what we can actually do now let's just

504
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,750
say we're looking for Fiona and we want

505
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,930
to see how exactly Fiona is related to

506
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,780
Austin all I'm going to do is run the

507
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,720
query as you can see it tells me Austin

508
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,370
has a colocation Fiona colocation is

509
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,690
it's a very very broad sort of

510
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,310
relationship so we can ignore all the

511
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,370
collocations but Fiona is located at

512
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,370
Austin and Fiona resides in Austin and

513
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,100
both of these are correct so I can

514
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,550
actually go ahead and take a look and

515
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,390
remove Austin now if I only provide if I

516
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,980
only provide Discovery with Fiona

517
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,510
and I don't tell it to find the

518
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,190
relationship of Fiona to any other

519
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,230
specific entity and it's just gonna give

520
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,450
me all the relationships that Fiona has

521
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,510
to other entities this Brian communicate

522
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,240
she's the owner of a cottage she greets

523
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,669
people that come over she's located at

524
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,320
location which is a co reference to

525
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,260
another entity but these are all good

526
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,179
for relationships associated with the

527
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,030
Fiona entity now if you would actually

528
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,440
go ahead and take all these

529
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,440
relationships and graph them out this is

530
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,360
what it would look like now one thing I

531
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,490
would do I would like you note is that

532
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm using a website called web graph

533
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,190
viscom and what I did is I actually just

534
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,290
went him to the JavaScript console of

535
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,840
Google Chrome and I put together a quick

536
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,380
like uh like a three liner piece of

537
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,990
JavaScript code over here and basically

538
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,480
what this JavaScript code does is it

539
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,850
allows you to take all these

540
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,770
relationships that are shown in this

541
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,960
English sum in the Watson discovery

542
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,600
tooling and as you can see it exports

543
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,120
them to a format that graph is likes so

544
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,950
you can go ahead and copy this and you

545
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,070
can paste it into graph news and that's

546
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,690
actually gonna make a really uh neat

547
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,400
knowledge graph out of it

548
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,320
so I took a few different entities

549
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,120
namely I took Fiona downtown Austin and

550
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,010
I took those three entities and I found

551
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,540
all the different relationships they

552
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,730
have and I exported them to graph this

553
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,679
format and I put them into this website

554
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,809
called web graph is calm so I didn't

555
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:47,179
need to do it manually in Python so as

556
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:49,850
you can see this is the whole graph that

557
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,650
it makes for us let's go through this a

558
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,150
little bit and take a look at what it

559
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,570
actually is so of course we have Fiona

560
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,240
at the very beginning here now Fiona is

561
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,740
located at location of course that's

562
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,630
just a CO reference to learner entity

563
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,470
here's the agent of recommend and she's

564
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,210
the owner of a cottage so you can see

565
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,179
Fiona owner of cottage and there's

566
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:12,410
another feature and discovery that

567
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,179
allows you to find evidence for use but

568
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,350
we're not going to be coloring that in

569
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,780
this video now there is a little bit

570
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,850
more of an interesting map here so you

571
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,890
could take a look at Fiona she's located

572
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,760
at downtown now Fiona is also located at

573
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,260
Austin

574
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,740
now downtown is located at Austin and

575
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,890
downtown is located at self and South is

576
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,049
also located at downtown so there's a

577
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:37,760
sort of circular reference here between

578
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,299
these two entities now if you take a

579
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:42,500
look over here there's also an

580
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,929
organization or Congress that's based in

581
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:46,850
and is a part of the South which is

582
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,620
located in downtown which is located in

583
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,720
Austin so as you can see you're able to

584
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,540
create this really complex graphs you

585
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,580
can take a look at Congress and you can

586
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,740
see that Congress is technically located

587
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,440
in Austin because Congress is based in

588
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,660
self which is located in downtown which

589
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,280
is located in Austin so you can make

590
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,620
these really complex relationships you

591
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,730
can also take a look at some more things

592
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,500
that are located in downtown with for

593
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,840
example Hyde Park is located in downtown

594
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,760
there's a neighborhood there many

595
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,580
restaurants inside of downtown there are

596
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,410
the Boston streets cars they're all in

597
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,470
the downtown and so as you can see this

598
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,960
is just a small fraction of the

599
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,850
knowledge that discovery was able to

600
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,660
extract from the Airbnb reviews and

601
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,429
again the Airbnb reviews weren't even

602
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,200
written with the intention of providing

603
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,780
this kind of knowledge but still lots of

604
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,160
discovery was able to understand that

605
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,049
natural language and provide that

606
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,360
information to us but we've got a little

607
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,679
bit more of an interesting data set

608
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,110
that's meant to actually provide this

609
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,780
kind of knowledge now this data set is

610
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,700
actually two documents just two

611
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,520
documents in contrast to the 999

612
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,470
available over here in the Airbnb

613
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,860
ratings however if you go back over to

614
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,510
manage data it's a very very interesting

615
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,059
data set see the Danes that I'm talking

616
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,610
about two biographies of Henrietta Lacks

617
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,140
now just in case you're unaware

618
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,020
Henrietta Lacks or actually was

619
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,880
suffering from a kind of cancer back in

620
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,620
nineteen around the 1950s and this kind

621
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,809
of cancer was actually special because

622
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,429
the cancer she had made her the first

623
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,620
person to have cells that we live and

624
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,510
actually thrive outside of the human

625
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,120
body so you can actually buy HeLa cells

626
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,890
as they're called and actually what

627
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,950
experiments on them and so that's why

628
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,410
we've solved uncertainly solve but we've

629
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,000
had major breakthrough some different

630
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,330
areas like cancer it all tons it four

631
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,040
kinds of areas because we were able to

632
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,170
use those difference

633
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,910
and so of course our client people

634
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,260
different people who write biographies

635
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,830
on Henrietta Lacks and so we take these

636
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,690
biographies more specifically the one by

637
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,360
Rebecca Skloot and also the Wikipedia

638
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,790
page actually relax and upload them into

639
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,220
Watson discovery using that same Airbnb

640
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,140
config so that we have the mentions and

641
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,170
the entities and the relationships all

642
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,340
all in the India in figuration as you

643
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,050
can see I tells us it's 50 percent

644
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,360
positive 50 percent negative it gives us

645
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,610
some keywords Henrietta Lacks but Bette

646
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,970
lacks Carver a personal Crownsville

647
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,790
state hospital David Lacs and these are

648
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,860
all related to of course the biography

649
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,200
tells us a little bit about the content

650
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,910
and it also tell us about a few

651
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,770
different concepts of course he'll as I

652
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,240
was mentioning the HeLa cells are

653
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,610
talking about cell cultures Rebecca

654
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,170
Skloot who's who actually wrote the

655
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,900
biography and Henrietta Lacks herself

656
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,030
but I know what you're interested in

657
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,170
you're interested in the knowledge

658
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,850
graphs let's head over to the crosswords

659
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,640
now let's just say that we want to find

660
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,100
the relationship all the relationships

661
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,370
that Henrietta Lacks has as you can see

662
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,190
these are all a different kind these are

663
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,420
all the different relationships that

664
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,790
Henrietta Lacks has now Henrietta Lacks

665
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,060
has attribute cancer health condition

666
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,950
Watson's able to find these really

667
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,440
complex relationships just for natural

668
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,780
language and then the best part is that

669
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,280
you can combine it with other machine

670
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,990
learning services to say hey something

671
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,120
like does Henrietta Lacks suffer from

672
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,340
cancer and actually convert that to

673
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,950
actually find a certain kind of

674
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,900
attribute or entity in this knowledge

675
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,540
graph but anyway let's just say I go

676
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,960
ahead inspect and I run inside of the

677
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,150
console that quick three liner of code I

678
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,840
was telling you about

679
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,110
as you can see we get these these graph

680
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,020
is an x over these graphs this sort of

681
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,420
graph this format text so if I were to

682
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,000
copy that into web graph is again as you

683
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,920
can see this is the knowledge graphic

684
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,580
gives us four four four just a few of

685
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,560
the entities inside of the solid graph

686
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,480
of course there's a lot more you could

687
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,700
extract if you wanted to but this is

688
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,860
what I've extracted for now so as you

689
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,720
can see this is actually great because

690
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,920
it says Henry

691
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,290
relax part of many elderly because Henry

692
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,840
Lux was elderly Henry relaxes also the

693
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,450
parent of Deb relaxed which again is

694
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,110
correct can relax also resides in clover

695
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,360
which is a geopolitical entity now

696
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,720
Deborah Laxmi more interesting Oprah

697
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,970
Winfrey actually plays role of Deborah

698
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,980
lakhs in a movie

699
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,410
however whispers is not that movie

700
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,900
that's a separate ecatel together

701
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,880
and Deborah Lacs is also part of many

702
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,160
descendants and these descendants of

703
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,830
Henrietta Lacks are located in the South

704
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,930
just like Deborah Lacs is located in the

705
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,510
South actually also part of the family

706
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,740
the lacs family and she's also the agent

707
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,900
of informs because she's informing

708
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,090
people about this by participating in

709
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,560
talks all the descendants are

710
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,230
participating in talks as well as Deb

711
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,390
relax if you go over here here are some

712
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,430
entities that aren't actually directly

713
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,020
linked to this part of the knowledge

714
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,000
graph however if we were to get out

715
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,100
every single relationship in this

716
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,510
knowledge graph there would probably be

717
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,030
some kind of link here now again this is

718
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,220
why this is so interesting we can see

719
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,020
that there's instructor which is a

720
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,300
person who is employed by Bellarmine

721
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,400
University which is an organization and

722
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,410
this organization is based in Louisville

723
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,900
which is a geopolitical entity now

724
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,030
Center College is based in Danville and

725
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,160
most of Danville and Louisville are

726
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,520
located in Kentucky

727
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,550
so they're both located in Kentucky as

728
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,750
rich tell us they're located in Kentucky

729
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,690
and so this is the knowledge graph and

730
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,200
discovery built of just a few entities

731
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,110
imagine having to go through that entire

732
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,330
biography as human and actually having

733
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,250
to extract these cash relationships make

734
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,560
notes about this now instead of you

735
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,530
actually really through all that text

736
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,900
and actually having it be impossible for

737
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,460
many computer programs to go through

738
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,530
that text you can use programs like

739
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,570
Watson discovery to create knowledge

740
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,190
graphs convert the structure of

741
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,780
information take a look at all the

742
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,310
different relationships that exist

743
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,800
inside this text and of course make your

744
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,590
life million times easier by converting

745
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,810
unstructured data and structured data

746
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,050
that you can make use of in

747
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,640
yeah great job explaining that I think

748
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,470
this crap will make lives at home so

749
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,340
that's my radio

750
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,740
it's very soon you know very soon as you

751
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,840
create a code pattern once but once the

752
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,060
Watson discovery knowledge graph is in

753
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,550
of course it is completely available to

754
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,630
the public because currently it's only

755
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,550
in in advance and the code pattern

756
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,950
should allow you to upload documents and

757
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,750
automatically make huge knowledge graphs

758
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,590
like this one that you can actually

759
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,570
jurors the 3d now we need to join code

760
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,090
pattern yes looking forward to it

761
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,500
thank you alright and so that's how you

762
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,290
can use the Watson knowledge graph or

763
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,120
Watson discovery services knowledge

764
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,460
graph to convert unstructured data into

765
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,650
structured data alright so that's how

766
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,240
you can use water discoveries new

767
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,950
knowledge graph feature hopefully very

768
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,170
soon it becomes out of beta and you can

769
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,880
use it in your free trial instances or

770
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,040
light instances and your regular

771
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,140
instances as well so thank you very much

772
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,700
