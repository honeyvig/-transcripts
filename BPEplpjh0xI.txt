1
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,089
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,020
tutorial

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,390
my name is Thanh de Mac XI and this time

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,980
we're going to be going over another

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,960
science experiment now I know I haven't

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,910
done one of these in quite some time

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,109
but today we're going to be talking

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,720
about how you can use carbon dioxide to

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,789
extinguish a fire or put out a flame

10
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,679
let's begin now as you can see I have

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,300
this demonstration set up in front of me

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,640
which I will be getting to in a bit I

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,380
promise but first we have to go through

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,649
the explanations shall we begin

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,120
if you want right now there'll be a

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,550
little box on screen to skip to them to

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,960
the demonstration if you like ok now the

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,000
box is gone let's continue with the

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,879
explanation now alright so first of all

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,770
before we can actually get into the

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,320
video I have to explain what does a fire

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,449
consist of first of all a fire is

23
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,359
substances combining with oxygen or

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,760
another supporter of combustion in order

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,979
to create things like bright light heat

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,040
and smoke that sort of fires and also I

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,630
mean you probably know fire is but also

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,840
what does a fire need to sustain itself

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,060
what does it need to be lit what does it

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,759
need to stay put now there are three

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,330
things no more no less even one of them

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,750
gone and the fire just won't start okay

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,400
so first of all you need something

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:40,650
called kindling temperature what is

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,150
kindling temperature now kindling

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,210
temperature is the temperature at which

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,909
substances start to burn this

38
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,070
temperature is sort of where fire starts

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,759
okay second you need a flammable

40
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,180
material and this can be really anything

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,640
like roller wood door propane and also

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,370
levels reminds me different substances

43
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,870
actually burn with different colors for

44
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,770
example

45
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,390
burning wood because of all of its

46
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,540
carbon it burns a yellowish blah

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,420
yellowish blackish color and propane for

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,690
example lights as a bluish almost

49
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,660
colorless flame that's an interesting

50
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,940
fact different substances burn with

51
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,970
different flame colors and finally the

52
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,390
third thing is that you need a supporter

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:46,440
of combustion all right so now

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,450
essentially let's explain this first of

55
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,980
all kindling temperature as I said is

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,960
the temperature at which substances

57
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,600
start to burn second a flammable

58
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,340
material which is any material that can

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,520
catch on fire and third a supporter of

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,410
combustion now what does this mean this

61
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,360
is usually oxygen first of all is what I

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,340
can say oxygen is a supporter of

63
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,170
combustion if you were to combine let's

64
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,190
say oxygen right like oxygen and wood

65
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,980
and like a really hot temperature it

66
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,320
will create a fire okay however there

67
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,910
are some things that are not supported

68
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,470
of combustion such as carbon dioxide

69
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,830
those are inhibitors of combustion or um

70
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,860
and or anti supporters of or not they're

71
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,050
not supporters of combustion and so

72
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,390
essentially they do not allow flames to

73
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,070
exist they don't allow they put them out

74
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,380
okay however supporters of combustion

75
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,170
allow them to exist and so usually let's

76
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,540
say lighting a candle at your home okay

77
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,030
it's actually most probably using oxygen

78
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,430
in the air in order to light the candle

79
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,080
as a supporter of combustion and so now

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
another thing is that first of all you

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,770
know what let's just get straight into

82
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,870
the experiment now alright so as you can

83
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,760
see I have this experiment sort of table

84
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,430
ready now before we begin I got to go

85
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,560
over the materials now first of all if

86
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,120
you were 18 you need parental

87
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,940
supervision for this experiment just

88
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,870
like I do right now

89
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,600
of course because I mean we are playing

90
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,360
with fire currently and also since we

91
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,850
are working / playing with fire you need

92
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,060
a fire extinguisher very important just

93
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,880
in case things get out of control also

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,400
you need things like a candle okay

95
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,290
simple candle over here that's lit again

96
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,050
get it lit by our parents all right just

97
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,270
like I have also you need okay this is

98
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,340
very hot to the touch you need a glass

99
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,020
with a candle stuck inside of it

100
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,540
preferably to the side now this candle

101
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,620
is about to go out we might just get

102
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,780
that swapped with a cut but not just yet

103
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,340
or actually you know what let's get the

104
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,370
candle here swapped now let's do that

105
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,220
all right so the candle is being lit in

106
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,680
just a second all right so it is ready

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,560
and if I just pick this up again this is

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,720
extremely hot to the touch so I can't

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,400
exactly touch it very nicely

110
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,920
now again it is very preferable to you

111
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,110
to keep the candle on one of the sides

112
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,150
that the carbon dioxide comes in and

113
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,850
goes out all right so now next what you

114
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,890
need is one of these little scooper

115
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,090
things I'm not exactly sure what these

116
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,430
are called but they're sort of a spoon

117
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,410
with a large dip and a straight little

118
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,870
scooper part it's for you to be able to

119
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,330
you know carry this candle here this

120
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,010
candle you'll be able to carry it and

121
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,920
put it in to the jug slowly just on top

122
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,230
of the jug okay you could use your hands

123
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,870
but I prefer a little spoon thing of

124
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,390
course that little cup with the candle

125
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,620
on a jug holder a coca-cola or really

126
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,740
whatever carbonated drink you use and of

127
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,540
course this should be relatively big so

128
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,160
it can carry a lot of liquid meaning a

129
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,950
lot more carbonation and also some salt

130
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,870
to release more to the carbonation or

131
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,310
you could use like a little part of a

132
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,440
Mentos or something like that or

133
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,670
something that will release the

134
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,420
combination of the carbonated drink and

135
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,270
of course a huge carbonated drink again

136
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,350
you should probably get the two later

137
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,080
variants not just those little smaller

138
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,790
bottles because these have a lot more

139
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,890
carbonation in them and they will be

140
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,440
much better for your experiment let's

141
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,600
begin now all right so no we don't need

142
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,540
a marker that's not required so now

143
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,680
again I'm just going to repeat this one

144
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,910
more time you need your parent or

145
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,490
supervision for this experiment and you

146
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,380
need these candles to be lit by your

147
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,060
parents if your kid

148
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,670
but let's anyway continue now let's

149
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,320
begin first of all the experiment will

150
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,050
consist of me taking this coke over here

151
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,840
this is even heavy okay so we're going

152
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,710
to slowly release the cap okay now

153
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,540
without too much carbon dioxide escaping

154
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,610
I'm just going to quickly open this up

155
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,860
okay and I'm going to pour this into my

156
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,090
jug here as you can see it goes into the

157
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,189
jug a lot of it okay so I'm going to

158
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,590
pour about this much in okay so now

159
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,180
there's currently a lot of carbonation

160
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,189
okay now that we know first of all

161
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,979
carbon dioxide has a density much higher

162
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,129
than the air around it and so what

163
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,740
happens is it tries to sink and so even

164
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,810
though it's like hurry up but you might

165
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,099
be thinking hurry up and put the candle

166
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,659
in so we can see the experiment but now

167
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,610
most of this carbon dioxide isn't

168
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,340
escaping some of it might be but most of

169
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,319
it is sinking down back into the jar so

170
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,020
star has hardly any oxygen in it and so

171
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,550
there's hardly any supporters of

172
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,430
combustion in it and so technically

173
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,069
speaking if I were to take this very

174
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,029
candle as you can see it is lit if I

175
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,279
want to take it and put it down into

176
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:39,069
this jug it should in theory go out and

177
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:42,550
as you can see the candle has gone out

178
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,330
it is no longer lit as you can see here

179
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,569
the candle has gone out I might just

180
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,860
zoom into that alright so the candle has

181
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,529
gone out now again this is because there

182
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:58,000
was no supporter of combustion in there

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,830
because there's no support or combustion

184
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,900
it wasn't able to stay put and the

185
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,699
carbon dioxide has essentially put it

186
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,650
out all right so now this is where the

187
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,449
salt comes in I'm going to pour in a bit

188
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:13,330
more coke just a little bit okay then

189
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm also going to pour some more salt in

190
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,120
there this releases a lot more carbon

191
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,139
dioxide and now watch this if I pour

192
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,849
this in here but I don't let any liquid

193
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,199
come out as you can see it has

194
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
extinguished the flame just like that

195
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,610
the carbon dioxide was enough to

196
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,849
extinguish the flame and that is how you

197
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,329
can use carbon dioxide with any sort of

198
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:43,300
carbonated drink in order to put out

199
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,149
candles and that was it for this

200
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,560
tutorial I hope you enjoyed just before

201
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,660
I go one last time I'd like to repeat if

202
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,579
you are a kid you need parental

203
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,020
supervision

204
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,330
or this experiment just to stay safe you

205
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,970
of course need a fire extinguisher

206
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,740
that's a must just in case again things

207
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,510
get out of control that's gonna be it

208
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,220
