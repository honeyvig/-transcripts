everyone this is dr. Marjorie from team
MDS conquer I'm going to discuss about
the own healing in this video so here
I'm going to discuss about the own
healing and also the healing of the
extraction wound and healing of the
fractures also if you see this own is
the discontinuity or break in the
surface of the epithelium okay if it
will be simple only the skin is involved
and when it involves the underlying
nerves or muscles and tendons it is
called as a complex own so these are the
list of types of wound a cute old a
chronic owned the wound which is not
healing even in the four weeks it is
called as a chronic wound and the other
classification includes the closed rooms
and the open rooms closed until are
contusion abrasion and hepatoma whereas
open wounds includes inside stones
lacerated penetrating and the crust owns
so usually the healing will be taking
place in two steps that is regeneration
and the repair the regeneration occurs
when healing takes place by the
proliferation of parenchymal cells okay
and whereas repair it is the replacement
of the NGO testify the fibrous tissue
and there are two processes which are
involved in the repair here that is
granulation tissue formation and the
contraction of the owns if you take the
granulation tissue formation it takes
place in three phases that is phase of
inflammation phase of clearance and
phase of in phase of in growth of the
granulation tissue so in phase of
inflammation after the trauma blood clot
will be seen at the site of injury and
the there is acute inflammatory response
within the 24 hours after the trauma at
the site of the injury so this is the
face of inflammation if you see the face
of clearance the combination of the
proteolytic enzymes find the auto lytic
enzymes and the phagocytic activity of
the macrophages all
welcome mine and clear of the necrotic
tissue debris sand the red blood cells
which is seen in which is called as a
phase of clearance and in the last in
growth of granulation tissue it consists
of two main processes the first one is I
am geo Genesis angiogenesis means linear
acceleration that means the new blood
vessels are formed and this angiogenesis
takes place under the influence of this
following factors like vascular
endothelial growth factor platelet
derived growth factor or transforming
growth factor basic fibroblast growth
factor and surface integrals so if you
take the next process that is called as
v reno genesis okay in this fibrinogen a
says that the newly formed blood vessels
are present in amorphous in the ground
substance okay then this fibroblast will
have a combination of morphologic and
functional characteristics of smooth
muscle cells and this collagen fibers
will appear by the sixth day after the
own and then which finally formed
formation takes place that is called as
a cicatrization I mean there will be
more and more of collagen formation then
coming to contraction of the own it
starts after four days and completed by
the fourteenth day after the own and
during this period the own will be
reduced approximately 80% of its
original size and this contracted own
will result in a rapid healing so those
are the steps you have to include in the
faces of all healing ok those three
steps then coming to the good healing
can be may be healing can be takes place
by the first inter and the second thing
which we have to include other ways by
which the own healing takes place
okay the healing can be takes place with
a primary union or a secondary union or
a tertiary indention it is also called
as a delayed primary cold closure so
primary yuning can occur takes place
when the only screen and unaffected
surgically in size don'ts without much
loss of cells and tissues and edges of
the homes are approximated by this
sutures
okay again there are few sequences in
this primary Union on the primary Union
which takes place in a healing those
sequence of five indirect initially
there will be hemorrhage
then acute inflammatory response
epithelial changes and organization of
the own so ml hammer initial
hemorrhaging notes immediately following
the injury okay then acute inflammatory
response within 24 hours
none of the epithelial changes were a
basal cell of epidermis from both the
cut margins start proliferating in the
this phase and they're well approximated
home discovered by a layer of with
epithelium within 48 hours and by the
fifth day multi-layered epithelium can
be seen and organization by the third
day fibroblasts also invade the own area
and by the fifth day new collagen is
formed and in the four weeks the scar
tissue the scanty cellular and vascular
even elements are formed with it
completely apathy lies the surface so
those are the four phases which are take
place in the primary Union so if you
take the secondary Union this secondary
Union is taken takes place when the
wound is infected when having extensive
loss of cells and tissues and if the old
is not approximated by surgical sutures
so on these are the sequences which
takes place in the secondary Union the
initial three to three to four phases
are the same
and the last thing is the own
contraction the presence of infection or
extra in which you can see in the
secondary Union so all these things
initial hemorrhage is same inflammatory
phase is also the same then even the
epithelial tissue cells will migrate in
the form of epithelial Spurs and until
end I need to add a granulation tissue
forms it does not cover surface fully
okay the surface of the wound is not
covered fully until a granulation tissue
is formed so
and the formation of granulation tissue
here which is I mean which is a bulk of
secondary healing is mainly because of
this granulation tissue and the newly
formed relation this week in the market
with a deep red I have color which is
granular and very fragile and une
contraction and this wound contracts to
1/3 to 1/4 of its original size and if
bacterial contamination of an open wound
is there as it is in the secondary union
the wound edges are not approximated
with the suture on and which is which
have a loss of more amount of epithelial
cells the most prominent chances of
bacterial infection is there so if
bacterial contamination of open wound is
that then it will delay the process of
healing so those are the steps which
includes the secondary Union ok then
coming to the tertiary healing the
stress-free healing is the secondary
healing plus delayed the primary closure
and this type of healing occurs
following an injury or an operation when
a tissue is excised and foreign material
or in fact shiny is present so this is
the tertiary healing so those we have
done and regarding the phases of healing
I know that is initial phase the
secondary phase and tertiary phase now
will go with the factors affecting the
whole healing which includes the local
factors and systemic factors so these
are the list of local factors given here
and this is the systemic factors which
are given here which affects her own
healing and if you take the hey age of
the patient the healing will be more
slow in the aged people and deviated
people and if you take the nutrition
also if more debris Asian the own
healing will be delayed in high protein
emia delay the appearance of fibroblasts
if you take a vitamin C deficiency if
vitamin C deficiency actually C play it
plays an important role in the collagen
formation and Oh Dean
if the vitamin C deficiency is present
you can see the formation of unstable
collagen which is degraded by collagen
eliza's hence the bone healing is very
delayed and it results in the capillary
fragility also then even the vitamin E
is also a membrane stabilizer in vitamin
A deficiency decreases the collagen
synthesis zinc deficiency also inhibit
the healing whereas widen b6 deficiency
also you can see the poor reef repair
and impaired circulation cross-linking
corticosteroids if the patient is in
corticosteroid it depresses the growth
of granulation tissue my recommends like
warfarin and apparently crease the
formation of fibrin matrix okay and the
depressed general assistance infection
shock and malignancy all these things
will decrease the own healing in even in
the diameters these are the three
reasons why there is a decreased own
healing in the diabetes because of
increased susceptibility infections
hyperglycemia released results in the
decreased activity of phagocytes and
even in the insulin is required in the
earlier stages for the collagen
formation so these are the three type
things where you can see why my wound
healing is delayed in the diabetic
people then other future netic disorders
coagulation disorders and smoking also
will cause the Delaine own healing so
those are the reasons you have to ride
with those the factors like local and
semuc factors you have to mention in
your exam then complications of the own
healing include infection epidermal
cysts
pigmentation seroma which is a
correction of fluid with limb for blood
and hematoma
okay these are the complications of the
own healing and other complications
include like scar formation incisional
hernia neoplasia keloid this keloid is
important and mostly seen in the African
Asian population and this is like a xsu
painful and ugly scar formation
this is because of the excessive
formation of the collagen material then
coming to the hypertrophied scar this
here the borders are confined to the
initial wound and the non highly
collagen fibers and fibroblasts is seen
in this thing then excessive contraction
proud flesh wound dehiscence so those
are the complications of the whole
healing if now will come the heat to the
healing of the extraction own this after
the extraction immediately blood fills
the socket which correlates and ends of
torn blood vessels in the periodontal
ligament then within the first this can
be divided into the stages that those
are the sequence which happened
immediately after the extraction now
we'll see after 24 hours alteration in
the vascular blood vasodilation occurs
mobilization of the leukocytes surface
of the clot covered by thick fibrin iron
finally the clot retraction then fur in
the first week of the own clot is
replaced by the graduation tissue and a
linear vultures the as teo clastic
activity and edges of the own continue
to exhibit the epithelium proliferation
in the second week clot continues to
organize fibrin mesh work is formed vo i
Anzio tenses tuber trabeculae a
first-year entered the socket osteoclast
ik resorption and the remnants of PDL
undergo degeneration in the third week
mature granulation tissue is seen
trabeculae of a state form around the
old and crest of annular bone is rounded
by osteoclast ik resorption
in the fourth week it is a final stage
of healing where the remodeling of the
bone is seen and the radiographic
evidence of bone formation does not
become prominent that means it will
become prominent only after the sixth or
eighth week often to the extraction so
if the tooth extraction on healing of
tooth extraction is given you have to
write let immediately
what is with what happens in the sockets
immediately after the 24 hours first
week second week third week in the
fourth week okay then
the complications of the extraction oonh
that is dry socket and the fibrous Union
then coming to the healing of bone it
can be healed by the indirect healing or
secondary healing or direct healing or
the primary healing so these are the
primary intention healing which there
are two types of healing that is gap
healing and a contact to healing and
here this gap healing this is small gap
between the fractured bony fragments you
seen whereas in areas with inter
fragment the gap is zero we can expect
the contact healing so you can note all
these differences between this gap
healing and a contact healing which is
given in this slide then this is because
in the secondary intention first there
will be a midterm of formation callus
formation bony this is fibrous can is
bony carrots and the bone remodeling
these are the steps in the secondary
intention of the bone healing then
complications of the fracture healing
include fibrous Union non-union and the
delayed Union so those are those are the
things you have to write for the bone
healing fracture heal bone healing of
the fracture healing and nowadays we are
using lasers so we'll see the lasers in
their own healing so these skills can be
write and you can write in the applied
aspects so lasers will employ employ the
low-level radiant energy and it will I
mean this majority of the laser on
healing has focused on the flourish
proliferative phase in the literature
and this low-level radiant energy of
laser will answer eight the own healing
reduces the pain and the enhance is the
neural regeneration so these are the
important points you have to write in
the laces and all healing and the own
care should be taken like you have to
provide a nutritional support and
monitor the nutritional sub-tree status
and create maintain a clean moist
environment with adequate circulation
and oxygenation
and you have to know about few points
about the hyperbaric oxygen therapy also
here the 100% oxygen it will be given at
two to two point four atmospheres for
one to two hours
so this is the applied aspect you can
write like lasers and moon care and
hyper box hyperbaric oxygen therapy and
advances in the own care we are using
the growth factors so this is the list
of exogenous application of growth
factor directly on the own you can you
wrote this points because these are the
advancements and this is the delivery
system that can be used to deliver the
growth factors like we can do topically
or a fibrin sealant or a glue use of a
platelet-rich plasma and
tissue-engineered equal ins so that's it
so if a home healing answers the answer
here has come you have to write all the
healing of own phases than the
complications of all healing than the
extraction socket healing than the
fracture healing are finally if you
applied aspects like lasers and the
advances in the own healing that we own
care that we are using now growth
factors directly on their own so these
are the references which are included in
this video
for the own healing thank you have a
great day
