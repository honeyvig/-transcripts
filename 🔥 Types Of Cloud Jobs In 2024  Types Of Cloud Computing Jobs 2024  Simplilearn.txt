the link mentioned in the description
box below for more details so without
any further delay let's start this video
on types of cloud computing jobs our
first category is all about jobs related
to Major Cloud providers like AWS Amazon
web services Microsoft Azure and gcp
Google Cloud platform we have two
primary roles within this category Cloud
administrators and Cloud Architects so
let's move on and check these rules out
the first is cloud administrator
a cloud administrator is a professional
responsible for managing and overseeing
the day-to-day operations of cloud
computing environments within an
organization their primary role is to
ensure that the cloud infrastructure is
running smoothly efficiently securely
and in accordance with the
organization's needs and objectives the
roles and responsibilities of a cloud
administrator includes resource
provisioning Cloud administrators are
responsible for provisioning and
configuring Cloud resources such as
virtual machines storage data bases and
networking components they ensure that
resources are allocated appropriately
based on workload requirements Security
Management they Implement and manage
security measures within the cloud
environment this includes setting up
firewalls access controls encryption and
identify and access management policies
to protect data and resources monitoring
and
optimization Cloud administrators
continuously monitor the performance and
health of cloud services they use
monitoring tools to detect and address
issues promptly optimizing resource
utilization and ensuring High
availability backup and Disaster
Recovery they create and manage Backup
and Disaster Recovery plans to safeguard
data and applications against data loss
or system failures this involves regular
data backups and testing of recovery
procedures the last is cost management
Cloud administrators are responsible for
managing Cloud costs they monitor
resource usage identify cost saving
opportunities and adjust resource
allocation as needed to optimize
expenses finally let's go through the
career path of a cloud administrator the
career path starts from a junior Cloud
administrator entry-level position with
responsibilities under supervision
focused on learning cloud management
fundamentals then Cloud administrator
managing day-to-day Cloud operations
independently with expertise in resource
provisioning security and
troubleshooting and finally a senior
Cloud administrator assuming leadership
roles including managing complex Cloud
environments optimizing costs and
contributing to the architecture
decisions talking about the salary of a
cloud administrator according to glasso
the average salary of a cloud
administrator is
$95,400 in the United States and in
India it goes around 7ak 74,000 rupees
per year with additional cash benefits
it depends on the company you are
working for and the skills you possess
also it may worry depending on which
cloud service you have mastered moving
on to the next job role in this segment
we have a cloud architect a cloud
architect is a specialized IT
professional responsible for Designing
planning and overseeing the architecture
of cloud computing Solutions within an
organization they play a pivotal role in
translating business requirements into
technical specifications and ensuring
that the cloud infrastructure meets the
organization's goals for scalability
security performance and cost
Effectiveness so let's talk about the
roles and responsibilities of a cloud
Cloud architect solution design Cloud
Architects design cloud-based Solutions
tailored to an organization's needs they
work closely with stakeholders to
understand business requirements and
objectives and then create comprehensive
Cloud architecture plans to meet those
goals Cloud platform selection they
evaluate and recommend the appropriate
cloud service providers for example AWS
Azure or gcp and services that best
align with the organization's
requirements and budget constraints
scalability and and performance Cloud
Architects ensure that the cloud
architecture can scale to handle
increased workloads and maintain Optimal
Performance this includes designing
autoscaling mechanisms and load
balancing
strategies security they are responsible
for implementing robust security
measures including exess controls
encryption and compliance with industry
standards and regulations Cloud
Architects design security into every
layer of the cloud infrastructure the
last is cost optimization managing Cloud
cost is significant aspect of their role
they design cost efficient architectures
monitor resource usage and Implement
cost saving strategies like reserved
instances or spot instances so let's go
through the career path of a cloud
architect the career path for a cloud
architect typically follows certain
stages like Cloud Solutions architect
entry-level position where individual
starts gaining experience in Cloud
architecture and solution design then
comes Cloud architect as Cloud
Architects gain experience they take on

responsibilities often leading
architecture teams senior Cloud
Architects experienced Cloud Architects
may take on senior or lead roles guiding
architectural decisions for large scale
Crow projects principal Cloud architect
this is a senior leadership role where
individuals may act as a Chief Architect
or lead multiple architectural teams and
the last is cloud architect manager or
director in larger organizations Cloud
architect managers or directors oversee
teams of cloud Architects and have
broader responsibilities for cloud
strategy to excel this role Cloud
Architects often pursue relevant
certifications if you also want to
master the field you can consider
enrolling in our Cloud architect Masters
program so don't forget to check out the
link mentioned in the description box
below talking about the salary of a
cloud architect according to glasso the
average salary of a cloud architect is
$171,500 perm in the United States and
in India it goes around rupees 22 lakh
per year with additional cash benefits
it depends on the company you are
working for and the skills you possess
in our second category we'll talk about
Cloud devops jobs these professionals
are like the connectors between
development and operations teams
ensuring a smooth software delivery
process the job role we have in this
category is of a cloud devops engineer
so who is a cloud devops engineer a
