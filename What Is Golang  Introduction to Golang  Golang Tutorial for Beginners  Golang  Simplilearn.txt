welcome to this video tutorial on golang
by simply learn
in this session we'll learn about the
most promising language golem we'll
start with what is going and learn about
the history of collect
further we will see why to learn golang
and explore its features
we will look into uses of co-lang in
various industries
after that we'll look into most popular
ids used for golang and at last we will
get to know about companies using golang
so hey everyone i am abhisaruja from
simply learn and welcome to this video
on what is calling but before we begin
if you love watching tech videos

now we will look into what is going
go also known as golang is an open
source programming language developed by
google it is a statically typed compiled
language
moreover go supports concurrent
programming that is it allows running
multiple processes simultaneously
this is achieved using channels go
routines etc
go language has garbage collection which
does memory management and allows the
deferred execution of functions
it also supports networked and
multi-core computing
you can run your first code without any
setup on the playground provided at
colland.org
we'll look into the history of colling
the gop programming language was born
due to the complexity of managing the
infrastructure and code bases within
google
the language creators all from google
had a clear goal design a programming
language that would be easy to use but
still be able to cover the main
challenges while working with the
company's intricate systems
go was designed by robert christmer
roe pike and ken thompson
and was designed at google in 2007 and
was announced to the public in 2009 and
it was made open source in 2012
with the release of version 1.0
the most remarkable release that is
golang 1.5 was presented in august 2015
and it included considerable changes the
compiler tool chain has been converted
from c to go entirely
and at this stage golang took the form
to which its authors aspired
now we will be knowing why to learn go
link
first reason that is easy to use and
learn golang is easy to use and
understand it has gained popularity in
the top 20 programming languages
go has a linear learning curve that
appeals to novice programmers
if someone already has hands-on c-sharp
or c-plus plus
learning go for them should be more
accessible due to its striking
similarities to c
next point we consider is community and
documentation
you can find the documentation on the
official website that is
golang.org
go has solid and easy to read
documentation apart from documentation
go also has a supportive and active
community
you can use the hashtag golank whenever
got stuck on twitter to reach out to the
community
impressive standard library
go users have a standard library packed
with the language which reduces
importing complex secondary libraries
google's standard library is vast but
not confusing that is without the issue
of conflicting function names
one of go's best contributions to
programming is
it offers a more straightforward way of
integrating data structures into code
blocks
next reason to learn golang is strong
security
simple code is safe and more secure than
complicated code as go is a statically
typed language go users don't have to
debug a lot of errors
which is the case with many dynamic
languages and their number of variable
types
plus the inclusion of a garbage
collector also helps prevent memory
leaks and the last reason to learn
golang is attractive wages
according to a survey conducted by
stackoverflow co-developers are the
third highest paid after pearl and scala
due to goes increasing popularity every
year this figure will continue to rise
now we'll look into the features offered
by golem
first that is flexible
because of the language design and its
roots from c
colang is easy to learn and understand
with simple syntax
next concurrency
go allows multiple processes to run
simultaneously
its ability to take advantage of
multi-core processor architectures
and efficient memory is one of the
reasons
why go code is today running some of the
most heavily used applications that can
scale
next is the fast output
go comes with a very quick compilation
time
in the golang development environment
there is no virtual machine the code is
directly compiled to machine code making
the compilation process faster and more
effective
besides the compiler produces only one
executable file after compilation this
file does not suffer from dependency and
can be uploaded and run anywhere this
makes the code execution process faster
the next is library
go comes with a powerful standard
library
distributed as packages which also
reduces importing complex secondary
libraries
the next feature is
garbage collection
this is goes one of the key features it
controls memory allocation and has
significantly reduced latency in the
newer versions
developers need not worry about freeing
up pointers or the situation associated
with
dangling pointers
now we'll see the uses of colon
go was originally built for programs
related to networking and infrastructure
intended to replace popular
high-performance server-side languages
like java and c-plus plus
kolang's support for concurrency makes
it an excellent choice for handling
borderlands that prevent scalability
today go is used for a variety of
applications
who is popular for cloud-based or
server-side applications
concurrency and networking features
align with its high portability across
various platforms make go an exceptional
language for cloud computing
as a matter of fact many standout cloud
platforms like kubernetes are built with
co google cloud also uses co to enhance
scalability and performance
devops and site reliability automation
are also popular ways to use co
many command line tools are written in
go
also go is used in the world of
artificial intelligence and data science
some uses go for microcontroller
programming robotics and games
go shines the most when it comes to
infrastructure today some of the most
popular infrastructure tools are written
in go such as kubernetes docker and
prometheus
now we will see some popular ids used by
golang programmers golend
coland is an ide by jetbrains to provide
an ergonomic environment for goal
development
sublime text
it is a commercial source code editor
that supports many programming languages
and markup languages
you have to install go sublime plugin
through package control that provides go
code completion and other ide like
features
go clips it is an eclipse extension that
adds ide functionality for the go
programming language
vimgo
vim is often called a programmer's
editor
plugins adds go language support for web
visual studio code using the go
extension for visual studio code you get
features like intellisense code
navigation symbol search testing
debugging and many more that will help
you in core development
you can install the go extension from
the vs code marketplace
now we'll see some companies using
golang uber
a ride-hailing platform that uses go
within its microservices
kubernetes kubernetes is an open source
container orchestration system used to
automate software deployment scaling and
management
google designed kubernetes but the cloud
native computing foundation currently
maintains it
dropbox dropbox is a file hosting
service that has migrated some major
components from python to go
netflix netflix is the most popular ot
platform and has used go to develop its
server architecture twitch
which is a live video streaming platform
that uses core for many busiest systems
soundcloud
it uses go to perform static analysis in
real time which is possible due to
static typing and fast compilation
with that we have come to the end of
