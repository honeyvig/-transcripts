Frank and Daniel one day they decide to
go for a trip to Venice they made a
budget list for all their expenses like
residence flight Etc they thought of
making their bookings online from a site
that offered discounts to the first 10
visitors on that day while making their
respective flight bookings Daniel's
transaction fa and he missed the offer
going on on the other hand Frank paid
his share very quickly and easily and
became one of the three Lucky Draw
winners Daniel was surprised and asked
Frank how he could make the transaction
when Daniel himself could not to which
his response was it's simple I used
Bitcoin a type of
cryptocurrency Daniel was confused and
he asked what cryptocurrency is and
since when has it been in use Frank
stepped up and explained to him
cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital
currency that works on blockchain
technology and is designed to work as a
medium of exchange online to buy goods
and services and make payments which was
introduced to the world first in 2013 By
Satoshi Nakamoto Daniel felt that it
sounds similar to other online payment
options he asked what makes it so
different Frank explained cryptocurrency
is decentralized and free from any third
party interference which means it is not
issued and controlled by any government
or Central Authority unlike other
payment systems that Banks or
governments are handling and that's why
a cryptocurrency transaction never fails
there could be many reasons for why
Daniel's transaction failed like he may
have exceeded his transfer limit for his
account must have been hacked or there
could have been some technical issue
with his bank server or maybe due to
high transaction fees imposed by the
bank but on the other hand
cryptocurrency charges almost no or very
low transaction cost there is no limit
for making transactions in fact you have
24/7 access to your money there is no
extra delay or extra charge on making
international transactions and the best
part is that anybody can use
cryptocurrency without the hassles of
paperwork all you need to do is create
an account on any digital wallet of
cryptocurrency this is what makes
cryptocurrency different from other
online payment options Daniel was
impressed by cryptocurrency but he
wondered how it works without the
control of an external Authority upon
research he found out that
cryptocurrency works on blockchain
technology blockchain is a set of blocks
that record information of transactions
like who made the transaction to whom
the amount of trade in the form of a
digital Ledger that is distributed
across the entire network meaning the
data is replicated and stored on each
node across the entire blockchain
network making it more secure and
impossible to change hack or cheat the
system then it is verified and validated
by every node to proceed with the
process of making the transactions the
crypto in cryptocurrency stands for
cryptography which is a method of of
using encryption and decryption to
secure the data in the presence of any
third party with ulterior motives now
Daniel was completely aware of the whole
technology and concept behind
cryptocurrency and was influenced by
Frank to adopt cryptocurrency in his
daily lifestyle too he did that by
booking his ticket but sadly no discount
like Daniel cryptocurrency has
influenced and impacted an enormous
number of people worldwide due to this
increasing popularity new companies like
May 2 and PayPal are coming forward in
investing in cryptocurrency every day in
2018 Malta an Island located in the
Mediterranean Sea south of Italy was
titled blockchain Island as it led to
the economic stability of the nation
many fintech companies like binance and
okx have already begun to take advantage
of malta's financial incentives and have
moved their headquarters to the
blockchain island since man evolved
currency has been a very important part
of our lives in the caveman era they
used the bter system now the bter system
involves goods and services being
exchanged among each other so now we
have a situation where a cavan is
exchanging seven apples and getting
oranges in return now the barter system
fell out of use because it had some
glaring flaws now these flaws include
having people's requirements coincide
for example say you have five apples and
your friend has five oranges you want
some of his oranges now until and unless
your friend has a requirement for the
apples that you own he'll not be ready
to make an exchange for it there's no
common meure of value now since there's
no common measure in terms of which
value of a commodity can be expressed
there's a problem when you have to
decide how many apples you're ready to
trade for one orange or a mango not all
Goods can be divided or subdivided for
example you can't divide a Live annual
into different smaller units the goods
cannot be transported easily now unlike
how modern currency fits in your wallet
or your mobile phone the goods that you
own cannot be taken with you everywhere
you go after realizing that the B system
didn't work very well currency went
through a few iterations in 110 BC and
official currency was minted in 10250 ad
goldplated Florence was introduced and
this was used across Europe and from
1680 to 1900 ad paper currency gained
widespread popularity and was used
across the world this is how modern
currency as we know it came into
existence modern currency included paper
currency and coins credit cards and
digital wallets for example you have
Apple pay Amazon pay PTM PayPal and so
on all of this was controlled by Banks
and governments now this means that
there was a centralized regul Authority
that limited how paper currency and
credit cards worked now imagine the
scenario of doing an online transaction
here you're thanking your friend for
paying for your lunch and you're saying
that you're sending them money to their
account now this transaction takes place
successfully but there are several ways
where this could have gone wrong they
could have been a technical issue at the
bank for example their systems could
have been down the machines weren't
working properly and so on that means
there's a central point of failure which
is the bank the users accounts could
have gotten hacked for example there
could have been a Dos attack or identity
theft and so on or the transfer limits
for that account were exceeded this is
why the future of currency lies with
cryptocurrency now imagine the
transaction between two people in the
future one of them has the Bitcoin app
and there's a notification asking
whether they're sure they're ready to
transfer five Bitcoins if yes processing
takes place here we're authenticating
the user's identity checking whether
they have the required balance to make
that transaction and other things now
after that done the payment is
transferred and the payment is received
all of this happens in the matter of
minutes and is as simple as that this in
turn removes all the problems of modern
banking there's no limits to the funds
you can transfer your accounts cannot be
hacked and there's no central point of
failure now as of 2018 there's more than
1,600 cryptocurrencies available now
there are some popular ones like Bitcoin
Litecoin ethereum and zcash and a new
cryptocurrency crops up every single day
now considering how much growth they're
having at the moment there's a good
chance there's plenty more to come in
the upcoming years so what exactly is
cryptocurrency a cryptocurrency is a
digital or virtual currency that is
meant to be a medium of exchange now
cryptocurrency is quite similar to real
world currency just that it does not
have any physical embodiment it also
uses cryptography to work the way it
does now some of the features of
cryptocurrency are that there's a limit
to how many units can exist with Bitcoin
this limit exists at 21 million now
after this no more Bitcoins will be
produced you can easily verify the
transfer of funds now the hashing
algorithms that Bitcoin uses makes it
very easy for users to determine whether
a transaction is valid or not they
operate independent of a bank or a
central Authority they work in a
decentralized manner Now new units can
be added only after certain conditions
are met for example for Bitcoin only
after a block has been added to the
blockchain will The Miner be rewarded
with Bitcoins and this is the only way
new Bitcoins can be generated so what
makes cryptocurrency so special firstly
there's little to no transaction costs
now if you use the digital wallet you'll
know that if you're transferring money
from your wallet to your bank account
you'll lose some amount of money you
have 24/7 access to money you can't just
walk up to your bank at 3:00 a.m. in the
morning and say that you want to
withdraw some money there's no limits on
purchases and withdrawals there's
freedom for anyone to use for example if
you're setting up an account in your
bank you need to do some amount of
paperwork and documentation with
cryptocurrencies all of that can be
avoided International transactions are
faster now why transfers take about half
a day to transfer money from one place
to another but with cryptocurrencies it
only takes a matter of minutes or
seconds what's the crypto in
cryptocurrencies crypto refers to
cryptography it's a method of using
encryption and decryption to secure
communication in the presence of third
parties with Al intent now this refers
to third parties who want to steal your
data or want to EAS drop on your
conversation cryptography uses
computational algorithms like s256 which
is the hashing algorithm that Bitcoin
uses a public key which is like a
digital identity of the user which he
shares with everyone and a private key
which is a digital signature of the user
which he keeps hidden now let's talk
about a normal Bitcoin transaction first
you have the trans transaction details
now this details who you want to send it
to and how much Bitcoins you want to
send them then it's passed through a
hashing algorithm for Bitcoin we use the
s256 algorithm the output that you
obtain is passed through a signature
algorithm with the user's private key
now this is used to uniquely identify
the user this output is then distributed
across the network for people to verify
this is done by using the senders public
key the people who verify the
transaction to check whether it's valid
or not unnown as miners now after this
is done the transaction and several
others are added to the blockchain where
it cannot be changed again if the
concepts of hashing seem a little
difficult to you I would suggest you
click on the top right corner and watch
the blockchain explain video so that you
can understand better now the sh 256
algorithm like I told you earlier looks
something like this now seeing how
complicated it looks I'm sure it's safe
to say that the encryption is very
difficult to hack today we'll be
focusing on two major cryptocurrencies
Bitcoin and ether now Bitcoin is a
digital currency that is decentralized
and works on the blockchain technology
it uses a peer-to-peer Network to
perform transactions let's talk about
ether ether is a currency that's
accepted in the ethereum network now the
ethereum network uses blockchain
technology to create an open- Source
platform for building and deploying
decentralized applications now let's
talk about the similarities between
Bitcoin and ether they're the biggest
and most valuable cryptocurrencies in
the market right now both of them use
blockchain technology but is nothing but
a technology that involves transactions
being added to a container called block
and creating a chain of blogs in which
data cannot be altered currency is mind
using a method called proof of work
which is a form of mathematical puzzle
that needs to be solved before a block
can be added to the blockchain finally
these are widely used across the world
now let's talk about the differences
with Bitcoin it is used to send money to
someone this is very similar to how real
life currency works with ether it is
used as a currency within the ethereum
network although it can be used for real
life transactions as well Bitcoin
transactions are manual which means you
have to personally perform these
transactions with each you have the
option to make these transactions manual
or automatic or programmable which means
that these transactions will take place
when a certain conditions being met for
Bitcoin it takes 10 minutes to perform a
transaction which is the amount of time
it takes for a block to be added to the
blockchain with ether it takes about 20
seconds to do a transaction now
blockchain is used like money for real
world transactions and ether is used to
power the ethereum network and power
real life transactions as well ether is
used as fuel within the ethereum network
to power both of these things now
there's a limit to how many Bitcoins can
exist which is 21 million you're
supposed to hit this number by the year
2140 ether is expected to be around for
a while but not to exceed 100 million
units now Bitcoin is used for
transactions involving goods and
services and ether uses blockchain
technology to create a ledger to trigger
a transaction when a certain condition
is met for Bitcoin we use an algorithm
called sha 256 for hashing and with
ethereum we use ET as of July 23rd 2018
one bit coin equals
$766 for ether it costs
$464 now what's the future of
cryptocurrencies the whole world is
clearly divided when it comes to
cryptocurrencies on one side you have
supporters like Bill Gates Al Gore and
Richard Branson who say that
cryptocurrencies are better than regular
currencies on the other side we have
people completely against it people like
Warren Buffet Paul Krugman and Richard
Schiller who are both Nobel Prize
winners in the field of Economics they
call it a Ponzi scheme and means for
criminal activities in the future
there's going to be a conflict between
regulation and anonymity since several
cryptocurrencies have been linked with
terrorist attacks governments would want
to regulate how cryptocurrencies would
work on the other hand the main emphasis
of cryptocurrencies is to ensure that
their users are kept Anonymous by the
year 2030 cryptocurrencies would occupy
25% of national currencies which means a
significant chunk of the world would
start believing in cryptocurrency as a
mode of transaction it's going to be
increasingly accepted by merchants and
customers and it will continue to have a
volatile nature which means prices will
continue to fluctuate like they have
been for the last few years quickly go
through the agenda
slide so first we will have a quick
introduction to what is cryptocurrency
following that we will have a comparison
between coin and
token then we will look into the types
of
cryptocurrency and at the end of the
video we will explore why do we need to
have so many types of cryptocurrency
so let's start the video so the first
thing that we are going to understand is
what is
cryptocurrency now a digital payment
system known as cryptocurrency doesn't
rely on banks to validate transactions
peer-to-peer technology makes it
possible for anybody anywhere to send
and receive payments payments made using
cryptocurrencies do not exist as actual
physical coins that can be transported
and exchange rather the only exist as
digital entries to an online database
that details individual
transactions now a public Ledger keeps
track of all these cryptocurrency
transactions that involve money
transfers digital wallets arew
cryptocurrencies actually stored so now
that we know what cryptocurrency is
let's break it down and compare the two
most basic forms of cryptocurrency that
is coin and token now coin and token of
phases that are regularly used while
talking about cryptocurrencies but there
is a distinction even if they may sound
similar so maintaining the Integrity is
crucial so now let's have a quick look
at the
differences so the first one is a
digital coin functions similarly to
traditional currency and is created on
its own blockchain it can be used as a
means of trade between two parties
conducting business together and a way
to store value coins and Litecoin are a
few examples of coins on the other hand
tokens are much more versatile than
merely digital currency tokens can be
used as a software application component
such as to allow access to an app
confirm identification ATT track Goods
as they move through a supply chain they
are generated on top of an existing
blockchain like nfts they can represent
digital
art second is coins require significant
resources and skills to create
themselves whereas tokens are relatively
easy to
create third coins are mostly
distributed using the mining process and
tokens are distributed using
icos coming to the next one coins are
used to store and transfer money on the
other hand tokens are used for various
purposes like security and asset
representation and the fifth is coins
can be validated by any Merchant who
uses them and one Merchant validates
tokens so now that we have reached the
most crucial part of this video the
types of cryptocurrency let's discuss
them one by one so despite being used to
describe all varieties of digital or
cryptocurrency the term cryptocurrencies
is frequently used interchangeably with
coins they are frequently considered as
such even though most of them aside from
Bitcoin does not function as as a unit
of account or a store of value or a
medium of
exchange so technically there are eight
types of cryptocurrencies security
tokens utility tokens payment tokens
exchange tokens non funable tokens defy
tokens or decentralized Finance tokens
stable coins asset back tokens and
privacy
tokens so let's start with the security
tokens
now these cryptocurrencies are
securitized and derive their value from
an external asset that can be sold as
security by Financial regulations as a
result they are utilized to securitize
the tokenization of real estate bonds
stocks real estate and other currencies
from The Real World to protect user
Investments Financial Regulators must
therefore supervise and regulate The
Exchange issuance dealings values
tokenization backing and trading of
transactions due to their nature now
security tokens basically stand in for
an interest a share of stock or Equity
voting rights and a dividend right in
the asset they represent owners or
holders share in the profits made by the
issuers or managerial choices through
security token offerings they are
distributed now they can be used when
investors require immediate settlement
open management Asset Division or
Etc now security tokens are further
divided into Equity tokens and asset
back tokens now Equity tokens resemble
conventional stocks and appearance and
operation except that ownership and
transfer are carried out digitally
dividends from manager and issuer
choices and actions are due to investors
debt tokens represent short-term loans
with fixed interest
rates now coming to asset back token
these have an underlying worth that is
supported by actual real estate works of
art carbon credits or Commodities they
possess qualities similar to those of
gold silver oil Etc they can be exchange
Etc examples of security tokens are C
funds bcab and science
blockchain now following uh security
tokens we have utility tokens
now utility tokens are simply digital
units that reflect a value on the
blockchain and are sometimes thought of
as a coupon or vouchers to put it
another way the token grants specific
access to a good or service offered by
the token issuer by purchasing the token
a person can acquire access to the
product or service and exchange it for a
specified access value now the holder
does not get ownership but rather the
right to a good or service with an
equivalent value to the Token for
instance as long as they own the token
they can access the
good or service for a reduced cost or
for free in some jurisdictions a
cryptocurrency classified as a utility
token is exempt from Financial
regulations now some of the examples of
utility tokens are funfare basic
attention token brick block Timmy coin
sharing lab token and Golem
so following this comes payment tokens
now payment tokens are used to transact
directly between buyers and
sellers so uh the products and services
on digital marketplaces as opposed to
wire middleman as is common in
traditional Banking and finance of
course the bulk of cryptocurrencies and
tokens fit within this category whether
they are security or utility tokens but
not all the utility tokens can also
function as payment tokens now payment
tokens are not secuti and cannot be
purchased as such as a result they're
not considered asset secuity subject to
financial regulations they might or
might not ensure holders access to any
present or future goods or services
example of payment tokens Monero
ethereum and
Bitcoin next is not non-fungible
tokens now a non-fungible token is a
blockchain based digital certificate of
ownership for a singular non-replaceable
item or one that cannot be traded with
another asset it is created using the
same technology as other types of tokens
still it is primarily used to represent
a work of art images audio video
Collectibles real estate virtual words
memes GFS digital content like post and
tweets now now NFD marketplaces like
Open Sea rille foundation and decentral
land are where you may buy and sell
them popularity monetizing Goods royalty
payments whenever their work is sold to
a new user partial ownership of
expensive assets auctioning to raise
money creating memorable moments or
preserving histories for Market motives
like trading and celebrity issuing are
all included in this
application now some of the examples of
nfts are Logan Pauls videos clips
Twitter founder Jack dorsy first tweets
nftd every day is the first 5,000 days
drawing by Mike winlan better known as
be and several crypto
kitties now following that we have defi
tokens or we can call decentralized
Finance tokens now decentralized Finance
refers to the financial applications or
D apps built on the blockchain or
distributed Ledger which makes them
distributed and those that render
financial and money control directly to
the user while allowing them to transact
globally with peerto peers methods and
access to global
markets now anyone with internet access
can access these defi apps each defi app
runs on a token economy that is
supported by a native token these tokens
are a programmable currency where
developer me logic to how transaction
and payments are made RV chain link Unis
Swap pocard and Solana just a few
examples of popular decentralized
Finance tokens now decentralized
exchanges storage sharing and apps for
Lending are some examples of defi
application
types following this we have stable
coins now these tokens are of stable
value in nature as their nature implies
meaning that their value is reasonably
predictable in that it essentially never
changes stable tokens or stable coins as
they are more commonly known are backed
by an asset with a relatively consistent
value such as cash so we have stable
coins that are pegged to the dollar and
the Euro as well as tokens backed by
Commodities like oil gold and other
precious metals stable coins assist in
eradicating assets or even other digital
currency inst stability stable coins
include P sauce and Teta which are all
backed by USD cash in a one: one ratio
along with true SD ji dollar and USD
coin as stable coins packed by gold keto
gold te gold digix Global and gold coin
then comes asset bagged
tokens now the term asset bagged tokens
refers to a class of
cryptocurrency whose underlying value is
supported by a real world asset such as
cash stocks bonds property gold and
precious metals on blockchain they are
utilized to represent and trade the
value of these underlying assets
digitally so due to the way the
underlying assets are used in
transactions most of these are provided
as security tokens the equity token
offer is the primary method of issuing
them examples of asset pack tokens are
oil coin which tokenizes barrels of oil
held in reserve petroleum coin ZN Inc
oil token Etc the energy web token
tokenized in Nai green energy token by W
VPP Etc are some of its
examples and now comes the last but not
the least that is privacy tokens now
these cryptocurrencies are used for
privacy applications as their name
implies because they have Superior
privacy promoting programming to bitcoin
and other popular
cryptocurrencies better anonymity in
crypto transaction is necessary for
various reasons including the right to
privacy security investigations are
extremely sensitive transactions yet
they are also utilized in fraud and
crime these cryptocurrencies use a
variety of strategies like currency
mixing offing transactions and anonymity
mechanisms like coin join to ensure
transaction
privacy some of the examples of privacy
tokens are Monero zcash Dash Horizon
beam and
vge so now that we have covered all the
necessary types of cryptocurrencies now
let's understand why we need so many
types of
cryptocurrency so since the source code
for blockchain technology is available
to everyone any software developer can
utilize it to build new things
developers have done just that at the
time of this writing there are
reportedly more than 10,000 different
cryptocurrencies in use and the number
keeps Rising for comparison Just 4 years
ago more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies
existed there are so many
cryptocurrencies now because of the
underlying blockchain technology it
allows programmers to design various
coins with a range of
features in this video we are going to
cover all important Concepts and
components related to proof of work
first we will have a quick in
introduction of blockchain then we will
understand what is proof of work then we
will look into how does it
works and after that we will explore why
is it actually needed what are the
issues faced by proof of work and at
last we will look into the blockchains
working with proof of work so without
further delay let's get started with the
video but before that let's have a quick
introduction to blockchain
the term blockchain refers to a
decentralized database that is made up
of sequential blocks that contain
recorded data the database is backed up
by a network of self-contained
participants known as
nodes now let's understand what is proof
of
work proof of work is a decentralized
consensus method that requir Network
participants to spend time solving an
arbitrary mathematical puzzle in in
order to prevent the system from being
hacked it is widely used in
cryptocurrency mining for validating
transactions and Mining new tokens it
helps in the processing of peer-to-peer
transactions securely without the need
of a trusted third party it also
requires huge amount of energy at scale
which only increases as more miners join
the
network now let's have a look at how
proof of work
works the right to add new blocks to a
proof of work blockchain is provided to
individuals who are willing to expand
computational resources to solve
cryptographic issues the participants
competing to add new blocks are referred
to as minors and the process is referred
to as
mining miners are the one who execute
proof of work miners use their
computational power to locate a valid
block when a piece of information such
as a transaction needs to be added to
the block
blockchain this is accomplished by
locating a hash that meets the network
protocol specific
requirements in cryptography a hash is
the outcome of a hash function it
converts any format or size of data into
fixed size
numbers the protocol established a level
of mining difficulty that is
algorithmically adjusted so that the
time it takes to obtain a proper hash
averag is 10 minutes miners can sometime
locate multiple blocks that satisfy the
protocol requirements at the same time
and split the chain n in
two because there can be only one
accurate chain the protocol must account
for these circumstances miners will
initially continue to mine on both
chains but once another block is
discovered on top of one of the two
prior blocks that chain becomes the
canonical chain and miners are
economically incentivized to discard the
other
block one of the advantages of proof of
work blockchain in terms of security is
their resilience to civil attacks civil
attacks occurs when one player in the
network generates many false identities
in the order to get an unfair Edge over
other network participants who only have
one identity 51% attacks occur when a
single user takes control of more than
51% of the Network's resources and hence
has control over the adding of new
blocks now we know how proof of work
Works let's dip down deeper and explore
why do we need proof of
work majorly proof of work is required
for security and fraud prevention as
well as trust proof of work is intended
to prevent users from printing coins
they didn't earn or from double spending
if users could spend their coins more
than once the currency would effectively
become worthless proof of work ensures
that independent data processors or
miners can't lie about a
transaction linking a block with the
proof of work hash of its predecessor
results in tamper resistance because the
hash of each block is an ingredient in
the hash of the following block any
changes in the chain will affect the
final proof of work hash as well as all
Block hashes in between so the deeper
the altered block the more computational
effort needed for
tampering the first minor who discovers
the proof of work answers publishes the
solution to the rest of the network when
a new block is discovered all nodes are
notified we check the answer twice
before moving on to the next block PS if
correct the block miners earn the
transaction fees and the block
reward the protocol only accepts the
longest chain as valid and authentic a
fake chain is Impractical in the long
run since a Minor's chances of receiving
the block reward and minimal other
miners will continue to extend the valid
chain quicker than the tampered chain
over
time moving on let's have a look at the
other side of the coin as as well as
understand some of the major issues with
proof of
work first is it has a negative impact
on the
environment second the 51% attack can be
used against it if miners gain control
of 51% of the hashing power they will be
able to determine what is
true aside from the enormous cost of
tries there's no mechanism in place to
punish any malicious miners
and fourth because every node must
process every transaction it does not
scale properly while sharding the
network May boost efficiency it also
reduces security this was all about
proof of work let's explore the best
blockchain networks working with proof
of
work Bitcoin is the largest and the very
first blockchain to adapt proof of work
and work with it ethereum is next
working with proof of work though it is
aiming to switch to proof of state which
we will talk about in a coming
video then comes Bitcoin cash which is
an extension of Bitcoin and follows the
same structure thus it also works on
proof of
work then come Litecoin which is also an
altcoin of Bitcoin and then comes Monero
another cryptocurrency serving similar
purpose as other cryptos what's in it
for us today let's understand why do we
need a smart contract what is a smart
contract usage of solidity for building
smart contract advantages of smart
contract blockchain implementation of
smart contracts we'll look at certain
examples of voting and digital token and
also we will take another use case of
how smart contract help us do
crowdfunding now why smart contract now
let's take a look traditionally how
contracts used to happen if suppose two
parties A and B have to get into a
contract they will utilize the services
of a third party whom they have to trust
and get the contract executed now with
the introdu production of smart
contracts and the technology which is
evolving removes the dependency on such
third parties and automates the
execution of such smart contracts so if
we compare traditional versus the new
smart contract in traditional we used to
have governments lawyers or any other
third party on which we can trust in
smart contracts we don't need any third
party we don't need any intermediate
execution time definitely there's higher
execution time in traditional contracts
because as many number of middlemen and
their intermediatory layers that many
number of days and time it takes smart
contract is just a matter of minutes it
gets executed because it is automated
programmable running on a computer and
it has some predefined condition
remittance if any remittance of either
of the parties have to happen then it's
a manual process approvals workflows
processes and these manual processes
take time under traditional Contracting
system but in a smart contract as the
conditions are predefined pre-embedded
as soon as a condition is met the
remittance happens automatically either
of the parties who have to be credited
with an amount is credited automatically
and that is the primary advantage of
using a smart contract
transparency is not available 100% in
traditional contracts the transparency
is bound peripheral between the parties
and the entities and the intermediaries
involved as compared to Smart contract
transparency is 100% available 24 by7
online anyone can go and review audit
and validate the transactions executed
by the smart contracts archiving
archiving is a big difficult problem for
traditional contracts as most of the
transactions are paper based or the
records are maintained offline it
becomes very difficult to maintain and
identify the traceability provence of
all the transactions which have happened
in a traditional contract whereby in a
smart contract it becomes easy as all
the transactions have happened through
the smart contract there's 100 %
traceability available from the provence
point of view you can trace the
transaction from its day one the point
of origin till present day And archiving
is automatically happening the log the
audit the transaction history is
automatically getting generated security
definitely is a concern in traditional
contracts as the intermediator is
involved manual processes involved
security can be compromised at any level
at any stage but in a smart contract the
security is maintained through
cryptography mainly through public key
infrastructure the public and private
key infrastructure it is a very secure
way of maintaining security and
cryptography of the transactions using a
smart contract cost yes traditional
contracts are expensive the cost of
transaction as high as compared to Smart
contracts as the middleman are involved
smart contract the cost is low as we
don't have any intermediaries and only
the cost of transaction is charged by
the underlying infrastructure of the
blockchain network which is running the
smart contracts signatures it manual
process all the transactions are signed
manually and verified manually but here
in the smart contracts all the
transactions are digitally signed using
the private key of the entities and can
only be decoded by the public key shared
by the parties involved in the smart
contract so in a nutshell smart
contracts give us n number of advantages
the primary advantages are listed here
and these are the advantages which
enforce us to move towards an economy
and to a system where we start using
smart contracts for our transactions to
avoid any disputes to keep the
transaction cost low thereby giving the
advantage to the end consumer now what
is a smart contract let's consider a
real life example where you are taking
out a chocolate from a vending machine
you deposit a $2 note in a vending
machine after that you hit A1 button
which is mapped against the chocolate
bar that you want to buy as a result a
liver in the vending machine moves and
pushes out the chocolate so basically
Aven button is programmed to the lver in
order order to move the chocolate out
now a smart contract is very similar to
a vending machine it eliminates the need
of an intermediat in case of the vending
machine is replacing a direct seller and
allowing you to make a purchase without
a middleman and it eliminates the need
of escro services now smart contracts
are self-executing contracts which
contain the terms and conditions of an
agreement between the parties and the
peers who are involved in that agreement
so the terms and conditions of an
agreement are written in a piece of code
and it is executed on a blockchain based
decentralized platform now these
agreements facilitates exchange of any
digital asset it could be digital
currency it could be shares it could be
property or it could be anything which
you want to transact so a blockchain
based decentralized platform gives you a
democratic system where the transactions
are authorized by the majority of the
participants and the identity of the
participants is also kept Anonymous now
let's consider an example where Rachel
is at the airport and her flight is
delayed but this inconvenience could
have been beneficial to Rachel as smart
contract insurance would ensure she's
given a compensation for the flight's
delay instantly so just imagine there is
a smart contract which the insurance
company has already deployed and it's
monitoring the flight's delay Rachel has
already taken that insurance for delay
in flights so as soon as that condition
is met for a delay of flight above x
amount of hours for example 2 hours then
in that case the insurance company will
automatically get that trigger and
Rachel will be credited with that amount
for which she's insured in her account
so let's see how smart contract can be
helpful here so AXA flight delay
insurance is one of the examples of
ethereum smart contract EXA is an
insurance company the smart contract is
linked to the databases that record
flight status so the smart contract is
connected to the databases it is
fetching that information information
and evaluating the delay it enables
automatic compensation when there is a
delay for 2 hours or more so that is the
condition when the flight delay is
beyond 2 hours then the insurance
contract will get executed and Rachel
will get paid a smart contract is
created based on the terms and
conditions so condition compensation is
equal to flight delay is less than 2
hours based on the code smart contract
holds the company's money until a
certain condition is satisfied this
smart contract is submitted to the nodes
on the blockchain network to their EVMS
for evaluation so evm is a runtime
compiler to execute smart contracts code
it is the brain it is the electronic
virtual machine which executes the smart
contract all nodes on the network
executing the code using the evm must
come to the same result because all the
EVMS would have the same copy of the
smart contract deployed if the flight is
delayed two or more hours smart contract
will be self- executed and the
compensation amount will be given to
Rachel and that is the objective of the
smart contract without involvement of
any middleman paperwork which Rachel has
to do to submit and then the insurance
company going through the manual process
all that has been bypassed and Rachel
has been compensated directly now let's
understand why do we need solidity for
developing our smart contracts now here
comes the important question which
programming language does a smart
contract use there are two widely used
programming languages for writing in
ethereum smart contract solidity and
serpent however on blockchain platform
solidity is widely used for implementing
smart contracts and this is what we are
going to talk about in our subsequent
slides now solidity is a high level
programming language used for
implementing smart contracts it enables
to check the program at runtime rather
than compile time solidity is a touring
complete language it has all the
conditions all the while Loops for Roop
operators Etc which are there in any
matured programming language in order to
write your code in order to write your
conditions if you have certain Loop if
you have V conditions Etc now what are
the advantages of smart contract as we
have already discussed there are no
intermediaries involved the process
executes without the need of a third
party it's an automated process they are
automated with the code which eliminates
manual effort for execution highspeed
highly Compu smart contracts which runs
on programming code the speed of its
execution is higher than a traditional
contract as the data is stored in the
decentralized system the chances of
modifying the data is difficult and I
would say more than impossible accuracy
based on the requirements terms and
condition of a contract is recorded
accurately so as soon as any transaction
is recorded it is registered on a
blockchain network and it is immutable
transaction no one can modify or make
changes in any record which has been
added onto a blockchain network through
a smart contract now let's take a look
at certain blockchain implementation of
a smart contract using blockchain in
voting process can eliminate voting
malpractices a centralized voting system
faces a lot of problems when it comes to
tracking votes there could be
manipulated identities there could be
manipulation in counting and there could
be biased decision making a smart
contract is introduced to eliminate all
these malpractices there are certain
predefined terms and conditions which
are already set in the contract no voter
can vote from a digital identity of any
other voter the counting is full proof
every vote is registered on a blockchain
network and the accounting is happening
automatically without any interference
from a third party or dependency on a
manual process so terms and condition
each ID should be attributed to just one
vote the validation is done by the users
on the Block Network itself so the
voting process can be in a public
blockchain or it could be in a
decentralized autonomous organization
based blockchain setup also but it is
100% transparent and every voting
transaction is recorded result every
voter's vote get recorded on The Ledger
and that information cannot be modified
it is transparently publicly available
for audit and verification now let's
take a look at one of the examples of
our voting solidity contract so here we
have have our voting solidity contract
it is built in solidity and I'll just
give you a brief overview of what are
the primary functions in this so if we
look at this particular contract this
contract gives you certain basic
parameters like what should be the
minimum number of participants or
proposals which are required for voting
then what should be the minimum amount
of time for debate that needs to pass
before the vote can be exec uted then
the margin of votes for majority a
proposal passes if there are more than
50% of the votes plus the margin so
basically we are defining what is the
winning condition what is the majority
margin for any vot to be accepted then
you have data structures where you are
accepting the proposals right and then
subsequently we are defining data
structures for members who are
participating in the proposals who are
submitting the proposals we are fetching
the addresses of the members basically
this is the digital identity of the
members who are submitting the proposals
and Etc so this smart contracts
basically allows you to create a voting
system where you can add members we can
remove the members you can change
certain voting rules based on certain
conditions like if you want to increase
the minimum Quorum if you want to change
the debating period minutes or the
majority rule changes then this is the
function for submitting a new proposal
for which the voting has to happen so
basically this example is about if I
have to take a vote within a
decentralized autonomous Organization
for a particular decision so rather than
a central Authority taking a decision
you can have a voting mechanism within
your organization to give a majority to
your proposal if you get the majority
The Proposal is accepted otherwise
rejected then there are peripheral
functions like check proposal code then
there's a voting function the actual
vote happens and for a particular
proposal you start increasing or
decreasing the number of votes then you
execute the proposal if the majority has
been achieved now let's take a look on
how to deploy a smart contract so here
we have our voting smart contract now we
will take a look on how to deploy our
voting smart contract on the ethereum
test Network called robsten this is our
voting smart contract now when you open
remix you should also have metamask
which is a chrome plug-in installed this
is a utility in order to connect to the
robon test net which is a ethereum test
Network so basically you say rob.
etherscan.io and this is the ethereum
test Network on which we will deploy our
contract so once you log in into the
metamask you will have a account created
and in that account you should have some
test ethers already so that you can use
them to deploy a contract so when you
create an account on robon you can buy
certain ethers using the robsten test
faucet so when you reach this site the
robsten test foret has already taken the
address for the account for which you
are raising the request and you can
raise request of one ether now whenever
this transaction will get processed your
account balance will get incremented by
one so as I already have ethers in it I
can utilize it to deploy my contract now
in order to compile and deploy my
contract I have copy pasted it here and
if I go to my run My remix has already
communicated via injected web3 to the
metam mask and taken my account which
has 7.83
ether now I need to do some
settings now as my contract is compiled
you can see it has taken all the
contracts you can see the drop down and
Congress is my major contract now I will
deploy my contract so on the Run section
you will be able to see in the drop down
the name of the contracts which are
there in my smart contract like I had
owned token recipient then there's an
interface and there is a congress so I
need to deploy my Congress contract now
in order to deploy this contract there
is a Constructor which requires certain
inputs so I can give certain values like
what minimum number of proposals I need
100 then minimum number of De bits 10
and margin of votes for majority so I
say deploy now as soon as I'll click
deploy it is going to request me for gas
because when the contract gets deployed
it will deduct certain ethers from my
account so when I'll say
submit if you notice now this
transaction has got initiated on the
robsten etherscan.io I click on it so
this is the transaction on which the
contract is getting deployed it is
taking time and the contract is getting
processed on the ethereum network now
once it will get deployed we will be
able to see the address at which the
contract has got created and deployed
now as you can see my contract has got
deployed at the address 0xcc I can load
it now this is the contract address and
this is the amount of actual ether which
was spent from my account in order to
deploy the
contract now there are certain
attributes on the option ether scan
which you can go and check you can
verify and publish your smart contract
over here so that others can also view
the code and utilize your smart contract
and if you go and check your metamask
this is the transaction which has just
been done in your account and if you
click it will take you to the same
transaction which we opened here now
after you have deployed the contract you
can interact with your contract directly
through remix just to test your contract
all the pink members are the the ones
which make changes onto the blockchain
and all the blue ones are the ones which
are only performing read operations so
in order to do any read operation you
will not be requested to spend any gas
so there will be no popups for metam
mask requesting for gas spending but if
you do any of these pink actions then
you will be required to spend gas as it
will be requiring to make some changes
onto the blockchain so this was a
example of a voting smart contract and
this will be available as a link for you
to take a look at now all our other
contracts which we will be covering
subsequently will be deployed in a
similar Fashion on the robster test net
now let's take another example if you
want to use Smart contract to issue your
own cryptocurrency or called digital
token you can use ethereum based smart
contract to create your own digital
tokens for performing transactions a
design and issue your own digital
currency create a tradable computerized
token that can be utilized as a currency
share or any asset which you want to
transact these tokens use the standard
coin API like in case of ethereum we
have standardizations of erc20 Etc which
allows contract to automatically access
any wallet for exchange as a result you
build a tradable token with a fixed
Supply and this particular platform
becomes like a central bank issuing a
digital money your smart contract
becomes the bank issuing the money so
let's take this example here so this is
a implementation of a erc20 token which
is a specification by ethereum and uh
the primary attribute for this token is
that you need to provide a name of your
token a symbol the decimals to which you
support and the most primary is the
predefined supply so just like in an
economy you have limited supply of money
here also you have to Define what will
be the supply of of your tokens and it
will be capped that will be the supply
so you need to predefine these
parameters and then you create certain
data structures within solidity to keep
a tap on the balances of the entities to
which you are giving the tokens and how
much allowance you want to keep per
address then there are certain methods
which you have to implement as per the
erc20 specification like transfer
transfer from approve and Call Etc so
all the these methods in a typical token
allows you to do the transaction send
and receive your custom tokens among
multiple parties so this would also be
available as a link for you to take a
look now let's take another example of a
use case for crowdfunding using smart
contracts to crowdfund your project so
suppose you want to start a business and
for a business you need a lot of funding
which is required but who would lend
that money to someone whom they don't
trust how will you generate that money
for such problem smart contract plays a
major role with ethereum you can build a
smart contract that will hold a
contributor's funds unless a given date
or a goal is met based on the result the
funds will be released to the contract
owners or will be sent back to the
contributors so basically you can create
a crowdfunding project for yourself if
you want to raise certain amount of
money and the contributors or the
investors will give you the money but
the amount will be kept on hold till the
time your project go goal or date has
been met and accordingly the investor
will get the token which you have
developed for crowdfunding in her or his
account accordingly now centralized
crowdfunding system has plenty of issues
with Management Systems so therefore a
da a decentralized autonomous
organization is utilized for
crowdfunding the terms and conditions
are transparently set in the contract
every individual participating in the
crowd funding is given a token and the
token is credited to their ethereum
based account now every contribution
gets recorded on the blockchain because
when the token transfer has happened
from the Dow to the individual investor
that transaction get recorded on the
blockchain network so let's uh quickly
take a look at the uh contract for a
crowd sale also so a crowd sale contract
provides you the basic attributes like
what is the goal of the funding how much
money you need to raise what is the
amount raised real time you can keep a
track what is the deadline right and
what is the price of the token in
ethereum basically what is the your
token amount in ethereum then there
could be that you might give certain
tokens in reward then you can have
attributes for your reward and then you
have your methods in order to keep a
check that once you have received the
funds you can withdraw the funds you can
check whether you have reached the goal
for funding and then you have the
methods for transferring tokens from the
sender to your own account this
particular kind of contract allows you
to maintain and keep a check on amount
of funding you have received or you want
to receive have you achieved your target
who are the investors in your token how
much percentage share belongs to your
account and how much percentage share
has been already been distributed on
amongst the investors Etc so everything
can be tracked so the smart contract can
build in such a fashion that there are
methods and utilities available in order
to run your entire crowdfunding so this
contract is also available in the link
and you can take a look so why wait
let's embark on this exhilarating
adventure together but before we dive in
if you're looking to take your career to
new heights and become a true expert in
the realm of blockchain and
cryptocurrency consider checking out our
professional certificate program in
blockchain in collaboration with di
canut it's an excellent opportunity to
master key architectural principles and
develop the skills needed to excel in
this rapidly growing field Ria is a
phenomenal Baker who runs a bakery in
New York on seeing the Great success of
her business she thought of growing it
even bigger and launching a new
franchise of her Bakery in La so for the
funds she applied for a loan of $50,000
from the central bank after completing
her documentation for the loan she comes
to know that the bank is rejecting her
loan application due to her loan
borrowing limit of the amount decided by
the central Financial system furious
with this situation she talked to a
friend Lisa a finance expert to
understand how this whole Central ized
Financial system of banks works and why
did her loan get rejected Lisa explained
to her that in centralized Finance Banks
and businesses use the money that you
invest or lend to make profits and their
overriding objective is to make money
third parties or Merchants like debit
credit card providers control money
transfers between the two end parties in
the financial system each charging a fee
for their services and that is why her
loan got rejected because the loan
amount exceeded the limit decided by the
bank or third parties for her Ria was
upset with the thought of not being able
to grow her business and that is when
Lisa suggested Ria to opt for
decentralized finance or defi Ria got a
little confused by the term and asked
what is decentralized finance Lisa
answered the decentralized finance is a
piece of code that eliminates middlemen
or banks by allowing individuals
business merchants and corporations to
perform Financial transactions using
developing Technologies peer-to-peer
Financial networks that provide security
protocols and connectivity to the
transactions are used to accomplish this
stablecoin is a cryptocurrency backed by
an asset or tied to a fiat currency like
the dollar is at the concept's core Ria
was fascinated and asked how it works
and how exactly defi could help her get
her loan approved Lisa further added
that defi uses the consensus mechanism
to El elate centralized Finance models
by allowing anyone or everyone to
utilize Financial Services regardless of
who they are or where they are a
consensus mechanism refers to the
methods used to achieve agreement trust
and security across a decentralized
computer network now this di mechanism
runs in a decentralized environment and
this is where blockchain comes into the
picture it provides the environment
where you can simply create your
decentralized program or D apps
according to your requirement in the
blockchain network transactions are
stored in blocks and other users in that
Network can verify them if a transaction
is verified by all its verifiers the
block is closed and encrypted and a new
block is created containing information
from the previous block thus creating a
chain of blocks and these transactions
are handled by decentralized
applications or say d apps Lisa further
explained that Aria's loan got rejected
due to the lower limit by the
centralized Financial system but in defi
she can submit her loan requirements
into a decentralized finance application
D and an algorithm would match her up
with peers who could help her after that
she'll have to agree to the lender's
terms to get her loan the transaction is
then recorded in the blockchain where it
will be securely stored in a ledger that
will make it impossible to hack or any
kind of malicious intervention and after
that she receive her required amount of
money once it is verified by the
consensus mechanism the lender can also
then begin collecting their payments at
the agreed upon intervals from her when
she makes the payment using her D app it
goes through the same blockchain process
and the money is transferred to the
lender Ria was impressed and relieved
that she now could grow her business in
a much more secure and cheaper way all
thanks to defi defi is meant to conduct
transactions using cryptocurrency
because technology is still evolving
it's difficult to say how if at all
existing cryptocurrencies will be
applied Finn is part of the management
team in an MNC and he has come up with
some profitable investment policies for
his company and his employees before its
implementation he needs to pitch his
idea in front of the board of directors
but the board of directors didn't
approve of his idea and that too without
any explanation for their decision
disappointed by this heed started
browsing the internet looking for a
solution that could benefit everyone and
where every member gets to have their
say and that is when he came across the
concept of Da which is a decentralized
organization that is collectively owned
by its members and where in decisions
are voted upon by by himself which runs
on blockchain technology but to
understand its concept in depth we went
to his friend Sam who's a blockchain
expert Finn explained to him his
situation how he came across the Dow and
why wants to know more about it on
realizing his excitement and curiosity
Sam decided to take him through the Dow
and how it functions he explained that
before understanding what Dow is let's
understand a bit about what blockchain
is blockchain is a system of storing
data that makes it difficult or
impossible to change hack or manipulate
the data it's basically a digital log of
transactions that are duplicated and
spread across the blockchain's whole
network of computers and the D is
something that makes use of its rules
and policies for its proper functioning
he further added a DA or decentralized
autonomous organization is a
blockchainbased organization that is
collectively owned and controlled by its
members they have built in resources
that no one can access without the
group's permission all proposals are
implemented using voting processes to
make decisions upon its rules and
policies ensuring that everyone in the
organization gets a say and this whole
system system majorly runs on ethereum
blockchain Sam further added that back
in 2016 the developers of the Dow
believe that by putting decision-making
power in the hands of automated
technology that will eliminate the
decision-making power driven by an
individual or by Body it was created to
allow investors to send money
anonymously from anywhere globally and
they would issue tokens to those owners
letting them vote on potential
initiatives or proposals Finn was
fascinated and ask Sam how exactly it
works and how this can be the solution
for his situation Sam explained
basically smart contracts are the
backbone of Doubt smart contracts are
programs that run when certain
conditions are met and are stored on a
blockchain let's understand this
stepwise Step One is when the
documentation of the idea takes place in
the similar way in doubt a group of
people write these smart contracts to
administer the organization once the
contract goes live on the ethereum
network changes to its rules can be
proposed only by voting the contract
automatically fails if the rules are
violated then comes step two which is a
funding period in which pitching of
ideas takes place in front of the
selected members and investors of the
organization similarly people in the Dow
organization contribute money to the Dow
by purchasing tokens that signify their
membership in the
organization and when the funding period
ends it brow proceeds to step three that
is when the approval and implementation
process of the idea takes place or say
the Dow starts to operate people can now
make proposals to the Dow on how to
spend the money and how the members can
vote to approve those
proposals this is how the first ever Dow
was launched by
slockit now the question arises what led
the Dow towards criticism this is due to
the infamous Dow hack back in June 2016
hackers used D's vulnerabilities to
assault its treasury the hackers were
able to gain access to 3.6 million
ethereum valued around $50
million this sparked a divisive debate
among Dow investors with some demanding
for the Dow to be permanently
dismantled initially vitalic buan the
founder of ethereum advocated a soft
Fork of the ethereum network which
included a piece of code that would
effectively Blacklist the attacker and
prohibit them from moving the St in cash
but soon after the problem was detected
in its code putting it vulnerable to
assault after great debate a second
alternative a hard Fork was suggested
and subsequently
implemented the hard Fork effectively
reset the ethereum Network's history and
move the D's ether to a different smart
contract allowing investors to withdraw
their assets and as a result of the hard
for two competing and now distinct
ethereum blockchains emerged Ed those
who oppose the hard Fork which wiped
back the blockchain's history back the
soft Fork version which is now known as
ethereum classic
Etc the ethereum blockchain is the
blockchain that implemented the hard
Fork changing the blockchain's history
so what's in it for you today we're
going to understand why do we need
blockchain wallet what is a blockchain
wallet how do these Wallet work what are
the different types of blockchain
wallets their comparisons and demo on
the usage of these blockchain wallets
and we will try to do certain
transactions using these wallets now
before these blockchain wallets came
into existence what were the means in
order for us to do the transactions and
what were the drawbacks in the old days
the transactions with whatever medium
and channels we had the problems were
that the transactions were slow and
Banks were the central point of failure
basically any transaction which has to
go through has to go through some interm
mediat channels and has to pass through
certain intermediaries like bank which
makes them a single point of failure
also there are issues in keeping track
of all accounts and balances data get
jeopardized manipulated or even get
corrupted across multiple systems where
the accounts and balances are maintained
now here comes into existence what is
called as blockchain wallet now what is
blockchain wallet a blockchain wallet is
a cryptocurrency wallet that allows
users users to manage different kind of
cryptocurrencies for example Bitcoin
ethereum Etc now a blockchain wallet
helps exchanging of funds easily
transactions are secure as they are
cryptographically signed the wallet is
accessible from web or mobile devices
and the privacy and identity of the user
is maintained so therefore a blockchain
wallet provides all the features which
are necessary for a safe and secure
transfer and exchange of funds between
different parties a blockchain wallet is
a typical cryptocurrency wallet that
allows users to manage cryptocurrencies
it is very similar to the process of
sending or receiving money through
PayPal or any other Gateway which you
use today but now you can use
cryptocurrency instead similar to PayPal
which you're using for making
transactions with your fied currency now
let's take a look at the ecosystem of
blockchain wallets here are certain
examples like electrum blockchain.info
Jax mycelium Samurai and Bitcoin paper
wallet these are just to name a few
blockchain wallets which are existing in
the market but there are many more based
on the requirement you have based on the
security you require and based on the
kind of wallet which suffices your need
so we will see what are the
categorizations of these kind of wallets
are now how do blockchain wallets work
let's take a look so before we move on
to how blockchain wallet wets work let's
understand what a private and a public
key is and how are these Keys related to
a blockchain wallet now whenever you
create a blockchain wallet you are also
provided a private and a public key
which is associated with your wallet now
let's take an example in order to
understand this imagine a person knowing
your email address is sending you an
email so in our regular day-to-day
activity if we want to receive an email
from someone we give him him or her our
email ID and expect an email from them
now what if an unknown person is able to
send emails through my account so I am
giving my email address for receiving
email but when I am disclosing my email
ID I'm not assuming that someone will be
able to send emails through my account
because then for that he has to be aware
of my email account password so knowing
your email address will not give a
person the ability to send an email from
your account you are not giving your
password to the person to send an email
you're just giving the email address to
send an email from a particular email
address an individual has to be aware of
the password associated with it now
blockchain wallet follows a similar
process using public key and private key
both together public key is similar to
your email address so basically whenever
your wallet is generated a public key is
generated you can share that public key
with anyone in order to receive funds
private key is top secret it's similar
to your password it should not get
hacked or you should not disclose it to
anyone and you use this private key to
spend your funds so now instead of
sending an email imagine you want to
transfer money to your friend this
transfer process is done through your
blockchain wallet with blockchain
wallets you can now send and receive
cryptocurrencies so as I said a
blockchain wallet has two keys a public
key and a private key public key is
shared with everyone just like an email
address private key is just like your
password which should be kept secret
with the sender so with blockchain
wallet no one will be able to send
crypto coins just like emails through
your public key until they know your
private key but if someone get access to
your private key there is a high
possibility that your account is hacked
and you might end up losing all the
cryptocurrency deposits in your account
now let's take a look what are the
typical features of a blockchain wallet
it's easy to use it's just like any
other software or a wallet which you use
for your day-to-day transactions it is
highly secure it is just a matter of you
securing your private key and it allows
instant transactions across geographies
barrier free without intermediaries and
also these transactions charges you lowc
cost fee and these wallets help you do
transactions across multiple
cryptocurrencies so you can make
payments across cryptocurrencies which
helps you do easy currency conversions
now let's talk about what are the
different type of blockchain wallets now
basically there are two types of
blockchain wallets based on the private
Keys one is hot wallet and another is
the cold wallet hot wallets are like
normal wallets which we carry for
day-to-day transactions and these
wallets are userfriendly cold wallets
gold wallets are similar to a Walt where
cryptocurrencies are stored with a high
level of security now let's take a look
at the differences hot wallets are
online wallets through which
cryptocurrencies can be transferred
quickly they're available online on
internet example coinbase
blockchain.info cold wallets they are
digital offline wallets where the
transactions are signed offline and then
later disclosed online so they are not
maintained on the cloud on the internet
they are maintained offline to have high
security and the examples of cold wallet
are treasure and Ledger now in case of
hot wallets private keys are stored in
the cloud for faster transfer in case of
cold wallets private keys are stored in
a separate Hardware which are
disconnected from the internet of the
cloud or are stored in a paper based
document hot wallets they're easy to
access available online 24/7 it can be
accessed through desktop or mobile but
has a risk of unrecoverable theft when
hacked cold wallet this method of
transaction helps in protecting the
wallet from unauthorized access from
hacking and other online vulnerabilities
now the wallet can be further
distinguished on these criterias there
can be software wallets they can be
Hardware wallets which are like kind of
USB driven and you plug into your USB
drive and your Hardware wallet can be
used or they are a typical paper based
wallet where you print your public key
and a private key on a paper and keep it
in a secure place so let's talk about
software wallet a software wallet is an
application that is downloaded on a
device either it could be a desktop or a
mobile or it could be a web- based
wallet which can be accessed online now
here are certain examples Dax bread
wallet and copay are the popular
software wallets so software wallet can
be further categorized into desktop
wallet online or we can call it web
wallet or mobile wallets now desktop
wallet are like cold wallet in which the
private keys are stored in cold servers
basically the desktop wallets the
private keys are stored in your desktop
you can unplug it from the internet do
some offline transactions and then bring
it back online now in case the main
server is lost then a cold server
basically your desktop is used as a
backup server these wallets can be
downloaded on any computer but can only
be accessed from the system they are
installed on so you make sure the
desktop or the machine on which you have
downloaded the desktop wallet is safe
has a backup you're maintaining the
hardware you're not letting the machine
go anywhere and it is on a secure
location now these wallet are definitely
cost efficient and one of the examples
is electrum and is one of the most
popular desktop wallet online wallets
are the other kind of hot wallets that
run on the cloud that are available on
the internet now here use users have the
benefit of accessing these wallets
across any device it could be tablet
desktop or you can use it from your
mobile browser the private keys are
stored online and are managed by a third
party you have to be dependent on a
third party service now for example
green address is a Bitcoin wallet which
is available on the web has an Android
app is available on a desktop and also
is available on iOS Apple mobile wallets
mobile wallets are like similar to on
online wallets except that they're built
only for mobile phone usage and
accessibility these wallets are also
user friendly and they have a
userfriendly interface for which helps
you in doing transactions easily the
example is mycelium which is the best
available Mobile Wallet Hardware wallets
Hardware wallet is a type of a cold
storage device typically like a USB
which stores the users private key in a
protected Hardware device these wallets
are similar to Portable devices that can
can be connected to the computer can be
plugged in as I said earlier it is less
prone to malware attacks malicious
attacks and it is hack proof examples
are Nano Ledger treaser and K key are
the top Hardware wallets available in
the market to make a transaction from
your Hardware wallet you have to ensure
the hardware wallet is plugged into your
computer system before you can do a
transaction from your Hardware wallet
paper wallet a paper wallet is an
offline process for storing
cryptocurrencies this wallet is a
printed paper consisting of both your
private key and a public key which are
accessed using a QR code now since these
wallets are safe they are widely used
for storing large amount of
cryptocurrencies now example are Bitcoin
paper wallet and my ether wallet are one
of the widely used paper wallets but the
question arises how do I add
cryptocurrency in my paper wallet in
order to make a transaction with your
paper wallet paper wallet works with
your software wallets the online wallets
to transfer funds from your software
wallet to the public address shown on
your paper wallet so basically first you
park your funds in a software wallet
then you transfer the funds from your
software wallet to the public address
printed on your paper wallet now let's
do the comparison blockchain info
blockchain info is a cryptocurrency
wallet which supports Bitcoin and eum
eum it is easy to use and has a low
transaction fee it has its apis exposed
you can easily use them to order to make
your own custom wallets also Ledger Nano
leder Nano is a hardware wallet which
offers a high security to your account
it is available for Bitcoin ethereum and
Litecoin users it is also possible to
maintain multiple accounts and access
them anytime Bitcoin paper wallet paper
wallet helps you to print your own
tamper resistant Bitcoin coin wallet it
minimizes the threat of hacking Jax Jax
is a software wallet which enables a
user to exchange currencies within the
wallet it is available for Bitcoin
ethereum Litecoin and many other
cryptocurrencies with ja a user can view
his updated balance as soon as the
processing is complete now let's take a
look at certain demos for the different
kind of wallets we have talked about so
let's first take an example of paper
wallet so bit address.org provides you a
paper wallet it uses the client side
JavaScript in order to generate a random
hash for your wallet so you keep moving
your mouse and it will generate a hash
public and private key it is recommended
that when you are doing this process you
should be disconnected from the internet
and once these keys are generated you
can print it and keep it secure and
clear the cachier of your browser so as
you can see on the the screen this is my
public key for receiving my Bitcoins and
this is the private key for me to spend
it I can print it and keep it handy with
me but of course the safety of these
physical documents cannot be entirely
guaranteed if a hacker discovers the
location of your paper wallet and
physically steals it then they can
access your Bitcoin Holdings so
basically it is of high importance that
you keep the paper wallet in a very very
sec Ure location some users hide or
disguise the paper wallet it should be
protected from physical damage if the
keys fade or can no longer be scanned
then the user will never again be able
to access the Bitcoin which are parked
in that address also take care if you
are using an incorrect type of printer
that also may damage the paper
wallet now let's take a look for our
second example of online wallet here we
are taking an example of bitpay so you
can download bitpay online and create
your account over
here you can create a personal wallet
you can create a shared wallet or a
joint share wallet once you create a
wallet like if you see the example over
here this is my personal wallet and I
have 3.64 five test Bitcoins over
here now in order to receive test
Bitcoins in my account you can receive
these test Bitcoins from test net. coin
for.ein now in order to receive it you
just need to
copy your Bitcoin address in the test
net address
so the test net has given me
87 Bitcoin so now my balance has
increased from 3.5 to 3.64 and I can see
this transaction
see 3 minutes go I just received 87 2287
Bitcoin the transaction is still in
process but in a while as this
transaction is getting M on the test net
I will receive it now as I have received
it I can even make a transaction and
send it to
someone so from my personal account I
can
send Bitcoin
to someone whose Bitcoin address I have
and I have to just paste it over
here transfer to bitcoin wallet either I
can select one of my own wallets or I
can search for any other Bitcoin address
which someone has shared with me and I
can send it to that particular address
now let's take an example of our
Hardware wallet how does Hardware wallet
works with the online wallets so here we
have metamask which has a feature of
connecting with Hardware wallet so once
you have metamask installed you will see
this option of connect Hardware wallet
now metamask has provided support for
Treasure so now once you connect your
Hardware wallet the USB with your
computer you can select an account you
want to view on that particular Hardware
wallet and you can only choose one at a
time and then you can start using that
particular wallet for your decentralized
apps so basically once you have your
Hardware connected it is integrated with
your metamask and then you can start
running your decentralized apps so that
they can start using the tokens or the
currency in the particular Hardware
wallet so use your Hardware account like
you would with any ethereum account log
to daps and send ethereums buy and store
erc20 tokens and nonf funable tokens
like crypto cies so if you click connect
to Treasure over
here metamask will start looking out for
the connected treasure device so first
let's have a look at what we're going to
explore in this video first you will get
an idea about what is decentralized
finance or defi then you will understand
what a liquidity pool is following that
you will understand the difference
between the liquidity pool and ordered
books then you will get a broader
perspective on how exactly liquidity
pools work and what are the regulations
of the liquidity pool and in the end
you'll get a gist of the pros and cons
of liquidity pools so let me take you
through decentralized Finance first
decentralized Finance or defi is a new
Financial system that is built on safely
distributed ledgers much like the ones
used by
cryptocurrencies defi reduces the
service charges that Banks and other
financial institutions impose
anyone with an internet connection can
use Defi and users can hold their money
in a Safe digital wallet and transfer
money quickly basically by giving people
access to peer-to-peer digital trades
dii threatens the centralized Financial
system and crypto assets are locked into
the contracts referred to as liquidity
Pools by users of defi protocols so that
others can use them well now that I've
mentioned liquidity pools let me explain
what what exactly a liquidity pool is a
liquidity pool is technically a pool of
crypto tokens secured under a smart
contract and these tokens provide
decentralized exchanges with the
necessary liquidity they require
basically the term liquidity refers to
the ease with which one can swap a
crypto token for another because so many
Financial transactions occur within the
defi ecosystem such Simplicity is
crucial but this raises the question of
how liquidity pools differ from ordered
books to understand how liquidity pools
differ from ordered books let's look at
the fundamental building block of
electronic trading which is the ordered
book simply put the open orders for a
certain Market are gathered in the
ordered book the system that matches
orders with each other is called the
matching engine the ordered book and the
matching engine are the primary
components of any centralized exchange
or CES
this concept made it possible to
communicate information efficiently and
enabled the development of intricate
financial markets defi trading however
carries out deals directly on the
blockchain without needing a central
entity to retain the funds in terms of
ordered books this creates a challenge
gas fees are incurred for each
interaction with the ordered book making
the cost of executing transactions
significantly higher additionally it
makes it very expensive for Traders ERS
who act as market makers and Supply
liquidity for trading paays Above All
Else however most blockchains cannot
handle the throughput needed for the
daily trading of billions of dollars but
liquidity pools solve each of these
problems with ease so now that the
definition and purpose of the liquidity
pool are all clear let me walk you
through the working of liquidity pools
as discussed before in a normal
liquidity pool users are encouraged and
rewarded for staking their digital
Assets in the pool rewards may take the
form of cryptocurrency or a portion of
the trading commissions paid by the
exchanges where they pull their assets
here's an example of how it operates a
Trader using Sushi swap to invest in a
BTC to usdt liquidity pool step one go
to sushi swap step two find the BTC usdt
liquidity pool step three deposit a
split of BTC and usdt to the BTC usdt
liquidity pool step four receive BTC
usdt liquidity provider tokens step five
lpts should be deposited to the BTC usdt
staking pool after the agreed upon
amount of time is passed you'll be given
the sushi token you pledge to keep it
safe it can be for a set period of time
like a week or 3 months the original BTC
usdt pair would be compensated with a
percentage of the commissions received
from exchanges on that liquidity pool in
addition by staking your lpts you would
receive Sushi tokens now that the
working of the liquidity pool is in
front of you let me give you a gist of
the regulations of liquidity pools for
your Investments the investment fund
manager needs a license to build a pool
in addition regardless of the
jurisdiction an investment fund license
is required whenever the pool is
actively sold or promoted to clients
some cryptocurrency liquidity pools
circumvent the issue by presenting
themselves as Community owned and
distributing governance tokens the
entire Community holds the ownership
thus Regulators won't be able to go
after the owners in court however there
is a significant amount of risk
associated with joining such
pools now that the concepts of the
liquidity pool are all clear let me give
you a look over the pros and cons of the
liquidity pool to give you a better
understanding the liquidity pool makes
trading on the decks simpler since
transactions are carried out at current
market prices whereas it goes against
the idea of decentralization that a
small group controls the pull of funds
people can use it to lend money and get
paid in prizes interest or an annual
percentage yield in return for their
cryptocurrency on the other hand due to
lack security measures there is a risk
of hacker exploits which could cost
liquidity providers money it uses
publicly accessible smart contracts to
maintain the transparency of security
audit information on the contrary there
is an exposure to Temporary
loss this occurs when a change in the
price of your assets that are held in a
liquidity pool results in an unrealized
loss as opposed to if you had just kept
the assets in your wallet well this was
all about liquidity pool and its related
Concepts Jordan a fresh graduate is
working as a sophomore engineer at a big
firm saving money for higher studies one
day he came to know that the bank where
he was saving money got bankrupt and all
his money was now gone with the bank
Jordan was confused how come if the bank
had gone bankrupt his money was also
gone when his friend Jack learned about
this he explained that banks are
basically a centralized system for
storing the data of all transactions
Banks rotate money to ensure the
existence of the money of their
customers for instance the amount of
money appearing on your account is just
a number or value so if they go through
any crisis your money also comes at risk
a real life example of this was the
bankruptcy of layman brothers when they
caused a global recession in a nutshell
by giving your money to the bank you are
giving control of your money to someone
else and this causes the problem of
transparency and this doesn't stop there
due to to the irrational ratio of Banks
and data present technical failures and
double spending where due to internal
server issues the amount gets deducted
twice became prominent
issues Jordan was shocked to know such
an in-depth mechanism of Banks and how
they negatively affect their money and
wondered if these issues are so
prominent what is a
solution and that's when Jack replied
well there is a solution and it's
Bitcoin Jordan was confused and asked
what Bitcoin is Jack explained that
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that came
into existence in 2008 a white paper was
published by a guy named Satoshi
Nakamoto suggesting a way of creating a
system for a decentralized currency
called Bitcoin its motive was to show
the world that a decentralized control
structure can work with the
institutional government Bitcoin claimed
to create a digital solution that would
solve all these problems like double
spending corruption and low transparency
without the need for a central Authority
Jordan was excited to know about Bitcoin
but needed clarification about how
Bitcoin can solve such issues that large
institutions like Banks
cannot Jack further explained that
Bitcoin is a transparent Ledger without
a central Authority and works on
blockchain technology blockchain is a
system for storing data in a way that
makes it challenging or impossible to
alter hack or defraud the system a
blockchain is simply a network of
computer system systems that maintains
duplicate copies of all transactions in
a digital Ledger disseminated throughout
the network and BTC is the currency used
to make those transactions successful
and as there are no middlemen the
transaction cost is way cheaper as each
system in the network carries a copy of
The Ledger or transaction stored in it
making it impossible to hack or
manipulate because to do so you will
have to take down or hack every system
or node participating in the network
Bitcoin is completely digital Jordan
after knowing this asked how it could
solve his problem and how he could get
access to bitcoin if it's completely
digital Jack explained that one can
always buy Bitcoins once you own Bitcoin
it gives you a specific ID which gives
you full control over your money using
that ID you can send or receive funds in
your Bitcoin account that can be later
converted into any currency anytime you
want so if he would have invested that
same amount in Bitcoin years ago he
could have easily accessed it and it
would have been worth much more than
they were years
ago another reference is a vnes Sundar
famously known as meta Covan who became
a billionaire with just $5,000
investment all because of Bitcoin so
these examples are powerful enough to
establish the fact that Bitcoin is the
best alternative for today's Financial
establishment and also how bright its
future is going to be so let's get
started and let's talk about what is
Bitcoin mining so what is bitcoin so
let's take an example so there is
someone who wants to send five Bitcoins
to Rachel now we will see how this
transaction can happen now Bitcoin is
based on the concept of digital currency
anyone across the globe can transfer
amount in Bitcoin irrespective of the
geography from anyone to anyone so
basically you need to just open an
account on the Bitcoin Network have some
bit coins in it and you can transfer it
either you can purchase the Bitcoins
online through some exchanges or you can
mine it so once you have Bitcoins in
your account you can transfer it to
someone you want whose address you have
now do you want to know how this
transaction work well this transaction
is done by Bitcoin mining so we will go
deep and understand that how the Bitcoin
transaction Works what all entities are
involved behind the scenes in order to
maintain the sanity of the Bitcoin
Network and make sure that whomever you
wanted the Bitcoin to reach to has
reached and there is no loss of Bitcoin
in the network and it is a successful
transaction so let's understand certain
Basics so what's in it for us today we
need to know what is bitcoin we will
understand the underlying technology
blockchain so we will talk about that
then we will see what are the advantages
of Bitcoin as compared to other digital
currencies and other digital
Technologies then we will go into the
concepts of Bitcoin mining then what is
Bitcoin mining and we will do a demo on
certain aspects of Bitcoin mining now
what is bitcoin Bitcoin is the first
decentralized digital currency that
allows users to transfer money
peer-to-peer without any intermediaries
like Banks governments agents Brokers
nothing is involved and all this is done
using blockchain technology so as we saw
in our previous example two parties
wants to exchange money transfer money
they don't need an intermediate now
Bitcoin can be used for online purchases
e-commerce transactions it can be used
as an investment instrument and it can
be primarily used for payments to buy
goods and services now it was created in
2009 it came into existence by a person
or a group of people called Satoshi
nakoto now Bitcoin helps transferring of
assets faster than regular Fiat
currencies it has definitely lower
transaction fees because as it it has
removed the intermediaries from between
the cost of transaction also goes down
and it is cryptographically secure it
uses cryptography infrastructure and
thereby the identities of the sender and
the receiver are also secure and entire
transaction is cryptographically signed
and the users information who are doing
the transactions or are part of the
network is also hidden and secure now
what are the advantages of Bitcoin so it
allows fast and quick peer-to-peer
transactions it is impossible to
counterfeit or hack the transactions
which are running on a Bitcoin Network
and it's an overall decentralized
process there is no centralized body
which is controlling the transactions or
charging a fees in order to validate the
transaction it is the participants in
the decentralized network who are taking
care of the sanity of the network
thereby making sure that the overall
transaction cost is low all the
information is accessible to public it
is available publicly on a public Ledger
anyone can go and view the transactions
and the volume of the transactions
happening on the Bitcoin Network and it
is a low fee transaction it is
comparatively low to other mediums and
channels through which today digital
transactions are made now what is
blockchain so Bitcoin runs on the
underlying technology of blockchain
blockchain is a public distributed
Ledger in which transactions made in
Bitcoins or any other digital currency
are recorded in a chronological order so
let's see certain features it is
cryptography Ally secure signed using
your private key and then shared on the
network with the public key it is
immutable any record or any transaction
added on the blockchain cannot be
modified or altered it is run by a
decentralized system there is no
centralized Authority or the body and
the transactions are stored in
containers aggregated in containers
called blocks so a block is the smallest
unit of a blockchain which records all
the transaction a basic structure of a
block is something like this it has four
Fields these are the primary attributes
of a block it has something called as
previous hash so the previous hash
attribute stores the value of the hash
of the previous block and that's how the
blocks are linked to each of data this
is the aggregated set of transactions
which are included in this block so
these are the set of transactions which
were mined and validated and included in
the block nons so in proof of consensus
algorithm which is used in Bitcoin nons
is a random value which is used to vary
the output of the hash value so every
block is supposed to generate a hash
value and nons is the parameter which is
used to generate that hash value and the
proof of work is the process of
transaction verification done in
blockchain now hash is the resultant
hash value obtained by passing the
previous hash value the data and the
nons through the sh25 6 algorithm to
generate the hash of this block so this
is the digital signature of the block
which is generated and this is the
basically identity of this block now sh
256 is a cryptographic hash algorithm
which produces a unique 256 bit alpha
numeric hash value for any given input
and that is the unique feature of this
cryptographic algorithm whatever input
you give it will always produce a 256
bit hash now let's understand the
concepts of Bitcoin mining what is
Bitcoin mining Bitcoin mining is the
process of verifying Bitcoin
transactions and recording them onto the
public blockchain Ledger in blockchain
the transactions are verified by Bitcoin
users so basically the transactions have
to be verified by none other than the
participants of the network those who
have the required hardware and computing
power and those entities are called
miners so we will be talking about them
later but the point to be highlighted is
that there is nothing like a centralized
body as in case of Legacy transactions
where we used to be dependent on a
regulatory or governing body or a bank
to make our transactions go through now
in Bitcoin here any user with mining
hardware and internet access can take a
part that kind of computer can be a
participant and contribute to the mining
Community process is Sol based on a
difficult mathematical puzzle called
proof of work so every Minor's job is to
solve the mathematical puzzle which is
called proof of work in order to
validate the transaction and earn the
reward and all the miners as they're
competing amongst CS to mine a
particular transaction The Miner who
first sols a puzzle gets the reward now
users trying to solell the puzzle as I
said are called miners they are the
participants in the network who have the
necessary hardware and computing power
to do all the transactions to validate
the transactions and validate they are
called as miners now in order to
understand Bitcoin mining we need to
understand and three major concepts of
blockchain it is based on distributed
public Ledger it uses s 256 encryption
algorithm and proof of work is the
underlying consensus algorithm for
Bitcoin mining so distributed public
Ledger a distributed Ledger is a record
of all transactions maintained in the
blockchain network across the globe in
the network the validations of
transaction is done by Bitcoin users
called as miners s 256 now blockchain
prevents unauthorized access by using a
hash function called sha 256 to ensure
that the blocks are kept secure they are
digitally signed their hash value once
generated cannot be altered now s256 it
takes an input string of any size and
returns a fixed length 256bit output
value and that is the primary feature of
shf 256 encryption algorithm you give
any put it will always give you a 256bit
output and it is a oneway function you
cannot derive the input reverse F from
the output what you have generated and
third is the proof of work in blockchain
mining is a process to validate
transactions by solving a difficult
mathematical puzzle called proof of work
now in order to do that the primary
objective of the minor is to determine
the nons value and that nons value is
that mathematical puzzle that miners
required to solve Sol in order to
generate a hash Which is less than the
target defined by the network for a
particular block now in the Bitcoin
Network users trying to solve
mathematical puzzle are called as minus
now the puzzle is solved by varying a
nons which produces a hash value lower
than a predefined condition which is
called as the target miners verify the
transactions and add the block to the
blockchain when confirmed and verified
as of today the miners who solve the
puzzle gets a reward of 12.5 Bitcoins
now once a block is added to the
blockchain the Bitcoins associate with
the transactions can be spent so once
the block is validated then the transfer
of Bitcoins associated with the
transactions aggregated in the block the
transfers are made then from one account
to the another now in order to generate
the hash let's see you use the sha256
hashing algorithm you define the hash
value if it is less than the defined
condition the target then the puzzle is
deemed to be solved and if not then you
keep on incrementing nons value and you
repeat the sh 256 hashing function
passing on to the nons value and you
Define generate the hash value again and
you keep doing this process till the
time you get the hash value Which is
less than the Target now let's check an
example so for example Beyond wants to
share 10 Bitcoin with Gen now in order
to do that what will be the steps so
Bond transaction data is shared with
Bitcoin users the miners from the memory
pool the transaction goes and sits in a
memory pool of unmined transactions so
in a memory pool set of unmined or
unconfirmed transactions wait until they
are verified and included in a new block
they remain in that unconfirmed
transaction pool now miners competing to
validate the transaction using proof of
work they keep on continuously pulling
the unconfirmed transaction pool they
pick up those transactions and start
validating those transactions they they
aggregate in a data block and start
validating they start solving the puzzle
the minor who solves the puzzle first
shares his result across the other nodes
the other set of miners now once the
block is been verified the nons has been
generated then the nodes will start
granting their approval if maximum nodes
grant their approval the block becomes
valid and is added to the blockchain now
simultaneously the minor who has solved
the puzzle will also receive the reward
in the meanwhile which will be of 12.5
Bitcoin which as of today stands at 98k
around dollars now the Bitcoins the 10
BTC for which the transaction was
initiated now will get triggered and
will get transferred from beond to
Jenifer now let's take a look at certain
facts in proof of work a predefined
condition the target is adjusted for
every 2,00 ,6 block which is
approximately every 14 days and an
average time to mine a block is 10
minutes so basically the target keeps
automatically adjusting itself to keep
the block generation within the 10minute
time frame so this is the representation
so in order to keep the time frame for
Block generation within 10 minutes the
target keeps on adjusting itself now the
difficulty of the puzzle changes the
target changes depending on the time it
takes to mine a block so this is how a
difficulty of a block is being generated
it is the hash Target of the first block
divided by the hash Target of the
current block so this is the difficulty
which is being changed after every 2016
blocks so basically it is very hard to
generate the proof of work but it is
very easy to verify by the miners so
once you have solved the puzzle and you
have broadcasted that yes you have
earned you have validated a record you
have determined the puzzle for other
miners it is very easy to verify what
you have done and once they give their
consensus the majority then the block
gets validated and gets added to the
blockchain now since the difficulty
depends on the hash Target its value
keep on changing after every 2016 block
as I said and as you can see in due
course from the day of inception of
Bitcoin in 2009 till today difficulty
has increased exponentially and it has
been increasing and thereby the entire
effort of Mining and the computing power
is also increasing so as of what was the
resources which were required to do
mining in 2019 you require more hashing
power more computing power in order to
do the mining today now what if someone
tries to hack the data so let's see
blockchain is a chain of blocks a b c
now each block has solved a puzzle and
generated a hash value of its own which
is its identifier now suppose a person
tries to Tamper a block the Block B and
tries to change the data which is
aggregated in the block so if the data
of the block will change the hash value
which is the digital signature of the
block will also change thereby it will
corrupt the chain which is subsequent to
it basically the blocks ahead of Block B
will all get dink because the previous
hash value of Block C will not remain
valid so in order for the hacker to make
the entire blockchain valid for the
block which he has changed he has to
change the hash value of all the blocks
ahead of Block B which will require huge
huge amount of computing power which
will be next to impossible so as you see
the results in the following block being
invalid so with this whole thing the
blockchain is making sure that the
entire sequence remains non hackable and
prevent data modification now let's see
what are the underlying Hardware
requirements for Bitcoin mining and how
the hardware is evolved so in the early
days miners used to solve the puzzles
using regular processors the controlling
processor unit CPUs now but it used to
take a lot of time for mining though the
difficulty levels were low but still it
used to take a lot of time now as I said
the difficulties level keep on changing
and growing so the miners also had to
increase the processing power so they
discovered that graphical processing
units gpus proved to be more efficient
than regular CPUs so but this also had a
drawback of consumption of electric so
any minor who has to calculate the
return on investment on the hardware he
also has to accommodate the cost of
electricity and other resources which
are going in in order to do the mining
so finally as of today they are using a
hardware called Asic application
specific integrated circuit which was
specifically introduced for mining which
consumes less power and has a higher
computing power and a better hardware
for mining so miners are profitable when
their cost of resources to mine one
block is less than the price of the
reward they receiv receives so
definitely they have to have the
investment less than the reward what
they own so as of today in blockchain
miners use their resources to verify a
transaction they each time a block is
mined new Bitcoins are created in the
network so the Bitcoin total Supply is
limited it is at $21 million
approximately 21 million Bitcoin are in
Supply 17 to 18 million Bitcoins have
already been mined so only 3 to 4
million are left as of today a reward of
12.5 Bitcoin is given to the minor on
doing the transaction verification but
the Bitcoin mining reward goes by the
halfing principle the reward given to a
miner is half every 210,000 block which
is approximately every four years so
then after that threshold is reached the
Bitcoin reward will go down to 6.25
Bitcoins so let's take an example of a
lottery ticket where your chances of
winning is difficult so we are talking
about what is Bitcoin mining pool your
chances of winning the lottery is
difficult but in a community if
individuals buy multiple lottery tickets
and pull their tickets together then
this will increase their probability and
chances of winning more so suppose you
won the lottery then based on the
contribution the reward is distributed
among all the participants Bitcoin
mining pool is a similar thing it's a
process where multiple nodes share their
resources together to mine a block now
when a block is soled the miners split
the reward equally based on the amount
of processing power they have invested
so it takes the pool members to generate
a final hash value then it checks how
much amount of work was contributed by
each pool member and as a result the
Bitcoin reward gets distributed
proportionally amongst the participants
now let's take a look at a demo on how
can you see what is the Bitcoin board
now this is a actual block of the
Bitcoin Network as you can see this is a
block and this is the block reward 12.5
Bitcoin so this was a block which was
mine this is the block number and these
are the set of transactions which were
part of this block now once this block
was mined by the minor all these
transactions then be done these are the
transfers of Bitcoin from one account to
the other this is the nons which was
generated by The Miner or the mining
pool in order to mine the block and
these are the other attributes and if
you take a look at this URL this is an
example of a mining pool it's a demo
account where the participants have
shared their mining resources and they
are mining it in a pool and see this is
the reward for which they are mining
this is the unconfirmed reward this is
the confirmed reward this is what they
have already validated and this is what
they have earned so far so these are the
hash these are the block numbers which
they have mined so why wait let's embark
on this exhilarating adventure together
but before we dive in if you're looking
to take your career to new heights and
become a true expert in the realm of
blockchain and cryptocurrency consider
checking out our professional
certificate program in blockchain in
collaboration with di canut it's an
excellent opportunity to master key
architectural principles and develop the
skills needed to excel in this rapidly
growing field ethereum and its
Concepts ethereum simply put while
Bitcoin is defined as digital money
ethereum is a decentralized platform
that runs the smart contracts exactly
the way they are programmed without any
downtime fraud and third-party
interference and also has its own
cryptocurrency called ether ethereum
aims to enable Innovations in three key
areas currency Assurance through ether
which serves as an innate currency for
the ethereum blockchain decentralized
autonomous
organization smart
contracts features of ethereum the first
feature of ethereum is that it is secure
because it is almost impossible to
tamper with the transactions in the
block or to add any fraudulent blocks in
the network the second feature of
ethereum is its Community following
ethereum has attracted a lot of
attention from people all over the world
the third feature of ethereum is its
corporate friendly structure the
platform is being leveraged by a number
of corporates to test and build various
applications the fourth feature that we
will take a look at is the possibility
of creating new assets on ethereum
blockchain that can be used as currency
a representation of an asset a virtual
share a proof of membership or anything
at all the next feature is the ability
of ethereum to process the transactions
fast while Bitcoin requires a block time
of 10 minutes in ethereum it's only a
few seconds the last feature that we
will discuss is the fact that ethereum
is uncensored ethereum's open-source
Network all ows complete transparency to
view every transaction all right that's
all about the features of ethereum let
me tell you about an important Concept
in ethereum called
gas gas in
ethereum gas is the fundamental block of
ethereum ecosystem that is paid for
every operation performed on the
ethereum blockchain it is the crypto
fuel for ethereum it can be considered a
transaction fee which has to be paid
when one party sends ethers to another
party even when a person deploys a smart
contract on the ethereum blockchain a
transaction fee needs to be paid for
that as well this payment has to be made
regardless of whether the transaction
succeeds or fails gas price is expressed
in ether and the minor decides whether
to refuse the transaction process or not
based on the expected gas price one can
see their transaction fee in eth or USD
when searching for the transaction on
etherscan.io
when somebody refers to gas they are
either talking about gas price or gas
limit the total cost of a transaction is
the product of gas limit and gas price
the gas limit is defined as a limit
since it's the maximum amount of units
of gas one is willing to spend on a
single transaction
this avoids situations where there is an
error somewhere in the contract and you
end up spending a very high amount of
gas however the units of gas required
for a transaction are defined by the
amount of code executed on the
blockchain lowering the gas limit below
the amount required will not help much
if enough gas to cover the computational
resources of the network is not supplied
with the transaction the transaction
will fail due to an outof gas error SO
gas is a commodity which is essentially
a cost of using the system like Bitcoins
ethereum also has its currency which is
called
ether
ether it is an incentive that the client
of the platform pays to execute
requested operations it ensures that the
developers write error-free codes
because unnecessary codes will increase
the cost ethereum is a blockchainbased
platform and ether is the crypto
currency that fuels the platform it is
commonly denoted as
eth let's have a look at the differences
between Bitcoin and
ether Bitcoin versus ether the first
difference is in the hashtag algorithm
used by these
cryptocurrencies while Bitcoin uses sh2
56 to encrypt blocks of blockchain
ethereum uses eash to encrypt blocks
technically both are one-way
cryptographic hash
functions the second difference is in
the use of Bitcoin and ether as we have
discussed earlier Bitcoin is only used
for financial transactions like purchase
and sale of goods and services however
ethereum being a touring complete
platform also supports smart contracts
and decentralized
applications the third difference is in
the price of the two
cryptocurrencies currently the price of
BTC is approximately $3500 us while that
of eth is approximately
$100 the market cap of BTC is almost six
times greater than that of BTC even
though eth has a higher circulating
Supply the fourth difference is in the
vision behind creation of these two
cryptocurrencies BTC is a currency
created to compete against the gold and
flat currencies by acting as an
alternative however eth is created as a
token to facilitate smart contract
deployment and
operations lastly the transaction speed
of BTC is much slower than eth while
btc's transaction speed is measured in
minutes eth is just a few seconds like
Bitcoins ethers are also stored in
cryptocurrency wallets let's understand
what are wallets in
ethereum ethereum virtual machine
ethereum wallets a wallet is the place
to securely store ethers in other crypto
currencies basically a wallet stores the
means of accessing your currency using
the private key now that I have told you
about the ethereum and its currency it
will only be fair that I explain evm now
evm ethereum virtual machine abbreviated
as evm is an engine which executes
translation code smart contracts are
compiled into B code which an evm can
read and execute the ethereum virtual
machine can be regarded as a quasi
touring complete machine it possesses
its own programming language known as
the evm bik code once the code is
written in higher level programming
languages the code can be compiled to an
evm bite code the ethereum virtual
machine uses a set of instructions
called op codes to execute specific
specific tasks thus if a user triggers a
transaction of five eth using his
desktop wallet the wallet sends the
message to the evm which connects with
the wallet address on the ethereum
network to process the transaction and
send it to the receiver smart contracts
are written in ethereum specific
programming languages let's learn more
about these
languages ethereum languages
every contract written for ethereum is
compiled into the evm B code and
deployed to ethereum blockchain for
execution ethereum uses the following
languages the first language is solidity
solidity is an objectoriented highlevel
language used for implementation of
smart contracts on the ethereum
blockchain solidity was influenced by
python C++ and JavaScript it is designed
to Target the
evm the second language is a low-level
lisp like language abbreviated as Triple
L it is one of the original ethereum
smart contract programming languages and
is similar to assembly it is meant to be
a very simple and minimalistic language
essentially serving as a tiny rapper
over coding in evm directly the third
language is Viper which is a contract
oriented programming language influenced
by python the fourth language is serpent
which is an assembly language that
compiles to evm code that is extended
with various highlevel
features the next language is muton
muton is similar to C likee language and
supports a dynamic full higher level
language it compiles to Native ethereum
assembler however Mutan is now
deprecated the last language is Julia it
is an intermediate language that can
compile to various different backends
like evm 1.0 evm 1.5 and ew ASM let me
now tell you about the accounts handled
by
ethereum types of ethereum
accounts externally owned accounts eoa
is an an account controlled by a private
key that has the ability to send ethers
and messages from it following are some
of the properties of an externally owned
account firstly it has an ether balance
secondly it can send
transactions thirdly it is controlled by
private keys and fourthly it has no
Associated code smart contract smart
contract is a a code running on top of
the blockchain containing a set of rules
for the nodes to agree upon so that they
can interact with each other as an
account it has the following properties
firstly it has an ether balance secondly
it has an Associated code thirdly a code
execution is triggered by transactions
or messages received from other
contracts and fourthly when executed it
performs op operations of arbitrary
complexity some of the advantages of
smart contracts are as follows first
smart contract is the simplest way of
implementing
decentralization second it provides a
high degree of security third it
eliminates the need for a third party
fourth it provides automatic agreement
enforcement fifth it turns legal
obligations into an automated process
processes and lastly it lowers the
transaction cost characteristics of
smart contracts smart contracts are
self-verifying and
self-executing they operate autonomously
to execute the terms of the contract and
verify the transactions without the need
of a third-party intervention the
elimination of third parties reduces the
cost of operations and further makes the
contracts tamper resistant
process of smart
contracts in this slide we will
understand how the smart contract works
first an optional contract between the
parties is written as a code into the
blockchain the individuals involved are
Anonymous but the contact is made
through a public Ledger then a trigger
event like an expiration date or a
strike price is hit and the contract
executes itself according to the coded
terms
next Regulators can use the blockchain
to understand the activities in the
market while maintaining the privacy of
an individual's position let me show you
the implementation of smart contract in
a simple use
case smart contract
example here we have an example showing
the purchase and sale of a house thus
once a buyer is matched with a seller
all assets are sent into the contract
the contract then distributes the assets
based on certain predetermined
conditions agreed between both parties
and coded into the smart contract thus
the settlement is automated and the
ownership becomes Undisputed due to the
transparency of blockchain eoa versus
smart contract in this slide we will
understand the difference between an eoa
and a smart contract based on four
critical
properties Nots in an external Ally
owned account non represents the number
of transactions sent from the account's
address however in a contract account
the nons is the number of contracts
created by the account the next property
is balance this number shows the amount
of way owned by the address whether the
eoa or contract account each ether is
divided into 1+ 18 Wei the next property
is code hash it is the hash of the
ethereum virtual machine code of an
account this is the code that gets
executed if this address receives a
message call it is immutable and thus it
cannot be changed once the construction
is done for externally owned accounts
the code hash field is the hash of the
empty string for contract accounts this
is the code that gets hashed and is
stored as the code hash the lab last
property is storage route it is a
256bit hash of the root node of a Merkel
tree that encodes the storage contents
of the account encoded into the tree as
a mapping from the keyak
256bit hash of the
256-bit integer keys to the rlp encoded
256bit integer values this tree encodes
the hash of the storage contents of this
account and is is empty by
default that was all about the ethereum
concepts and accounts let's understand
the process of mining
now ethereum
mining ethereum mining ethereum makes
use of proof of work mechanism to ensure
security the algorithm used in ethereum
is called
eash each time an ethereum transaction
is made a is responsible for ensuring
the authenticity of information and
updating the blockchain with the
transaction let's consider an example
where Bob wants to send one eth to Alice
now we will take a look at the
step-by-step process that is followed in
order to confirm this transaction
through mining first Bob attempts to
send Alice one e once Bob's transaction
is initiated it is combined with other
transactions that have occurred in the
last block the miners will then validate
the block with a new set of instructions
once validated the minor creates a new
block and is rewarded for it thus Alice
receives one eth after the transaction
is
validated ethereum mining the term
transaction is used in ethereum to refer
to the signed data package that contains
a message to be sent from an eoa to
another account on the blockchain
ethereum blocks contain two things a
transaction list and a recent state of
The Ledger that comprises these
transactions in the example shown on the
screen we can see a transaction where
one wallet sends 20 eth to another
wallet the diagram shows the previous
state and the next state for the
transaction State Storage the states are
assembled into a state tree that is
linked to the account and the block the
ethereum includes State roots that store
the root hash of the hash tree which
represents the system State when the
block was created now we will take a
look at the step-by-step process to see
how ethereum stores
transactions first a hash is generated
for each
transaction then pairs are selected and
a hash is generated for each pair this
way the last remaining hash becomes the
root the block header as seen in the
image on the screen contains the
previous block has and three Merkel
trees these trees are to maintain the
state to maintain the transactions and
to maintain the receipts also each block
always refers to its previous blocks
hash ethereum ecosystem
types of ethereum tools the ethereum
ecosystem consists of eight major tools
they are gu
ganache
parody
metamask Mist wallet
swarm
ipfs
whisper now let's move forward and take
a look at each of these in
detail gu gu is a multi-purpose Man line
tool that runs an ethereum node
implemented in go it is the official
goang implementation of the ethereum
protocol and is commonly used to
interact with the ethereum network
though there are several ways to
download GI the fastest one is to get it
from the ethereum.org
website next we have ganach CLI ganach
CLI ganach CLI is a customizable and
fast emulator for blockchain which
permits making calls to blockchain
without the need for running an actual
ethereum node following are some of the
properties of
ganache firstly transactions are mined
instantly secondly no transaction cost
thirdly accounts can be recycled reset
and instantiated with a fixed number of
ether without the need for faucets or
mining fourthly gas price and Mining
speed can be modified fifthly a
convenient GUI gives you an overview of
your test chain events parody parity is
the fastest lightest and most secure
ethereum client that provides the core
infrastructure Essentials for quick and
reliable Services parody is written in
Rust language it offers better
reliability code Clarity and performance
it is an ethereum client that is
integrated directly into your web
browser apart from allowing the users to
access the functions of basic ether and
token wallet it also serves as an
ethereum GUI browser it provides access
to a diverse range of ethereum features
including D
apps metamask metamask turns Google
Chrome into a browser that allows the
users to send and receive transactions
and also fetch data from the
blockchain it is a browser-based wallet
which can be added as a plugin to your
Chrome browser it permits you to run
ethereum D apps directly from your
browser without the need for running a
full ethereum node metamask
accounts practically it is unrealistic
for everyone in the world to run a node
to interact with the ethereum blockchain
to overcome this metamask hosts a number
of nodes so you don't have to a user
simply needs to install metamask and can
automatically get connected to the nodes
thus you can use the ethereum blockchain
seamlessly let's talk Mist which is
another important tool of the blockchain
ecosystem Mist wallet Mist wallet is the
end user interface for ethereum that is
developed for browsing and using D apps
mist is an official ethereum wallet it
was developed and distributed by the
team which is responsible for the
management of ethereum ecosystem it is
usually used by developers who want to
create deploy and use Smart contracts it
is a full node wallet which means you'll
have to download the entire ethereum
blockchain onto your computer some of
the applications of mist wallet is as
follows first sending and receiving
transactions second storing ether third
creating multi- signature wallets and
fourth deploying smart
contracts
swarm swarm is a platform which supports
distributed storage and provides content
distribution services it acts as a
native base layer service of the
ethereum
web 3 stack it provides sufficient
decentralization and redundant storage
of ethereum Records to distribute
blockchain data as well as daa codes it
leverages the underlying ethereum
infrastructure through the use of
contracts and ethers to encourage
cooperation among nodes the files are
split into pieces and are stored in the
nodes of the network an accounting
protocol is used by peers to to keep
track of these chunks delivered and
received and resulting micro payments
associated with
it
ipfs ipfs is a decentralized storage
system that is not related directly to
ethereum but can be integrated with it
ipfs stores data by use of a distributed
hash table or
DHT once we know the hash we request the
the peer Network who has a copy of the
content located at the corresponding
hash and then we download the content
from the node who has the desired data
which we need the data transfer between
the nodes in the network uses a
mechanism which is similar to the one
used in bit torrent it also provides a
versioned file system capable of storing
files and tracking versions over time
thus it defines how files move across a
network making it a distributed file
system by combining all of these
properties ipfs is enabling a new
permanent web and augmenting the way we
use existing internet protocols like
HTTP whisper whisper is an
identity-based communication protocol
for D apps to interact with each other D
apps that need to publish small amounts
of information to each other and have
the publication last some substantial
amount of time prefer using whisper for
instance a d app running a currency
exchange may use whisper to record an
offer to buy a currency at a pre-agreed
price on the exchange platform some of
the drawbacks of whisper are as follows
it has low-level API which is only
exposed to D apps and never to users
second it has low bandwidth and is not
designed for large data transfers third
it has uncertain latency and lastly it
has no reliable methods for tracing
packets ethereum
Frameworks we'll look at two types of
ethereum
Frameworks
web3.js
web3.js is a set of libraries which
permit one to interact with a remote or
local ethereum node it can be done with
the use of IPC or an HTTP connection the
key connection between ethereum Network
and dap that allows you to compile
deploy and interact with smart contracts
is called web3.js
it gives us a way to build a website or
client that can talk to the ethereum
blockchain let's take an example of of
traditional development when you develop
a website it talks to apis using Json or
jQuery to make Ajax calls a website
talks to blockchain using web 3 using
json. RPC which is similar to making a
remote procedure call ethereum comprises
of a large number of nodes which talk to
each other we use Json RPC to make a
request to a particular node which is
like an a API call thus if we want to
talk to a Smart contract or read an
account we do it through web 3 e. JS it
is a highly optimized lightweight JS
utility for ethereum based on
web.js in this all the unnecessary
characters are removed from the source
code and the code is reduced to 160
kilobytes ethereum development
environment the the three commonly used
ethereum development environments
include remix IDE truffle and Embark
let's understand these environments in a
little more detail remix IDE remix IDE
is a browser-based compiler and IDE that
enables users to debug transactions and
build ethereum contracts with solidity
language you can simply log on to the
webbased editor write the code and
compile the same to create the bite code
in order to test your code the next
slide shows how remix
looks another popular environment is
truffle truffle truffle is a development
environment testing framework and asset
pipeline for blockchains using the
ethereum virtual machine or evm it helps
users in developing smart contracts
publish the contracts and test them then
we have embark embark embark is an
environment that allows you to easily
develop and deploy decentralized
applications it performs the following
functions first automatic deployment of
contracts second keeping track of
deployed contracts third managing the
complex systems of interdependent
contracts fourth
performing test driven deployment with
contracts using
JavaScript fifth managing different
chains like test net private net and
livet and lastly redeploy the contracts
if any changes are done let's talk about
ethereum networks ethereum Network the
basis for decentralized consensus is the
peer-to-peer network of participating
nodes which maintain and secure the
blockchain a node is defined as a device
or a program that can communicate with
the ethereum blockchain network they are
also referred to as clients they provide
wallet functionality and allow users to
perform transactions on the
blockchain thus a node serves as a
machine running as an ethereum client it
is used to store the data and transer
money it is formed by combining one or
more nodes and each node contains a copy
of of the blockchain types of network
there are three main types of networks
the test net the main net and the
private
Network ethereum D apps and
daos D App decentralized application is
an application that is used on networks
with trustless protocols to avoid a
single point of failure they run on a
peer-to-peer computer network all the
activity which takes place place on an
ethereum decentralized application is
cryptographically secured on the
blockchain D apps are open source which
means that everyone can verify the
contents of the software some properties
of D apps are as follows it uses
ethereum as a development platform it
uses cryptographically encoded blocks it
is not governed by a central server and
there is no master copy of
daab let's talk about the advantages of
DS now advantages of daab ethereum DS
have the following advantages improved
stability due to a distributed Network
higher
reliability automatic credentials
assigned through smart contracts no
downtime no third-party intervention and
high security example of daps some of
the known examples of D apps include we
fund
storage kyc chain and 4G Capital these
companies have developed different
applications using
blockchain next we have the
daos
Dao daos are organizations designed to
hold assets and use the voting system to
distribute them they exist entirely on
blockchain and are governed by the
consensus
protocols they show the potential of
blockchain to revolutionize human social
institutions called
daos it is an organization run by rules
agreed through a consensus process among
its members and written in a set of
contracts run via a blockchain it is an
open-source software capable of
modification by its members process of a
Dao now let's take an example and see
how this works let's consider that a
country is holding elections and wants
to prevent fraud in the voting system a
Dao is created to keep transparency in
the voting this is ensured by embedding
predefined conditions in the code people
eligible to vote are assigned voting
tokens and the voting starts every vote
is processed on the ethereum blockchain
and it ensures transparency by allowing
everything to run in a decentralized way
so now let's take a look what's in it
for all of us today we will be talking
about what is ethereum the features of
ethereum like cryptocurrency smart
contracts ethereum virtual machine
decentralized application and it uses
and decentralized autonomous
organization we will be also looking at
applications of ethereum and a demo on
Smart contract deployment on a locally
running ethereum client now what is
ethereum ethereum is a blockchain based
Computing platform that enables
developers to build and deploy
decentralized applications so basically
ethereum is a platform where we can
build applications which are not run by
a centralized Authority you can create a
decentralized application where the
participants of that particular
application are the decision-making
Authority so the here we can see
ethereum allows us to build and deploy
dap applications now what are the
typical features of ethereum ethereum
allows you to use its own cryptocurrency
called e it allows development and
deployment of smart contracts it
provides you the underlying technology
the architecture the software which
understands smart contracts and allow
you to interact with it which is called
ethereum virtual machine then it allows
eventually to create Consolidated
applications called decentralized
applications and also it allows you to
create decentralized autonomous
organization now let's talk about e
ethereum cryptocurrency ether e is a
cryptocurrency that runs on ethereum
network basically it is the fuel which
is running the ethereum network it is
used to pay for the computational
resources and the transaction fees for
any transaction to be executed on a
ethereum network like Bitcoin ether is
also a peer-to-peer currency apart from
paying for transaction ether is also
used to buy gas which is used to pay for
computation of any transaction you make
on a ethereum network also if you have
to deploy a contract on ethereum network
you would need gas and you would have to
pay for that gas in ethers SO gas is the
execution fee paid by a user for running
a transaction in etherium ether can be
utilized for building decentralized
applications for building your smart
contracts and making standard
peer-to-peer payments now what is a
smart contract a smart contract is a
simple computer program
that facilitates the exchange of any
valuable asset between two parties it
could be money it could be shares it
could be property or it could be any
other digital asset which you want to
exchange these contracts can be created
by anyone on the ethereum network and
primarily the contract consists of the
terms and conditions mutually agreed
between the parties between the peers
and the primary feature of a smart
contract is that once it is executed it
cannot be altered and any transaction
done on top of a smart contract is
registered permanently it is immutable
so even in future you modify the smart
contract the transactions correlated
with the original contract does not get
altered or you cannot modify them so for
the verification process smart contract
is carried out amongst the anonymous
parties of the network without the need
of a centralized Authority and that's
what makes any smart contract execution
on ethereum a decentralized execution it
provides the transfer of any asset or
currency in a transparent and a
trustworthy manner as the two entities
are totally unaware their identity is
secure on the ethereum network though
the transactions once successfully done
the accounts of the sender and receiver
are updated accordingly and there why it
generates a trust between the parties
who are transacting using the ethereum
network now what happens in traditional
system of contract in traditional
systems of contract you sign an
agreement then you trust a third party
hire a third party for execution now the
problem is that in such an engagement
the data tampering is possible now if we
talk about the new smart contract the
agreement is coded in a program now
result is not verified by a centralized
Authority it is verified by the
participants on ethereum based
blockchain Network now once a contract
is exed uted the transaction is
registered and it cannot be altered or
tampered so it removes the risk of any
data manipulation or alteration now
let's take another example where Jack
has given a contract of $500 to Elsa for
developing his company's website now the
developers code the agreement of smart
contract using ethereum's programming
language now the smart contract has all
the conditions the requirements for
building the website once the code is
written it is uploaded and deployed on
the ethereum evm virtual machine evm is
a runtime compiler to execute your smart
contract once the code is deployed on
the evm every participant on the network
has a copy of the contract now now when
Elsa submits the work on ethereum for
evaluation each node on the ethereum
network will evaluate and confirm
whether the result given by Elsa is done
as per the coding requirements and once
approved and verified the contract worth
$500 will be self- executed and the
payment will be paid to Elsa in ethers
so John's account the person who had
gone into a contract his account will be
automatically debited and Elsa will be
credited with $500 in ether denomination
here we will now take a look we will do
a demo small demo on a deployment of a
smart contract so for in order to
execute our smart contract we will need
two set of softwares ganach and truffle
and we will show you in the demo how to
install these two softwares on your
machine now we will be giving a demo on
the following smart contract this is a
smart contract where we are writing a
simple contract of a greeter we have a
variable called greeting which we will
be initializing using a Constructor and
then in our demo we will be showing how
you can change the value of the variable
greeting using the set greeting method
and read the value using the Greet
method this is the other contract where
we will be defining that whoever is
deploying the contract on the blockchain
network is always the owner of the
contract and then we have defined
certain mandatory functions in order to
kill the contract on the ethereum
network so only the owner of the
contract can kill it now let's talk
about what is an ethereum virtual
machine eum virtual machine is designed
to operate as a runtime environment for
compiling and deploying ethereum based
smart contracts basically evm is the
engine which understands the language of
smart contracts which are written in
solidity language for ethereum evm is
operated in a sandbox environment
basically you can deploy your own
Standalone environment which can act as
a testing and a development environment
and you can n number of times test your
smart contract deploy it verify it and
then once you are satisfied with the
performance and the functionality of the
smart contract you can deploy it on the
ethereum main net now any programming
language in the smart contract is
compiled into the bite code which the
evm understands this bite code can be
read and executed you using an ethereum
feature called ethereum virtual machine
so basically evm machine understands a
bite code so one of the most popular
languages for writing a smart contract
is solidity so once you write your smart
contract on solidity that contract gets
converted into the bite code and gets
deployed on the evm and thereby evm
guarantees security from Cyber attack
now how does evm work so suppose a wants
to pay B 10 ethers the transaction will
be sent to the evm using a smart
contract for a funds transfer from A to
B now in order to validate the
transaction the ethereum network will
perform the proof of work consensus
algorithm the minor nodes on the
ethereum will validate this transaction
whether the first the identity of a
exist or not a has the relevant amount
of balance to transfer 10 ether to B and
in will validate the transaction once
validated The Ether will be debited from
A's wallet and will be credited to B's
wallet and during this course the miners
will charge a fees in order to validate
this transaction and will earn a reward
now all the nodes on ethereum network
execute smart contract using their
respective EVMS now how does proof of
work works every node in the ethereum
network has the entire history of all
the transactions the entire chain it has
the history of smart contract B
basically the address at which the smart
contract is deployed the transactions
associated with the smart contract and
also it has the handle to the current
state of the smart contract now the goal
of the miners on the ethereum blockchain
network is to validate the block for
each block of transaction my ERS use the
computational power and resources to get
the appropriate hash value by varying
the nons now the miners will vary the
nons and pass it through a hashing
algorithm in case of ethereum it is the
it has algorithm this produces a hash
value which should be lesser than the
predefined target as per the proof of
work consensus if the hash value
generated is less than the target value
then only the block is considered to be
verified and the minor gets rewarded
only then now when the proof of work is
solved result is broadcasted and shared
with all the other nodes in order to
update their Ledger if other nodes
accept the hash block as valid then the
block gets added to the ethereum main
net blockchain and as a result the minor
receives a reward which as of today
stands at three ethers plus the minor
receives the transaction fees which has
been generated for verifying the block
all the transactions which are
aggregated in the block the cumulative
transaction fees associated with all the
transactions is also rewarded to the
minor now do you know in ethereum a
process called proof of stake is also
under development and it is an
alternative to proof of work it is meant
to be a solution to minimize the use of
expensive resources you spent for mining
using proof of work now in proof of
stake The Miner is actually the
validator can validate the transactions
based on the amount of crypto coins he
or she holds before he or she can start
the mining So based on the accumulation
or the repository of crypto coins with
the miner beforehand will give him the
higher probability of mining the block
now however proof of stake is not widely
adopted as of now as compared to proof
of work algorithm now let's understand
the concept of gas now ethereum virtual
machine has a concept of gas and why do
we need it so like we need fuel to run
car in the same way in order to to run
application on ethereum network we need
gas now what is gas to perform any
transaction on ethereum network a user
has to make a payment has to Shell out
ethers in order to get the execution
done the transaction done and the
intermediat monetary value is called as
gas on ethereum network gas is a unit
that measures the computational power
required to run a smart contract or a
transaction so if you have to do a
transaction which is updating the
blockchain you would have to Shell out
gas and that gas will come with a price
in ethers now how is the gas fees
calculated in ethereum the transaction
fees is calculated in ethereum using the
below formula for every transaction
there is a gas and the correlated gas
price so the amount of gas required to
execute a transaction multiplied by the
gas price you generate the transaction
fees so gas limit on ethereum network
refers to the amount of gas which is
used for the computation and the amount
of ether a user is required to pay for
the gas now here we have a screenshot
from the ethereum main net where the
cost of transaction is being shown so if
you see for this particular example
transaction the gas limit was 21,000 the
gas used by the transaction was 21,000
and the gas price was 21 GUI which is
the lowest denomination so 21 GUI into
21,000 gave you the actual transaction
fees which is
0441 ether which is approximately 21
cents as of today's ether market value
now this transaction fee goes to the
minor who has validated the transaction
to understand the gas limit and the gas
price in a better way let's consider an
example of a car suppose your car has a
mileage of 10 km and the price of petrol
is $1 per liter then driving a car for
50 km will cost you 5 L of petrol which
will be worth $5 similarly to perform an
operation or to run a code on ethereum
you need to pend certain amount of gas
like the petrol where each gas has a per
unit price called gas price now if a
user provides less amount of gas to run
a particular operation then the process
will fail and the user will be given a
message of out of gas and GUI is the
lowest denomination of ether which is
used for measuring unit of a gas price
now how is ethereum's mining different
from Bitcoin mining the hashing
algorithm is the primary difference the
Bitcoin uses sha 256 ethereum uses it
has the average time taken on bitcoin
for mining a block is 10 minutes whereas
in ethereum it is 12 to 15 seconds as of
today the mining reward for Bitcoin is
12.5 BTC but for ethereum is is three
ethers plus the transaction fee the
accumulated transaction fee for all the
transactions for a block now as of 23rd
July the Bitcoin value was
$766 whereas one ether stands at
$466 now here we have a screenshot of a
ethereum reward which has been given to
the minor of the block now as you can
see here is the breakup of the reward
three ethers plus the total accumulated
transaction fee of all the underlying
transactions in this block which is
0666 ethers now now what is a
decentralized application now let's
compare it with our traditional
applications our traditional websites
which are currently running so for
example when you log into Twitter a web
application gets displayed which is
rendered using an HTML page now the page
will call an API to access your personal
data your information which is centrally
hosted now it's a simple process the
front end executes a backend API and the
API goes and fetches the information
from a centralized DB now if we
transform this application into a
decentralized application then now when
you will log in the same application
will get rendered but it will be calling
a smart contract based API to fetch the
information from the blockchain network
so the API gets replaced with the smart
contract interface and the smart
contract will fetch the information from
the blockchain network which is its back
end and that blockchain network is not a
centralized DB it's a decentralized
network where the participants of the
network the miners of the network are
validating verifying all the
transactions which are happening using
the smart contract on the blockchain
network so thereby any now any
transaction or any action happening on
the Twitter kind of application which
has been transformed will now cannot be
claimed as a centralized uh transaction
it will be a decentralized transaction a
Dap a decentralized application consists
of backend code that runs on a
distributed peer-to-peer Network it it
is a software designed to work on an
ethereum Network without being
controlled by a centralized system and
that is the primary difference it
provides the direct interaction between
the end users and the decentralized
application providers now an application
qualifies as dap when it is open sourced
its code is there on GitHub and it uses
a public blockchain based token in order
to run the application a token acts as a
fuel for the decentralized application
to run dap allows the backend code and
data to be decentralized and that is the
primary architecture of any dap now
let's discuss what are decentralized
autonomous organizations Dows is a
digital organizations that wants to
operate without any need of a heral
management it wants to operate in a
decentralized and a democratized fashion
so basically a DA is an organization
where the decision making should not be
in the hands of a centralized Authority
but it should be in the hands of certain
designated authorities or a group of
designated people as a part of authority
it exists on a blockchain network where
it is governed by the protocols embedded
in a smart contract and thereby they
rely on a smart contract for decision-
making all the business decisions are
driven by the smart contracts or we can
say a decentralized voting system within
the organization so any organization
ation decision before being taken has to
go through the voting system which is
running on a decentralized application
so how it work people add funds to the
DA because da requires funding in order
to execute and take decisions based on
that each member is given a token on a
percentage basis which represents the
percentage of shares of that particular
member in the da now those tokens are
used to vote in the Dow where the
proposal status is decided based on the
maximum votes so every decision within
the organization has to go through this
voting process now let's take a look
what are the applications of ethereum in
real world and where it is getting used
so as we have seen with da voting
systems are adopting it the results of
the polls are publicly available where
it ensures a transparent and fair
democracy by eliminating voting
malpractices it is getting adopted
widely in a banking scenarios and
banking systems with ethereums
decentralized system it is becoming very
difficult for hackers to have
unauthorized access and it also allows
payments on a ethereum based Network so
banks are also using ethereum as a
channel to make remittances and payments
shipping deploying ethereum in shipping
helps tracking of cargo and prevents
goods from being misplaced or
counterfeited so basically ethereum is
providing you a the provenance and
tracking framework for any kind of asset
required in a typical supply chain now
with ethereum's smart contract
agreements can be maintained and
executed without any alteration so any
industry which has fragmented
participants is subject to disputes and
uh which requires and digital contracts
to be present then ethereum can
definitely be used as a technology for
developing your smart contract and
digitally recording the agreements and
the transactions based on those
agreements so let's get started for a
demo on how to deploy an ethereum smart
contract locally so in order to deploy a
smart contract we will be first
installing ganache client which allows
you to host a local ethereum client on
which you can deploy your smart contract
so as we are working on the Windows
environment when we are downloading the
ganache setup we can also download node
order to install ruffle on our
machines now as the node has been
downloaded we will install
node so now node is successfully
installed now we're going to install
ganach locally
now we will run ganach a little later
before that we will perform certain
steps or we can run ganach and see so
once ganach is up and running I'll show
you the interface how it
looks so when ganach is brought up it
automatically creates 10 accounts with
prefunds of 100 ethers it is running on
Local Host port number
7545 now as you see there is no
transaction or anything which has
currently happened so the current block
is zero which is the Genesis block there
are no transactions and there are no
blocks as of now so there are no
transactions and blocks which have been
generated so using this ganach CLI now
we will be deploying our greeta contract
now as we have installed node we will be
installing truffle truffle is the
utility which allows us to compile and
deploy ethereum
contracts okay now once truffle is
installed we need to create a directory
called
grer now we need to run the command
truffle now once we run this command
ruffle by default creates a package
structure which has three folders called
contracts migrations test truffle. JS
and truffle config now we will be
writing our smart contract called
greeter doou and we will compile and
deploy basically our greeter do soul
will be under contracts folder and we
can
our contract is created and it is lying
under contracts folder now we need to
add another file under migrations folder
called as deploy contract.
JS so we will name it as deploy contract
now in this deploy contract we need to
put line of
code now in this file we are asking
ruffle to deploy our newly created
greer. Soul file now in the Greer
contract we have a Constructor we are
initializing the greater contract with a
value hi hello and we are passing a gas
value so this gas is currently at a
higher limits and we know at this gas
value the contract will get executed but
otherwise you can also evaluate the gas
value of a contract using remix now once
this file is been saved you go to the
truffle. JS and make the following
entry now here we are telling truffle
that our Local Host ganach client is
running on local host at Port number
7545 and network ID can be anything
though the current ganach client is
running on Port network ID 57 but we
have kept it open that we can connect to
any network ID now after this step need
to go back to my command prompt and say
truffle
compile now if you get this error if we
are getting this kind of error in
Windows then need to do one quick
fix we need to go to the users directory
and rename truffle. CMD to truff so I'll
go to my drive
users apping just
now here now instead of truffle I have
to say
truff now there might be certain
compilation warnings we can ignore that
now my contract is been compiled now I
need to run the next command truff
migrate at this stage my smart contract
is deployed and now you can see
this is the step this is the place where
the contract has been called and this is
the transaction where the default value
of my variable greeter has been set to
hi hello so we will see now I need to
run command Tru
console to interact with my contract now
as on my truff console I can check at
what address is my contract deployed so
my contract is deployed at address 0 x37
which matches with the address 0x
373 now I need to check the default
value which I had set while deploying my
contract so this is my value hi hello
now I can change the value to something
else because in my greeter contract I
have a method called set greeting now
whenever when I'll be performing this
action
a new block will get generated and the
block count will increase from 4 to 5
because I'm making a change on the
blockchain as you can see now a new
transaction has been created this was
the gas used this is the default gas
price in ganache and block number five
is being mined now I can reread the
value of the variable now it will return
me the latest value which is change
greet value so this demonstrates how to
use
a solidity contract how to compile it
deploy it on a locally running
blockchain Network you can connect
multiple nodes to this ganach client and
all the nodes should be running on the
same network ID should have the same
network ID but they can be running on a
different machine so here we can see all
the other details the block the
transactions which have happened if I
perform the action again block number
six has been generated has another
transaction associated with it and I can
get the latest value so why wait let's
embark on this exhilarating adventure
together but before we dive in if you're
looking to take your career to new
heights and become a true expert in the
realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency
consider checking out our professional
certificate program in blockchain in
collaboration with I Kut it's an
excellent opportunity to master key
architectural principles and develop the
skills needed to excel in this rapidly
growing field in this video we will
explore ethereum Mining and we'll go
through some of the fascinating Concepts
and components revolving around it first
we will have an introduction to
ethereum then we will understand what is
ethereum
mining then we will explore why should
we mine
ethereum we will look into the types of
ethereum
Mining and then we will understand how
the ethereum mining process
works then we will explore how exactly
to mine
ethereum then we will discuss will the
proof of State translation kill proof of
work and then finally we will find out
is Mining ethereum
Profitable so without doing Much Ado
let's get started with the video let's
bring you up to speed on
ethereum ethereum is defined as a block
machine based Computing platform that
enables its developers to build and
deploy decentralized application and Mak
sure all the transactions are
cryptographically secured in the
network ether is the cryptocurrency of
ethereum used to build decentralized
applications smart contracts and make
standard peer-to-peer
payments ether basically acts as fuel
for the ethereum network it tracks and
facilitates all the transactions
so that brings us to what is ethereum
mining in simple words ethereum mining
is a process of creating and adding a
Blog of transaction to the blockchain
network of ethereum it uses the proof of
work consensus mechanism for mining
ethereum all transactions taking place
in the ethereum network needs to get
approved by the
miners miners is a community of people
using a hashing strip eash to solve
computationally hard puzzles for
successfully mining the blocks of
transactions in the etherum blockchain
network which helps secure the network
from attacks like hacking or
manipulation of
identity now let's understand why we
need to mine
ethereum the primary goal for mining
ethereum is to make money ethereum
mining turns Act of securing the network
into a relatively complex but profitable
business also miners thece a certain
amount as a reward for mining each block
of the ethereum blockchain network
including the transaction fees paid by
the users thus ethereum mining benefits
each and everyone participating in
ethereum blockchain
network so what are the types of
ethereum mining ethereum mining can be
performed in three ways ethereum solo
mining ethereum pool Mining and ethereum
Cloud mining
in ethereum Solo mining you will get
rewarded only if you solve the puzzle
and M the ethereum block first since
here you are competing with many people
and companies you have to be very good
at your
work also solo mining is only profitable
when you have plenty of resources with
you like 100 plus graphics
card and in Solo mining having so much
equipment may use a lot of electricity
and space leading to high electricity
bills and and not everyone has a
considerable amount of area
needed aarum pool mining is the easiest
and fastest way to get started with
ethereum mining in this you work along
with other people together in a single
pool and if someone from the pool gets
the hash code correctly they share the
reward among everyone in the
pool we should consider a few important
factors before joining a pool like pool
size minimum payout and pool
fee pool size determines the number of
blocks you find in the ethereum network
and it shares rewards as the number of
miners increases the chances to get
rewards also
increase minimum payout is the minimum
amount of ethereum you need to mine
before it gets credited to your wallet
and pool fee is the amount you need to
pay to continue using the pool this
amount is percentage based on the amount
of ethereum you're mining
ethereum Cloud mining you pay someone
else with the equipment to mine ethereum
for you you pay some amount of money as
feace to them for investing their time
and resources and in return they provide
you with the reward they gain by the
mining
ethereum but this technique of mining
ethereum has some pros and cons to Pros
do not responsible for any equipment
damage you don't have to require all the
necessary equipment and look for space
to store it you can sit back observe
market and enjoy the reward for your
investment in eum
mining cons if the ethereum price drops
then there is no way you are getting
your money back the money you invested
or the fees paid to the minor is lost
and you can't ask the other person to
change the equipment according to your
concern etheral Cloud mining is
considered a safer way for mining
service providers to guarante a profit
for the resource they have
purchased now let's understand how the
ethereum mining process
works ethereum mining follows a specific
set of steps to function step one a user
requests a transaction with the help of
the private key of his digital Wallet
account then the request is shared
worldwide with the ethereum network
next the requested transaction is added
to a list of pending transactions that
needs to be added to the ethereum
blockchain
network step four the minor then
verifies and validates the requested
transaction and perform a complex
mathematical puzzle on the transaction
data step five once the request
transaction is verified and it stores a
copy of it in e the process of proof of
work Begins for the respective
blocks step six then the notes of the
etherum network verify at the checksum
of the state of the minor Block matches
the checksum of the updated state of evm
after execution of all
transactions step seven only after that
the block is added to the ethereum
blockchain
network step a on successfully mining
the block it rewards the minor with some
amount of ether in their wallet the
block reward of ethereum is three
ether and step nine the requested
transaction is approved and credited to
the respective wallet or wallet each
transaction is mined only once but every
participant of the ethereum network
verifies
it this makes me curious about how to
mine
ethereum tools you will need to be an
efficient Miner for ethereum on your
personal computer are an ethereum wallet
to store all your currency earns GPU
drivers or graphics card with a minimum
of 3 GB Ram a mining software suitable
according to your Hardware like
GP and a compatible operating system
Windows 7 or 10 with
64bit before getting started with mining
ethereum you need to create an ethereum
wallet to sore all your ether pres Model
T and Legend Nano are the most reliable
and secure wallets in the market of
cryptocurrency installing GPU drivers or
graphics card after creating your
digital wallet you need to update all
the
hardware that is drives in your system
you can use two types of graphics card
they are AMD graphics card and Nvidia
graphic
scard Claymore is considered the best
software for mining ethereum on GPU
drivers now we need to follow a few set
of steps to get started with
mining step one download the latest
version of Claymore dual Miner for your
operating system the latest version is
Claymore
11.0 step two click on the latest
version for Windows and download the zip
file step three extract the files of
Claymore 11.0 to a folder on the desktop
for easy
access open the folder to have a look at
the
files step five right click on start and
then on the edit
option step six edit the start. pxt file
and add these
lines step seven choose your desired
pool from these recommendations
s you can also find better searce
results than these according to your
region step eight type in your pool
address instead of mining pool
address step nine save your start. pxt
file within new updates remember while
saving select type as all
files and step 10 once you save click on
the clay. B file to begin mining is head
now let's explore will the proof of
State transition SK proof of
work the newly introduced concept of eum
2.0 road map plans to upgrade to proof
of State consensus algorithm in which it
will provide all existing miners of
ethereum network with a limited time to
earn a return for the
investment this expected to be launched
by the end of 2021 or the starting or 20
22 it was supposed to be launched by
October 2020 but the history of delays
regarding this upgrade is worth talking
about nobody truly knows when ethereum
2.0 will be completed and introduced to
the crypto mining
world now when we know all about
ethereum mining this makes me wonder if
ethereum mining is
profitable the profit of any crypto
mining majorly depends on the cost of
electricity in that particular area as a
rule anything below
$0.12 per kilowatt consumes in an hour
is considered profitable you can mine
ether and turn it into a vital source of
income by analyzing these figures like
hash rate of ethereum block reward
number of blocks per day and the coin
price of
ethereum you can also use an aing
calculator to figure out your daily
revenue basing it on these factors or
you can use this formula
too the predictions are made that the
ethereum price can rise and become more
stable in the coming few years so it is
an excellent opportunity to invest in
and Save in ethereum in this video I
will take you through various important
Concepts and components of ethereum
classic first we will look into the
origin of ethereum classic
then we will understand what is ethereum
classic followed by why is ethereum
classic used what are the goals of
ethereum classic and after that we will
see the difference between ethereum
classic and ethereum after that we will
look at some of the limitations of the
etherium classic and at the end we will
explore what is the future of etherium
classic so without any further Ado let's
get started with the video so let's
start with the origin of etherum
classic SLO doit a German business
created the Dao a decentralized
autonomous organization or da initiated
on ethereum in
2016 while the project earned over $50
million through crowdfunding hackers
took advantage of a flaw in its smart
contract and stole $50
million most ethereum users including
creators with Alec butterin and Gavin W
favored a heart fork or a major
modification in the blockchain's
underlying protocol to recover the
assets resulting in the formation of the
new etherium
chain however certain members of the
community opposed to the fork preferring
to follow the principle of code is Law
and remained on the old
chain reaming it ethereum classic they
commonly referred to ethereum Classic as
the original ethereum coin since it
preserves the ancient core of the
ethereum block chain as it existed
before the Dao assault that brings us to
the next concern which is to understand
what is ethereum
classic eum classic is a blockchain
based open source decentralized
distributed cryptocurrency platform that
runs smart contracts ethereum classic is
a decentralized governance platform that
leverages smart contracts embeded within
a distributed Ledger or blockchain
network it's splits the original
ethereum blockchain into two parts with
ethereum classic being the older of the
two and ethereum being the newer one now
let's proceed further and have a look at
the uses of eum
classic ethereum classic has three major
uses the ETC or etherium classic like
other cryptocurrencies is primarily used
to pay for decentralized computations on
the ethereum network Etc is used to pay
for executing transac actions and smart
contract functions on the ethereum
blockchain this is referred to as gas
and the fee associated with these
actions are known as gas
costs Etc is also a native token with a
monetary policy that creates a
predictable
disinflationary emission scheduled with
the fixed market supply
cap now let's move ahead and have a look
at the goals of ethereum
classing the ethereum classic project
has seen several modifications and
additions since the split the Project's
purpose is to develop a global payment
network based on Smart contracts that
can operate with no centralized
Authority ethereum classic like other
cryptocurrencies will most likely aspire
to be a digital store of value meaning
you can see and exchange it while
maintaining its worth a crypto's digital
store of value includes its purchasing
power which may be swiftly converted to
cash or used to purchase another asset
just like money if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit scaleup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know
more now that we know all the major
components of ethereum classic let's
type down and have a look at how
ethereum classic differs from
ethereum Etc or ethereum classic is a
speculative digital asset that investors
May trade but the eum token or eth is
the more genuine and extensively traded
of the
two with a market capitalization of $3.9
billion Etc has 116.3 million coins in
circulation while eth on the other hand
has a market capitalization of more than
$
34.9 billion and around 15 .6 million
coins in
circulation Etc trades at $ 33.656050
gr the scalability of ethereum classic
payment mechanism remains one of the
Project's largest concern in the
future furthermore security is likely to
be an issue with smart contracts
especially because ethereum classic has
already been hacked and millions of
dollars stolen so this brings us to the
very important question that is what
future eum classic holds for
itself because ethereum is considered
the more authentic of the two networks
ethereum class future appears to be less
bright than ethereum specially given
ethereum classic security concerns
ethereum classic may have difficulties
until it can modify its code and
software to prevent future
hacks well this was all about eim
classic in this video we will explore
etherium 2.0 and we'll go through some
of the fascinating Concepts and
components revolving around it first we
will have a quick introduction of what
is ethereum
Network then we will look into what
ethereum 2.0
is then we will understand what led to
the origin of ethereum
2.0 then we will understand the changes
in ethereum
2.0 then we will look into the current
status of ethereum 2.0
research and at last what future we
expect for etherium
2.0 so without doing Much Ado let's get
started with the video
so what is the ethereum
network ethereum is defined as a
blockchainbased Computing platform that
enables its developers to build and
deploy decentralized
application ether is the cryptocurrency
for ethereum used to build decentralized
application smart contracts and make
standard peer-to-peer payments it tracks
and facilitates all the transactions and
make sure they are cryptographically
secure in the network ether basically
add as a fuel for the etherium
network so what is etherium
2.0 etherium 2.0 is a set of
interrelated upgrades that will make the
ethereum network more secure scalable
and
sustainable multiple teams from across
the ethereum ecosystem have come
together to work on these upgrades in
ethereum
2.0 then what led to the origin of
ethereum 2.0
with growing popularity ether and the
ethereum network has gotten more blocked
by transactions currently it is capable
of handling 15 to 45 transactions per
second which is comparatively impressive
but it is not enough to handle all of
eum's users worldwide also the high
demand is affecting the driving up of
transaction
fees nodes power the ethereum blockchain
network but currently its nodes are
experiencing too much volume although
the programmers working on the upgrade
have claimed that making its notes
bigger wouldn't be
practical ethereum 2.0 intends to make
the network more scalable to handle all
of the activities on the ethereum
network that makes us wonder what are
the changes in ethereum
2.0 the two significant changes that
will come with the upgrade are adopting
proof of state and sharding
adopting proof of stake ethereum
blockchain implementations suffer from
performance issues because they rely on
a processing power intensive process
nuna's proof of work to record and
validate their
transactions the problem with proof of
Works design is that it's very
inefficient ethereum 2.0 will solve
these issues by transitioning its
blockchain to a more efficient proof of
stake system it will decrease in the
complexities faced by the network
leading to massive throughput gains for
the whole
network Shing is a process that intends
to enhance ethereum's efficiency and
ability to scale in the current version
of ethereum blockchain all data that is
added to the chain under goes
verification by all participating nodes
that means that the speed of its fluid
participant limits the processing speed
of the entire
network Shing will increase the
efficiency of the network resources by
breaking data verification tasked among
its set of nodes and each of them will
be responsible for validating and
verifying just the data allotted to them
this will increase the Network's overall
capacity and make it much faster and
efficient than its outdated
version so what is the current status of
ethereum 2.0
research while eum 2.0 has been in
research and development since 2014 it
has actually been making some progress
the beacon chain went live in December
2020 introducing the staging concept but
still there is no official claim for the
completion of this
transition the next phase is man it
merging the beacon chain into the
current ethereum Network mining ethereum
tokens will officially end in this phase
and staking will become the primary be
to create new tokens in the ethereum
network the last part of the transition
is expected to unfold in multiple phases
like adding the sharp chains to give the
ethereum blockchain network more
capacity and efficiency to handle all of
the demand and increase transactions per
second although it has been a long road
and there is still a good deal of
uncertainty around the timing the
ethereum developers do seem to be
motivated and on their way to completing
the whole transition so what is the
future of ethereum
2.0 if executed properly this transition
to ethereum 2.0 could be a total Game
Changer it will create a modified
Network that could potentially process
one lakh transactions per second and a
much more sustainable Network without
the energy intensive mining process and
it will introduce smart contracts
worldwide increasing the ethereum's
network utility furthermore ethereum
co-founder with Al Vin once said that
the issuance of new token should be
highly reduced under ethereum 2.0 which
could increase its
demand given all these factors ethereum
2.0 seems to hold a bright future for
ethereum blockchain Network let's
proceed further and have a look at how
they both differ from each other did you
know there are more than 1600
cryptocurrencies worldwide and among
them Bitcoin and ethereum have always
been the top two most popular
cryptocurrencies in the world by market
cap also recently ethereum as well as
Bitcoin reached its all-time peak in
worldwide trading according to D.G every
day new companies like Meo and Papal are
coming forward to invest in Bitcoin and
ethereum on March 7 2021 meu confirmed
that it had purchased 40 million in
Bitcoin and ethereum on the other hand
papal is about to launch a scheme with
the public can purchase and sell
cryptocurrencies initially featuring
Bitcoin and ethereum bya people digital
wallet but have you all ever wondered
how they compared based on their
similarities and differences in various
aspects well before moving any further
let's have a quick look at how Bitcoin
and ethereum originated and made a
benchmark in the economic system
worldwide Bitcoin was first introduced
in 20 9 by Satoshi Nakamoto to resolve
cyber attacks double spending and
eliminate the middleman between the
transaction it led the first revolution
of digital money which enables
transparent and decentralized
peer-to-peer
transaction on the other hand ethereum
came into the picture years after
Bitcoin it was first introduced in the
late 2013 by with alic butan after that
it was very quickly and widely adopted
because it offered a platform to build
and run applications without any
downtime fraud or interference of any
third party etherum serves as a
Computing platform that enables its
developers to build and deploy their
decentralized application now let's move
ahead and see the difference between
them which make them compete with each
other in this economy this video will
cover individual aspects for comparing
ethereum and bitcoin's performance in
that particular field first we will look
into the introduction of ethereum and
Bitcoin
then the algorithm they
follow the programming
language mining process of ethereum and
Bitcoin monetary
policy
transaction and availability of these
two
cryptocurrencies by time Bitcoin has
proved itself as a well-known
cryptocurrency however ethereum with
different functionalities is giving a
quite tough competition to bitcoin but
before moving ahead let's have an
introduction to ethereum and Bitcoin
ethereum is a platform that builds
immutable smart contracts and
application for its users without any
centralized interference for Bitcoin it
is an alternative to Fiat money or
physical currency the main function of
ethereum is to provide its users or
developers with a platform to build
smart contracts using daps or
decentralized application on the other
side Bitcoin only intends to be a medium
of exchange of money and value stored in
its blockchain Network now let's get
started and move towards the first
comparison which is algorithm ethereum
uses the E cryptographic algorithm for
mining blocks in the ethereum network on
the other hand Bitcoin uses the sh 256
hashing algorithm for mining blocks in
the Bitcoin
Network eash algorithm is mainly used
during the proof of work function proof
of work is a small piece of data that is
difficult to generate but easy to
validate and satisfy certain Network
requirements sh 256 algorithm helps
Bitcoin users to protect all their
sensitive data like private Keys moving
on the programming language of ethereum
and Bitcoin ethereum uses solidity
solidity is a highlevel programming
language used by ethereum for
implementing smart contracts but in
terms of programming language Bitcoin
keeps it simple Bitcoin uses C++ as its
programming language it is a stack based
programming language used to give
Bitcoin software instructions on how to
make
transactions as we have covered the
algorithm and programming language of
both cryptocurrencies now let's take a
look at the mining process of both
mining is a process in which transaction
made are validated and added to
blockchain public Ledger in blocks and
the people mining these blocks are
called miners AUM miners mind the
unvalidated transaction using the proof
of work method but it aims to switch to
proof of stake because it will make its
Network more immune to centralization
energy efficient and stronger support
for its shared chain on the other hand
similar to ethereum bitcoin miners also
use the proof of work method to mine
unvalidated transactions these method is
enough to function in Bitcoin Network
worldwide now let's proceed towards the
monetary policy of both cryptocurrencies
but let's first understand what monetary
policy is monetary policy is known as
the process of drafting announcing and
implementing the plan of actions taken
by the competent monetary authority to
control the money supply and Achieve
goals that promote sustainable economic
growth so eum's policy is defined by the
reward paid out by its protocol
ethereum's monetary policies are best
described as minimum issuance to secure
the network therefore there is a
constant trade-off between the
transaction speed and security but
bitcoin's monetary policy comprises of
two parts Haring and block frequency
Haring event is when the reward of
mining Bitcoin is cut in half and it
also cuts the inflation rate and the
block reward is the number of Bitcoins
you get if you successfully mine a
blockchain block the current block
reward for ethereum is two ether per
block and for Bitcoin the block reward
is 12.5 Bitcoins per block also every 14
seconds a block of ethereum is generated
and one block of Bitcoin take 10 minutes
to generate monetary policies are
considered to be fixed and
non-inflationary due to this over time
mining blocks will become more difficult
next is
transactions ethereum is a little bit
faster than Bitcoin with 30 transactions
per second and it takes just a few
minutes to confirm it on the other side
bitcoin's transaction speed is five
transactions per second second and it
can take up to 60 minutes or more to
confirm either the currency of ethereum
acts as the fuel for ethereum networks
and Bitcoin is only used as the value
for real world transaction to compete
with already present electronic cash
like credit cards and Google pay
ethereum and Bitcoin require higher
productivity to attain widespread
adoption now talking about the
availability of both
cryptocurrencies ethereum is not limited
but it can occasionally reduced due to
large Network upgrades however Bitcoin
is limited to 21 million coins and as of
today 18 million Bitcoin is already used
but in the end both Bitcoin and ethereum
being the top cryptocurrencies share a
few similarities like both are
decentralized and can be used to have a
peer-to-peer transaction proof of work
also both have a large network of
independent nodes choose from over 300
in demand skills and get access to to
1,000 plus hours of video content for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more now let's have a demo now let's
have a look at the media outlet website
coindesk where we will see all stats
related to bitcoin and ethereum in
detail coindesk is a site specialized in
digital currencies it is used to explore
the news and price data related to
cryptocurrencies and also explains how
cryptocurrencies contribute to the
evolution of fin Financial system
worldwide now see this graph this graph
shows the change in bitcoin price in 24
hours duration this graph shows the
gradual change in the price of Bitcoin
it started from

graph shows the current status of
cryptocurrency in USD dollars we can
also see its value according to any
centralized currency like Euro or INR
this this graph shows the constant
trading change in the value of
cryptocurrencies every moment we can
also access the data of trading from an
hour to its lifetime so let me tell you
that Dogecoin is an altcoin and an
almost sarcastic meme coin that serves
as a peer-to-peer open- Source
cryptocurrency well that's not enough so
let's dive down and understand the
concept of Dogecoin more precisely hey
everyone I'm sham Le and I welcome you
all to this new video of simp learn on
what is
Dogecoin but before starting let's have
a look at why is it in the news since
the beginning of the year 2021 Dogecoin
has surged more than 950 from less than
half a penny to more than 5 cents per
Dogecoin then Elon Musk CEO of Tesla
incorporation took his interest in it
and tweeted too much concentration is
the only real issue for cryptocurrency
making the owner of the Dogecoin wallet
a subject of attention later on other
CBS like Snoop Dog also started taking
an interest in Dogecoin and started
tweeting and promoting it on social
platforms which made Dogecoin climb to a
peak of 8.2 us cents and market
capitalization of10 billion in this
video we will come across the following
topics first we will see the origin of
Dogecoin and then we will understand
what is Dogecoin how does it exactly
works and then we will see what led to
the growth of
Dogecoin what what are the areas of uses
of
Dogecoin then we will figure out what is
the current value of Dogecoin today and
lastly how can we buy it let's start
with the origin of
Dogecoin Dogecoin was invented by two
software Engineers IBM engineer Billy
Marcus and Adobe engineer Jackson farmer
did you know that they never even met
before combining the two most
significant phenomena of the Year 2013
Bitcoin and Doge well now let's move
ahead and see what is Dogecoin Dogecoin
is a peer-to-peer open-source
cryptocurrency that provides its user a
completely unknown decentralized and
secure environment free from any third
party interference to make their
transaction Dogecoin was intended to be
an altcoin and a mecoin inspired by shba
inu's popular meme AKA Doge moving ahead
let's have a look at how it works to
understand the workflow let's take the
example of two friends Mark and
Susan Mark owes some money to Susan and
now he needs to return it so he thinks
of an idea and decides to send her
Dogecoin instead of giving her physical
money they both open their digital
Wallet account to pay her he needs two
essential pieces of information first
his private key and second her public
key to get access to Susan's private key
he needs to scan a QR code from his
smartphone
then the application alerts all the
Dogecoin miners around the world to
proceed further with the process the
Dogecoin miners validate whether Mark
has enough Dogecoin to make the payment
or not and after the validation process
they approve the transaction request
Dogecoin miners race with each other to
collect all the data of the pending
transaction known as the nons the miners
then apply a mathematical function to
produce the correct hash number for the
particular nons of the p transaction the
minor who successfully produces the
correct hash number is rewarded with 25
Dogecoin in his account after that Mark
and Susan gets a confirmation message
that the request for the transaction has
been approved and within 10 minutes the
requested amount of Dogecoin is credited
into the wallet of Susan thus the
transaction is completed so what led to
the growth of Dogecoin Dogecoin
officially Came live in 2013 and became
an instant hit within the community of
people who just wanted to play around
the cryptocurrency
freely as I said earlier Dogecoin was
intended to be a joke for Content
creators but they were very well
received it users of Internet forums
like Reddit and Twitter adopted Dogecoin
and started tipping their content
creators this usage of Dogecoin made it
surpass the trading value of the other
cryptocurrencies specifically Bitcoin in
2014 it also started doing charity work
to introduce and promote themselves in
the real world for example once they
raise a fund of
$55,000 for a NASCAR driver Josh Wise
and in return he printed the logo and 98
Dogecoin over this race car eventually
it almost became the mascot for what
crypto should be let's have a look at
who uses
Dogecoin today many companies and firms
like restaurants grossers web hosting
products retailer ebook Sellers and
travel Services uses Dogecoin for
transaction these are a few example of
companies in every sector that uses
Dogecoin grossers hello pets gamer
heat.com for web hosting gamer for
products retailer meltdown and noex
ebook seller canel and travel services
like Belo doit this this makes me
curious about the current value of
Dogecoin let's have a look at that too
according to the market cap today the
current value of Dogecoin is
0.059 357 USD with a trading volume of
$16 billion the circulating supply of
this cryptocurrency is 129 billion
Dogecoin and the max supply of Dogecoin
is not available how can we buy
Dogecoin so to buy Dogecoin we will have
to for follow a few steps Step One open
a digital wallet buy your coin is
considered a perfect application for
trading cryptocurrencies step two
register your account step three
complete your profile kyc by providing
your identity and address proof like
Adar card step four add your bank
account details step five secure your
account by creating a convenient trading
pin that is only accessible by
you and step
six there you go now you can start
trading that is all about Dogecoin did
you know that on 20th April 2020
Dogecoin searched its value to $1 making
this day named after itself as do day
the supporters of Dogecoin were trying
to amplify the value of it to make it
$1 but how is it done in reality how can
we affect the value and availability of
cryptocurrency well all this is done by
a process called Mining and this is what
affected tcoin resulting in the rise of
its value mining coins of the Dogecoin
network is called Dogecoin mining hey
everyone I'm shamle and I welcome you
all to this new video of Simply learn on
a very interesting topic of Dogecoin
mining we will cover all the concepts of
Dogecoin Mining and we will understand
how to M Dogecoin all by
yourself now let's move ahead and see
what's in this video video for you first
we will have an introduction to what is
Dogecoin then we will figure out the net
worth of Dogecoin
today we will understand what Dogecoin
mining
is then we will have a comparison of
mining process of Dogecoin with a few
other cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin then we will dive into how to M
Dogecoin in this segment first we will
see types of Dogecoin mining like pool
and
solo then we will see what exactly you
require to start Dogecoin mining What
hardware and software you need for
Dogecoin
Mining and then we will understand A New
Concept of Dogecoin mining which is
Dogecoin Cloud
Mining and in the end we will analyze
whether Dogecoin mining is profitable or
not so let's get started and have a
quick look at what is
Dogecoin Dogecoin is a peer-to-peer open
source cryptocurrency that works on
blockchain technology also it provides
its users a completely unknown
decentralized and secure environment
free from any third party interference
to make their
transactions Dogecoin uses cryptography
to secure all its
transactions this makes me curious to
know what is the net worth and
availability of Dogecoin
today according to market cap today the
current value of Dogecoin coin is
0.266 247 USD the circulating supply of
this cryptocurrency is 127 billion
Dogecoin so that brings us to what is
Dogecoin mining Dogecoin mining is a
process of validating the data blocks of
transactions by solving a complex
mathematical problem and adding them to
the Dogecoin
Network each confirmation of
transactions adds a new block to the
Dogecoin Network work miners perform
this process Dogecoin miners are a
community of people who perform complex
mathematical Solutions on the
transactions for mining Dogecoin that
makes me wonder what the difference
between Dogecoin Mining and other
cryptocurrencies mining
process let's have a comparison between
Dogecoin Mining and the Bitcoin mining
process we will be comparing these
crypto mining based on these factors
first algorithm it is a set of rules
that every cryptocurrency follows for
mining new coins in the algorithm
Dogecoin mining uses stript Bitcoin
mining uses
s256 script is considered a lot quicker
and cheaper than the s256 algorithm
making mining easier for miners of the
Dogecoin
Network second is difficulty this
represents the complexities and
challenges faced by miners to mine each
block of the blockchain of any
cryptocurrency in difficulty Dogecoin is
2,798
252 Bitcoin is 3 trillion 511 bli 60
million
55289 thus it proves that Dogecoin is
easier to mine among other
cryptocurrencies third is block time it
is the time taken by a new block of
transactions to be checked confirmed and
added to the blockchain block time of
Dogecoin is 1 minute for Bitcoin it is
10 minutes and at fourth and fifth we
have reward per block and per block USD
it is the amount in USD to the minor for
each block added to the
network block reward for Dogecoin is
10,000 dogecoins per block which in USD
is
27.36% it is 12.5 Bitcoin per block and
in USD it is
8639
1.63
Bitcoins moving on finally we have
reached the most crucial point of this
video now we will have a look at how to
mind
Dogecoin Dogecoin can be mined in two
ways the first one Dogecoin pool Mining
and the second is solo mining a Dogecoin
pool is a group of people who share the
compan computing power to mine Dogecoin
transaction data and get rewarded by
equal share after confirming the
transaction solo mining is when only one
person does all the work of Mining and
confirming
transactions the reward is awarded only
to that person after confirming the
transaction let's have a thorough
discussion of the difference between
Dogecoin pool Mining and solo
mining in Dogecoin pool mining you have
to mine as a part of it and pay fees in
Dogecoin solo mining you don't need to
pay any fees and you mine all by
yourself also in pool mining you will
only get a part of the reward earned by
the pool but but in Solo mining the
total reward earned will be received by
you only as in pool mining many people
work together so the Mind blocks more
often and on the other side solo mining
could take a lot of time before one mine
their first block
in pool mining it takes less time to
confirm a transaction as you work as a
part of the pool community on the other
hand in Solo mining it can take much
longer to confirm a transaction as you
do all the work and there is a lot of
competition so this was all about
Dogecoin pool Mining and solo mining
let's proceed further and see what we
need to start mining
Dogecoin but before we start mining we
will have to make sure that we have
these things with with us a PC with any
operating system like Windows Linux yubu
Etc a good internet
connection add a digital wallet to store
the dogecoins you mine which hardware
and software can we use for Dogecoin
mining you will need your PC CPU which
should be powerful enough to mine
Dogecoin a GPU or graphics card can also
be used for mining Dogecoin for example
sappire pulse radon rx580
Asus RX Vega 64 and many
more script Asic minor is programmed to
mine scrip based cryptocurrencies like
Dogecoin like bitmain andt Miner L3 BW
l21 strip Miner Etc if you new to
Dogecoin mining then using your PC CPU
will be the right choice and CPU Min is
the most appropriate software if you are
thinking of mining using GPU or graphics
card you can have a wide range of
software some of the best software is
Cuda minor which works perfectly with
Nvidia products CG minor which works
with most GPU hardware and easy minor is
considered suitable for beginners
stripped Asic miners are considered to
be very powerful hardware and multim
Miner is excellent with this Hardware
moving ahead let's understand what doco
coin Cloud mining
is Dogecoin Cloud mining is a mechanism
to mine Dogecoin using rented data
centers without installing any hardware
and related
softwares it allows people to take an
interest and participate in Dogecoin
mining at a very low cost making
Dogecoin mining accessible for a broader
range of people
worldwide since the Dogecoin mining
process uses the cloud it reduces
equipment maintenance or direct energy
cost
this whole concept of Dogecoin mining
brings me in front of one question is
Dogecoin Mining
Profitable Dogecoin mining profitability
can be analyzed based on power
consumptions hash rate and cost the
Dogecoin mining calculator is used to
make it simple in this calculator the
default value for the latest Dogecoin
mining hash rate and latest Dogecoin
difficulty Target is pre- loaded for
better results Dogecoin mining d is 44
44412 25 per year that is 14 million
Doge per year the block time for
Dogecoin is 1 minute which means the
supply of Dogecoin will never go down
after deducting mining power cost and
Mining fees the final daily Dogecoin
mining profit is
$22.53 Dogecoin to USD with a profit
margin of positive
81.7% % also I think Dogecoin mining is
fun so that is all about Dogecoin mining
but before moving any further let's see
what we have for you in this video first
we will have a quick introduction to
what is
Dogecoin followed by how to buy Dogecoin
then we will understand what a Dogecoin
wallet is and what are the types of
Dogecoin
wallet then we will look into how to
create a Dogecoin wallet and how to use
it
after that we will figure out why
Dogecoin is so
popular and finally we will go through
the top five Dogecoin wallets in
2021 so without wasting any time let's
get started what is Dogecoin Dogecoin is
a peer-to-peer open-source
cryptocurrency that works on a
blockchain technology also it provides
its users a completely unknown
decentralized and secure environment
free from any third party interference
to make their transactions Dogecoin uses
cryptography to secure all its
transactions now let's proceed further
and have a look at the process of how to
buy
Dogecoin you can buy Dogecoin by
following these Steps step one create a
Dogecoin wallet step two locate your
specific Dogecoin address which is a
long area of characters that starts from
capital D followed by any other Capital
character or any number
and step three find a source that sells
Dogecoin and VOA buy dogecoins so that
brings us to what is Dogecoin
wallet a Dogecoin wallet is something
where you can stop store receive or send
dogecoins technically it is very similar
to a real life wallet Dogecoin wallet
consists of its public and private key
connecting it to the distributed Ledger
over the Dogecoin Network you can use
your wallets publicly which also
functions as your coin address for your
bank account number for Dogecoin where
anyone can track the transactions made
by maintaining the anonymity of the
users the private key of your wallet is
used to approve transactions in The
Ledger your wallet's public key is used
to receive dogecoins from other users on
the other hand your wallet's private key
is only used to send dogecoins to other
users in the network so what are the
types of Dogecoin wallet Dogecoin wallet
is of two types digital Dogecoin wallet
and physical Dogecoin wallet digital
Dogecoin wallet is accessible through
the web and you can also download it
according to your handset or operating
system on the other hand physical
Dogecoin wallets are pretty expensive
and less accessible so moving on let's
see how to create a Dogecoin wallet to
create a Dogecoin wallet for yourself
you will have to go through the
following steps
step one choose the correct wallet
Dogecoin core wallet and multi- Doge
wallet have been created and are
maintained by the developers team of
Dogecoin here we will be using the
Dogecoin core wallet as
reference step two download and install
the Dogecoin wallet in your handset you
can also use the official website of
this wallet for your windows and step
three open the Dogecoin wallet
application and verify your Dogecoin
wallet address
and that is it it is this easy to create
and have your Dogecoin wallet now when
you have your Dogecoin wallet in your
hand let's see how you can use it on the
very bottom of the homepage of your
wallet there are two options request
coins where you can request dogecoins
from other users in the Dogecoin Network
and send coins where you can send
dogecoins to other users in the Dogecoin
Network to receive coins first click on
the request coins button second enter
the required number of coins you want to
request and third have the bow generated
barcode scanned by user you wish to
request
amount now to send coins first type the
Dogecoin wallet address to whom you want
to send
dogecoins enter the required amount you
wish to send to that user and third
click on send and there you go now you
can use your Dogecoin wallet whenever
and wherever you you want this makes me
wonder why is Dogecoin so popular
despite being in tough competition with
other strong cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin Dogecoin has never missed an
opportunity to be in the Limelight
Dogecoin popularity is mainly attributed
to its vast and dedicated Community
other than that social platforms like
Reddit and Twitter also promot a
Dogecoin to a great extent due to its
fun factor and the whole joke story
behind it cele ities like Snoop Dog
Kevin Jonas Elon Musk also started
taking an interest in Doge point and
posting pictures and comments on their
social media handles which increased The
Craze of Dogecoin all around the world
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit scaleup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more so this was all about Dogecoin
wallet now let's have a look at the top
five Dogecoin wallets of 2021 these are
the top five Dogecoin wallets of
2021 Ledger Nano X treza model T Kip key
bance and
Kraken Kraken is primarily a
cryptocurrency exchange platform but can
perfectly act as a Dogecoin wallet all
you need to do is to register and then
buy some
dogecoins it is a very secure and
reliable cryptocurrency exchange
platform it charges a very low fees for
every transaction taking place on it and
it accepts a pretty decent amount of fat
money but before starting with the
comparison let's look at what we have
for you in this video first we will have
a chis introduction of Dogecoin Bitcoin
and
ethereum then we will look into the
comparison of Dogecoin Bitcoin and
ethereum and at last we will look into a
few similarities between these
cryptocurrencies so let's get
started Dogecoin was intended to be an
altcoin and a meme coin inspired by shba
inu's popular meme AKA Doge but it was
very well received by everyone in the
crypto world and today it is the fourth
top
cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a
peer-to-peer open-source cryptocurrency
that provides its users with a
completely unknown decentralized and
secure environment to make their
transactions Bitcoin led the first
revolution of digital money in 2013
Bitcoin enables transparent and
decentralized peer-to-peer
transaction Bitcoin is designed to be an
alternative to National currencies and
intends only to be a medium of exchange
and value storage it comprises of
features like a public Ledger
immutability and high transparency
making it a great
platform ethereum came into the picture
years after Bitcoin ethereum offered a
platform to build and run applications
without any downtime fraud or
interference of any third party ethereum
serves as a Computing platform that
enables its developers to build and
deploy their decentralized applications
using smart contracts through its
currency ether or
eth the primary function of ether is to
help developers build smart contracts
using daps or decentralized
application now let's move on the
comparison between Dogecoin Bitcoin and
ethereum we will be comparing them based
on few major parameters like
algorithm programming language mining
process monetary
policies
transactions today's
value and
availability so let's move ahead and
start with the very first comparison the
algorithm do Dogecoin uses strip
cryptography for mining the blocks of
the Dogecoin Network in comparison
Bitcoin uses the sha256 hashing
algorithm for mining its blocks in the
blockchain
network ethereum on the other hand uses
the eash algorithm for mining its
transactions strip Language is a
password based key derivation function
that is mainly used to avoid customized
Hardware attacks by raising the resource
demands of the AL
algorithm sh 256 algorithm helps Bitcoin
users protect all their sensitive data
like private keys or transaction details
and help maintain the anonymity of the
user for a much secure performance of
transactions e algorithm is mainly used
during the proof of work function proof
of work is a small piece of data that is
difficult to generate but easy to
validate and satisfy specific Network
requirements
moving on the following
comparison programming
language Dogecoin is considered to be an
altcoin for Bitcoin both Dogecoin and
Bitcoin use the same programming
language C++ it is a stack based
programming language used to give
Bitcoin and Dogecoin software
instructions on how to make
transactions on the other side ethereum
uses solidity which is a highlevel
programming language used by ethereum
for implementing smart
contracts now that we have covered
programming language and the algorithm
of these cryptocurrency let's get to the
following very important parameter which
is mining
process but before getting started with
the comparison first let's understand
what mining is mining is a process in
which transactions are validated and
added to the blockchain public Ledger in
blocks and the people mining these
blocks are called miners in terms of the
mining process also Dogecoin and Bitcoin
use the same method to verify and
validate the pending transaction in the
networks and that is proof of work
although ethereum miners also mine the
unvalidated transactions using the proof
of work method it aims to switch to
proof of stake because it will make its
Network more immune to centralization
energy efficient and more vital support
for shared
chains now we have come to the following
person which is monetary
policy monetary policy is known as the
process of drafting announcing and
implementing the plan of actions taken
by the competent monetary authority to
control the money supply and Achieve
goals that promote sustainable economic
growth dogecoins policy is defined by
its block reward paid to its miners
whereas bitcoin's policy is defined by
two processes having and block reward
having event is when reward of mining
Bitcoin is cut in half and it also cuts
the inflation rate and the block reward
is the number of Bitcoins you get if you
successfully mine a blockchain
block an ethereum's policy is defined as
minimum issuance to secure the network
that is there is a constant trade-off
between the transaction speed and
security dogecoins block reward is
10,000 for mining one block bitcoin's
block reward is 12.5 for mining each
block and which is set to get reduced to
6.25 by
2024 and ethereum's block reward is two
ether per
block Dogecoin takes 1 minute to
generate one block Bitcoin takes 10
minutes to generate one
block and ethereum generates one block
every 14 seconds
seconds well monetary policies are
considered to be fixed and
non-inflationary due to this over time
mining blocks will become more
complex now moving on to the following
comparison which is
transactions Dogecoin is the fastest and
can complete 70 transaction in 1 second
and takes just 2 to 3 minutes to confirm
a
transaction Bitcoin can complete up to
five transaction in 1 second and takes
10 minutes or more than that to confirm
one
transaction and ethereum can complete 30
transactions per second and it takes
just a few minutes to confirm
it Dogecoin is majorly used for tipping
content creators on social platforms
like Reddit and
Twitter Bitcoin is only used as a
superior alternative for Fiat money and
is used primarily for real world
transactions on the other hand ether the
currency of ethereum acts as the fuel
for ethereum
networks now that we have covered all
about transaction process of these
cryptocurrency let's have a look at the
value of Dogecoin Bitcoin and ethereum
in today's
date the value of Dogecoin on today's
date is
02992 Bitcoin being the highest is
34857
58 and ethereum holds a value of
23565 now we have reached the last
comparison of Dogecoin Bitcoin and
etherium which is
availability the circulating supply of
Dogecoin is 1.7
billion Bitcoin very low as compared to
Dogecoin is just 21 million in
circulation
ethereum on the other hand is said to be
unlimited but till today the circulation
supply of ethereum is 115.6
million till today 113 billion Dogecoin
has already been mined for Bitcoin 18
million Bitcoins are already mined and
for ethereum roughly 36 million ethereum
has already been
minded in this graph you can see the the
red box on the right side of the graph
shows the maximum supply of Dogecoin on
the extreme left you can see first the
options that you can use according to
your requirements like if you want to
know about Dogecoin you can go for the
first option that is www. dogecoin.com
which will lead you to the official
website of Dogecoin if you want to chat
with the executives of coin Market
regarding Dogecoin then you can go for
the fourth option which is
chat before that is an address for bance
address through which you can keep a
track of dogecoins value on that
platform and you can also change it
according to your choice by clicking on
more right beside the more option you
can see the market cap value of Dogecoin
which is 38 Bill
3849
M4
69,90 it is the total value of Dogecoin
in circulation
beside the market cap option you can see
fully diluted market capitalization
which is 38 b700
m795 6 it is the capitalization when Max
supply of Dogecoin was in circulation
and on the right side just before total
Supply you can see the volume of
Dogecoin
1,779
m41 17,641
it is the value of Dogecoin traded in 24
hours next is Bitcoin similar to
Dogecoin you can see the red box on the
right side of the graph shows the
maximum supply of
Dogecoin on the extreme left you can see
first the options that you can use
according to your requirement like if
you want to know more about Bitcoin you
can go for the first option that is www.
bitcoin.org which will lead you to the
official website of
Bitcoin right beside the more option you
can see the market cap value of Bitcoin
which is 651
b73 mil
10,753 it is the total value of Bitcoin
in
circulation beside the market cap option
you can see fully diluted market
capitalization that is 732 Bill 387
m262 69
and on the right side just before the
total Supply you can see the volume of
Bitcoin that is 30 billion
249
m939
865 ethereum is no different from
Dogecoin and Bitcoin in this also you
can see the total supply of
ethereum also you can visit the official
website of www. ethereum.org to explore
more about ethereum you can have a look
at the market cap value of ethereum
which is 273
b755 M5
8653475111 m779
346 but in the end all these top
cryptocurrencies Dogecoin Bitcoin and
ethereum share a few
similarities like they all are
decentralized all three cryptocurrencies
are free from any third party
interference or any centralized
Authority and can be used to have secure
and independent peer-to-peer transaction
maintaining the anonymity of the
user and proof of work that is all their
transactions are verified and validated
before processing after complete
verification further transaction process
takes place also all of them have a
large network of independent nodes so
while wait let's embark on this
exhilarating adventure together but
before we dive in if you're looking to
take your career to new heights and
become a true expert in the realm of
blockchain and cryptocurrency consider

digital signature which defines the
ownership of your assets and that can be
bought and sold for real money
cryptocurrency or any other asset like a
non-fungible token AKA nft non-fungible
tokens mean means that they are not
interchangeable and each of them
represents unique assets owned by a
specific person on the other hand
fungible tokens are interchangeable and
can be divided into smaller units to
form the same value for example a $100
bill is fungible as you can exchange it
with $5 $20 bills or $250 bills but the
painting of The Last Supper is
non-fungible as it cannot be generated
in bulk even if it is copied it will not
be authentic each nft contains
distinguish information like who owns
the digital asset and who sold it making
them distinct and easily verifiable as
it is impossible to for such a
certificate it will secure her
painting's originality after learning
what nft is Susan was curious to know
how exactly nft Works nft basically
creates a blockchainbased digital
certificate for your digital
Collectibles including Games music art
and many more this certificate gives
your artwork A Unique identity the
underlying technology and the
programming language used by nfts are
the same as other cryptocurrencies such
as blockchain and the programming
language eash or script nft majorly
exists on ethereum blockchain a
distributed public Ledger that records
all the
transactions however nft is quite
different from these cryptocurrencies
Bitcoin and ethereum are fungible tokens
which means if you trade Bitcoin or
ethereum for one another you will have
the same value or item in return
basically money on the other hand nft is
a unique token therefore if you try to
trade it you may end up with something
completely different in your hands Crypt
punks is a remarkable example of nft it
enables you to buy sell and store 10,000
Collectibles with the proof of ownership
being stored on the ethereum blockchain
after exploring how nfts work Susan was
convinced and bought nfts for all her
paintings due to this her artworks were
secured from any kind of forgery and
also gave her artworks a particular
value this contributed to increased
sales too as everyone was easily able to
buy the artwork without any fear all in
all her exhibition was a complete
success similarly nft has proved itself
to be a boon in the lives of many others
like Jack dorsy the CEO and co-founder
of Twitter with his very first and
famous tweet just setting up my Twitter
and VES saris famously known as medova
who bought $ 69.3 Million worth of nft
art on be
owing to its increasing popularity
people are now willing to pay hundreds
of thousands of dollars for nfts nft has
enhanced media exposure and special
perks for aspiring artists like Susan on
social media this popularity of nft
creates new opportunities for new art
platforms motivating people to buy art
from internet platforms and promoting
copyright or originality of digital
assets meet Frank and Daniel one day
they decide to go for a trip to Venice
they made a budget list for all their
expenses like residence flight Etc they
thought of making their bookings online
from a site that offered discounts to
the first 10 visitors on that day while
making their respective flight bookings
Daniel's transaction fa and he missed
the offer going on on the other hand
Frank paid his share very quickly and
easily and became one of the three Lucky
Draw winners Daniel was surprised and
asked Frank how he could make the
transaction when Daniel himself could
not to which his response was was it's
simple I used Bitcoin a type of
cryptocurrency Daniel was confused and
he asked what cryptocurrency is and
since when has it been in use Frank
stepped up and explained to him
cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital
currency that works on blockchain
technology and is designed to work as a
medium of exchange online to buy goods
and services and make payments which was
introduced to the world first in 2013 By
Satoshi Nakamoto Daniel felt that it
sounds similar to other online payment
options he asked what makes it so
different Frank explained cryptocurrency
is decentralized and free from any third
party interference which means it is not
issued and controlled by any government
or Central Authority unlike other
payment systems that Banks or
governments are handling and that's why
a cryptocurrency transaction never fails
there could be many reasons for why
Daniels transaction failed like he may
have exceeded his transfer limit or his
account must have been hacked or there
could have been some technical issue
with his bank server or maybe due to
high transaction fees imposed by the
bank but on the other hand
cryptocurrency charges almost no or very
low transaction cost there is no limit
for making transactions in fact you have
24/7 access to your money there is no
extra delay or extra charges on making
international transactions and the best
part is that anybody can use
cryptocurrency without the hassles of
paperwork all you need to do is create
create an account on any digital wallet
of cryptocurrency this is what makes
cryptocurrency different from other
online payment options Daniel was
impressed by cryptocurrency but he
wondered how it works without the
control of an external Authority upon
research he found out that
cryptocurrency works on blockchain
technology blockchain is a set of blocks
that record information of transactions
like who made the transaction to whom
the amount of trade in the form of a
digital Ledger that is distributed
across the entire network meaning the
data is replicated and stored on each
node across the entire blockchain
network making it more secure and
impossible to change hack or cheat the
system then it is verified and validated
by every node to proceed with the
process of making the transactions the
crypto in cryptocurrency stands for
cryptography which is a method of using
encryption and decryption to secure the
data in the presence of any third party
with ulterior motives now Daniel was
completely aware of the whole technology
ology and concept behind cryptocurrency
and was influenced by Frank to adopt
cryptocurrency in his daily lifestyle
too he did that by booking his ticket
but sadly no discount like Daniel
cryptocurrency has influenced and
impacted an enormous number of people
worldwide due to this increasing
popularity new companies like matu and
PayPal are coming forward and investing
in crypto currency Every Day in 2018
Malta an Island located in the
Mediterranean Sea south of of Italy was
titled blockchain Island as it led to
the economic stability of the nation
many fintech companies like binance and
okx have already begun to take advantage
of malta's financial incentives and have
moved their headquarters to the
blockchain island cryptocurrency is
revolutionizing finance and banking
around the world thanks to
cryptocurrency now anyone with an
internet connection can trade spend and
borrow money around the world and nobody
can stop them people like Bill Gates
co-founder of Microsoft Corporation and
Elon Musk CEO of Tesla support
cryptocurrency as it is much better and
secure than physical money and also
holds a great future for the world's
economy and on the other hand some
people think of cryptocurrency as a bane
to the world's economy like Warren
Buffett CEO of birkshire hathway and a
banga CEO of global MasterCard feel the
cryptocurrency is a platform of criminal
activities and will destroy the world's
economy well one thing is clear that
this conflict is going to stay put for a
little longer meet Susan an aspiring
painter she wishes to conduct an online
painting exhibition for all her digital
artworks however as the exhibition is
online she is worried that her paintings
won't be secure as anyone could easily
Forge or replicate them her friend Mark
came to her rescue with an idea of nft
he suggested that Susan could buy nfts
for all her paintings as nfts are
trustworthy easily transferable and will
also maintain her ownership rights on
her artworks Susan had no idea what nfts
were so Mark stepped ahead and explained
it to her nfts turn your digital assets
into one of a kind by creating a unique
digital signature which defines the
ownership of your assets and that can be
bought and sold for real money
cryptocurrency or any other asset like a
non-fungible token AKA nft non-fungible
tokens means that they are not
interchangeable and each of them
represents unique assets owned by a
specific person on the other hand
fungible tokens are interchangeable and
can be divided into smaller units to
form the same value for example a $100

like Jack dorsy the CEO and co-founder
of Twitter with his very first and
famous tweet just setting up my Twitter
and VES saris famously known as medov
who bought $ 69.3 Million worth of an F
art on be owing to its increasing
popularity people are now willing to pay
high hundreds of thousands of dollars
for
nfts nft has enhanced media exposure and
special perks for aspiring artists like
Susan on social media this popularity of
nft creates new opportunities for new
art platforms motivating people to buy
art from internet platforms and
promoting copyright or originality of
digital assets many experts in the
crypto industry say that around 40% of
new crypto users will use nfts as their
entry point as a result of its growing
popularity n F could represent a more
significant part of the digital economy
in the
future in this video we will explore
about sha Ino coin and we'll go through
some of really exciting Concepts and
components revolving around it first we
will look into the origin of shibo coins
then we will understand what is shibo
coins then we will explore how it is
different and unique from
Dogecoin then we will figure out why is
it so
popular and at last we will explore what
future Shea Ino coin holds for
itself so without wasting more time
let's get started with the video so how
did the shiba inuk coin
originate the Sha inuk coin was created
in August 2020 by an anonymous person
calling themselves roshi an
Indian it was intended as an ALT coin of
Dogecoin which itself was created as an
altcoin of Bitcoin and this mem coin has
been named after the Japanese dog breed
Shiva
enu it feels like the Shibu coin was wit
into existence and is now insanely
popular among major crypto exchanges
through the power of its following crowd
memes and a very cute dog now we know
how it originated so let's have a look
at what is shibba inuk coin shibba inuk
coin is a decentralized community
building crytocurrency or we can say an
experiment developed within the shibba
Eno ecosystem and built on top of the
etherium blockchain network like many
other
coins it is a meme coin launched as a
rival of Dogecoin or Doge killer both
Dogecoin and sheep coin were made in a
humorous manner but sheep coin has
already taken over some Dogecoin markets
attracting a lot of attention and Rising
as a popular choice among investors
especially after such market crash of
cryptos like Bitcoin and
ethereum but what is the difference
between shib Inu coin and
Dogecoin although both shib Inu coin and
Dogecoin are meme coins and share the
same tree of origin both of them differ
a lot from each other at the same time
and the very first difference between
them is the Sheep coin is a token and
Dogecoin is a currency
let's have a look at more of those major
differences like
this first is development shivu coins or
sheep coins are built on and powered by
the ethereum network while Dogecoin has
been developed using the same technology
as
Bitcoin then is use cases sheep coin is
still working upon price more due to its
high popularity than utility but on the
other hand Dogecoin has already
established itself to some extent as a
medium of online
payments then is value according to coin
market cap the current value of sheep
coin is
0.0000
7378 and that of Dogecoin is
0.261
711 and at last availability the
availability of sheep cointal today is
394 million and for Dogecoin it is 130
billion now this definitely raises a
question in my mind why is Shibu coin so
popular Shibu coin is majorly popular
because of two
reasons Tesla founder Elon Musk has
tweeted recently expressing that he
would like to own a Sheba P that hyped
the crypto market and Prices rose by
300%
on the other hand its prices fell by
around 40% after the founder of ethereum
blockchain network metalic butan donated
50 trillion sheu coins to Indian
government for Co Relief Fund of an
Indian crypto entrepreneur sandep
Nal so now that we know about shibo coin
and its Concepts let's have a look at
what is the future of Shibu
coins though Sheba coin is only known as
a meme coin its increasing popularity
and people's interest in participating
in it is pointing towards a different
but bright
future according to investing cube.com
the Sheba coin is predicted to rise
again although there isn't much movement
among this token and its value active
buyers could help its value rise the
value could rise to 0.00
00104 in a more active buyer
Market although it may not appear to be
a significant amount due to its
popularity in future it can have a
significant influence over large
investors of the crypto
Market some are very interesting and
important aspects of salana
crypto first we will understand what is
salana then we will look into what is a
sold token or S
token then we will explore when and how
did it
originated after which we will look into
some of the features of
salana then we will explore what type of
consensus method does Solana
use after which we will understand how
Solana
works then we will explore the current
price and volume of salana in today's
date after that we will look into the
future of salana holds for
itself and at last we will look into
real life uses of
salana so without doing Much Ado let's
start the video Let's explore what is
salana salana is a cryptocurrency that
is used to pay for transactions or a
decentralized Computing Network
Solana attempts to increase blockchain
scalability by combining proof of stake
and proof of History consensus as a
result Solana promises to be capable of
processing 50,000 transactions per
second while maintaining
decentralization now the question arises
what is the SL token or Soul
token Solana's ecosystem uses the SL
token as a native currency as a result
the token can be transferred between
nodes in the salana cluster in exchange
for running onchain programs or
certifying the
results it can also be used to make
micro payments known as
Lamport now when we are talking so much
about Solana crypto let's also dive down
and explore how and when exactly it came
into
existence anatol Yakov en o established
the salana platform in
2017 before launching salana yakovenko
worked at qualcom after working as a
software engineer at Dropbox he has a
wide spectrum of knowledge with
compression
methods he developed a new method of
dealing with typical throughput
difficulties in the Bitcoin and ethereum
blockchain with the help of Eric
Williams and Solana's CTO Greg Fitz
gal they intended to develop a trust
list distributed protocol with increased
scalability the team now has experience
from leading companies around the world
including Apple Google Microsoft Intel
Twitter Dropbox and
others now that we know what Solana is
and all about its background let me ask
you a question recently salana joined
hands with two foundations to raise a
fund of $5 million to encourage the next
waver creators and fans onto crypto
networks so comment down your answers in
the comment section below to know the
correct answer to this question watch
this video till the
end moving on let's talk about its
features which makes it unique and
popular scalable Solana uses proof of
history and a number of other
groundbreaking features to allow the
network to scale at the rate of More's
LW low cost for applications with
billions of users Solana is designed to
keep fees low so you will never have to
worry about Rising fees as your user
base
grows composable the single Global state
of Solana guarantees project
composability
multiple shards and lay two systems
should never be dealt
with so we have heard a lot of
references to proof of history but what
exactly is it that we will discuss
within the type of consensus method
salana
uses the salana network which has 200
physically different nodes can handle a
throughput of more than 50,000 DPS when
using gpus is one of the most performant
permissionless blockchain unlike Bitcoin
which employs the proof of work
algorithm as the system decentralized
clock Solana uses the proof of History
technique you can use proof of History
to construct historical records that
verify an event occurred at a given
point in time this algorithm is a
verifiable delay function with a high
frequency this function requires a
specific number of sequential steps to
evaluate each transaction or even that
is examined will be assigned a unique
hash an account that can be verified
publicly and effective
the count serves as a cryptographic
timestamp allowing us to determine when
each transaction or event occur this
provides increased throughput and
efficiency within the Solana
Network now that we know about its
structure and mechanism let's explore
how Solana
works now we know Solana has built a
oneof A- kind method for determining the
time of a transaction known as proof of
History three let's see the step-by-step
procedure of how it
works step one input the details of
transactions performed in the network to
its
leader step two leader will now
efficiently sequence and organize the
messages so that they can be processed
by another
nodes step three the leader then
executes the transactions based on the
Ram's current state
step four the completed States
transactions and signature will then be
published by the leader to the verifiers
called replication
nodes step five if the state receives
confirmation the verifiers will perform
the same transactions on their copies of
the state and publish their
signatures and at last step six the
consensus process will then use the
published confirmations as votes now
that we know everything about salana
let's have a look at the price and
volume of salana according to market
capitalization the salana network can
process more than 50,000 transactions in
one second and the current price of it
is $30 with a circulating volume of 270
million s coins which is quite
impressive considering its time span in
market capitalization as well as
compared to other
cryptocurrencies let's see what future
the salana holds for itself
salana although being a new project has
delivered on its Promises of speed and
scalability its token price has also
done well ATT attracting investors
attention nonetheless the network
acceptance and usage are still in their
early
stages we won't know whether salana
speed make a significant difference in
the Bitcoin realm until we witness
substantial traffic and more use cases
having a fast network is beneficial but
the advantages will only occur as more
people utilize it and more use cases
emerge real life uses of
salana serum radium bonea Orca oxygen
and Phantom wallet are some of the
recent projects that Solana is working
with well this is all about salana
Crypton in this video I will take you
through various important important
Concepts and components of the cardano
first we will explore what is cardano
then we will understand what is Ada
followed by what is its Max Supply and
value in today's
date then we will see why is it so
popular and after that we will explore
various layers of cardano followed by
consensus algorithm of
cardano after that we will look into the
difference between cardano and it eum
and at the end we will look into the
uses of
cardano so without further Ado let's get
started with the video so what is
cardano cardano is a third generation
decentralized proof of stake blockchain
platform that aims to outperform proof
of work
networks the infrastructure load of
escalating expenses energy utilization
and lengthy transaction time limits
scalability and sustainability for proof
of work networks like
ethereum Foundation decentralization
smart contracts scaling and governance
are the five stages of cardano
development the relevance of these
issues to blockchain networks were
recognized by Charles hoskinson
co-founder of the proof of work
blockchain ethereum who began creating
cardano and its principle cryptocurrency
Ada in 2014 and introducing the platform
and the Ada token in 2017 the cardano
foundation i o k and E M RG are all
responsible for cardano's
governance now let's move ahead to what
is Ada Ada is the name of cardano's
principle cryptocurrency it is based on
the cardano blockchain a first of its
kind decentralized Network built
entirely on scientific and mathematical
principles by cryptography and
Engineering experts
its purpose is to provide a quick and
secure transaction of value and allow
users to operate Smart contracts and
applications furthermore the ability to
send and receive funds instantly and for
a low fee has numerous applications in
the business and financial
worlds it is a proof of stake coin used
to fuel cardano ecosystem now let's have
a look at the max Supply and current
value of ADA in today's state
according to market cap cardano's
current value is 21823 USD and the
maximum supply of cardano can be of 45
billion out of which till today its
supply has reached 31 billion but the
question is why is it so
popular currently Ada the native coin of
the popular allcoin cardano has risen to
an all-time high breaking the previous
record despite a big price crash warning
the Ada USD rate of exchange topped
$2.5 for the first time on September 17
2021 cating a
154.50 4% price surge that began on July
20 now that we have covered the basics
let's di down and explore the layers of
cardano network there are two layers to
the cardano blockchain the settlement
layer and the computational layer the
settlement layer CSL is responsible a
settling transaction made by Network
peers in Ada the local currency the
computational layer CCL was built with
smart contracts and decentralized
applications in mind to maximize the
Network's capacity for protocol
modification and soft for
implementations we developed a layer
protocol cardano is written in hair
skill while smart contracts are written
in pluts a programming language that
allows for the creation of more
stringent contra
contracts now let's understand the
working of consensus algorithm of
cardano as discussed earlier Hill a
widely recognized and secure programming
language is used to create the cardo
open source
code kadano relies on the or borus
consensus protocol which is an uniquely
built proof of stake blockchain
technology this consensus process
ensures that ADA may be issued and
received quickly and securely as well as
the security of smart contracts on the
cardo blockchain at the same time as a
proof of stake consens mechanism it
rewards token holders who stake their
Ada in the network and assist insured
Network
unanimity so this is how it
works first the network chooses VI notes
called slot leaders at random to have
the opportunity to mine new blogs andol
control the flow of
data second the blockchain is divided
into slots each referred to as an
Epoch and at last lot leaders can mine
their own specific Epoch any person who
assist in the mining of an Epoch or a
portion of it is rewarded also an Epoch
can be partitioned an infinite number of
times now that we know both cardano and
ethereum deal with smart contracts and
daps let's unveil the difference between
them two launch date cardano was
launched in September 2017 while
etherium was launched way ago in January
2014 cardano was founded by Charles
hackinson while on the other hand eum
was founded by withal buin consensus
algorithm cardano follows proof of State
although etherium also intends to switch
to proof of state it still follows proof
of work programming language cardano
uses hair skill and etherium uses
solidity and architecture cardano has
two lays CSL and CCL but etherium just
consist of one layer now that we have
covered all the important aspects of
cardano let's have a Peak at the uses of
cardano one of the core principles of
cardano is that the Ada is stake to the
blockchain as part of the proof of stake
blockchain Network which allows Stak
pool operators to successfully verify
transactions on the blockchain this is
where the cardano cryptocurrency comes
into play those that stake their Ada on
the blockchain are rewarded with extra
cardano this staking system contributes
to the blockchain
security in addition Ada is used in
voting unlike other blockchain projects
kadano token holders vote and decide on
protocol updates rather than minors
unlike other blockchain networks cardano
token holders vote and decide on
protocol modifications not miners when a
new Improvement or enhancement to the
cardano blockchain is suggested cardano
crypto holders vote with the Ada as a
result everyone who owns a
cryptocurrency has a vote in how it
develops so well this is all about
cardano so what are your thoughts on
cardano and will you be investing money
in it I will take you through various
important con Concepts and components of
the Matic first we will explore what is
polygon followed by what is
Matic then we will look into the
features of
Matic and after that we will understand
how does Polygon
works then we will discover why is it
important to
ethereum and what is its current value
and circulating
Supply and at last we will discuss is it
a good investment or not so without
further Ado let's get started with the
video so let's start with what is
polygon polygon formerly known as Matic
network is a scaling solution that seeks
to give several methods to boost the
speed of transactions on blockchain
networks while also lowering the cost
and
complexity polygon describes itself as a
layer to network which means it is an
addon layer to ethereum that does not
attempt to alter the or blockchain layer
like its geometric name sake it has
numerous sides shapes and applications
and it promises to be a more
straightforward framework for creating
interconnected
networks polygon is a scaling solution
that seeks to give several methods to
boost the speed of transactions on
blockchain network while also lowering
their cost and
complexity now that brings us to what is
Matic after the rebranding polygon re
mained its Matic cryptocurrency the
digital coin underpinning the network
Matic is the payment and settlement unit
for participants who engage within the
network and is also utilized to keep
tokens safe on the polygon
Network since then it has received an
Incredible cost search following a
tremendous expansion in
use the Matic cryptocurrency is
available on a number of well-known
decentralized and centralized trading
platforms including Finance onein
exchange and coinbase pro the crypto
Community is banding together to make it
easier to buy polygon or mtic tokens by
making them available in both Fiat and
crypto so now that we know what they are
let's have a look at the features of
Matic first is it provides blockchain
performance enhancement
Technologies polygon side chain was one
of the first things they offered a side
chain is a blockchain that links to it
and improves its
performance transactions are processed
faster and fees are significantly
lower second is its goal to create a
foundation of blockchain
network polygon's future goals are huge
its purpose is to create a foundation
for blockchain networks instead of being
completely disconnected users would be
able to establish blockchain networks
that interconnect
third comes its ethereum virtual machine
or evm compatible because polygon is evm
compatible developers can easily Port
their apps to it a and Sushi swap are
just two of the popular ethereum apps
that have already been deployed on
polygon then comes other blockchain
networks as well as ethereum 2.0 could
provide challenges polyan isn't the only
blockchain Network initiative in the
works
others such as poot and avalanch provide
interconnected blockchains project like
these make go exist or one may develop a
Superior Solution and abandon the others
ethereum has also been releasing updates
to ethereum 2.0 in a series of releases
and next is fees governance and staking
are all handled through the polygon
token we have discussed the Project's
objectives but what about polygon's
cryptocurrency token
it can be utilized in a variety of ways
now we have almost covered the basic
let's TI down and understand how it
works polygon is a multi-level platform
that intends to grow ethereum by using a
variety of side chains to unclock the
main platform in a cost effective and
efficient
manner if you're not aware of site chain
they are separate blockchains that are
linked to the main ethereum blockchain
and can support a variety of
decentralized Finance
protocols as a result polygon can be
linked to networks like poga dot Cosmos
and avalanche now let's have a look at
why is it important to
ethereum Matic is compatible with the
evm developers that accustomed to
working with ethereum can easily
transition to polygon polygon has a
security layer that may be turned on or
off which en enables soine platforms to
forego additional protection while
maintaining their freedom and
flexibility mic tokens can be used to
vote on polygon Improvement Pro
proposals and participate in network
governance so now let's have a look at
the cryptomarket value of
Matic according to market cap polygon's
current price is
1.30 USD
dollars and the maximum supply of
polygon is 10 billion out of which till
today its supply has reached 6.67
billion now the question comes is it a
good
investment so if you're thinking about
investing in Matic keep in mind that
cryptocurrencies are quite volatile so
you'll need to be prepared for large
price swings so only invest money you
can afford to lose and make sure to
build up your emergency savings and
retirement account first however
investors should keep an eye on the
implementation of ethereum to as well as
the activity of polygon
competitors there's still a lot to play
for in this sector and it's unclear how
it will develop so moving on let me give
you an overview of all the topics you
are going to cover across in this
video first we will understand the
basics and explore what is stable coins
following that we will look into the
types of stable
coins after that we will have a Cris
comparison between stable coins and
other
cryptocurrencies moving on we will have
a look at some of best stable coins
according to market
capitalization after that we will dive
down deeper and understand why is it so
important and in the end we will see
what can we do with these table coins so
now let's get started with the
basics what is stable coin a stable coin
is a type of cryptocurrency that is
backed by Pres Reserve asset like the US
dollar or gold that aims to provide
price
stability it started getting popularity
since they try to combine The Best of
Both Worlds the rapid processing and
security or privacy of cryptocurrency
payments as well as the volatility free
and stable prices of paid currencies so
now that we know what stable coin is
let's explore its types
the first one that we are going to
understand is Fiat collateralized stable
coins it uses a fiat currency Reserve
such as the US dollar to issue a
sufficient number of crypto dollar to
other types of collateral include
precious metal such as gold and silver
as well as Commodities such as oil but
the majority of today's Fe
collateralized stable coins use dollar
reserves now independent custodians
manage such reserves which are audited
on a regular basis to ensure that the
essential compliance is met teeta and
true USD are popular cryptocurrencies
that are backed by Dollar deposits and
have the same value as a single US
dollar now moving on to the next one we
have crypto collateralized stable coins
stable coins that are crypto
collateralized are backed by other
cryptocurrencies because the reserve
cryptocurrency may be volatile such
stable coins are over collateralized
which means that a larger number of
cryptocurrency tokens a as a reserve for
releasing a smaller number of stable
coins now coming to the last one that we
have is non-collateralized or
algorithmic stable
coin now this don't have any reserves
but they do have a working mechanism to
keep the price stable similar to that of
a central bank the dollar beg Bas coin
for example employes a consensus method
to increase or reduce token production
based on demand now such practices can
be compared to a central bank producing
Bank notes to sustain per currency
valuations it is possible to achieve
this by developing a smart contract on a
decentralized platform that can execute
independently so now that we have a fair
knowledge of stable coin let's have a
quick comparison between stable coin and
other cryptocurrencies to understand
their functioning even better so the
first one is it is possible to
accurately predict fluctuations in the
value of stable coin on the other hand
it is difficult to anticipate the trend
in the value of other
cryptocurrencies the second one is
stable coins are centralized as they are
maintained by independent
custodians on the other hand
cryptocurrencies are
decentralized the third one we have is
is stable coins values remains constant
at $1 cryptocurrency on the other hand
has a price range depending on its
performance in market
capitalization and the fourth one is
stable coin price remains constant
making them
nonvolatile cryptocurrencies on the
other hand have a lot of insecurity
making them extremely unpredictable and
highly volatile now let's have a look at
some of the best coins according to the
market
capitalization first we have is Teta
with the market capitalization of $ 79.5
billion then we have USD coin with
market capitalization of 535
billion following that we have bance USD
with market capitalization of $18.3
billion then we have terra USD
with a market capitalization of 13
billion then we have D with market
capitalization of $9.7
billion following that we have true USD
with market capitalization of 1.5
billion then we have PA dollar with
market capitalization of
9474
billion following that we have neutrino
USD with the market capitalized Iz ation
of $
4939
billion now let's understand why stable
coins are so important to
people stable coins are devoid of the
volatile nature of non-peg
cryptocurrencies while retaining some of
their most valuable
properties
like stable coins are open Global and
available to everyone on the internet
24/7 they transport data quickly cheaply
and very
securely and they are programmable and
digitally native to the
internet now that we have covered almost
everything about stable coins and its
Concepts now let's see what all can we
do with these stable
coins first is cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin and ether have a lot of
volatility
sometimes even by minu buyers and
sellers can have confidence that the
value of their tokens will neither grow
nor fall unpredictably in the near
future the asset is linked to a more
stable currency or say stable coins the
second one is stable coins can be held
without a bank account and a simple to
transfer the value of stable coins may
be easily moved around the world even to
countries where the US dollar is
difficult to come by or where the local
currencies
volatile coming to the third one is
there are several simple ways to earn
income on a stable coin investment which
is often higher than what a bank would
offer so for the fourth one we have with
transfer fees of less than $1 people
have sent as much as a million dollar
worth of
usdc and the fifth the last one is
stable coins like usdc is a wonderful Al
native for transporting money around the
world because of their quick processing
and cheap transaction fees so well this
was all about stable coin before getting
to the comparison of crypto coins and
tokens let me give a quick introduction
to what is a digital asset this will
help you understand the difference
between crypto coins and tokens better
broadly speaking a digital asset is a
non-tangible asset that is created
exchanged and kept in a digital format
by this definition cryptocurrencies and
crypto tokens are considered digital
Assets in the context of blockchains
since both cryptocurrencies and tokens
are digital assets on blockchains the
terms are frequently used synonymously
but they are not similar there are
multiple parameters where they differ
from each other on multiple levels and
that's what we will cover moving forward
in this video so let me take you through
the comparison parameters based on which
we will compare crypto coins and tokens
first is definition cryptocurrencies
have their own unique blockchain BTC is
the currency used in the Bitcoin
blockchain ethereum has eth on its
blockchain similar to traditional
currencies the main purpose of these
currency coins is to serve as a form of
wealth storage and a medium of exchange
for this reason cryptocurrency is
another name for cryptocurrency coins
although they are created utilizing
blockchain technology unlike
cryptocurrency currencies crypto tokens
are not native to a blockchain while
cryptocurrency coins imitate
conventional money crypto tokens behave
more like assets or even Deeds a crypto
token may serve as a proxy for ownership
the next parameter that will be measured
is Supply if getting your learning
started is half the battle what if you
could do that for free visit skillup by
simply learn click on the link in the
description to know more the way they
are created mining is used to create
cryptocoins in most cases
cryptocurrencies are either mined using
a proof of work or P or a proof of stake
POS consensus mechanism tokens unlike
cryptocurrencies are generalized and
distributed by the project developer
rather than being mined tokens Can Be
utilized in a plethora of ways once they
are in the possession of buyers now
talking about fees or gas when
transferring a cryptocurrency
transaction fees or gas are cheaper
however when transferring tokens they
are more expensive when transferring
tokens you still require some
cryptocurrency in the same account
because fees are always paid for in
cryptocurrencies now moving on to the
next parameter purpose what are they
used for or what they serve cryptocoins
are designed to work in the same way as
paper money and metal coins meaning they
can be used for many of the things
normally used with US dollars or Euros
including storing value exchanging for
other currencies paying for goods and
services transferring to others and so
forth whereas most crypto tokens are
made to be utilized in daps or
blockchainbased projects crypto tokens
Can represent ownership in a dow a
digital product or nft or even a
tangible item crypto tokens are similar
to currencies in that they may be
purchased sold and exchanged but are not
utilized as a means of exchange to put
it another way cryptocoins are more like
dollar and cents whereas crypto tokens
are more like coupons or vouchers and

link in the description to know more the
variation of crypto coins or tokens
present in the crypto Market some of the
popular crypto coins are Bitcoin the
first and most well-known cryptocoin in
the world ethereum implements smart
contracts and is the home to thousands
of blockchain projects and nfts cardano
an open- source and decentralized
blockchain platform that is one of the
first to run on a POS consensus and many
more in crypto tokens some of the
popular tokens are filecoin and arweave
allow users to pay with their utility
tokens for the right to store data on
their decentralized Network maximizing
the potential of cloud storage axi
Infiniti one of the best known play to
earn on the market and features a
utility token called Smooth love potions
Kronos a utility token for the
crypto.com ecosystem and there are many
more tokens available in the crypto
ecosystem now the decision of whether to
purchase coins or tokens greatly depends
upon on the holder intention so while
wait let's embark on this exhilarating
adventure together but before we dive in
if you're looking to take your career to
new heights and become a true expert in
the realm of blockchain and
cryptocurrency consider checking out our
professional certificate program in
blockchain in collaboration with I Kut
it's an excellent opportunity to master
key architectural principles and develop
the skills needed to excel in this
rapidly growing field so let's have a
look topics that we are going going to
cover in this topic first we will
understand what is Ripple followed by
what is
xrp then we will see the working of
Ripple then we will learn how to mine
xrp after that we will have a comparison
between Bitcoin and ripple then we will
explore the pros and cons of Ripple
after which we will see how you can
actually use Ripple followed by we will
see how can we buy Ripple and in the end
we will see if it is a good investment
or not so let's get started with the
video first let's understand what is
Ripple so the firm behind xrp is Ripple
which is a payment settlement systems
and currency engine Network that can
handle transactions all across the
world basically it acts as a trusted
intermediary between two parties in a
transaction
as the network can be immediately
validated that the transaction was
completed
successfully Ripple can ease the
exchange of a wide
range of Fiat currencies and
cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin so
when users utilize a network to make a
transaction the network takes a modest
charge in the form of
xrp and ripple was built from the ground
up to be a swift a leading money
transfer Network successor or to
otherwise replace sentimental layer
between large financial institutions so
this raises the question of what is XR
so let's have a look at it the xrp
Ledger created by Jade M Arthur Brito
and David Schwarz is a blockchain that
runs xrp maleb and Brito would go on to
form Ripple which would employ xrp to
enable Network
transactions you can acquire xrp as an
investment crypto to trade from other
cryptocurrencies or as a way to fund
Ripple Network transactions xrp's
blockchain in particular D from that of
most other cryptocurrencies other
cryptocurrencies give anyone who can
solve difficult equations quickly access
to their transaction ledgers and
verification processes Ripple
transactions on the other hand are safe
since the majority of Ledger holders
must agree to the verification
before they can be added also the Ripple
Network which employs xrp is somewhat
centralized and uses a consensus
protocol this means while anyone can
download its validation software it has
its own node list that consumers can use
to validate transactions based on which
participants they believe are least
likely to cheat them so now that we know
the basics of Ripple and xrp let's have
a look at working of Ripple two verify
transactions the xrp cryptocurrency
employs a consensus protocol validators
verify that proposed transactions are
valid by comparing them to the most
recent version of The xrp Ledger now a
transaction must be accepted by the
majority of validators in order to be
verified once it's verified the
transaction is then added to the
blockchain so now that we know it's
working let's have a look at how Ripple
can be mined by its users ripples or XR
is created using a crypto Ledger that is
a keen to blockchain technology and is
Federated by financial institutions and
payment processor
networks while it is true that Ripple
xrp cannot be mined by miners it is
technically viable to do it using other
cryptocurrencies so one of the most
viable techniques for mining xrp is to
mine other cryptocurrency such as
Bitcoin and ethereum and then transfer
the M crypto for ripple through
exchanges and that's how the mining is
done so as we have discussed all the
basics of Ripple let's di down deeper
and have a look at how it differs from
Bitcoin to verify transactions and
distribute new currencies Bitcoin
employees mining participants set up
mining devices to solve complex
mathematical equations with the first
person to solve the equation ation
winning the right to add a block of
transaction to bitcoin's network then
participants receive Bitcoin rewards for
each block they add in the exchange for
Bitcoin mining whereas the consensus
protocol used by xrp confirms
transactions for a transaction to be
accepted it must receive the approval of
a majority of validators who actually
review it then Bitcoin transaction
confirms can take several minutes and
are associated with significant
transaction charges due to the ingate
and expensive nature of mining utilized
in the cryptocurrency but on the other
hand xrp transactions are instantly
confirmed and have very cheap
transaction fees the user is charge a
small amount of xrp each time a
transaction is completed on the Ripple
Network now the supply of Bitcoin is
limited to 21 million which means there
will be never more more than 21 million
Bitcoin the artificial scarcity of 12
Bitcoin has sparked investor interest in
the currency potential as a safe haven
but in contrast at the time of
introduction 1 billion xrp was pre-mined
and progressively distributed onto the
market by the company's major investors
next we have when miners discovered
Bitcoins they are released and added to
the network they have no set release
date and their supply is largely
determined by Network speeds and the
difficulty of the algorithm used to
create coins on the other hand the
release of xrp is controlled by a smart
contract according to an inbuilt smart
contract Ripple is expected to
distribute a maximum of 1 billion xrp
tokens per month so the current
circulation is 55 billion till now so
this was all about the difference
between Bitcoin and ripple and I'm
pretty sure that till now you have
understood all the basic knowledge about
Ripple so let's move ahead and look into
some of the pros and cons of Ripple
though xrp transactions are quick and
inexpensive Ripple's consensus protocol
is perhaps less secure than other crypto
transaction processing
Technologies next is even though
Financial organizations are already
using Ripple's payment Network Ripple's
Financial Partners primarily use trip
net rather than xrp
cryptocurrency next we have is small
company owners and individuals who can
utilize xrp to make safe money
transactions yet because it is
administered by a private Corporation
and because of the SEC litigation Ripple
has sparked the debate and for foreign
currency transfers xrp can be utilized
as a bridge currency but in the United
States buying xrp is quite challenging
so now that we know its pros and cons
Also let's have a look how you can
actually use Ripple xrp can be used in
the same way as any digital currency for
transaction or as a possible investment
other sorts of transactions such as
currency exchange potentially be
processed using the Ripple Network for
example instead of dealing with the
currency conversion directly through a
bank or money changing exchange you may
first exchange your us dollarss for xrp
on the Ripple Network and then use them
to buy euros rather than paying the
Hefty cost that Banks and money
transmission businesses May demand this
can be a lot fast and less expensive
option so now that we know everything
about Ripple let's explore how can we
actually buy Ripple so all you need to
is sign up for an account on an exchange
that sells Ripple's xrp cryptocurrency
to buy it then using any of the
exchanges allowed payment methods buy it
here are a few places where you can get
xrp Q coin uphold and coin
Mama now the question
is is Ripple a good
investment so
xrp is a risky investment that is not
forther faint of art however if you feel
Ripple will succeed as a payment system
it it may be worthwhile to invest in xrp
so just be sure you're not gambling with
money you can't afford to
lose well this was all about what is
Ripple so let's start the video let's
have a look at the topics that we are
going to cover in this video first we
will explore what is binance coin
following that we will understand how it
works then we will dive down deeper and
explore a very interesting concept for
followed by binance which is BNB
burning then we will look at the uses of
the binance coin followed by its
benefits after that we will come across
some important factors to consider
before investing in the binance coin and
at the end we will see the pricing
dynamics of the binance coin the first
thing that we are going to explore is
what is binance coin so binance coin of
BNB is a cryptocurrency that that may be
used on the binance cryptocurrency
exchange to trade and pay fees as of
January 2018 the binance exchange was
the world's largest cryptocurrency
exchange conducting over 1.4 million
transactions every
second this coin is limited to 200
million BNB tokens and runs on the
ethereum blockchain using the standard
erc20 protocol as an incentive binance
coin users receive a reduction in
transaction cost on the binance
exchange other cryptocurrencies such as
Bitcoin ethereum Litecoin and others can
be exchanged or traded for
BNB now let's move on and see how it
works BNB is a crypto asset that
fluctuates in value as individuals use
and trade it similar to other digital
assets on the market B&B can be stored
suitable wallets obtained from crypto
exchanges and send directly to others
for payments and other purposes but
there is a whole working initiative
behind this process bance layer one
blockchain is merged to form the BNB
chain previously the binance M chain and
the binance chain binance designed the
blockchain for best performance when it
comes to trading onchain when building
the BNB chain and binance de
it is also based on this newly developed
chain furthermore BNB chain transactions
are powered by the BNB gas token which
stands for build and build previously
also known as binance coin now BNB
Beacon chain and BNB smart chain make up
the BNB chain the former is concerned
with BNB chain governance which allows
BNB holders to vote and stake their
coins then it's a consensus layer that's
compati able with the ethereum virtual
machine and has multi-chain
hubs now moving on let's have a look at
the B&B burn
concept bance uses 20% of its profit
each quarter to buy back and burn
binance coins completely destroying them
binance has consistently performed
quarterly burns the most recent Bean on
October 17 2020 which was the 13th
quarterly burn
binance will continue to burn BNB coins
every quarter until it has purchased and
destroyed 100 million binance coins or
half of the total
Supply binance coins Supply is reduced
as a result of the procedure and its
Rarity is affected which could affect
the assets value binance also has a
program called the BNB Pioneer burn
program which assets cases when BNB
holders have unrecoverable lost BNB and
compensate them them by reducing the
amount from the next BNB burn now let's
have a look at some of the uses of the
binance
coin the binance coin like other
developing cryptocurrencies has a
variety of applications outside of the
binance exchange
including first is trading binance coin
can be exchanged for other
cryptocurrencies on a variety of
exchanges depending on the exchanges
regulations next is transaction fees on
the binance exchange users can use BNB
to pay for transactions on the binance
exchange and earn a hefty
discount next we have is credit card
payments on crypto.com BNB can be used
to pay for crypto credit card
bills next is Payment Processing
Merchants can accept BNB as a form of
payments giving customers more options
in terms of payment
methods next we have is booking travel
Arrangements on certain websites BNB can
be used to book hotels flights as
well next is entertainment now BNB is
used for a variety of purposes in the
entertainment industries from paying for
virtual gifts to purchasing lottery
tickets as
well next in the line is
investment binance coin can be used to
invest in stocks ETFs and other assets
on a variety of
platforms and at last is loans and
transfers on some platforms BNB can be
used as a collateral for loans there are
also apps that allow users to use
binance coin to split bills and pay
friends and
relatives so now that we have covered
the basics of the binance coin let's
have a look at some of its benefits that
makes it unique
starting with quick
transactions when you trade on the
exchange with BNB you'll have access to
the platform propery matching engine
which can handle up to 1.4 million
orders per second finding the
appropriate transaction is always
possible and using BNB makes it even
easier and more
reliable next is secure and
trustworthy binance already has millions
of cryptocurrency users and dealers who
rely on the platform and believe in the
security and protection aspects of this
exchange to keep your funds safe The
Exchange uses a multicluster and multi-
tire system framework as well as the
secure assets funds for users next is
trade multiple
cryptocurrencies you can trade more than
150 cryptocurrencies on the exchange
with BNB thanks to a rapid secure and
low cost transaction matching technology
aside from that B&B has its own trading
pair to fulfill your individual trading
needs there's no need to seek elsewhere
moving ahead is Trading
discount you can also get a 50% discount
on your trading charge if you use BNB
with traditional payment methods if you
buy $10,000 worth of coins you'll be
charged $10 and if you use BNB those the
trading charg is cut in half so you will
just have to spend
$5 next is spending binance coin you can
utilize BNB in a variety of ways in
addition to having a smooth experience
within the binance ecosystem and
receiving transaction fee discounts
several service providers particularly
in the travel and hotel Industries
accepted using BNB you can purchase
dinner or a new phone as well now let's
have a look at some of the factors that
you should consider before investing in
binance
coin now binance coins can be used to
invest in some icos listed on binance
Launchpad program The binance Exchange
will publish new cryptocurrencies and
the use of binance coins will provide a
seamless Marketplace for trading a range
of virtual tokens binance will
eventually become the decentralized
binance exchanges principle currency
the Visa debit card of monacco the
world's first payment and cryptocurrency
platform and the platform's mobile app
also support binance
coin now as we are talking about
Investments let's have a look at the
Peak at BNB pricing and
Dynamics bnb's pricing has traditionally
varied in a similar way to the price of
other crypto assets traded on the market
binance coins market capitalization has
increased over time topic $70 billion
BNB was also sold for around
$0.10 per token during finance's Ico
today the current value of BNB is
$286.22 with the market capitalization
of 46 b81
m218 BNB has seen a tremendous increase
in value since its Ico reaching up high
of more than $600 per coins at time is
it wise to invest in binance coin well
if purchase joined and sold at the right
times it's conceivable and its past
price growth resulted in profit however
only time can tell where the price of
BNB will go in the future Alex like
everybody else in the world had heard a
lot of hype around blockchain and
cryptocurrency being a techie he started
exploring blockchain and cryptocurrency
and understood that blockchain is a
distributed digital database that makes
recording transactions and managing
Assets in a corporate Network much
easier and cryptocurrency on the other
hand is a digital currency that acts as
a medium of exchange over a blockchain
network it is not supported by any
Central Authority such as a government
or bank but what intrigued him was how
people contribute to blockchain so he
decided to go to a friend Sarah who is a
blockchain expert upon asking how people
actually participate in blockchain Sarah
answered this occurs via crypto mining
cryptocurrency mining is the process by
which specialized computers often known
as nodes or mining rigs validate
blockchain transactions for a specific
cryptocoin and exchange for a mining
payout listening to this Alex asked if
he could also join this network and be a
part of the crypto mining process Sarah
said it's a little difficult because
crypto mining requires a huge setup like
a high-end processor GPU high
performance graphics card lots of
electricity and an AC and to set up all
this he needs a huge amount of land Alex
was disappointed and that is when Sarah
said but there is one network that you
can mine without any hassle it is pi
Network Alex got curious and asked what
pi network is and how it can act
differently from other cryptocurrencies
Sarah explained that p network is a
digital currency initiative that
attempts to make cryptocurrency mining
accessible as first generation
currencies such as Bitcoin have become
too centralized for many da users let's
understand this in detail Pi Network
came into the picture in 2019 itself
since then it has been in testing mode
even though it's not launched yet it
still offers to mine its coins and
here's how to mine it users must first
Safeguard the currency they also need to
expand their Network by referring it to
others all you need to do is one every
day log in and click a button to receive
digital cash there is no evidence of
Labor being done they simply log in and
press a button because this currency is
not yet exchanged it has no value two
increase your level by inviting
additional people to the site this
allows them to accumulate more digital
cash each day in pyramid schemes and
multi-level marketing this is a common
model she further added that Pi was
designed to be HED regularly to protect
its scarcity when a minor receives half
as many coins for processing new
transactions this is known as having it
usually happens when you reach a certain
Milestone when P hit 100 000 users its
mining rate fell to 1.6 per hour then to
0.4 per hour then to 0.2 per hour and
finally to 0.2 per hour when it reached
10 million users it will continue to
have until 1 billion users are reached
on learning about this whole new
cryptocurrency transformation in pi
Network Alex was sure that he definitely
wanted to lay his hands on it for once
with branding based on the number Pi the
Project's first phase began on Pi Day on
March 14th 20 9 with the free Pi mining
app the network had over 100,000 active
users by June 2019 when Phase 2 began a
year later more than 3.5 million users
were there in May 2020 the app began
running advertisements in order to raise
funds for the project on March 15th 2022
Pi Network said its user base had grown
to 33 million up from 14 million in
March 2021 it will enable a completely
decentralized web where users are in
control basically it's designed to link
public and permission networks oracles
private and Consortium chains and yet to
be developed future Technologies through
the pka do relay chain PKA do enables an
internet where separate blockchains can
communicate data and transactions in an
untrusted manner decentralized
institutions services and apps are now
easier to build and Link than ever
before
padot aims to liberate Society from its
Reliance on a broken web where its
powerfully institutions cannot betray
our confidence by giving entrepreneurs
the tools they need to create better
Solutions now this whole explanation
raises a question of who is responsible
for building poad do so let me explain
you the web 3 Foundation a Swiss
organization established to promote a
fully functional and userfriendly
decentralized web has made PKA dot its
Flagship project now to build PKA Dot
and encourage the creation of the
services and apps that will run on it
the web 3 Foundation is collaborating
with top tier
organizations a world-class
implementation of web3 with PKA dot at
its score is being developed by
researchers from indria Paris and eth
Zurich developers from parity
Technologies and capital Partners from
cryptocurrency funds like polychain
capital in fact do you know that grants
are being offered by the web3 foundation
for ecosystem
growth well so moving on let me take you
through the working of PKA dot because
so many parach chains help the main
relay chain with a lot of the heavy
lifting PKA dot is able to analyze all
this data as a result compared to around
7 for Bitcoin and 30 for ethereum the
bka network can execute more than 1,000
trans actions per second now poka do
should become much faster if the network
expands and more par chains are added
and then the speed can reach a million
transactions per second as well now let
me take you through a very important
aspect of PKA do Network which is very
evident in its name itself and that is
dot now the native token of the pka do
network is dot transaction fees taking
governance purchasing a pain space and
enable a number of crucial poka dot
features may all be done with DOT now
these dots can be connected in multiple
ways so let's discuss them one by one
first is relay chain it's PKA Dot's core
aspect and is in charge of the network
inter parability across chains consensus
and shed
security second is parach chains now
these are independent blockchains that
are capable of creating creating their
own coins and tailoring their
functionality to particular use
cases third is par thread which is
similar to par chains but uses a pay as
your go payment system now blockchains
without a constant connection to the
network are most more cost
effective fourth is Bridges now this
enables connections and communication
between parach chains and para threads
and other networks like ethereum and
Bitcoin
so now that I have already discussed
about dots let me give you a quick
overview of how one can use these
dots so if you have one dot it is bare
minimum balance needed to maintain an
active PKA network account now your
account will be deleted if the amount
Falls below one dot so find out more
about accounts and the need for existing
deposits then we have five dot to
participate in C loans for parach chain
slot auctions you must make a minimum
contribution of this
amount then we have 10 dot it is the
bare minimum stake necessary to submit
your nomination of validators purpose
however in order to receive staking
incentives your stake must be greater
than the dynamic minimum stake among
active nominators find out how to
nominate
people and then it's $0 you can cast a
council vote or registered an onchain
identity now the Democracy of poar
benefit from dot to make suggestions to
support them and to vote on them when
they become
referendums dot must be bonded to submit
a treasury proposal 100 dot in bonds of
5% of the required funds must be
provided now you may be able to take
part in initiatives like the Thousand
validators programs thanks to Dot
now moving ahead let me tell you about
why you should consider PKA do so PKA do
provides a platform for everyone
regardless of whether you are a
blockchain developer or just interested
in being a part of the community this
Wiki provider a location for Builders
and maintainers to use tools and for new
students to explore educational
content now let me tell you about how
staking actually works on padot
so in order to protect the network or
validate transactions or generate and
distribute new dot fga dot uses appr
proof of State consensus process
depending on how much time technical
expertise and money they wish to invest
dot holders can engage with the staking
mechanism in a variety of ways like
validators who do the most work it's a
big commitment and calls for
technological expertise you must
maintain a node of or one of the
computers that makes up the network with
little to no downtime and stake a
sizable portion of your own dot in order
to become a validator now you gain the
ability to approve valid transactions
and add new blocks of the transaction to
the relay chain and potentially
establish dot while also receiving a cut
of transaction fees and tips in return
next we have is
nominators they enable everyday
investors to take part in staying ctly
you can trust a validator to follow the
rules if you give them part of your dot
in return you receive a portion of the
dot that your selected validators earn
now you risk losing some of your stake
if your validators violates the rules so
choose carefully any of the jobs
mentioned above will allow you to St and
participate in the network in order to
be eligible for DOT Awards holders of
dots can vote on proposed software
changes and have a say in how the
network is run so this was all about PKA
dots and it's related well let's have a
look at what you are going to learn in
this video about
Litecoin so first I will take you
through the definition of what is
Litecoin followed by how it works then I
will let you explore the differences
between Litecoin and
Bitcoin then I will help you understand
what are the pros and cons of Litecoin
then I will explain to you how Litecoin
is used following that I will explain to
you how Litecoin is traded and then I
will let you explore why trade Litecoin
with CMC Markets and then I will take
you through the factors that affect
Litecoin and in the end why should you
buy Litecoin so let's get started with
the video first let me make you
understand what is
Litecoin now the native cryptocurrency
of the open- source blockchain project
Litecoin whose code is a copy of
Bitcoins is LTC as the silver to
bitcoin's gold Litecoin was created to
be more scalable and to process
transactions considered more quickly
than Bitcoin in October 2011 Charlie Lee
a software engineer who had previously
worked at Google and the cryptocurrency
exchange coinbase announced the creation
of the blockchain on the Bitcoin talk
Forum now that we know what is Litecoin
let me take you through how it actually
works now using an open-source
cryptographic technology digital coins
are created and transferred using
Litecoin it keeps a decentralized public
Ledger for all transactions using
blockchain technology now what is
blockchain technology a shared digital
Ledger called the blockchain contains a
record of every Litecoin transaction by
miners recent cryptocurrency
transactions are compiled into blocks
after that the blocks are
cryptographically protected before being
connected to the pre-existing blockchain
now Litecoin and Bitcoin among other
cryptocurrencies also use similar
blockchain
technology now this raises a question
that what is mining now mining is the
process of employing miners or mining
software to secure each block to the
current blockchain the release of new
Litecoin units occur when a block has
been secured
these units can be reintroduced into the
market by miners well this raises
another question that how exactly
Litecoin differs from Bitcoin now this
comparison will be made on a few
parameters first is coin release date
Litecoin was launched on 7 October 2011
whereas Bitcoin was released on 9 Jan
2009 second is maximum coin Supply there
is a limited Supply of coins in
circulation for both Bitcoin and
Litecoin Litecoin has 84 million coins
accessible which is almost four times as
many as bitcoin's 21
million third is average transaction
speed now despite requiring more
Advanced Equipment than Bitcoin to mine
which takes almost 10 minutes blocks in
Litecoin are actually generated in 2.5
minutes up to four times faster
additionally Litecoin executes Financial
transactions much more quickly and can
handle more of them in the same amount
of
time fourth is having having interval
for Block rewards their range is based
on basically market supply only and the
last one is mining algorithm a
cryptocurrencies blockchain can draw by
adding new blocks when minus
successfully solve hash functions now
Litecoin and Bitcoin employ different
mining algorithms script is the hash
hash function used by Litecoin and
Bitcoin utilizes sh
256 now let me explain to you the pros
and cons of
Litecoin now the popularity of Litecoin
started to sore in 2017 5 years later it
is still in demand and sells for over
$70 it has fed better than many of its
Rivals during the recent cryptocurrency
sell off but Investments always carry a
risk it's impressive how relative
stability has held up for Litecoin
throughout time though it exhibits
steadiness but lacks the impressive
growth that attracts
investors although the coins are
reasonably priced they are nonetheless
more expensive than most of their Rivals
also litecoin's market capitalization is
smaller than other cryptocurrency and it
has lost market share as well also
Litecoin is less speculative than many
of the younger coins even if all
cryptocurrency Investments are
speculative
the expansion of Litecoin may be
constrained by the fact that it is less
scalable than competitive blockchain
like Stell lumens so now that we have
covered the basics of Litecoin let me
take you through how Litecoin is exactly
used now due to its strong liquidity
Litecoin is a cryptocurrency with
simpler trading actually owners of
Litecoin will discover the businesses
like Newegg sling TV and even Charities
like the American Red Cross are glad to
take their digital money to make a
payment with LTC you can alternative
utilize a digital currency app like
bitpay or cryptopay now you can use the
binance app to send money using LTC if
you wish to use it for peer-to-peer
payments now let's see how Litecoin is
exactly traded now the price of one
Litecoin is typically indicated against
the US dollar when purchasing it on an
exchange in other words you are selling
USD to purchase LTC if the price of
Litecoin increases you can sell it for a
profit because it is now worth more in
USD than when you first purchase it now
if you opt to sell at a lower price and
incur a loss this is what will happen
also you can trade Litecoin with CMC
Markets using a spread beted or contract
for difference or sa the account this
enables you to make price predictions
without actually owning the
cryptocurrency your possession of
Litecoin is not transferred instead you
are taking a stake whose value will
fluctuate with changes in the price of
Litecoin relative to the US
dollar now that you know how Litecoin is
traded let me explain to you why
Litecoin should be traded with CMC
Markets so the first reason is open a
long or short position now you can trade
on increasing and falling prices with
speed
betting at cfds to sell Litecoin which
is not available on cryptocurrency
exchanges and you do not need to hold
any second is efficient use of capital
now when you trade using leverage you
merely put up a small portion of the
total trade value to begin a position
with well-known cryptocurrency exchanges
you must deposit the entire contract's
value remember that both gains and
losses will be Amplified and your risk
losing for more money then you initially
invested third is no exchange account or
wallet there's no requirement to open an
exchange account or wallet to store the
purchase Litecoin in contrast to trading
the underlying cryptocurrency this
eliminates the need to wait for exchange
approval worry about keeping your wallet
secure and pay fees if you decide to
withdraw money
later fourth is trade with an
established provider CMC Markets is a
licensed provider with 29 years in the
business we provide assistance to all of
our customers anytime the markets are
open and fifth is trade responsibility
for most people cryptocurrencies are
still rather new and can be very
unstable they want our clients to fully
access comprehensive instructions
resources to support their trade now
let's have a look at the factors that
actually affect the LTC coin now similar
to bitcoin litecoin's volatility is
likely influenced by the following
factors first is regulation governments
and central banks presented do not
control cryptocurrencies there are
concerns about how this might evolve
over the coming years and it effect on
value second is Supply there are only so
many litecoins that can be mined which
is 84 million the rate at which coins
are introduced to the market can also
effectively
availability third is press public
opinion security durability and the
pricing of competing cryptocurrencies
like Bitcoin can all Impact Litecoin
prices and fourth is adoption neither
consumers nor businesses have yet embrac
Litecoin as a form of payment however
some believe that blockchain technology
has promised and may one day be more
widely used now the biggest question of
concern is should you buy Litecoin
according to blaski or bit Ira Litecoin
might be a good addition to the
portfolio of an experienced
cryptocurrency investor who values its
stability and adaptability particularly
for those who want a combination store
of value Asset with the side bonus of
convenient transactions so according to
some experts light Point might be a
suitable investment for a beginner
looking to learn the ins and outs of
cryptocurrency trading media makes the
following conclusion about whether LTC
is a good option for your wallet there
are other blockchain competitors that
individuals may pick from but Litecoin
Still Remains a relevant choice so let's
have a look at what we are going to
learn in this video first we will learn
what is algorthm followed by what is
algo then we will look into its
foundation and protocol then we will
understand what is algorithm taking
mechanism and how does algorithm work
and at the end we will see how to buy
algorthm
so before we understand the indepth
mechanism of algorthm let's first
understand what algarin
is the blockchain network and project
algarin was established in 2017 by MIT
computer scientist Professor Sylvio Meli
in June 2019 algo the Network's native
cryptocurrency and the main it Network
both became live the blockchain
facilitates smart contracts and as was
already mentioned focuses on increased
scalability with support for
customizable layer on blockchains the
algorith network is a public
decentralized pure proof of state
blockchain now these can be used to
build blockchains that are customized
for particular purposes according to the
initiative Financial Services
decentralized finance fintech and
institutions can all benefit greatly
from its
technology well well this reminds me do
you know which nation is the first
nation to accept digital currency to
figure out which nation is taking a step
toward future technology hang on till
the end of this video till then you can
all comment down your answers below now
let's get back to the
video so now that we have come to its
crypto algo let's understand that also
in detail the native currency of algor
algo has a total Supply cap of 10
billion coins which will be issued by
2030 each newly forced block is
accompanied by a new algo that is send
to particular algo holding wallets so
you must have at least one algo in a
non-custodial wallet to optain these
algo incentives approximately every 10
minutes this reward which offers algo
holders an apy of between 5 and 8% is
given out now due to this process you
can passively stay take the algo coin
making it one of the easiest
cryptocurrencies to earn a passive
income now that we know what is algor
let's have a look at how its foundation
was built and what projects it deals
with the algor network is funded and
expanded by the algorithm Foundation a
nonprofit corporation that was
established in
2019 additionally it contributes
significantly to blockchain governance
research and Community for instance the
foundation has provided developers with
education through University programs
and has assisted algorthm projects
within its ecosystem with accelerator
programs however the private Corporation
algorthm incorporative is in charge of
technical development Additionally the
algor foundation holds a sizable amount
of algo which it utilizes to finance its
operations now this raises the question
of what protocol algorithm primarily
follows so let's have a peek at them the
algor network asserts to address three
main problems referred to as the
blockchain
trma security scalability and
decentralization these are the three
main issues the algorithm protocol
intends to address so let's discuss them
one by
one first is
security Now the algorithm protocol is
resistant to malicious assaults which
makes it perfect for transactions keep
keeping valuable assets and developing
secure business applications it keeps
security at both the network and
consensus protocol levels and safeguards
user accounts individually second is
decentralization now algor lacks a
single point of control or centralized
Authority participating nodes in the
network verified transactions and all
nodes have an equal voice in decision
making algorthm is an extremely
decentralized system as a result so
because the selection is both random and
private anybody on the network has a
chance to be a member of the committee
of users that approves each block so
there is a no set committee and
volunteers from all over the world
administer it notes third is
scalability now the algorithm protocol
is more scalable than Bitcoin or
ethereum because it can process several
transactions per second now the
consensus protocol developed by algor
eliminates the requirement for the
computational power that Bitcoin or
ethereum uses to address cryptographic
issues well this brings us to the
staging mechanism of algorthm
algorthm employs a special proof of
stake variant known as pure proof of
stake one algo token is all that is
necessary to participate in pure proof
of
state and to help secure the network on
the contrary etherum 2.0 has a 32 ether
minimum stake requirement creating a
substantially higher entrance barrier
for consumers on the other hand a low
minimum staking requirement can
compromise network security since users
may not act ethically if they have
little money at stake in the
network so now that we know that
ethereum and algarin are closely working
with proof of stake there's a huge
rivalry competition between them so
let's see how they both actually differ
from each
other now blockchain Technologies like
algor and ethereum can be seen as Rivals
both platforms employ smart contracts
and provide the infrastructure necessary
for creating more blockchain based
projects so algor and ethereum differ
from one another primarily in the
blockchain's consensus mechanism
ethereum employs the proof of work
algorithm which needs a lot of energy
and processing power to mine new
currencies and complete transactions
ethereum is increasingly switching to
the proof of stake algorithm
the most popular kind that needs
blockchain Network uses to choose them
as validators on the other hand algor is
already using pure proof of
stake now on average a new block of
transactions can be processed on the
ethereum platform every 12 to 14 seconds
whereas algorith Network transactions
are completed more quickly in less than
4 seconds
also so now that we have covered all the
basics of algorithm let's dive deeper
and have a look at how it actually works
with proof of stake now algarin has
provided a two- layer smart contract
design since 2020 that differs
significantly from past methods and this
is how it goes now layer one is on chain
for smart contracts that carry out basic
usually transactions directly on the
blockchain now algor layer One deals
with atomic transfers or when several
parties consent to swap cash
whereas l two is offchain and is for
specific two required smart contracts
this covers two large twoo complex or
two computationally demanding smart
contracts the gist is that less complex
smart contracts which will take longer
to process operate outside the
blockchain and run on a different
platform now algor can operate more
efficiently than single layer blockchain
thanks to this architecture
algorithm uses a pure proof of stake
mechanism to validate transactions now
anyone can stake their tokens and take
part in the validation process if they
have at least one algo in their
possession the algor protocol chooses
participants to validate blocks of
transaction the possibility of selection
for each online user depends on the
number of algo tokens users receive
participation benefits for confirming
their transactions so here are the three
steps that algorithm undergoes while
working with first is proposal stage now
users become participation nodes once
they have sted and generated their
participation key algor Dr nodes serve
as the channel for communication between
these notes now the block proposal phase
then uses a verifiable random function
to choose several blog proposals while
taking into account the percentage of
each validators State the identity of
the chosen block proposer is hidden
until the new block is offered because
harmful actors cannot Target the
selected validator network security also
increases however proposer can exhibit
their vrf output with the proposed block
to demonstrate their
legitimacy then comes the second stage
this soft Bo stage participation nodes
are chosen randomly to join the sof off
vote committee after a block has been
submitted so that only one candidate can
add to the blockchain this stage screens
ideas voting power on the soft committee
is proportionate to each notes stake and
votes are utilized to choose the
proposed block with the lowest vrf
hash now because the lowest vrf hash is
an unpredictable value it will be hard
to attack the blocks proposal in
advance and then comes the last stage
certified by W stage the Integrity of
the transaction in the block from the
soft W stage will be examined by a new
committee established to look for double
spending now the block is added if the
committee accepts the work if not a new
block is chosen the current block is
rejected and the blockchain goes into
recovery mode it is a aspect of pure
proof of State consensus mechanism since
the leader who suggests a faulty block
is not subject to a slashing penalty
algorithm folks are relatively uncommon
because only one block proposal may be
certified at a given time all
transactions are then deemed as final
after the block has been added so now
that we have covered all the technical
Concepts and functionalities of
algorithm let me tell you where you can
actually buy
algorithm basically you have a wide
range of choices available when it comes
to purchasing cryptocurrencies
thankfully coinbase binance eoro Kraken
and crypto.com works wherever algorithm
is available so you may purchase
algorithm it is Speedy simple and
secure well this brings us to the end of
this video but before ending this video
let's have a look at the question I
asked you before in this video well the
first nation you to accept digital
currency is the Marshall Islands the
Republic of the Marshall Islands is a
country that Embraces emerging
Technologies to create an open Financial
system that uses blockchain
technology the sov a digital currency
will coexist with the US dollar in
circulation and support the Marshall
Islands productive participation in the
world economy first we will understand
what an avalanche network is and why it
is so special followed by what avac
crypto is used for then we will
understand the working of the Avalanche
Network and then we will look into the
benefits of the Avalanche Network and at
the end where and how to
buy so first we will understand what the
Avalanche network is so Avalanche is a
blockchain platform that can support
smart contracts and it was introduced in
2020 by aval ABS Avalanche focuses on
low prices quick transaction times and
environmental friendliness to create a
scalable blockchain system while
maintaining decentralization and
security users can build as many unique
and functional blockchains as they want
with Avalanche one must pay a monthly
subscription fee to run a blockchain on
the Avalanche coin
avac but why is Avalanche Network so
special well aval Labs estimates that
the platform can process
4,500 transactions per second compared
to about seven for Bitcoin and 14 for
ethereum additionally it can complete a
transaction in less than 3 seconds
multiple competing platforms forms will
have bottlenecks making them more
suitable for massively scalability
decentralized applications also
Avalanche is designed to address
interoperability another significant
issue currently plaguing blockchainbased
systems and is very scalable this is
accomplished by permitting communication
between blockchains within and between
subnets allowing them to complement one
another and support cross-chain value
transfers well now that we know what an
avalanche network is let's look at the
usage of avax crypto technically avax
the native token is a utility token the
currency of the Avalanche ecosystem is
avac well in other words the token is
utilized as money within the network
generally for rewards fee collection
during transactions and many other use
cases additionally it is employed for
staking avac which protects the network
then followers are rewarded with more
avac
and some users stake avac to generate
passive revenue on the network now let's
have a look at the working of the
Avalanche Network avalanche's developers
set out to find a solution to some of
the typical issues that earlier
blockchains like Bitcoin face to advance
and improve blockchain technology
continuously incompatibility scalability
and usability issues are just a few of
these and by utilizing three blockchains
Avalanche uses a novel strategy to
address the these issues according to
time to finality metrics Avalanche
claims to be the fastest smart contracts
platform in the blockchain
industry the three blockchains that make
up the Avalanche main net are xchain
this blockchain is employed for Asset
Management the Avalanche consensus
protocol is employed then comes C chain
to develop smart contracts this
blockchain is used the Snowman consensus
protocol is employed and in the end it
is pchain and this blockchain is
utilized to create smart contracts and
the protocol for snowman consensus is
used by having all nodes operate
concurrently the Avalanche consensus
protocol randomly verifies validators
transaction confirmations the goal is to
improve the likelihood that a
transaction is true or legitimate by
periodically performing random checks
the Snowman consensus protocol uses
blocks in a linear manner but otherwise
functions similarly well now that we
know the basics of the Avalanche Network
let's have a look at problems that is
solved by this network well as we
discussed before Avalanche was developed
to deal with many of the problems that
most blockchain networks have platforms
like Avalanche aim to reduce
centralization in the cryptocurrency
industry by offering an alternative to
networks like ethereum Avalanche
primarily addresses two issues
congestion scalability was a purposeful
consider ation in the creation of
avalanche Avalanche offers subsequent
transaction times on par with top tier
payment processors like PayPal and Visa
with the ability to handle up to 6,500
transactions per second with subsec
finality Avalanche is incredibly strong
and effective and second is low fees
Avalanche which many people view as
ethereum's rival outperforms ethereum
regarding gas costs avalanche's fees are
significantly less expensive than
ethereums the network charges fees for
several things including producing and
minting assets staking transaction fees
and blockchain development after these
things are done the fees are burned
permanently lowering the amount of avax
on the platform and now let's look at
some of the benefits of avalanche
Network the manner Avalanche was
constructed is mostly responsible for
its key advantages the founders of
avalanche discovered a Sol solution to
the frequent issues with blockchains by
utilizing the Network's special design
first on the list is
interoperability the trade of different
types of cryptocurrencies and data with
other platforms is only supported by a
few blockchains Avalanche makes
interoperability possible by enabling
several blockchains to exchange
information and essentially interoperate
with one another then it is scalability
for instance mining Bitcoin uses a lot
of power and processing resources and
ethereum can handle only 15 transactions
per second these restrictions make these
blockchains difficult to scale despite
their strength and great value on the
other hand Avalanche promises subsequent
transaction rates and amazing processing
capacity and was designed to be
expandable and next is
usability usability or how simple it is
to use and implement the tech technology
in many applications and use cases is
one of the issues with adopting any
technology Avalanche is gaining
popularity in the cryptocurrency world
at a rate that can compete with ethereum
and has demonstrated utility in several
situations so now that we have discussed
all the necessary Concepts around the
Avalanche Network let's see where and
how to buy
avac these are a few platforms with
illustrations of how to buy avac on that
particular platform first is uphold
followed by binance and then bit Panda
and then
gate.io hey everyone we often encounter
situations where we feel like buying our
own house but sometimes it becomes a
little too expensive but you buy it
anyway well to make that happen you need
to borrow a loan from the bank so you
put up a down payment of 20% so you can
borrow the rest of the 80% from the bank
and make the payments and if you fail to
make the payment to the bank they can
easily confiscate the house now what
exactly happens is the bank lends you
money knowing that you will pay high
interest on it and then the banks give
that interest to its lenders of course
after having their profiting charges
well a is a cryptocurrency version of
that bank so why wait let's embark on
this exhilerating adventure together but
before we dive in if you're looking to
take your career to new heights and
become a true expert in the realm of
blockchain and cryptocurrency consider
checking out our professional
certificate program in blockchain in
collaboration with I canut it's an
excellent opportunity to master key
architectural principles and develop the
skills needed to excel in this rapidly
growing field in this video you will
explore what is a and following that you
will see how exactly a came into
existence and then you will see how it
works and after that you'll see some
real life usages of a and at the end you
will explore whether it is safe or not
but before moving ahead please do
subscribe to our YouTube channel for
more such interesting videos and hit
that Bell icon so you never miss an
update from Simply learn now moving on
to what is a a is technically a
decentralized application that allows
people to lend and borrow
cryptocurrencies all without a middleman
in return for some fees a uses an
algorithm to determine the lending rates
and match the borrowers with lenders
using a smart contract smart contracts
enable these assets to be managed by a
distributed network of computers running
its software and when lenders deposit
cryptocurrency into the protocol it is
routed to a liquidity pool where it is
used to meet the demands of the
protocol's borrowers now if you're
unfamiliar with what a liquidity pool is
you can definitely see our video on
liquidity pool which will be appearing
at the top of your screen right now this
means that a users do not have to put
their trust in a certain institution or
individual to manage their money they
merely need to believe that the code
will run exactly as intended well now
that you know what a is this raises a
question of how and why it came into
existence a was founded by Stanny
kulicha who was very interested in
ethereum and how it could disrupt
traditional Finance in November of 2017
St kulich and a team of developers
released ethland in an initial coin
offering or Ico by letting users publish
loan requests and offers the intention
was to enable users to lend and borrow
cryptocurrency from one another although
ethland was an Innovative concept the
network and its Associated token Lind
lost popularity once the 2018 be Market
began lack of liquidity and the
difficulty in matching loan requests to
offers were the plat form's main
problems in 2020 eth Lind revamped its
offering and changed its name to a
switching from the Lend token to a in
the process a was redeemable for 100
Lind for every token as part of the
migration and since that movement the
group has received more than $32 million
from some of the leading Venture
capitalists in the blockchain industry
including blockchain capital and
standard crypto so now that you know the
functionality and the mod of a let me
take you through the workings of a to
make you understand how it fulfills its
motive so the first step is to submit of
a request for comment or Arc the post
should provide all the details of the
potentially final AIP when an arc is
submitted on the governance Forum as a
result the community will have the
opportunity to offer suggestions for
improvement and if a general consensus
can be reached through a community poll
to successfully submit and vote on the
AIP now following that the second step
is to create a snapshot all queries and
remarks are addressed after being placed
on the governance Forum in order to
enhance the arc to get input from the
community and choose the preferred
course a snapshot vote is advised this
quick view enables a general agreement
to be reached to increase the likelihood
that the AIP submission will succeed and
then comes the last step which is to
submit an a request for improvement
approvement or AIP a GitHub poll request
is used to submit the suggestion and the
community decides whether to approve it
moving on let me take you through some
of the real life uses of a first is
security users can stake the a erc20
token to help secure the system and
receive compensation in return second is
collateral borrowers who pledge the
native token as security for their loans
are required to pay lower costs than
those who utilize other cryptocurrencies
that are locked within the platform and
the third one is Dow a serves as the
Dow's governance token and can be used
to cast votes on proposals about the
addition of additional tokens to the
protocol platform functionality and
other uses well this was all about a but
wait one question remains unanswered is
a safe well a a decentralized money
market paves the path for a more
transparent and open Financial system a
is an intriguing dii project that
enables transparent access to funds and
services for Bitcoin users another
encouraging advancement is the a token
it gives its owners the power to change
the a protocol the procedure is
additionally safeguarded from Black Swan
situations so now this was all about a
on let's look at the concepts you will
be exploring in this topic first you
will understand what is Iota following
that you will explore for what is tangle
in iota's tangle and then you will come
across the working of Iota and iota's
architecture after that you will see
some features of iota's tangle and the
impact of Iota in real life so what is
iota's tangle iota's tangle is a
distributed Ledger that is open costree
and scalable and is made to facilitate
frictionless data and value movement the
Iota network is the backbone of iot
and is designed for the internet of
things and has low resource requirements
tamperproof data and fee-free
microtransactions the internet of
everything is a network for exchanging
money and data between devices and this
distributed Ledger is the first one
designed for it also Iota has no blocks
no miners policy which means you
validate two additional transactions
when you send an Iota transaction and
this enables Iota to get around
blockchain's financial and scalability
constraints in short Iota is positioned
to be a key player in the upcoming
Industrial Revolution by facilitating
business interactions between machines
and connecting the economies of people
and machines but this raises a question
what does the tangle stand for in iota's
tangle Well iota's network is called the
tangle it permanently documents the data
and value Exchange it guarantees that
the data is reliable and cannot be
changed or erased it's kind of a digital
Ledger that is replicated on all nodes
in an Iota Network all the data in the
tangle is stored in objects called
transactions and when a transaction is
attached to the tangle it cannot be
changed and is immutable in short it
contains the current transaction history
and is the single source of Truth so now
that you know about the basics of iotus
Tangle let me take you through the
working of it first let's make this
clear that Iota is not a blockchain it's
a dag which stands for directed a cyclic
graph dag is used to agreeing on all of
the transactions inside their tangle
though dags are similar to blockchain
they are still way faster and can scale
better seeming to be the next evolution
of blockchain
technology in Iota Network each
transaction is called a node which are
connected to each other using edges or
arcs directed stated that the graph has
a direction and the asli part states
that the graph always continues in One
Direction and never has a loop now each
node will try to point to at least two
other past nodes but you can find up to
eight once that node has two other
future nodes directed toward it it will
be a confirmed transaction and this
whole network of nodes is called tangle
and the more people use Iota the faster
it gets because you have those two nodes
pointing towards your transaction faster
but what is iota's architecture for
those transactions to take place iota's
architecture includes the following
basic components client users who send
transactions to nodes on the Iota
Network such as wallets applications and
Etc can join the tangle nodes devices
that are connected and in charge of
maintaining the tangle Integrity Iota is
a network made up of these devices
tangle the tangle stores all of its data
in objects referred to as transactions a
transaction becomes immutable and
unchangeable once it is linked to the
tangle well now that you have understood
all the concepts of iota's Tangle let me
tell you some unique features of Iota
tangle first it is highly scalable
unlike blockchain Alternatives Iota uses
a dag or directed a cyclic graph data
structure that enables transactions to
be added in parallel second is fast
transactions Iota transactions are
confirmed within minutes unlike other
cryptocurrencies whose transaction
confirmation rates depend on the crowd
third is low resource requirements as
discussed in this video Iota is designed
to enable devices to participate in a
low energy Network such as sensors
fourth is finality within seconds the
approval of genuine messages happens
extremely swiftly and effectively fifth
is zero fee transaction as we know this
is the USP of iota's tangle if it sends
one cent it receives one cent and if it
sends a million dollar it receives a
million do and sixth is distributed Iota
is a globally distributed Network that
is resilient and robust against attacks
continuing this let me take you through
the impact of Iota tangle in the real
world first is social impact the Iota
Foundation encourages the utilization of
technology to improve Society at large
it focuses on sustainability harnessing
the power of iot to manage natural
resources more efficiently an identity
introducing digital identity to people
Beyond borders and citizen Centric
governance to enable more transparent
and inclusive governance second is
global trade Iota can make it easier for
businesses governments logistic
companies and end users to work together
while fostering trust it focuses on
track and Trace sharing updates
throughout the supply chain with
Providence data from The Source Customs
and Border management update trade
certifications for International
Exchange and digital twins turn any
product container or Consignment into a
digital twin and the third one is
unifying digital identity Iota aims to
provide trust between individuals
organizations and things it focuses on
self- Sovereign identity a borderless
digital identity that anyone can verify
the identity of things identities to
allow devices to prove their
authenticity and
specifications Regulatory Compliance
digital identities that meet data
privacy regulations like gdpr hey
everyone think of a situation where a
person a with headsets wants to get an
iPad and a person B wants to get an
headset with an iPad so to reach out to
each other easily they go to a gadget
shop and sell their products to that
shop and buy the other products headset
for person B and iPad for person a there
itself well similar to this GED shop
Unis swap also serves as a platform
where you can exchange ethereum coin
with any ethereum token just by paying a
very small fee and without any
intermediaries hey everyone well in this
video you are going to explore what is
unis Swap and what is UN and I then you
will learn about its governance process
and how does Unis swab work following
that you will know how to use Unis Swap
and what are the pros and cons of Unis
Swap and at last you will know how to
invest in Unis swap so let's get started
with what Unis swap is unis swap is a
completely different kind of exchange
that uses an automatic liquidity
protocol a latest trating methodology
that is fully decentralized meaning it
isn't owned and run by a single entity
it enables peer-to-peer Market making
Unis swap is also a cryptocurrency whose
symbol is uni it enables users to trade
cryptocurrencies without any involvement
with a centralized third party the
ethereum pl platform serves as the
foundation for the unisa
blockchain which is controlled by un
owners and is completely open source
meaning that anyone can view and
contribute to the blockchain school unit
SW basically works on supply and demand
mechanisms let me show you how
on Unis swap when you exchange your
ethereum they give you a fair market
value of the basic ethereum token now
after you are done the price of basic
ethereum token Rises because there are
less of them since you bought it and
price of ethereum drops because there is
more of it since you sold it now whoever
comes next will have to buy the basic
ethereum token at a higher price or sell
some ethereum at a higher price this is
actually done to even out the liquidity
pool so that Unis swap has an even
amount of ethereum and and the basic
ethereum tokens so now that you know
what Unis swap is let me take you
through what uni
is basically the Unis swap token makes
it possible for the community and
stakeholders to own and actively manage
the protocol by aing on important
protocol updates and development
projects through an onchain governance
process un Andi holders run this
protocol
therefore anyone can earn You and I by
agreeing to not sell or trade their
crypto
Holdings but this brings the question of
what is unis swof governance process is
so the first step is the temperature
check procedure determines whether there
is enough motive to change the current
situation a majority vote with a 25k un
yes vote threshold prevails at the end
of the two days now the subject is
closed on the Govern site if the trat
check does not suggest that there should
be a change from the current situation
then if it does suggest any changes then
it is pushed to Second Step that is the
consensus check now the consensus check
procedure develops a formal conversation
surrounding a proposal and takes into
account feedback from the temperature
check another offing vote follows
consensus check and a majority vote with
the 50k un yes
threshold prevails after 5 days and then
comes the last step that is the
governance proposal the governance
process ends with the governance
proposal The Proposal comes with a
nonchain executable code and should take
into account the consensus check
suggestions a delegate must have a
minimum balance of 2 million uni in
order to submit an onene governance
proposal a majority vote with a 40m un
Andi yes vote threshold wins after a
7day voting period now that you know the
mechanism of the Unis swap platform let
me tell you how it actually works the
Unis swap platform enables the
decentralized trade of numerous
different digital assets using smart
contracts built on the blockchain
through liquidity pools which utilize
smart contracts to automatically
rebalance themselves after each trade
pairs or digital assets are exchanged
uniso is powered by two smart contracts
The Exchange contract and the factory
contract these are automatic computer
programs made to carry out particular
task when certain criterias are met in
this case the factory smart contract is
used to add new tokens to the platform
while the exchange contract handles all
token swaps or trades on the new Unis
swap version 2 platform any erc20 based
token can be exchanged for another well
this covers all the internal
functionality of of Unis swap so moving
on you will learn how to use Unis swap
well you only need an ethereum wallet
like coinbase wallet and a small amount
of eth which you'll need to pay for gas
fees in order to utilize Unis you can
access app. unis.org to begin exchanging
tokens or provide liquidity by using the
app browser included in the coin based
wallet mobile application or its desktop
browse extension moving on let me tell
you about some of its pros and
cons well it enables the decentralize
exchange of many digital assets but it
only supports the exchange of ethereum
compatible
cryptocurrencies second smart contracts
enable asset trading that may be cheaper
and more efficient but it still uses
proof of work which is an energy and
resource intensive
process Unis swap users can earn un and
I were agreeing to not sell or trade
their cryptocurrency Holdings but users
must do an eth to pay transaction
processing fee four decentralized
governance of the Unis swap platform
enables anyone to participate however
using a decentralized exchange requires
a compatible selfhosted
wallet so now comes the most important
question of this whole discussion how
can you invest in Union work
by getting un and I you can make an
investment in Unis swap using a
centralized cryptocurrency exchange like
coinbase or Kraken is the simplest way
to purchase
uni another coin like ethereum can be
used to buy uni on the Unis swap
platform is Monero so to make you
familiar with what Monero is let me give
you the example of Lena Lena is a
journalist in a surveillance heavy
country who wants to keep her financial
transactions private she's interested in
Bitcoin but knows it's not completely
Anonymous and could still be traced back
to her Bitcoin address one day Lena
comes across Monero and this discovers
that Monero is designed to priortize
privacy and security she decides to use
Monero to buy some books from an online
bookstore she sends the payment from her
Monero wallet to the provided address
which is completely private and
untraceable the bookstore confirms
receipt of the payment and ships her
books Lena is pleased with the privacy
and security of Monero and plans to use
it for all her future online
purchases now if we speak in short
Monero is an open-source privacy
oriented digital cryptocurrency that
provides users with complete privacy and
security when making a
transaction its blockchain is opic which
makes transaction details and amounts
Anonymous by obscuring the addresses
used by participants Lena story is one
just example of how Monero can be used
to protect one's Financial privacy and
Security in a world where data is
becoming more and more valuable but what
makes mono so private if getting your
learning started is half the battle what
if you could do that for free visit
skillup by simply learn click on the
link in the description to know more
well mono's privacy feature makes it
different from other cryptocurrencies in
order to provide privacy and anonymity
Monero relies on two important Concepts
still addresses and ring signatures now
stilt address with stilt addresses a
sender can create a unique public
address on behalf of the recipient for
each transaction with the recipient can
still receive all payments using a
single public address just like in
Bitcoin Monero users will generate both
a private view key and a private spend
key the private view key enables them to
view all the transaction link to the
account while the private spend key
functions similarly to a Bitcoin private
key as it authorizes payments now
talking about Ring signature ring
signatures are a cryptographic concept
that pertains to digital signatures it
allows any member of a defined group of
individuals with private keys to sign a
digital signature in Monero when you
initiate a transaction your wallet
selects a group of keys from the
blockchain and forms a ring
as a result it is impossible for an
observer to determine which key was
utilized to sign providing anonymity to
the transaction now that you know the
basics of Monero let me take you through
the process of mining
Monero now Monero is compatible with
various operating systems including
Windows Mac OS Linux Android and FreeBSD
unlike other cryptocurrencies such as
Bitcoin Monero mining doesn't require
specialized Hardware like asic's which
can be really expensive instead you can
use the CPU or GPU of a standard
computer to mind Monero Monero utilizes
proof of work mining as stated on the
company's website this algorithm is
crucial for securing crypto currencies
such as Monero by preventing issues
related to double spending that can
actually misrepresent the available
Supply now let me tell you how one can
access Monero now although many
exchanges have opted not to offer Monero
there are still places to purchase it so
if you're in the United States you can
buy Monero on crackin Q coin or binance
and another way to get Monero is to
purchase it directly from another person
on the decentralized peer-to-peer
platform bisque exchange or you can
simply use binance to do the
exchanges

first you will understand what is basic
attention token following that the
working of bad after that you will
understand how to use basic attention
token and then you will learn how you
can earn bat rewards and at the end you
will see what is basic attention token
used for so without any further Ado
let's get started with what is basic
attention
token the ethereum network serves as the
foundation for the decentralized open
source basic attention token digital
advertising ecosystem some of the topics
addressed by the project in relation to
Internet advertising include data
security data ownership and consumer
benefit its goal is to create an honest
transparent and Equitable system
advertisers will be able to Target users
directly and reward them with tokens for
the attention with the help of bat in
contrast to traditional advertising
systems that use personal data to Target
ads bat uses a blockchain based system
that allows users to opt into anonymous
at targeting users can choose to view
relevant advertisements without having
their personal information shared with
advertisers B prioritizes your privacy
and gives you back control over your
data this raises the question of how bat
is able to do this well the ethereum
blockchain serves as the basic attention
tokens Foundation as we know its
creators have collaborated with the
brave browser to implement the
Innovative advertising strategy Brave
has implemented the basic attention
metric or bam attention measuring system
it uses an anonymous Ledger system to
distribute money between readers content
creators and advertisers in fact it
brings them together for so many reasons
for example any content creator can
publish their post on their website now
advertisers offer a certain number of
basic attention tokens for ads Bas on
their content after that they will reach
an agreement based on the attention
score on the basis of user engagement it
basically means that ads are more
tailored to users and give the
advertisers the window of profit
ensuring that brave users see well
tailored ads while it also improves
speed privacy and security of the
browser so now that you have understood
the functioning of basic attention token
let me tell you how you can use a basic
attention token now because payments of
made in the form of tokens there are
numerous opportunities for seamless use
the first is to donate them to publisher
and other content creator this could
even include providing premium content
to donors these tokens can also be used
to purchase digital products such as
data services on the brave platform
itself now how exactly to earn these
batter rewards now the first step is to
download the brave browser you can then
sign up for brave rewards by clicking on
the triangle next the search bar and
then you can now start earning bat
tokens simply by viewing advertisements
now advertisements appear as background
images push notification or cards in
your news feed which is the second step
they are not included in videos or
pop-ups making the experience seamless
and unobtrusive so now that you have
understood the basics let me tell you
the usage of
bat first is advertising The Advertiser
in in this case provides the tokens that
will be distributed to those who view
their advertisements users who choose to
participate in Bat rewards are also a
part of this advertising ecosystem they
are compensated with tokens for each
advertisement they watch based on the
amount of time and attention they devote
to it second is tipping now bat makes it
simple to Express gratitude to your
favorite content creators you can use
your tokens to tip internet users such
as twitch streamers YouTubers and
Twitter users this Fosters a passionate
community of users and creators allowing
for the creation of better content and
third is special access bat can also be
used to allow content creators to create
exclusive content for users who tip or
pay them thus free and paid content can
coexist in a unified ecosystem this also
enables creators to give back to their
communities by creating exclusive
content for those who actually support
them but before diving right into the
list let's have a quick and crisp
understanding of what crypto trading
actually means so taking a financial on
the price direction of individual
cryptocurrencies against the dollar or
against any other cryptocurrency is what
crypto trading is all about cfds or
contract for difference are a popular
way of trading cryptocurrencies because
they offer more flexibility leverage and
the ability to trade both long and short
positions also it's essential to
consider things like supported assets
fees payment methods and security when
considering a cryptocurrency trading
platform so we have also considered
these factors to give you a better idea
of which platform will be the best for
you so now that we have a basic idea of
