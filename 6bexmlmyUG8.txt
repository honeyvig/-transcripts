1
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,719
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,480
tutorial my name is Henry bakshi and

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,240
this time we're going to be going over

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,039
how you can use neural networks to play

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,160
a game in Swift and this time it's a

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,960
game called Nimble ninja and now first

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,800
of all before I continue I'd like to say

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,439
a big thank you to Michael leech Michael

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,359
leech is a uh I developer uh and he has

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,800
created a game uh that uses Sprite kit

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,160
and Swift for iOS uh and essentially is

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,480
a game called Nimble ninja so now let me

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,520
explain the concept of this game to you

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,760
to begin so first of all uh we have a

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,399
sort of platform all right we have a

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,800
platform here and we have a character

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,840
here uh who has eyes and a mouth okay so

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,520
he's a he's a character he's essentially

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,199
the ninja here H and we have obstacles

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,480
in front of him now it's not like your

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,359
classic game where you have to jump over

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,880
the obstacles instead here there are

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,240
obstacles underneath as well and they

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,640
don't just alternate like this like if I

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,000
were to do this they don't just

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,920
alternate like this what happens is it's

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,479
completely random which is the best part

28
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:20,520
so I mean by complete Randomness you

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,240
could have three in a row like this for

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,960
example all right uh you could also then

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,280
have like two more this could be some

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,119
sort of example game all right this is

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,439
sometimes how the game could play out

34
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,040
it's completely random and that's the

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,680
best part about it so this is

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,920
essentially the game and so in order to

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
dodge this obstacle now first of all

38
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,520
this obstacle is coming at this uh

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,799
person uh or the ninja and so

40
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,920
essentially what happens is when you

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560
click on the screen anywhere on the

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,920
screen this ninja is going to flip

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,439
around over

44
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,680
here all right so he's going to flip

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
around then he's going to continue

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
running the obstacle will go above him

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
now once this obstacle starts coming at

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,440
him then he's going to flip over again

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,280
uh and uh and so he's going to dodge

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,520
that obstacle and he's going to keep

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
doing that whenever an obstacle is

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
beside him uh so that he can dodge the

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,360
obstacles up and down that's essentially

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,680
how the game works so now I'd like to

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,319
sort of get into how my part of this

56
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,040
game works now first of all this is

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,959
actually a pretty interesting gamees uh

58
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,519
game for a human to play all right so

59
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:30,560
now

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,959
humans are good at this but I've made a

61
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,160
modification to the game and this

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,000
modification incorporates speed so

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,080
obstacles over time come at you faster

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
and faster and faster every second they

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,480
get faster and essentially what this

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,200
allows me to do is add another level of

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,959
Challenge and so after about like

68
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,000
120 it becomes almost impossible for a

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,480
human to play maybe even 140 it becomes

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,840
impossible almost impossible at least

71
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,360
your brain that we're mapping out onto a

72
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,760
computer on a much much smaller scale

73
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
because of course your brain has

74
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,480
trillions upon trillions of neurons You

75
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,560
couldn't possibly you know simulate that

76
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,040
on a computer even the world's fastest

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,919
uh supercomputer can only emulate uh

78
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,720
around like a worm siiz brain not even

79
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,840
yet uh and so of course neural networks

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,199
do take a lot of computational power but

81
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,520
I will be getting into why the iPhone 7

82
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,680
handles this amazingly in just a

83
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,639
bit so now let's take an example of a

84
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,680
neural network so now let's say you

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,880
wanted to create a brain and this brain

86
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,199
could essentially count up okay so you

87
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,000
give it a b a four bit binary uh sort of

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
number and it'll give you the next

89
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,840
binary number so let's say we have our

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,479
inputs so this is a neuron whenever I

91
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:56,240
draw this sort of Big O I mean that this

92
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,639
is a

93
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,919
neuron just like in your brain these are

94
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,840
on so they might not look like them but

95
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
they are and so let's say you give it

96
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,440
the input as binary

97
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
0

98
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
0

99
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,280
0 1 now if you don't know this is 4 bit

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,840
binary and this would mean one okay this

101
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,000
is in 10 bit one so now uh essentially

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
uh what's going to happen is let's say

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,440
we have some more neurons now we of

104
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,720
course want to have output

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,039
neurons

106
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,680
these output neurons will be able to

107
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,280
give us our output which in this case is

108
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,759
going to be 0 0 1

109
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,560
0 but how do we go from input to Output

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,000
do we just connect these and do

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,639
calculations and do extremely Advanced

112
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,199
calculations between them in order to

113
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,039
find out how to add a number no but

114
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,600
you're close what we do is we add

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,560
another layer of neurons and this layer

116
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,039
is called the hidden layer so first of

117
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
all this is called the input

118
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,240
layer this is called the output

119
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,000
layer and now we're going to add

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,599
something called The

121
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,520
Hidden

122
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,199
layer the hidden layer is essentially

123
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,919
what does all of the processing now

124
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,440
again there can actually be multiple

125
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
hidden layers but I'll get back I'll get

126
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,560
back to that in just a bit so let's say

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,440
we have six hidden neurons so we have

128
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,280
one 2 3 4 five and six okay so we have

129
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,960
six hidden neurons

130
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,639
now this input neuron this specific

131
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,440
input neuron the first input neuron will

132
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,759
be connected to every single hidden

133
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,240
neuron now if you're wondering how it's

134
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,680
connected it's connected using something

135
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,039
called a synapse I'll explain this in

136
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,080
just a second so now of course every

137
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,000
other input neuron is also going to be

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,759
connected to every other hidden neuron

139
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,680
or res said every other neuron in the

140
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,960
hidden

141
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,639
layer and so if I just finish this

142
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,360
diagram really

143
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,120
quickly as you can see every input layer

144
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
neuron is connected to every other

145
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,720
hidden layer neuron so essentially

146
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,080
what's happening is these are called

147
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,840
synapses what are connecting these

148
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,360
neurons now these synapses do a

149
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,919
calculation okay now essentially what's

150
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,800
happening is it's let's say this neuron

151
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,919
it takes the zero and it passes it on to

152
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,960
every single synapse that it has

153
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,879
connected to it and those synapses will

154
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,919
do a c a very SM small and minor

155
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,759
calculation on them and then they'll

156
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,360
send that that like this uh this neuron

157
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,440
let's say it's going through the first

158
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,240
synapse it's going to send it to the

159
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,479
first hidden layer neuron now this

160
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,319
neuron is going to receive input from

161
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,159
lots of these other four neurons as well

162
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,960
and so it's going to take all of those

163
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,680
four inputs from the input layer from

164
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,479
the synapsis and it's going to do a

165
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,599
calculation on those and then pass it on

166
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,280
again through synapses and all of these

167
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,840
neurons will do that with the

168
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,560
corresponding inputs that they were

169
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,840
given now if you're thinking that hey

170
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,960
wouldn't all these neurons get the same

171
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,360
input though well no because the

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,680
synapses between these between like

173
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,159
let's say uh this neuron and this neuron

174
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,039
or this neuron and this neuron are

175
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,599
completely different weights by weights

176
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,879
I mean how heavy the calcul calculations

177
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,720
are how big the calculations are are

178
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,039
they very minor sort of really um sort

179
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,320
of really sort of minor calculations uh

180
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,000
like fine-tuned calculations or are they

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
major calculations that make the number

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,760
a lot bigger or a lot smaller that's

183
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,240
essentially the weight and then from the

184
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,399
hidden layer they go right back to the

185
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,760
output layer and so essentially of

186
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,200
course we are connecting every single

187
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,320
hidden uh neuron

188
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,959
uh in this layer to the output

189
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,800
sorry to the outputs

190
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,399
um so what's happening here is again we

191
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,880
are connecting to these neurons using

192
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,800
these

193
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,519
synapses now these synapses will again

194
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,760
do another calculation on the uh on the

195
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,519
number that they were given from the

196
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,120
hidden

197
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,040
neuron and then finally now I know this

198
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,920
is taking some time because this is

199
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,600
exactly how complex a neur actually is

200
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,360
in a computer as well so as you can see

201
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,880
this is essentially our architecture if

202
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,360
you will of how the ne network will work

203
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,480
now again every connection has a weight

204
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,040
every neuron has a weight every synapse

205
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,920
again has a weight and the output

206
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,560
neurons have a weight as well and once

207
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,760
everything comes together and all these

208
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,920
calculations are completed you'll have a

209
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,440
final output and this is all done within

210
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,880
milliseconds so we're essentially using

211
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,720
exactly what your human brain does as

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm talking my brain is implementing a

213
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,000
very very very similar technique except

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,360
on a much larger scale with trillions

215
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,519
upon trillions of neurons and that's how

216
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,839
I'm generating the speech quite ironic

217
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,760
but uh essentially now to begin when you

218
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,640
initialize this neural network the

219
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,279
weights on the synapses and the neurons

220
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,560
are going to be completely random and

221
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,640
your output will be absolutely random as

222
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,440
well complete gibberish not useful

223
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
whatsoever okay now you may by a

224
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,920
completely random chance get the perfect

225
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,200
random weights and good output but

226
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,959
that's a very very small chance so now

227
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
how would we actually get this to give

228
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,720
us useful output this is how what we' do

229
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
is we'd say okay you gave me this output

230
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,639
but I expected this output you give it

231
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,600
that positive example and tell it what

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,880
it did was wrong so what's going to

233
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,519
happen is it's going to put a technique

234
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,720
called back propagation into play and

235
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,360
what's going to happen is it's going to

236
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,680
take that output that it was supposed to

237
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,279
give and sort of make that act as input

238
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,959
and see how like let's say we were to uh

239
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,440
give this uh run in Reverse if we were

240
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,639
to give it okay so let's say it okay

241
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,320
sorry I'm going all over the place but

242
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,839
let's say your random neural network

243
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,639
gives you uh 1 1

244
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,720
01 okay as your output but this is

245
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
completely wrong wrong all right we do

246
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,959
not want this all right but we do want

247
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,680
this we do want this output

248
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,360
though so what's going to happen is

249
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,040
you're going to say okay let's say that

250
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
we took this and ran it backwards

251
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,240
through the neural network and wanted to

252
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,399
get exactly this how would we do it

253
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,680
what's going to happen is it's going to

254
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,000
send us back and it's going to adjust

255
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,279
the calculations ever so slow ly in

256
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,160
these neurons in these synapses in these

257
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,079
other neurons and in these synapses and

258
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,279
if it doesn't get this output it'll do

259
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,600
that again in a very small fashion over

260
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,480
and over and over again until it reaches

261
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,639
this input or very very close to in this

262
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,360
input how far it is from this input is

263
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,920
called the error rate you can make the

264
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,800
error rate to be as small as you want or

265
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
to be as big as you want in this case

266
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,720
since we want this to be as accurate as

267
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,360
possible we're going to give it an error

268
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,639
rate of

269
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,560
0.01 now of course that may take hours

270
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,480
days maybe even like a week to train

271
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
depending on your training set and how

272
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,240
exactly accurate you'd like it to be but

273
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,839
it shouldn't be a

274
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,040
problem because of course I mean it does

275
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,880
pay off in the end you have an extremely

276
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,360
useful counter and of course this is

277
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
only four bit you could apply this to

278
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
many more bits or even to much more

279
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,440
useful calculations rather than just an

280
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,600
Adder But continuing though so now we

281
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,560
have this neural network and we have

282
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,279
this back propagating from many many

283
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,199
like for many different outputs and

284
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,040
that's essentially our training data

285
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,800
then we have our test data which checks

286
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,839
the error rate and if it's too high

287
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,240
it'll try to bring the error rate down

288
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,160
by back propagating over and over again

289
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,480
but this still I mean you kind of have

290
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,680
to admit that why would this be useful

291
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,279
we can just do plus equals 1 plus plus

292
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,839
or like equals to this plus one you

293
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,279
really don't need this type of neural

294
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,639
network but what you do need is for a

295
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,839
neural network to do something much more

296
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:29,760
advanced

297
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
that you can't just write a massive

298
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,240
function for let's take a look at that

299
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,440
so now let's just say that we don't use

300
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,199
this neural network right we're not

301
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,680
going to be implementing this but this

302
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,920
was a pretty nice example of how a

303
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,720
neural network actually works so let's

304
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,120
just take this off the board so now what

305
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,720
is what are we going to be doing in this

306
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,600
video now if you haven't already gotten

307
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,040
the clue we're going to be mixing Nimble

308
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,079
ninja with n networks they a bot that

309
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,120
can play the game almost infinitely

310
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,480
let's take a look so now as you can see

311
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,880
what I'm going to do is let's say uh we

312
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,800
have our game all right so of course we

313
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,160
have a little platform we have our

314
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,160
person here with his eyes and his nose

315
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,880
and a mouth and we have our obstacles

316
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,120
all

317
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,240
right now let's see what parameters we

318
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,160
have now if we were to feed some sort of

319
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,519
data from the game into the Neal Network

320
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,600
what would the data be okay so let's see

321
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,160
we have the current speed at which this

322
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,199
uh which the obstacles are running

323
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,720
towards the ninja so we have the

324
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,880
speed that's one of our

325
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,920
parameters we have I don't know the x

326
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,440
value of the nearest

327
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,759
obstacle and that's pretty much it

328
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,279
actually uh for this game I mean there

329
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,440
are a few more like the X obstacle uh

330
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,040
the x value for the OB for the obstacle

331
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,600
on the opposite side

332
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,759
but I'm not going to get into that

333
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,040
because that could get a little bit

334
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,600
complicated with the training so I'm not

335
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,240
going to get into that just

336
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,320
yet uh in fact I'm actually not even

337
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
going to get into the speed today all I

338
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,959
care about is the x value of that

339
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,759
obstacle let's take a look at what I

340
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,320
mean now let's say we have a neural

341
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,880
network with one input no more inputs

342
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,199
just one input then we have a hidden

343
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,360
layer okay now this isn't just these

344
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,360
many neurons we have a hidden layer of

345
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,240
300

346
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,839
neurons and so this input layer will

347
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,880
connect to each and every single one of

348
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,079
these neurons and there of which there

349
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,040
are like

350
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,120
300 okay and then we have one output

351
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,000
from which each neuron will connect two

352
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,759
again so essentially we have 300 Hidden

353
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,199
one input one output now how would this

354
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,639
work so our input is the x value of the

355
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,120
closest obstacle and our output is

356
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,720
whether to not whether or not to flip to

357
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,600
flip or not to

358
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:17,399
flip if it is over if this output value

359
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,440
is greater than

360
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,480
0.99 we consider that yes we do want to

361
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,680
flip if it's less than 0.9 99 then it's

362
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,920
a no we do not want to flip our

363
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
character and that is essentially how

364
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,120
it's going to work but what's going to

365
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,880
happen is I'm going to play this as far

366
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,000
as I can without it getting too fast and

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,079
right as I stop playing or right as I

368
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,519
lose the neural network will kick in so

369
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,839
essentially while I'm playing I've

370
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,920
created uh I've edited the code a little

371
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,360
bit of this game actually quite a bit uh

372
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,120
and so essentially it's going to collect

373
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,480
data of how I play and it'll clean up

374
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,759
the data and sort of it'll organize that

375
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,240
data after that it's going to use uh the

376
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
an API from Colin Hundley is GitHub will

377
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,400
be in the description as well as Michael

378
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,160
leeches and so essentially uh it uses an

379
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,760
API from Colin Hundley called Swift AI

380
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,720
which has a neural network library

381
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,520
essentially a neural network neural

382
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,760
network API and so it's going to feed

383
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,600
that data into the neural network then

384
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,439
the neural network will back propagate

385
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,400
back propagate back propagate train

386
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,000
train train test test test until it

387
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,480
reaches an error rate of under

388
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,559
0.01 once it reaches that error rate we

389
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,360
know that we're ready to let the neural

390
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,520
network play the neural network will

391
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,080
then run into action and it should be

392
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,400
able to play almost infinitely unless it

393
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,679
gets fast to the point that it's unable

394
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,760
to like it doesn't even appear on screen

395
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,039
it gets that fast which I could solve

396
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,400
technically by creating a maximum speed

397
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,679
but for the first version this is pretty

398
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,720
good

399
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,280
anyway though so this is essentially how

400
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,919
our final application is going to work

401
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,480
it looks like a simplification here but

402
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,440
trust me it's not this simple but I'm

403
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,480
here to make it simple for you so I hope

404
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,600
that by the end of this you'll either a

405
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,120
be able to implement this into uh this

406
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,919
Nimble ninja game by yourself or B be

407
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,360
able to implement it into your own game

408
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,120
in fact I'm working on implementing this

409
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,120
neuron Network technique to much much

410
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,720
more advanced games uh hint apple

411
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,960
picking uh but anyway you'll be seeing

412
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,720
more of that on my YouTube channel later

413
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,440
but for now this is what I'm going to be

414
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,159
explaining to you hope you like this

415
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,440
part again thank you very much uh but

416
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,520
now the rest will be explained in part

417
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,039
two when I explain to you how you can

418
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,200
use these neural networks to play Nimble

419
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,559
