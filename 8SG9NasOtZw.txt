1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,149
so lower and welcome to the tutorial my

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,890
name is Henry Bakshi and this time we're

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,569
gonna be going over something printing

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,970
you and before I continue I'm just going

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,040
to recommend that this tutorial is

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,370
slightly based off of my postfix and

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,430
infix evaluating tutorial so I actually

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,039
created a video for that and so I'd

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,080
recommend you check that out down in the

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,710
description

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,420
it'll be really helpful if you just

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,849
watch that then watch this because it's

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,970
slightly based off of it and yeah that's

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,769
pretty much it anyway continuing today

15
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,719
I'm going to be explaining how you could

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,180
evaluate straight up in fix expressions

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,020
using Swift so let's get started and so

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,540
this method is basically instead of

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,640
converting to post tricks than solving

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,780
the postfix just solve as you go through

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,820
the equation essentially so let's get

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,770
started and I'll explain exactly how it

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,379
works while we move on so let's get

24
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,390
started to end so now first thing what

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,260
I'm gonna do is I'm going to take some

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,220
sort of random expression like maybe

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:16,610
something like 1 plus 2 2 times 4 plus 5

28
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,420
now this is a pretty interesting

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,400
equation the reason I didn't just put 3

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,799
here's because windows 2 is 3 anyway so

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,100
it's a really more informative if we do

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,329
this way ok let's continue so again

33
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,100
we're going to be using stacks for this

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,619
and so again this is going to be a

35
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,280
quicker way to do this since once we

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,229
reach an operator it's going to solve

37
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,200
whatever was behind it as long as it can

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,329
with bed mass rules again I couldn't

39
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,170
find this on Wikipedia online in general

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,200
so I'm assuming since I couldn't find it

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,390
no no no one has screen a tutorial on

42
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,909
this yet but if you can find a name for

43
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,290
this algorithm please do tell me in the

44
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,820
comments or you can even email me at Tai

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,100
Chi mini at gmail.com and I email will

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,409
also be down in the description anyway

47
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,259
continuing let's start solving this

48
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,379
expression so first of all let's number

49
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,350
these characters so the

50
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,380
one is zero this plus is one actually

51
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,380
which right is a bit bigger zero this is

52
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,580
the one

53
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,970
and so then Oh actually that's two

54
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,690
erases and I'm where to where I didn't

55
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,790
read so you can clearly tell the

56
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,670
distinct difference so now is it going

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:39,890
to be a zero this is a 1 this is a 2 3

58
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,150
so this one is the zeroth character in

59
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,490
the expression this plus is the first

60
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,750
this 2 is the second this times is the

61
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,170
third this fourth is the fourth this

62
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,080
pick this plus is the fifth and this v

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,910
is the sixth and so let's get started

64
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,130
and so now what I'm going to be doing is

65
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,110
we're going to be solving if you use Dax

66
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,300
let's get started and so first thing

67
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,610
what we do is in Swift we split this

68
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,130
into an array it's separated by each

69
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,620
space so that we have each and every is

70
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,100
a little token then what we do is we

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,780
just loop through that entire tokens

72
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,250
array and start solving so let's get

73
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,890
started over here and so let's just say

74
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,810
first of all we have one stack in black

75
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:43,200
one stack good so this is one stack that

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,810
we have I'm going to make one more stack

77
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,270
for our operators it's already starting

78
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,080
to look quite a lot like my other

79
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,580
tutorial however this is where the twist

80
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,460
comes in instead of converting than

81
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,440
solving again this will convert and

82
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,990
solve at the same time and then whatever

83
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,380
is left it'll solve so let's get started

84
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,770
and first we have a 1 again whenever you

85
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,110
find a number in this expression just

86
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,750
add it to the operand stack so in order

87
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,030
to differentiate between these this is

88
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,670
the operand stack or the number stack

89
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,930
and this is the operator stack there's

90
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,360
no other really name for it stack

91
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,320
perfect so this is the operand stack

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,780
this is the operator stack so when we

93
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,360
see a 1 over here we just immediately

94
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
say that okay we're gonna take one and

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,900
push it in here now what we're gonna do

96
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,580
is we're gonna see a plus and since

97
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,080
there's nothing in here there's no

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,090
things for us to do so we just push the

99
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,700
plus onto our stack so we write a plus

100
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,970
inside here perfect then we have a 2

101
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,370
again this will just go straight into

102
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,900
our operand stack now here's where

103
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,400
something comes in we seen other times

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,290
now let me explain something called

105
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,090
priority 2 now as you can see we have

106
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:24,150
times divide add and subtract now we

107
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,160
split these into two parts and so

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,970
multiplication and division have the

109
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,020
priority of 0 addition subtraction of

110
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,150
the priority of 1 and so these actually

111
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,100
you know what it's a little bit

112
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,810
confusing for someone just to see it

113
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,510
like that so I'm gonna get spaced out so

114
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,389
there's going to be

115
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,750
times which has a priority of zero me

116
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,419
has the highest priority and there's

117
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,819
also divide which also has a priority of

118
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,840
zero so it also has the highest priority

119
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,789
addition not so much it has the least

120
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,199
priority and so does subtraction

121
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,379
perfects so now that you know that I can

122
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:14,500
explain the rule to you the rule is that

123
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,180
because we want to take a look at this

124
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,620
operator so we have a times currently

125
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,969
that's what we're on okay in our stack

126
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:30,349
our stacks peak which is our plus which

127
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,830
is the highest element in the stack is a

128
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,949
plus so we note down the priorities for

129
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,930
each four times zero for addition it's 1

130
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:50,029
now when you can see that this number

131
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:57,379
over here 1 is greater than zero so we

132
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,990
can say that we will not be popping out

133
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,279
however for example if it's priority or

134
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,370
zero we would be popping out the plus

135
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,289
and doing some more stuff however I'm

136
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:10,580
going to be explaining that in just a

137
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,979
minute so now we know we're not going to

138
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,199
be doing any popping we just add the

139
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,969
times to our snack perfect so now we see

140
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,759
a four and so we just put a four onto

141
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,250
our operand stack perfect then we see a

142
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,080
plus and now this is where the twist

143
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,529
comes in as you can see this is

144
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,240
basically just like my other tutorial

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,439
we're just building up some postfix

146
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,659
however now that it sees this operator

147
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,779
no not because it's the last however

148
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:52,039
because it's priority is greater than

149
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,409
the one that's in the peak of the stack

150
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:57,949
so as you can see we're currently on

151
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,870
this plus

152
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,610
and we're not on this tines we're

153
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:08,030
currently on the plus ok so we note down

154
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,500
the plusses priority which we know is

155
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,470
one and we note down the times priority

156
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,610
which is zero so now we know that 0 is

157
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,750
less than 1 so what we do is we come

158
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,940
over here and we and we pop the x out of

159
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,830
our stack then we pop out the floor and

160
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,870
then we pop out the two okay then we put

161
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,909
them to the side and we said okay what's

162
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,279
for the operator and then two equal to

163
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:48,710
well we know that it is eight so what we

164
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,839
do is we take that eight and push it

165
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,420
onto our operand stack perfect so now

166
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,500
what we can do is again we see that I'm

167
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,180
not going to erase this because we're

168
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,010
still on this because we see there's

169
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,760
still something in our operator stack so

170
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,010
this actually has the same priority

171
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,050
because plus and plus both have a

172
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,110
priority of one so this is equal to one

173
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,480
that means still that we will pop out

174
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,110
and add so what I'm going to do is I'm

175
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,860
going to pop this plus out of our stack

176
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,450
I'm going to pop out our eight from the

177
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,170
stack I'm going to pop out the one from

178
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,140
our stack then what I want to do is I

179
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,610
again I'm going to put them to the side

180
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,370
and again we're done this I'm just going

181
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,660
to keep that there so you know we've

182
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,089
done that and then so we have 8 plus 1

183
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:48,050
which will be equal to 9 and so we put a

184
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,230
9 into our operand stack and then we see

185
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,230
ok there's a plus and so we just put in

186
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,420
a plus onto our operators that operator

187
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,120
stack because of course that needs to go

188
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,600
there no matter what then we see a 5 so

189
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,459
we're going to put it onto our operand

190
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,360
stack now we realize that the question

191
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,880
is over so a few remaining operators

192
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,800
that are in this

193
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,930
that we're going to apply here just like

194
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,180
we didn't postfix just no not exactly

195
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,070
so we see a plus right so what we do

196
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,740
where we pop out with plus we pop out

197
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,130
the 9 you pop out the 5 and you say

198
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:35,310
what's five plus nine and so it is 14

199
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,670
and so it'll push 14 onto our auburn

200
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,640
stack and then once we're done

201
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,529
completely there's nothing left in the

202
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:46,690
operator stack we can just pop out this

203
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,490
value and return it and so our answer we

204
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,730
know will leave 14 so it's a really

205
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,700
basic method of how this works and now

206
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,220
that you know exactly how this works I'm

207
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,089
going to give you one more example

208
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,450
before we do go to the Mac part let's do

209
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:23,470
something like yeah let's do some

210
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,240
subtraction this times right

211
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,050
let's do subtraction so something like

212
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:43,209
five plus two minus four perfect no but

213
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:47,910
I can do draw this out nicely for you

214
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:56,620
five plus four and so this is the zero

215
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,660
with character is the first character

216
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,630
the second character this is the third

217
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,680
character and this is the fourth

218
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,180
character perfect and actually since

219
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,070
this is actually a little bit hard to

220
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,050
distinguish if this is actually a number

221
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,260
or character number I'm gonna try it in

222
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,300
red so again this is the zero is the

223
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,640
first second third

224
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,589
that's the fourth the reason I'm

225
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:26,329
actually telling you these character

226
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,370
numbers and you'll see is in the Mac

227
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,800
part there's a little extra feature in

228
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,540
this app that I will be showing you that

229
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,300
requires these characters numbers anyway

230
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,339
let's solve this now first of all I'm

231
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,279
gonna draw stack so I'm just going to

232
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:52,579
say stack one stack two wrong okay so

233
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,920
first of all we see a five and you push

234
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,690
it onto our operand stack perfect

235
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,880
then you take a plus and we add it onto

236
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,480
our operators back then we see it - we

237
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,440
put it onto our operand stack we see a -

238
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,070
now we start so the minuses priority and

239
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,279
the pluses priority are the same since

240
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,220
they're the same we just do this you pop

241
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,029
out the plus you pop out the - they pop

242
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:36,740
out the five we do 5 minus 2 and we know

243
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,459
oh it's so plus 2 sorry and so we know

244
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,910
that this will be 7 so what we can do is

245
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,040
just push a 7 on to our operand stack

246
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,649
then again this - has to go into our

247
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,519
operator stack and then we see a 4 so I

248
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,649
can just put it onto our operand stack

249
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,160
now that we're done we see a - and so

250
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,980
since it's a - what we do we pop it out

251
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,720
of our operator stack we pop the 4 out

252
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,060
we pop the 7 out and then we see okay

253
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:19,130
what is 7 minus 4 well this is going to

254
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,920
be equal to 3 now that we know that we

255
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,480
can push it back in here and then we see

256
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,089
oh this is empty the operator stack is

257
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,060
anything so you just pop this out return

258
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,589
it and we have our answer which is the

259
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:35,879
correct answer which is 3

260
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,739
those are two really quick examples of

261
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,319
how that worked and so actually further

262
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:42,999
to tell you this I actually thought of

263
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,699
this algorithm while I actually suck

264
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,730
nose up punching calculators where you

265
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,739
can basically type five plus four plus

266
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:54,369
this plus that and it solves it why like

267
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:57,639
while you type I was really confused on

268
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,389
how it would just actually be able to

269
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,669
solve it without knowing mean to our

270
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,230
question without knowing that there's

271
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,679
something ahead that has higher bidness

272
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,699
but since I have I've seen many of these

273
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:15,579
I've worked with them I was able to

274
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,769
estimate what sort of algorithm would be

275
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:19,839
after a bit of tweaking it worked and

276
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,399
I'm creating this video so now we're

277
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,569
gonna be going to the Mac part in which

278
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:23,980
I will explain my entire code a

279
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,410
playground and also a slight app that

280
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,929
I've created again I haven't really

281
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,089
created a framework for yet but I will

282
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,549
be making one and it will be available

283
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:34,329
available for download down in the

284
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,730
description and it can also handle

285
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,069
brackets basically it'll just solve

286
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:42,309
brackets for you it'll actually know

287
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,639
it'll sold the bracket and instead of

288
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,959
having the bracket there it'll put a

289
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,299
dancer there and then it's maybe becomes

290
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:50,889
much easier to solve so that's how that

291
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:51,369
works

292
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:57,669
and yeah let's get to the Mac part so

293
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:59,379
welcome back to the Mac part now we're

294
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,209
going to be going over the code and as

295
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,759
you can see I have actually brought this

296
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,889
little panel closer to the codes and you

297
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,709
can actually see the equation and also

298
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,790
the answer pretty much close together so

299
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,449
let's get started with this specific

300
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:19,539
equation two plus four plus five minus

301
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:22,449
three times two plus seven pretty long

302
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,339
and the answer in this case should be

303
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,399
okay let's take this out so three times

304
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,129
two we know that's six then we can do it

305
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,589
in anywhere you want so six plus seven

306
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,399
for example 13 five minus 13 we could do

307
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,600
eight for that and then so four plus 80

308
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,269
2000 be 12 and then I'm two so this

309
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,509
should be around 14 for the answer so

310
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:47,730
now let's put this into

311
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,399
our little contraption actually you know

312
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,170
what that wasn't such a good idea anyway

313
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,970
so let's put this into our little code

314
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,380
and so 2 plus 4 plus 5 minus 3 2 plus 4

315
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:04,530
plus 5 minus 3 times 2 plus 7 so let's

316
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,069
see what this program gives us and the

317
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,660
answer is 12 maybe I had an error in my

318
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,240
calculations but this is the correct

319
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,069
answer because I have tested this out

320
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,740
and it is completely correct so let's

321
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,549
just test this out 6 plus 5 so that

322
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:26,250
would be around 11 11 minus 6 we know

323
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:33,380
that would be around 5 5 plus 7 would be

324
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,990
12 perfect so this is 12 and so I had an

325
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,540
error in my calculation sorry but anyway

326
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,160
we know that the correct answer is 12

327
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,330
and so our program is pretty accurate

328
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,010
and so again as I said in the whiteboard

329
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,340
parts this program does work with

330
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,580
brackets I have coded it to place all

331
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,100
brackets with their answer and so ever

332
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,520
to give it something like 12 plus 10

333
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,520
divided by 2 as you can see it will give

334
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,610
17 however if I put brackets around 12

335
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,830
plus 10 it will give us 11 and this is

336
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,929
the correct answer because 12 plus 10

337
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,660
that's 22 divided by 2 that should be 11

338
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,940
however if we do it this way it's going

339
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,460
to be 12 plus 10 divided by 2 and 10

340
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,600
divided by 2 is 5

341
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,540
so 12 plus 5 which is 17 which is the

342
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,669
correct answer as well so the brackets

343
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,110
in this case do make a difference and

344
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,910
that's how they work in case you don't

345
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,590
understand what I mean by replace the

346
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,110
brackets well this is what I mean if we

347
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,790
go up here as you can see my bracket

348
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,669
logic this is the original little

349
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:44,400
expression here with the brackets and

350
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,980
stuff after my simplification process it

351
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,400
is this 22 divided by 2 and that's how

352
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,230
that works

353
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,130
anyway now continuing let's take a look

354
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,830
at the code now now again as I said it

355
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,570
would be extremely helpful if you would

356
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,070
just go

357
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,409
watch the original postfix tutorial

358
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,980
because there I always explain stacks I

359
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,549
explain most that sort of stuff and so

360
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,720
it would be really helpful if you would

361
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,809
just check that out and then so you will

362
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:16,250
also find out how I calculate the

363
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,490
precedents and stuff like that anyway

364
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,889
and also one more thing before we

365
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:23,809
continue first of all what I'm gonna do

366
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:26,389
is I'm going to expand this variable

367
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:29,990
once I type something in like what was

368
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,049
the original question two plus four plus

369
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:41,289
five plus four plus five minus actually

370
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:47,929
minus three minus three times two plus

371
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:51,019
seven perfect and so now as you can see

372
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:53,419
it gives us the correct answer and this

373
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,850
is all the stuff behind it so I just do

374
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,090
this and so I can also show this so as

375
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,460
you can see here this is actually

376
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,100
showing us first of all what character

377
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,570
are what index in our array and then

378
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,519
second it's actually showing us okay so

379
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,659
um basically the third character which

380
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:18,860
is this plus modified this two plus four

381
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,620
to be turned into six and as you can see

382
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,600
these red numbers here are all our

383
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,379
indexes now anyway continuing and I set

384
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:29,450
this third this third character which is

385
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,899
the plus actually modified to plus four

386
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:38,980
to become 6 then this fifth minus

387
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,820
modified six plus five to become eleven

388
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,590
as you can see here also here we have

389
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,110
the five here it modified this to become

390
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,000
eleven anyway now at nine we can see

391
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,169
this plus has turned this 3 times 2 into

392
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:05,200
6 over here and then this Plus also

393
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,029
solved for essentially 11 minus 6 which

394
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,100
would be 5 as you can see and then it

395
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,659
was just left with 5 plus

396
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:17,450
seven and so it got the answer 12 and so

397
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,599
that's how that works anyway now we can

398
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,749
continue who is looking at our code

399
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,460
let's continue now and as you can see I

400
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,369
am going to be skipping a little bit of

401
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,529
this because uh first of all this is you

402
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:32,539
don't need to know this right now and

403
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,669
also this is completely I needed I was

404
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,989
just experimenting with something before

405
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:38,570
but now it's not needed as you can see I

406
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,509
have my stack class I have an extensions

407
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,099
in the string class which will easily

408
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,169
allow me to get the precedents the

409
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,549
operator or number of any sort of

410
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:53,299
essentially string another extension is

411
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,429
the string class which was created by I

412
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,919
think Alec Lars not start on them so but

413
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,840
anyway the link to it will be down in

414
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,599
the description and so that completely

415
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,299
works this string extension will allow

416
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,369
us to get a subscript of a string and

417
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,129
then finally this extension to the array

418
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,590
class which will allow us to get

419
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,019
something from an array and make sure

420
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,700
that it actually exists by either

421
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,369
returning an optional or it will return

422
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:25,960
the actual value if it exists and so

423
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,389
what it's going to do it actually this

424
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,559
was created by someone on Stack Overflow

425
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,529
as well and I will be putting their name

426
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,269
and the link to their answer down in

427
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:36,679
description so you can look in the

428
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,609
description for that anyway continuing

429
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,879
let's look at our in fix parser now so

430
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:46,789
anyway this is our and fixed parser and

431
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:49,190
first of all as you can see I have a

432
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,559
function here what this function is

433
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:54,409
going to do is it's going to allow me to

434
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:57,200
replace all the brackets with the actual

435
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,379
final answer it does this by taking each

436
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,129
and every section of brackets and it

437
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,580
will basically and also in case you are

438
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,279
wondering these are the only two things

439
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,799
that I've taken from Stack Overflow the

440
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,529
rest is all mine completely is the only

441
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,779
two things that were from stag envelope

442
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:20,059
anyway so that's the this is the bracket

443
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,500
engine it has

444
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,330
some nested functions which will allow

445
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,690
us first of all to power to parse out

446
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,320
all the brackets and so from all of them

447
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,290
from the entire expression convert all

448
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,930
the brackets into an array of strings so

449
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,050
if there's like five sets of brackets

450
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,350
you want to put five sets of brackets

451
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,260
into that string array and then after

452
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,870
that this bracket solving function will

453
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,060
actually return a string which is the

454
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,190
final expression completely ready to be

455
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,770
essentially returned so it will take all

456
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,770
the brackets values and it will solve

457
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,870
them using this solve function that I've

458
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:08,000
created and then it will replace the the

459
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,860
places where that bracket is occurring

460
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,680
inside of the expression with the answer

461
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,870
that it got from the sole function so

462
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,660
that's a pretty simple way to explain

463
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,970
how it works and if you want a more

464
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,550
detailed explanation on this again you

465
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,440
can always download the source code from

466
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,030
github and this will be completely

467
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,040
available on github I will be releasing

468
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,140
an app version soon of this but the

469
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,340
playground version will be available

470
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,620
immediately and it will also be soon

471
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,630
releasing an app version of the postfix

472
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,520
and index conversion just check out my

473
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,160
Twitter and I'll I'll tweet you one I am

474
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,500
done uploading that anyway let's

475
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:48,200
continue so now as you can see our solve

476
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,410
function finally so now this is our salt

477
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,660
function and we're taking the expression

478
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,390
over here as a variable and so this

479
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,570
expression variable is a string and

480
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,630
we're returning an int I due to the fact

481
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,910
that I just wanted to English and then

482
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,380
to turn on a double because it gives you

483
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,170
for me to test anyway so now the

484
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,440
expression so basically when we are

485
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,120
going to be removing all the brackets in

486
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,490
this one line because we have an

487
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,770
expression handler function so what's

488
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,750
gonna happen is we're going to say the

489
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,530
expression is equal to expression dot

490
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,520
characters dot contains a bracket if it

491
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,760
does then use a bracket engine on this

492
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,090
expression or else just

493
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,400
equal to the expression which is itself

494
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,490
and so that's how it will simplify a

495
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,789
very complicated bracket filled equate

496
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,720
expression with normal expert with a

497
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,429
normal expression that it's nice at

498
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:51,490
sewing anyway after that we are creating

499
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,750
our operator stack and our operand stack

500
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,919
next after that we are creating our

501
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,960
tokens which are essentially just the

502
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,679
expression separated by each space and

503
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,870
that's so that we have all the different

504
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,419
tokens and then using that we can look

505
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:09,070
through them check a third operator

506
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,309
check number do some logic with them etc

507
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,620
etc so as you can see it's converting

508
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,929
two plus four plus five minus three

509
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:20,220
times two plus seven into a big array

510
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,460
full of all this two plus four plus five

511
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,549
minus three and then there's more so

512
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:31,270
that you can't see them here anyway and

513
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,279
then so after that we are looping

514
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,240
through our tokens so we are enumerated

515
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,480
our tokens and so we are taking the

516
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,570
index and the token in our tokens array

517
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,669
and looping through them after that

518
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:47,740
we're just printing out token at index

519
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,240
so it's a little bit easier for me to

520
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,240
know what is where just in case I went

521
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,399
to the bug sorry about that

522
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:57,460
and so now we can see that I'm checking

523
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,250
if the tokens a number no logic required

524
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,860
put it onto the operand stack that's it

525
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,899
apart from that if it's an operator

526
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:06,730
however this is where stuff gets

527
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,730
complicated we're checking if the

528
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,460
operator stack speaks precedence is

529
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,549
lower than or equal to our current

530
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,640
tokens precedence then we want to check

531
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,580
if not the operator operator stacks

532
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,940
empty meaning that this stack is not

533
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,169
empty then create a new variable called

534
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,140
result and then do a switch case on the

535
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,750
operator stack and then you want

536
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,669
to check if it's a plus set the result

537
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:42,490
to the two values right fresh out of the

538
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,039
stack add them together and that's the

539
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,990
value in resolution

540
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,890
result however if it's a - you want to

541
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:54,220
take the the number that's one down from

542
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,190
the first number so what you do is you

543
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,830
say okay this number I'm not going to

544
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,960
explain how I actually get this number

545
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,120
but this number is the second highest in

546
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,540
V stack so if five were the highest and

547
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,740
two were after a five and then there was

548
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,809
many other numbers there were many other

549
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,720
not many other numbers actually then you

550
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,940
would take the two because that's second

551
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,030
highest in this stack and then you can -

552
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,090
out operand stack top pop because that's

553
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,280
going to be the first number anyway and

554
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,230
so since that one's gone but the second

555
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,120
the second highest element is now the

556
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,440
first highest element man it's still

557
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,480
there we have to pop that out of our

558
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,200
operand stack but multiplication however

559
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,059
we don't do that that's because addition

560
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,980
and multiplication can be done in any

561
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,260
order order gets you do the numbers but

562
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,179
actually in most cases it can in some

563
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,450
cases it can't but yeah it doesn't

564
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,910
really matter for this sort of a

565
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,790
conversation sort of a calculator and

566
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:06,220
yeah so sorry multiply multiply in

567
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,650
addition you can do in any order like

568
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,630
you can put the number the first number

569
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,429
on the other side or the second number

570
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:13,600
on the other side and it'll still give

571
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,630
you the same result but if you were the

572
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,820
if for a multiplication or actually

573
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,309
division and subtraction you have you

574
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:23,050
would put the numbers in a different

575
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,460
order it would give you a completely

576
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,080
different result maybe even negative

577
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,370
numbers sometimes and you don't really

578
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,610
want that so that's why we are not doing

579
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,980
it for addition for multiplication and

580
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,770
addition but we are for division and

581
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,590
subtraction so in division we're doing

582
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,770
the same thing that we did for

583
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,240
subtraction however we are not basically

584
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,830
mining or subtracting we're dividing and

585
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,840
so that's basically how that works

586
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,990
anyway but I if there's nothing like

587
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,120
that if there's not a plus minus times

588
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,890
or divide meaning our algorithm has gone

589
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,210
wrong for some reason

590
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,800
the result is zero that's the best thing

591
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,170
we can do after that just print out the

592
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,790
index week but we don't need that

593
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,230
anymore because we have result at index

594
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,820
meaning if there's something that's

595
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,430
modifying something tell me where it's

596
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,220
being modified from and what its answers

597
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,770
going to be so it's easy for me to debug

598
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,320
and also I can show it to you and then

599
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,570
I'm just printing out operand stack not

600
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,490
self value which I do not need anymore

601
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,040
but then I'm popping one out of the

602
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,530
operator stack because now we've

603
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,070
actually done that we've essentially

604
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,980
dealt with that operator and then we are

605
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,620
pushing this result on to the operand

606
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,990
stack and then once everything is done

607
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,100
we are pushing this specific token on to

608
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,480
the operator stack sorry operator stack

609
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,120
and then once we're done there might be

610
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,830
a few opera operators left in the

611
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,370
operator stack so what I'm doing is I'm

612
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,210
saying while not operator stack dot

613
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,450
empty what we're doing is we are again

614
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,970
just setting the result to zero

615
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,850
switching on the operator stack speak

616
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,070
doing all that logic then popping one

617
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,900
out of the operator stack and then

618
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,940
pushing this result on to the operand

619
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,280
stack once we're completely done with

620
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,830
that the only value left inside of the

621
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,470
operand stack will be the final answer

622
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,160
and so we can just return the int

623
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,170
typecasted force unwrapped version of

624
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,230
operand stack pop that's how that works

625
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,050
and so then it will return our answer

626
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,060
and then we will be able to see our

627
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,770
answer so for example if I were to do

628
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,300
something really complicated maybe

629
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,180
something like random numbers and random

630
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,960
operators at the same time plus four

631
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,600
times nine

632
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,470
four times right just some random thing

633
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:01,919
here

634
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,139
81 and let's see what spotlight gives us

635
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:09,210
81 so as you can see our answer is

636
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,820
correct because of course I don't think

637
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,210
spotlight Apple's own little calculator

638
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,000
thing would be wrong okay so that's

639
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,309
essentially how this infix parser works

640
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:22,860
again this entire source code will be

641
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,360
down in the description for you to

642
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,000
download I will eventually be making a

643
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,070
framework for both this and my other

644
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,929
postfix one if you want to take a look

645
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:33,179
at that and again this is very simple

646
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:34,289
kind of operators just put its

647
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,570
precedents and it's a string extension

648
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,269
and handle it in both of these while

649
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:42,750
