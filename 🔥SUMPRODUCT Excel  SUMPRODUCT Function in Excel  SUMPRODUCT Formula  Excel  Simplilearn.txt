let's get started with our onepoint
agenda which is about some product in
Excel so sum product and Excel so it's a
combination of both sum and product
function
so for this let's imagine you in a store
and you are supposed to calculate the
price tax of certain products for the
overall products let's say a customer or
a client come to your store and he
purchased like 10 items and you have to
calculate the rate and price and the
total price right so individual item
might have its individual rate and into
number of quantity of products he
purchased and the sum total so you're
conducting two two different operations
here right so some product is a
replacement for those two so I have the
same example here so these are the
clients these are the products and
quantity rate and you need to calculate
the price and total sum right so ideally
what you would do is you would multiply
this with
this and you will get a number and
similarly you would drag it all to the
end and here you would summarize
this that's how you usually do it but
what if I said you there is a shortcut
where you can do this all the way in
just one click all you have to do is
just some
product select that by pressing Tab and
now give the
Aries this one and this one you will get
the same number now some product is a
little brilliant so what I'm mean to say
is let's say if you wanted to calculate
for only product one quantity of product
one or the price of product one can you
do that yes absolutely just Min a change
in the formula select the same some
product and ensure that you are giving
the products column as well but ensure
that is encapsulated inside of bracket
so give the entire column close the
bracket and now the quantity
ideally it should work but it will not
because we are providing a comma here
because okay let's see it so you get
zero which is not the right answer but
why because we are giving two different
parameters and out of the first to the
first one where we have B3 to B8 this
particular parameter is acting or it is
returning a Boolean value so to make
sure that the Boolean value yields into
an actual value instead of comma you
should be providing a star now it will
work okay we forgot to encapsulate this
one inside a bracket as
well here it's really
simple we have to give a referencing
cell so let's say I'm adding the
referencing cell over here and this
particular value should be equals to
this cell and now I think it should work
there you go so that's how you can use
some product in Excel and if you want to
calculate the price tag the value or the
formula is a little
similar again
product press tab to select the function
and um the array should be equals to
this particular value make sure to
encapsulate that within a bracket and
then you finish the formula by giving a
star and the rate I think we also need
the quantity
here enter yeah that's the
value yeah and that's how we use some
product in Excel and with that we have
come to an end of the session on some
product in Excel should you need any uh
resources that we used in this session
