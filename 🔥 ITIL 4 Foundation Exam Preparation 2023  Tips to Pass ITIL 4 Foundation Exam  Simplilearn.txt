scrum Master training help me out to
become successful in my career after
doing this certification I got a job
offer from NTT data with a decent salary
hike hi I'm Samir Gupta I was working as
a IIT technician for TCS that is when I
was looking for a career growth this led
me to take certifications like ITIL and
prince2 from Simply learn I completed my
engineering in electronic and
communication that is when I thought
that I need a career growth and I took
up a certification for ITIL and prince2
I was looking for a certification in
ITIL intermediate I already did my
certification for ITIL Foundation from
some other Institute which were
basically offline simply learns ITIL
training was very much comprehensive it
was very much elaborated I would say
mostly the courses were shared in the
form of a PPT slides with us and there
were trailers which were available over
the videos it was very easy to go
through very much comprehensive and lot
of informations were there which was
very much helpful for me to take up the
course certification examination later
on so currently being in a city like a
Bangalore where you have a really huge
traffic problem it was very much easy
for me to go through my courses over
mobile application and complete it on
time so that is why I thought that it
would be much better to continue with
the simply learn rather than going with
any other offline course centers after
doing my certification in ITIL entrance
too I was able to get a promotion as a
project manager in my organization it
was very much helpful for me because
information which I got through this
certification were really up to the mark
to become a IT project manager in any
idea organization I believe that in the
field of ID it is very important to keep
Pace with latest technology and process
