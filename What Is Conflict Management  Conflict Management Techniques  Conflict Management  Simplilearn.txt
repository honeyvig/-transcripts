fact that employees serve as the
backbone of an organization towards its
growth and success by their productivity
and support to achieve organizational
goals
so it's the duty of the organization or
management to provide a healthy
workspace with required resources
and not just resources but also a
healthy environment as most of the

now before moving ahead with conflict
management let's understand what a
conflict is now a conflict is defined as
a clash between individuals arising due
to different
thought process attitudes understanding
requirements etc so when individuals
differ in opinions or interest and are
unable to find a middle a better way
there arises a conflict where most of
the conflict results in heat arguments
loss of peace and harmony are negative
perceptions
so now understand what is a conflict
management
so conflict management is the process of
resolving disputes where negative
results are minimized and positive
results are prioritized to resolve
conflicts in a better way this process
involves using different tactics
depending on the situation like
negotiations and creative thinking so
whenever to individuals different ideas
opinions interests or etc that arises of
conflict conflicts can be verbal
conflict religious conflict emotional
conflict or any sort of as conflicts
leads to disrespect and unnecessary
tensions in organizations conflict
spoils the decorum of the organization
and also reduces the productivity of the
employees by carrying unnecessary
attention
so that is what we need conflict
management for now now that we have a
good overview of what conflict
management is let's understand and look
into some of the importance of conflict
management
so conflict management plays a very
important role at workspace to prevent
conflicts and making employees
concentrate on their work
so the first one is conflict management
strengthens the bond between employees
now individuals must be motivated at
work and make every single day exciting
and challenging employees must be
transparent with each other and
processes must be discussed with
everyone to avoid ignorance or let out
now this way every employee feels
indispensable for the office
and he or she strives hard to live up to
the expectation of his fellow workers
and a way contributing to the
organization in his best way possible
this reduces the stress and tensions of
the employees
next we have is it helps to maintain a
healthy relationship
now conflict spoils the ambience and
spreads negativity at the workplace
leading towards unnecessary arguments
disrespects etc so conflict management
prevents squirrels between
employees
and make the work more peaceful
next comes
it helps to find an alternative for
problem
now this similar interest thought
process needs attitudes of individual
results in a conflict the discussion of
new ideas helps to prevent conflicts
before implementing it that make sure
you discuss with each and every one
related to it
listen to what others say and consider
their opinions without ignoring their
views lead to avoid or tussle
now
it also helps to implement ideas and
strategies successfully
now when individuals open up to other
towards discussion
makes oneself feel confident and
motivated towards this way to approach
where discussion provide better idea and
strategies
avoiding ignorance and disrespect
between employees
now that we know the importance of
conflict management let's have a look at
some of the options through which we can
actually avoid conflict at the base
so the first one is never leave any
problem unattended now problems are
bound to rise in a working environment
as no individuals have a huge count at
workplace
never leave any problem unattended as a
small problem can eventually become a
major reason to spoil the entire process
the problems must be addressed at its
initial stage and all related employees
must act in an open discussion providing
the reason for the conflict to arise and
solution towards the same
second is effective and transparent
communication
now one should be clear and precise in
their communication
delivery of speech a presentation in a
noisy environment ruins one's effort as
no one pays attention to it or attempts
to understand what the other person
intends to communicate resulting in
misunderstandings
then we have use of planners
not just providing commands to perform
action but also making oneself aware and
understand how it should be performed
and what are the different ways to
perform make oneself educated and feel
confident to avoid the same in future
now this process makes one aware of
their responsibilities and avoid
dependency on others to the core
have a peaceful mind
now conflicts are only spoiled ambience
of
workplace but also reduce the
productivity of the employees they get
demotivated leading to waste of time and
energy and nothing productive one should
trust his colleagues and always approach
the right person for the right job and
adapt according to the situation that
helps to create a peaceful environment
then we have is motivate oneself and
teammates now motivation is the key tool
towards success
mooding motivating oneself and teammates
provide a positive attitude
self-confidence and deterministic
mindset to achieve goals towards a
progressive approach
now let's have an overview of how to
avoid conflicts
first one is never leave any problem
unattended
second is
effective and transparent communication
third is use of planners
four have a peaceful mind
and fifth motivate oneself and teammates
so so far we have understood how to
avoid conflicts now let's understand how
to resolve conflicts
now resolving any problem in an
effective way helps to avoid loss of
time energy and resources
resolving conflicts at the workplace
provide a healthy relationship among
employees
supporting and peaceful environment
now let's see how to resolve conflicts
in a working environment
the first point that we are going to
discuss is a be a good listener
now listening to problems provide a
detailed description of the problem from
its origin to the current state that
helps to analyze think and react to the
problem that help to decide what is
right and wrong
second is
be patient
so never rush or
jump your questions as under a pressured
situation make oneself unaware of
important information which lead to the
rise of problems so be calm and patient
and prove space at the opposite end to
respond peacefully
have a positive attitude
now one should be in the motive to
resolve the issue at the earliest in the
best possible way rather than finding
faults in the other person
or assuming that he or she is wrong
now provide an interactive and
supportive speech to discuss the issue
or his opinions or that part of
explanation for the issue
now this will develop a positive
environment around you and other
enhancing your level of confidence to
resolve the issue at the earliest
fourth is never criticize now one should
be made aware of his or her
responsibility and the process making
them realize where they are wrong in a
polite way rather than initiating strict
actions or making fun of them so one
should aim to correct them and avoid the
same hindrance in futuristic rather than
punishing them or criticizing them
next is
ignore others now this should be taken
in a positive way now one should be
confident enough in the process
and stand firm on their decision rather
than discussing the same with others and
convincing them that might work now
leading to false and irrelevant
information creating a negative impact
in their process by adopting multiple
ideas that might ruin the entire process
