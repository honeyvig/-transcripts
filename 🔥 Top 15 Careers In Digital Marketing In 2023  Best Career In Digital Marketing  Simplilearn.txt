but don't just take our word for it
listen to what our Learners have to say
about our courses during my graduation
we were taught traditional advertising
but the industry demanded digital skills
so finding a job in the digital
marketing domain was a challenge for me
I thought a certification in digital
marketing would help me get a job and it
did after the course I was hired by
pantalo as a digital media specialist
with a 20 salary hike and now I'm
finally doing what I like
hey I'm Isaiah Moore I live in Arizona
and the United States I did my
graduation in 2020 in strategic
Communications from Northern Arizona
University in 2020 I joined Nova Home
Loans as a trailing documents
coordinator and worked there for almost
a year in fact I worked at various
places as a student but after graduation
I couldn't find a job in my field of
study or anything that aligned with my
interests I gave tons of interviews but
without any luck the reason
I lacked practical skills on top of that
I had no certification in digital
marketing in particular
so last year I decided to upskill myself
with a professional certificate program
in digital marketing offered by simply
learn in collaboration with Purdue
University I think it was a very good
decision I really liked the curriculum
it helped me enhance my Knowledge and
Skills last year itself after the course
I was hired by panalope as a digital
media specialist with a 20 salary height
and this year I was promoted to digital
marketing accounting
I finally found my footing in the
digital marketing domain and I think the
certification had a huge role to play
the certification helped me pursue my
desired career path
I can use my skills and experience to
become a freelance digital marketer one
day upskilling has helped me turn my
dream into a reality so without any
