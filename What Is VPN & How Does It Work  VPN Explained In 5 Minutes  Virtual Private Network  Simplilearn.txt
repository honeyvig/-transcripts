jude is waiting at the airport to hop on
her flight back home when she realizes
that she missed making an important bank
payment
she connects her laptop to the public
wi-fi at the airport and goes ahead to
carry out the bank transaction
everything goes well and jude completes
her transaction
after a couple of days she was wiped off
her feet when she learned that her bank
account was subjected to a cyber attack
and a hefty amount was wiped from her
account
after getting in touch with the bank
authority she learned that her account
was hacked at the airport
she then realized that the public wifi
she used might have caused her this
trouble
jude wishes that had her bank transfer
escaped the hacker's eyes she would not
have been a victim of a cyber attack
bank officials advise her to use a vpn
for future transactions especially when
connecting to an open or public network
like most of us jude had come across the
term vpn several times but didn't know
much about it and little did she think
that the repercussions of not using a
vpn would be this bad
let's understand how the hacker would
have exploited jude's transaction in the
absence of a vpn
in this process jude's computer first
connects to the internet service
provider isp
which provides access to the internet
she sends her details to the bank's
server using her ip address
internet protocol address or ip address
is a unique address that recognizes a
particular device be it a laptop or a
smartphone on the internet
when these details pass through the
public network the hacker who passively
watches the network traffic intercepts
it
this is a passive cyber attack where the
hacker collects jude's bank details
without being detected
more often or not in such an attack
payment information is likely to be
stolen
the targeted data here are the victim's
username passwords and other personal
information
such an unsecured connection exposed
jude's ip address and bank details to
the hacker when it passed through the
public network
so would you have been able to secure
her transaction with the help of a vpn
well yes
picture jude's bank transaction to be
happening in a tunnel that is invisible
to the hacker
in such a case the hacker will not be
able to spot a transaction and that is
precisely what a vpn does
a virtual private network more often
known as vpn creates a secure tunnel
between your device and the internet
for using a vpn jude's first step would
be to install software-based technology
known as the vpn client on her laptop or
smartphone that would let her establish
a secure connection
the vpn client connects to the wi-fi and
then to the isp
here the vpn client encrypts jude's
information using vpn protocols
data is encrypted to make sure it is
secure
next the vpn client establishes a vpn
tunnel within the public network that
connects to the vpn server
the vpn tunnel protects jude's
information from being intercepted by
the hacker jude's ip address and actual
location are changed at the vpn server
to enable a private and secure
connection
finally the vpn server connects to
jude's bank server in the last step
where the encrypted message is decrypted
this way jude's original ip address is
hidden by the vpn and the vpn tunnel
protects her data from being hacked
this explains how vpn makes your data
anonymous and secure when it passes
through the public network and the
difference between a normal connection
and a vpn connection
after learning about this jude was
certain that she should start using a
vpn to carry out her online transactions
in the future
this is also applicable to each one of
us
even if you work remotely or connect to
public wi-fi
using a vpn is the safest option
in addition to providing a secure
encrypted data transfer vpns are also
used to disguise your whereabouts and
give you access to regional web content
vpn servers act as proxies on the
internet this way your actual location
cannot be established
vbn enables you to spoof your location
and switch to a server to another
country and thereby change your location
for example by doing so you can watch
any content on netflix that might be
unavailable for your region
so here's a question for you

the correct flow of a vpn connection
