hi I'm Jay smells er the director of
program management on the.net team in
this video I'm going to provide an
overview of dotnet 2015 and related
updates and visuals to do 2015 update 1
first let's talk about the way we
approach our investments in the.net
framework it really centers around three
primary pillars the first is ensuring
that we're providing a dotnet
application platform that meets the
needs of the applications you've been
developing and the direction that you
need to take those going forward as well
as providing a platform upon which you
can build the next application that
you're being asked to create we're also
ensuring that we do this in a way that
is open transparent and collaborative
with the application development
ecosystem finally I wanna ensure that
we're creating a platform that not only
can be used to be great applications for
Windows but Apple any application
deployed to any platform we talked about
dotnet 2015 we're really talking about
two framework profiles the dotnet
framework for 6 or what I typically
refer to as the full framework this is
the version the dotnet that we've been
working with and you've been building
applications on for years provides
everything you need for building
applications from desktop applications
through high scale web services a little
over a year ago we introduced dotnet
core an optimized framework designed for
today's modern application types across
all of this we have a set of common
investments investments in things like
the runtime the compilers and core
library packages that extend the
experience and apply to all types of
applications so let's drill into each of
those areas starting with the the common
layer across across all let's talk a
little in the runtime in the runtime one
of the big areas of investments in net
46 was around the new 64-bit JIT
compiler provides increased performance
of applications and the opportunity for
us to create new and interesting
libraries for example support for sim D
in the language space we invested in a
faster compiler we've invested in
creating a set of language features that
smooth the overall language
usage and programming experience we
don't have big paradigm shifting
features like a sink or link in this
release instead we focused on the things
that just make your life easier as a
developer things like string
interpolation or the name of capability
in visual studio we focused a lot on
continuing to have the best of muggin
experience in the world we used to call
it the Cadillac of IDE s I think now we
probably refer to that as the Tesla of
IDE s and really expanding that
experience that you could take advantage
of modern language capabilities like
lambdas and Link while working in the
debugger and finally in the core
compiler space we have the new Roslyn
compiler the re-implementation of the
c-sharp and vb.net compilers that
exposes the intimate details that the
compiler has of your application to tool
vendors allowing tool vendors like
ourselves with Visual Studio and the
ecosystem to create richer and more
immersive experiences for your
application developers a couple great
examples of where this comes into play
are around code analysis or we're now
able to move beyond just static code
analysis and get into semantics
understandings of what your application
is doing providing even richer set of
tools for ensuring you're building the
best applications you can for library
and framework authors we have what we
refer to as coda where frameworks the
ability to include a compiler extension
with that library that gives an
interactive experience for using the
library using the framework in the way
it was intended and flagging users that
may be not as optimal including the
ability to offer fixes to the developer
right within the IDE if we move up a
little bit and talk about the
application types that that sit on top
of you know these runtimes we see that
we there's a number of different things
we have first we have a couple great
desktop UI presentation stacks Windows
forms is a great UI platform for
building Windows desktop applications
it's actually probably one of the most
complete platforms we have it's a great
set of experiences across the design
time the runtime and the third-party
ecosystem for supporting create great
desktop applications the team is focused
on the fundamentalism in this stack
really bending our energy and ensuring
that we're providing the best
performance work in the most current
hardware platforms
addressing that the key bugs that you as
customers have told us about WTF is
another great desktop presentation
technology stack we continue to invest
heavily here in performance as well as
modern hardware so doing investments
around high DPI resolutions improve
touch support and so forth we also in
Visual Studio 2015 really made a lot of
investment from the tooling experience
for WPF in this case took a lot of the
great experiences that we created for
Windows Universal projects and the
diagnostic tools and made them available
for WPF developers as well we also took
technologies and approaches we used in
the web design stack and applied them to
WPF doing things like allowing the
application and the surface if the
application to be used as the designer
as the navigation tool for figuring out
where these UI elements were coming from
and of course the Windows Universal
platform the universal Windows platform
really allowing us to create a single
runtime a single designs API surface
that can work across the full family of
Windows devices from small embedded
Windows devices to phones all the way up
through large wall mounted displays X
boxes and so forth as part of this we've
brought to market the dotnet native
experience dotnet native is a compiler
technology that allows us to extend the
dotnet compiler tool chain so rather
than stopping with the intermediate
language we now hook up the back end C++
compiler and produce a native binary as
a result this is the same c++ come back
in compiler that you would use if you
were a C++ developer so you get the
optimizations of a C++ application with
the productivity of a c-sharp and net
developer experience of course it is a
heterogeneous world up there especially
in devices and we want to make sure that
dotnet developers are able to use those
skills to build native iOS and Android
applications taking advantage of their
existing C sharp and dotnet skill set we
do this with a great partnership we have
with the folks at xamarin they enable
you to extend that's those skills to
build native iOS and Android
applications while also having an
opportunity to do reuse of code across
the specific implementation
so it's the best of both worlds you get
a 100% access to the platform API
specific to iOS or Android but you can
share a lot of the common code that
exists across all valves and all those
implementations and of course for the
web developer there's asp.net 5 this is
the new re-envisioning of the a sprint
net web stack to create designing it for
more modular use designing specifically
around new modern cloud workloads giving
you the ability to create a consumes
only the components of the framework
that you you actually need giving you
smaller deployment sizes which result in
higher density on the servers you're
deploying to we've dramatically improved
the tooling experience to continue
ensure you have the most productive
experience when building web
applications with Visual Studio and
asp.net now let's talk a little bit
about dotnet core data core is really
there to move net beyond Windows
historically when you think of net you
think about it as a platform built for
building great Windows applications with
dotnet core we're breaking that we're
changing the mold there and we're making
dotnet be a technology that can be used
by any developer building any app on any
platform we're doing it through a few
core design principles specifically
we've designed a net core to be modular
from the beginning it's all package
based rather than thinking about
assemblies you think about packages and
you allow nougat our package manager to
ensure you have the right packages
available and the right dependencies
that your application requires we also
designed net Cora with specific
workloads in mind specifically modern
workloads so things like Universal
Windows platform ability to work across
devices as well as the modern asp.net
web workload and dotnet core is the
implementation of dotnet that we've
implemented entirely and in the open
working in github and his supports
cross-platform so the ability to build
and he's been in application and deploy
it to a Linux environment or build it on
a Mac we think about dotnet open source
it's not just about the source being
open it's about how we go about building
the software it's about how we the
approach we take to designing the
product
we've done a number of things over the
last year we've really started to to see
increased maturity in the team in the
way they work so we see everything from
the early design ideas around the next
version of the c-sharp language being
posted out on github and having
conversations with you as the community
of developers about the direction we're
taking the language we see every pull
request that's made whether it's from a
Microsoft engineer or an on Microsoft
engineer go through the same open code
review process in the public so everyone
is learning from the best practices that
we have the contributions and the
reactions we've seen here have been
tremendous we've seen everything from a
big portion of the Mac platform
abstraction layer for the common
language runtime to fix this - error
message strings coming from the
community and everything in between
we've also seen this way we work have an
influence on the way we work with other
platforms a couple weeks back we saw the
first merge requests going into the
Linux kernel that referenced the
Microsoft core CLR project as one of the
justifications for making a change to
the Linux kernel that's just a
tremendous example of the kinds of new
collaboration that's happening across
our industry to give you more of a feel
for it let's take a look at what the new
dotnet core experience looks like for
someone trying to develop an application
on a Mac in this demo we'll take a look
at building an asp.net 5 application
on.net core on a Mac now i've already
gone through the steps to install both
asp.net 5 and dotnet core so i have a
set of commands that are now available
to me as part of this experience one of
them is a dotnet version manager so I
could say D nvm list when I see our list
of the versions of.net core and aims but
not that I have available on this
machine here's how you can start seeing
that side-by-side support that we now
have with the.net core implementation in
this case beta 8 is the active
installation on my machine and that's
the one that we'll use by default for
any commands to create an application I
can take advantage of the asp.net
extension to yeoman and just say yo asp
net which will launch ilmin and our
asp.net generators will choose
the basic web application give it a name
I'll call it hello connect and that will
now scaffold out the basic files we need
for our asp.net application so let's go
change directories to that we can take a
quick look and we see that it's
generated the basic set of views
controllers and project files that you
would expect for an asp.net 5
application next thing we need to do is
just restore the packages used for this
application in this case we'll probably
grab a lot of them out of the cache so
you can looked at the project file and
has done that the last thing when you do
is we'll just launch this application by
typing DNX web what this is going to do
is launch a lightweight cross platform a
sprinter net host we have called Kestrel
now that is up we'll switch over to our
browser and we'll just go to localhost
and here we see our asp.net 5
application on dotnet core running
locally on my Mac that was a quick
summary of the Ares investment in dotnet
2015 hopefully it gave you some insight
into the kinds of scenarios we're going
after and the things were thinking about
this is a collaboration so I encourage
