hey everyone i'm shamlee and i welcome
you all to this new video of simply
learn on what is hyper ledger
in this video we are going to cover all
important concepts and components
related to hyperledger
first we will understand what is
hyperledger then we will explore the
history of hyperledger
then we will understand goals of
hyperledger
after that we will look into the layers
of hyperledger technology
after which we will explore
organizational architecture of
hyperledger then we will understand how
hyperledger works and at the last we
will explore other hyperledger tools and
projects so without much delay let's get
started with the video
first let's understand what is
hyperledger
hyperledger is an open source community
that offers and focuses on developing
suitable frameworks tools and libraries
for enterprise grade blockchain
deployments
and builds open source blockchains and
related applications for use across
various industries
the linux foundation hosts this global
collaboration which comprises
professionals in finance banking the
internet supply chains manufacturing and
technology as well
built under technical governance and
open collaboration individual developers
service and solution providers
government associations corporate
members and end users are all encouraged
to get involved in the creation and
marketing of this game-changing
innovations well that makes me wonder
how have pleasure came into existence
let's die down and explore the history
of hyperledger
the hyperledger project was announced by
the linux foundation in 2015
a year before it was released
the hyperledger project's executive
director brian bellendorf also claimed
that the hyperledger project would never
create its own cryptocurrency
the project began accepting submissions
for the incubation of code bases and
other code element technologies in 2016.
hyperledger fabric and lip consensus
were two of the first blockchain
framework code bases to be accepted
later saw two intel's distributed ledger
was incubated now let's move to the
goals of hyperledger
first
is to facilitate commercial transaction
create enterprise grade open source
distributed ledger frameworks and code
bases
second is to provide infrastructure that
is impartial open and community driven
with technical and corporate governance
third is to develop blockchain and
shared ledger pocs application cases
field trails and deployments build
technical communities
fourth is to educate the general
audience on the blockchain's
technology's market potential
fifth is to promote our community of
communities by utilizing a toolkit
approach that includes a variety of
platforms and framework now let's
understand the technology layer of
hyperledger hyperledger employs the
following essential business components
in its architecture
first is the consensus layer
it is in charge of reaching an agreement
on the order and verifying the accuracy
of the blog's transactions
then comes the smart contract layer
which is in charge of processing
transaction requests and only
authorizing transactions that are valid
after that is the communication layer
peer-to-peer message transit is handled
by the communication layer
then comes identity management services
these are required for maintaining and
validating user and system identities as
well as creating trust on the blockchain
and at the end comes the api or
application programming interface
external programs and clients can
interact with the blockchain using the
api
now let's have a look at the
organizational architecture of
hyperledger
essentially hyperledger enables the
development of various blockchain-based
systems and applications for industrial
use by providing the necessary
infrastructure and standards it acts
more like a hub bringing together
numerous blockchain based projects and
tools that follow established design
philosophy
hyperledger's architecture can be
broadly divided into three main
components which is apis
sdks
and clis
apis or application programming
interface include membership services
which is a set of cryptographic
certificates that defines the
organization by itself
every pair or order needs this type of
certificate which consists of some
common properties that signifies that
whether the peer or the order belongs to
the same organization
a pair which is a part of the same
membership services can communicate with
each other but peers from other
organizations cannot communicate with
each other
sdks or software development kits
include blockchain and transaction layer
which constitutes the core code of the
blockchain it consists of the consensus
algorithm which helps to make the final
decision on the validation of every
transaction
it also consists of distributed ledger
as well as legit storage which contains
all details regarding the transactions
made 1
and also lastly known status of each
transaction
it has a peer-to-peer protocol used to
communicate between the nodes on the
network clies a command line interface
consists of chain code which is a layer
of logical programming which consists of
the business logic required to run in
operation on the hyperledger
now that we know all about hyperledger
structure and goals let's understand how
hyperledger works
let's take an example of two friends
alex and sarah who wants to perform a
hyperledger transaction
sarah runs a bakery and wants to send a
birthday cake to alex as per his request
on the sarah's bakery app now sarah
looks for his address on her application
which sends a query to the membership
services of the application and
validates transaction of only directly
affiliated peers to the application
now our application searches for alex's
membership on the membership services of
that particular application for
validation
now after that hyperledger connects both
parties alex and sarah
both of them will now generate a result
which needs to be the same for the
transaction to be validated on the
two-party agreement
now the validated transaction is then
sent to the consensus cloud for placing
orders and these orders are then sent to
the connected peers
and then being verified by them
according to the ledger once it is
approved by the consensus cloud alex
finally receives his birthday cake and
then the transaction is committed to the
ledger
now let's have a look at some other
hyperledger tools and projects
hyperledger fabric hyperledger sawtooth
high pleasure ayurva hyperledger indie
hyperlogic basu hyperledger caliper
hyperledger explorer hyperledger cello
and hyperledger burrow are a few
hyperledger tools and projects
introduced after the origin of
hyperledger in 2016.
well this is all about hyperledger we
almost reached the end of this video if
i missed anything important do let me
