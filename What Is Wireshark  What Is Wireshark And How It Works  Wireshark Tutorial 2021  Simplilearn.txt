due to the increase in the network
transactions
in the modern era there are often cases
when we face some problems regarding
network issues
but
are there exactly network issues or is
somebody spying on us
well such cases are regarded as network
sniffing cases
but how exactly a hacker hack into a
network system
well for today's topic we'll understand
the same
hi guys and welcome to yet another
interesting video simply learn
if you love watching tech videos
subscribe to our channel and hit the
bell icon to never miss an update from
us
for today's agenda we'll understand what
exactly is network sniffing
then see some tools that are used for
network sniffing purpose and lastly
we'll understand what exactly is the
wireshark tool
let's take a look at network sniffing
to access the network related
information between devices to gain
profit or use the hacked data for
illegal purpose is known as network
sniffing
this is a process where a hacker or a
measures programmer
spy into the network devices of our
system
they can access different websites that
we visit often or see our network habits
let's take a look at different tools
that are suitable for sniffing purpose
network sniffing tools are software's
that are available on the internet that
can be used to sniff into the network
let's take a look at some of the famous
network tools
first one is awk
this is a networking sniffing tool which
has specialization in intelligent
analysis for network packets
next is wireshark
this software tool is best to look into
protocol related data packets that are
often transmitted over the network
and lastly we have solar wind network
packet sniffer
where the performance of this sniffing
tool is best where the performance
management is to be looked into
let's take a look at the wireshark
sniffing tool this is an open source
network sniffing software which is
specifically designed
to attack data packets during a
transmission over the network
this type of software uses different
color combinations to represent
different packets and protocols let's
take a look at some of the uses for the
sniffing software
the first uses it is used to analyze
network packets
whereas
it can also be used to troubleshoot
different network issues which are often
used by different engineers
to test whether the software or a
network device is susceptible to an
attack
and lastly it is also used to check
malicious and hacking possibilities on
the network
now that we are completed with the
briefing for the software that is known
as wireshark let's take a look at the
actual demo how exactly network sniffing
is done
you can directly access
the wireshark software website
where you can find the download option
and download the most suitable
version for your laptop or computer
device
after downloading the software when you
install
it you will get something like this
as we can see
these connections are the connections
that are connected to my laptop right
now
and the difference in the graph that we
can see over here represent the traffic
on the network that is present
to much better understand what exactly
is going on the network we can access
one of them let's access the wi-fi
network on my laptop
after accessing the network
we can see some packet settings like
this
these represents the packet transaction
that has been made on my network through
the internet
and this is how a hacker or a cyber
criminal knows how exactly we use a
network services
this part of the wireshark represents
different detailed information about the
transaction that has been made
and the last section represents some raw
data or garbage data
but how exactly a hacker use all this
jumbled data and hack into a system
well
to clarify this there's an option
that can be used that is known as
display filter on the wireshark software
if you want to search for a specific
protocol for example tcp
we can write tcp in the search filter
and search
and now as we can see
we only get the protocols that are
related to tcp
this is how we can differentiate
different protocols and access some of
them to gain knowledge about what
exactly is going on in the network
let's try accessing some other protocol
now
for example
dns
and as we can see only the protocol and
the data packet that is related to dns
protocol is visible to us
to further enhance the display filter
let's try accessing a
different page on the web browser
for example
simplylearn.com
when we access the simplylearn website
we can see the professional courses that
are available
but let's take a look at the changes
that has been made on the wireshark
to know this let's write
tcp and a keyword included contains
and one more thing to include over eis
during the display filter if you write
something that is related to the
software it will represent in a green
color
like this but if you write some error
related keywords like this it will
represent in the red
let's continue with the search setting
including the contains keyword and
writing
simply learn
and entering
now as we can see these two related data
packets represent the simply learn
website that we access just now
where the source destination ip address
represent
my system address whereas the
destination that is
13.224.21.74 represent the simply learns
ip address let's take a look
and in the garbage area or the raw data
we can take a look simply learn website
to see some more details regarding the
same
you can access the transport layer
security
and the transmission control protocol
where we can see the source port the
destination port which is always 443
as well as
the flag
and the timestamp for the same
this is how hackers get the data about
our network settings
but if we want to search for more data
related to simply learn website that we
visited just now
there's an another filter that we can
use
for example
using ip
dot add r
space equal equal and writing the i p
address for the website simply learn
that is
thirteen point two two four
0.21.74
and when we press enter we get all the
related data for the simply learn
website
and this is how we can see the related
data
to much further enhance our display
settings let's try another example
access your internet browser
and access some other website for
example
dot
for example the state university
and access the allahabad state
university
and
some other
part in it for example the university
state
pdf
let's see the changes in our wireshark
settings
and try using http
when we write this we get the data that
is related to the http but what is the
use for the same
when you access this
and right click on the same
and choose the option follow
and http stream
and over here we can take a look at the
host that is
the website that we just visited
now imagine if we were a hacker and we
knew all this
we can access any website that our user
visited
and we can hack into his system through
the website
guys but the point that has to be noted
over here is if we use the network
sniffing tool wireshark or some other
tool that is
available on the internet for research
purpose or experimental use that's fine
but we shouldn't use all these softwares
for any malicious activity because that
is illegal
now
some of the options that we can see are
the red box
this action is used if you want to stop
the traffic connection that means if we
press this option
and clear this
and press enter
this shows
that the network settings has stopped
receiving any traffic that is available
on the network but if we want to access
them again
we can choose this bluefin option
continue without saving
and the software against
start recording the websites or the data
packets that are available on the
network
now let's take a look at an example as
we all know we often visit different
websites and there are some cases we
often see when the chrome represent a
non-secure option
that represents that the website is
unprotected against network attack
for example we can access our
experimental website
this is a website that allows us to
access the non-secure part of a website
if we write for username as
admin1213
and for password as
simply learn
and login
as this is an experimental website it
says
it's sorry and the login has failed
let's see the changes in a wireshark
software
now as we already did earlier if we want
to access a specific website we should
write
tcp
contains
and the keyword of the website that was
admin
through this we can see this was the
website that we visited just now
but if we want to access the actual
important data that was the password
that we typed
we can use this option
and over here we can see the simply
learn
which was encrypted earlier in the
website
this is how a hacker or a cyber criminal
use different sniffing softwares and
gain data about different users
and with this we have reached the end of
the session
