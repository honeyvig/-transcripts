in this session on user datagram
protocol we will look into the
application of applying the udp protocol
and why it is used to transmit data in a
network channel hi guys and welcome to
yet another trusting video by simply
learn but before we begin if you love
watching tech videos subscribe to our
channel and hit the bell icon to remiss
an update from us now without further
ado let's take a look at the agenda for
today's session
to begin with we will look into what is
the user datagram protocol
continuing with knowing some features of
the protocol
moving on with header format of the
protocol
next we will look into the working steps
of the udp protocol
applications of the udp protocol and in
the end we will look into udp versus tcp
protocol
let's move on with the first heading
that is what is user datagram protocol
the user datagram protocol commonly
known as udp protocol is designed
to be unreliable and connectionless in
nature
which applies process to process
communication model for data exchange
between devices and is active in the
transport layer of the osi model
and is used to transfer
data and information related to internet
services over the network channel where
process to process communication refers
to the use of port numbers in the header
format during the transmission of data
over the network channel
as for connectionless
it means that
the utp format does not provide
established path for the data to
transfer instead it uses multiple
different paths which we will look into
further in the video let's move on to
the next heading
features of using user datagram protocol
the user datagram protocol provides the
network with ways efficient and easy to
understand network protocol features to
apply over the data that is to be
transmitted
where the first feature of udp is
related to the working area that is the
udp model is a transport layer protocol
of the osi model and is used to deliver
best effort delivery options for the
data transmission where the best
delivery option refers that the protocol
does not provide the sender will receive
any acknowledgement from the receiver
side for the data transmitted
or it does not provide any guarantee of
data transmitted to the receiver side
now let's move on to the second feature
of user datagram protocol the second
feature represents the mode of delivery
a connection that the udp establishes
for data transmission
the udp protocol as we know already
establishes
a connectionless path that means there's
no actual virtual path for the data to
be transmitted
so that the each data from the udp
format uses a random path available in
the network channel and reaches its
destination
now let's move on to the next heading
that is udp header format
the udp header format comprises of two
parts
first the udp header part which is eight
bytes in size and second the data to be
transmitted
furthermore the header part is divided
into four different parts
source port destination port total
length and checksum
where each of the parts are divided into
16 bits
let's take a look at the different parts
of the header format in a little detail
the first one is source port number
it is a 16-bit value that is used to
identify the port that is transmitting
the data
next is destination port number
that is used to identify the port number
that will be receiving the data on the
receiver end
next we have total length as the name
suggests this value is used to specify
the total length of the udp packet
including the udp header part
and the last is checksum this is a 16
bit value field and is used as an
optional attribute
it is left empty if there is no need or
it is used in case where accuracy of the
data is to be measured
now let's move on to the working of the
udp protocol
to begin with we have data from the
sender side
which is enclosed with the udp header
for communication and data in the udp
header part
the next step is to hand over this data
over to the ip section
for encapsulation
with the ip header and data
with the udp header and data part
as for the last step this part is handed
over to the frame section where it is
transformed with the frame header and
data format
moving on now let's transmit the data
over the network channel for the
receiver and to receive it
over to the receiver side first step is
decoding of frame header part and data
part into the ip section which contains
ip header and data section
again this ip's packet is divided into
udp header part and data part
from where the message is retrieved from
the data section of the utp header
format and is then received by the
receiver end
now let's move on to the applications of
udp protocol
let's take a look at some of the
features of the udp protocol that
provides
applications to various network models
for the first one we have
it provides flow control and error
control mechanism
to the network model such as tftp
next it provides faster transmission of
data as there is no pre-established
virtual path needed
so it is used for real-time services
live communication and gaming services
now let's move on to the last heading
for this session that is udp versus tcp
protocol
we will differentiate between udp and
tcp based on some attributes that are
mostly used in the network model
and the first attribute is reliability
for udp protocol as we already know now
it is an unreliable in nature
that is it does not provide any
guarantee of data transmitted to the
destination side is reached or not
as for tcp
it provides reliable and guaranteed data
delivery to the receiver side
the next attribute is acknowledgement
signal
the udp protocol does not provide any
acknowledgement from the receiver side
to the sender side
whereas in case of tcp protocol sharing
the acknowledgement signal is very
important if the acknowledgement signal
is not shared by the receiver side to
the center side the data exchange will
halt
let's move on to the next attribute that
is connection mode
as we already know now udp is a
connectionless mode of service there is
no virtual path established for the data
transmission to takes place
whereas for tcp protocol it is a
connection oriented protocol
that is a virtual path is needed for the
data to be transmitted over to the
receiver side or the destination node
the next attribute is error check system
in udp protocol basic check system is
only used for error check
whereas for tcp protocol it is an
extensive error check service
and along with error flow control
mechanism included in the tcp protocol
service
