ERS YouTube channel you are already
watching simply learn and today we bring
you this informative video about jira
tutorial
it is a software tool for tracking issue
and managing projects
before we begin if these are the video
you like to watch hit that subscribe
button and the bell icon to get notified
and if you are a tag geek he is a brain
teaser for you
who coined the concept of jira software
Apple
atlassian Microsoft
or mountain peak let us know your answer
below and get a heart from Simply
without any further delay let's get
started with the session
now let's take a quick look at the
agendas first
we will understand what is jeera moving
forward we will discuss how jira works
next we will see the jira component
and the uses followed with we will see
the basics of jira concept and then
features of cheetah software
what is jira
jira is an agile project management tool
used for project management bug tracking
issue tracking and automate workflow it
is also the solution that provides
Concepts and solution to the entire team
the clients allowing for collaborations
and transparency it is an incident
management tool and a platform
independent tool that can run on any
platform or operating system and also in
a multilingual tool
so now we will see how does jira work
if we look into the work process of jira
then it permit us to organize the task
and other priorities constructing a
well-organized workflow in different
management
the workflow includes review and
approval steps and multiple resolutions
possibilities
going through this workflow we can
create a subtask customize task manage
activities set due dates reminders task
Recycling and determine what types of
project this help gather contextual data
or information regarding the task the
track and the process report and Tackle
all the bugs and release it when
approved
after understanding how jira works we
will see its component along with its
uses
what is a component in terms of project
management
our projects of divisions are called
components these subdivisions are
applied to break down problems into
manageable chunks within a project which
later helps to generate good reports
that is collecting useful statistic and
grouping data contextually
as we know that jira components are very
helpful and most software project team
use these components and also big
companies might use chia components more
often to manage the data stream because
larger data sets are more difficult to
track
the project manager put a lot of effort
behind to ensure no task is overlooked
and that reports are prepared for action
but as T Max pen
the project becomes more complicated
when it's become too easy for things to
slide through the cracks have issue and
have created problems
to overcome all these the team uses
Chira components to track issue software
bugs and individual work this jira
component helps to organize these issue
based on functionality features
customers and departments let's take a
look at another example let's take an
Uber is an example
Suppose there are three subcomponents of
projects a driver's app a customer's app
and a food delivery app
and under your food delivery app project
you have got like order Meal special
offer and food Combos and so on how will
you track all this information across
different projects this is done by
components
next we will discuss jira concept
jira works on following three concepts
project issue and workflow
the first one is Project it is a
collection of issues you can use a jira
project with your team to coordinate and
improve the development of a product by
tracking the project managing the help
desk and more depending on the
requirements of your needs it can be
processed and configured according to
your and your team's need
and the second one is issue as we
already know jira is a tour used in
project management and also uses issue
to track all the tasks according to your
team and how your team uses jira the
issue can be represented as a project
the task user requirements detection of
software bugs and enhancement of the
project
the next one is workflow jira has
built-in workflows and it is used to
track the life cycle of an issue where
it tracks a set of status and
transformation that an issue moves
throughout the process and typically
represent a process within your
organization
and lastly let's take a look at features
of jira software
so the first one is Authentication
users are authenticated against the
active directory remember me provides
automatic login when the user visits gr
software
it has in quick access to the software
the next one is dashboard
users can have more than one dashboard
on the main page showing Dynamic
information presented in text or
graphics
a team can share a dashboard to track
the progress
it helps in immediate access to
meaningful mattress that are used to
track the health of a project or
application and to manage resource
workloads
next is workflow
it defines a cycle of an issue with
validation first it will open then it
will go in progress
and it will resolve then it will close
if it is not resolved it will go to
reopen and to the progress
the next one is they can be shared by
several projects and can be unique
it can be simple and sometimes quite
complex too
the next one is issue searching
this will allow you to find an issue in
which you are interested
it gives better transparency so that
everyone can see what is being done and
the progress that is being made
the next one is time tracking
this feature allows for the input and
monitoring of actual and estimate time
span on an activity
it will allow more effective management
of free sources and many more
next is Project Administration
they control the access to the data and
who can access it and what should be
accessed
they can also control who can view and
edit issue handle locally without system
administration involvement
and the last one is road maps
Aurora Maps allow you to create a clear
version of the product you are
developing
and can use to find what needs to be
done and when problems are expected to
be fixed
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free visit skillup by simply learn click
on the link in the description to know
more
so let's get started with that class in
website and we will create an account
the first thing jira will ask you to log
in your email ID with your unique name
that should be a site name
and you can provide any name and it
should be unique
or after writing any name suppose
it should be unique and just after that
you have to agree
so next page is this here jira will ask
you whether you are new to this or you
are experienced
suppose you are new to it
and your agile methodologies Newton
and suppose we spend our time on working
on features and it is flexible schedule
to finish a while now
so for our project we are going to use
scrum template so we will change the
template first
then this scrum
use template
and we'll use T manage
project because it's free let's take a
name for our project let's suppose here
sample
and here zero also assigned a key to
your project that is Js
this key can be used to refer you any
project so let's create the project
you're also having so many options for
integrating your gear experience with
other platform but let's for now let's
take
uh just skip this
here is a first thing we need to do is
first we will create an epic so let us
enable
yeah this is known as the Epic panel
right
now over here at the left down you can
you can give it an epic name for this
project
um I wanted to use an example of
favorite
where I could store and view my products
so let us
the favorite
now that we have created the Epic
we can I can use this drop down menu to
view the details
so first view all details
let it make a little big
okay over here you can add a description
we can also add comments
and we can add stories
so let us see how to do that at first
you can click add
to add a collection
sorry you click add a child issue
so here you can
specify what kind of issue you want to
create like any story task or Burger Etc
so for first story let us see that we
want to save our products so in our
favorite list so we want to write here
product and we will create it right let
us also add another story for sharing
the favorite so
so here we are
favorite
and then we will create it
so now we have created our two stories
now we will close this section and we
can view our stories in the background
next step is to create a Sprint
so
very simple all we have to do is to
track
this backlog
the next one
yeah
start sprinting
and it will ask you for the detail over
here and you can see a Sprint name
and the duration date timing and Etc
so just
sorry
so now we have created us two Sprint and
you can see to do in progress to do in
progress and done in the board section
now you can
um open up the stories and few
and view the details inside
you can assign to the same one and you
can do it at a set story Point estimate
is a quantitative value of how much
relevance a story has in the Epic so far
now let us just set it as
four
or three
and over here
add a child issue
since a story is about saving the
product and the favorite so
you can first
first
you can first create a favorite button
on the product page
that is product page right so page
[Music]
you can also add another task to create
a new database so that we can store the
product that we like or like
create
database for
favorite product
not that we all are done here we can
close this section story
here we will do the same thing for this
story also
detail is over here
or Z3
you can add a child issue button over
here we can create
a page to display
favorite
[Music]
and our second subtask could be about
creating a button so that we can view
our favorite list like we can add
View
favorite button
okay here we are done here we can also
see this
so now you can see this to-do button
over here and now for our sub task so
you can expand them and you can click on
the progress
now see that the since the story in
progress we can close this
and slide over
into and in the process
we can do this to the same for the
Second Story
and open this
we're done
in progress
close it will shift it to in progress
now once you are done with the sub task
you can go to the same place and you can
specify it
as done
this also
you can pull it down
now you can see that the progress is 100
percent
100 done right so now you can cast the
story
and shifted it over
the done column
you can do same for the next
so now once we completed all the sub
tasks and the stories you can go in the
complete and you have to complete the
Sprint
yeah
we have also seen how to assign it to
someone
and how to create story points estimate
and how to track progress of your
project and now we will see how to
manage workflow so the first thing you
need to do to access your workflow is
first you have to go to the board and to
the right corner button
and click on the manage workflow over
here you can see the face that your
business is currently going through and
start creative to in progress done and
it's Etc so you can also add a few face
like if you want to add let us know add
another to-do status
suppose add
so once you are done over here it will
come you can see
the
face that you have deployed and you have
to update your workflow and save and
continue
so you can exit this interface and have
the overhead to the board
in our way you can see
that the add phase for your project
so now that we have seen what overflow
will be so now that we have seen what
workflows are let us explore few other
options
so the first thing that we can see is
code
over here you can integrate jira with
other platforms
so that you can manage any of your
project easily and you can also have an
in-house inversion interface
with this we have come to the end of
this session where we understand the
basics of cheetah software which allows
organization or team to streamline and
automate the tracking of virtually
anything that need to be tracked on it
can be customized to support particular
requirements and hence provide the
potential for improving the organization
in terms of productivity communication
metrics Effectiveness and many more hope
