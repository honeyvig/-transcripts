's YouTube channel in this session we
will learn about software development
who is a software developer and the
different types of software developers
in the IT industry but before we begin
let me tell you guys that we have daily
updates on multiple Technologies if you
are a technique in a continuous hunt for
latest technological Trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
YouTube channel and don't forget to hit
that Bell icon to never miss an update
from Simply learn and before we begin
with our session today if you are an
aspiring software developer who is
looking out for online training and
certification from the experts and from
the top universities in the world then
search no more simply learns
postgraduate program in full stack web
development from Caltech University
should be the right choice for more
details on this course please use the
link in the description box below having
said that over to the training so we can
Define the term software development as
follows
software development is a branch of
computer science which includes the
development and building of computer
systems software and application
software
now that we know the process of software
and development let's move further and
learn more about a software developer
so who exactly is a software developer
so a software and developer can be
defined as follows software developers
are computer science professionals who
use the knowledge of engineering
principles and programming languages to
build a software now that we have some
briefing about what exactly is software
development and whom do we call a
software developer we will now enter
into our core topic for today's
discussion where we will learn the types
of software developers and the languages
including the Frameworks that you need
to know to become one and also to make
things better we will also learn some of
the additional skills that you might
need just in case to make sure you never
miss anything in real time
so let's get started
we will begin with the front-end
developers so basically the front end
developer specializes in the programming
of visual interfaces including its
Aesthetics and layouts the front-end
developers code runs on the web browser
on the computer or a mobile user of the
site it is very high level work normally
far removed from the hardware it
requires an understanding of human and
machine interaction and design
principles more than a computer science
theory
so the popular languages required to
become a front-end developer are HTML
CSS and JavaScript followed by that the
major Frameworks or the Ides that you
might have to master to become a
front-end developer are visual studio
IntelliJ pycharm also some of the major
additional skills that you might require
are get Version Control for example if
something goes wrong along the way the
last thing you'll want to do is start
over from the beginning
Version Control is the process of
tracking and controlling changes to your
code so that this won't happen so
Version Control software is a tool you
will use to track those changes so you
can go back to the previous version of
your work and find out what went wrong
without tearing the whole thing apart
followed by that the next additional
skill you might need is to build
responsive design that controls and
supports multiple devices these days we
use any number of computers phones and
tablets to look at web pages ever notice
how this page is adjust stem cells to
the devices you are using without you
doing anything on your end
this is due to the responsive design
understanding responsive design
principles and how to implement them on
the coding site is the key to the
front-end development so the last and
important additional skill is to be able
to write code for various types of
testing bugs are the reality of the
development process in order to keep
things moving you will need to test your
code for bugs along the way
so the ability to test and debug makes
the list of essential skills for
front-end Developers there are a couple
of different testing methods for web
development or of which functional
testing looks like a particular piece of
functionality on your site like phone or
a database and make sure it does
everything you've coded to it to do
followed by that we have unit testing
unit testing is another method it tests
the smallest part of your code that's
responsible for one thing on your site
and exam mindset individually for
correct operation so followed by the
front-end developers we have the backend
Developers
so the backend developer is the one who
specializes in design implementation
functional called logic performance and
scalability of a piece of software old
system running on machines that are
removed from the end user backend
systems can grow to very complex but
their complexity is often not visible to
the users for example consider Google
search engine
the front end part is very simple user
interface with a title and a text box
and two or three buttons the packing is
enormously complex system able to crawl
the web index and find what you're
looking for with a growing array of
sophisticated mechanisms
so with this we will move ahead and
understand the major programming
languages and Frameworks that you need
to specialize to become a back-end
developer
so the major programming languages that
you might be needing to become a
back-end developer are scalar
programming language Java full and
finally the Python programming language
these are the leading and cutting-ish
programming languages preferred by
Professionals in real time to code the
backend process
also the major Ides or the Frameworks
that you might be needing to become a
backend developer are the visual studio
IntelliJ and pychon so the important
additional skills that you might require
to become a back-end developer are
having some good knowledge of session
Management in a distributed environment
basic exposure to the front-end
Technologies like HTML and CSS as
desirable followed by that you should be
having an awareness of security concerns
which is important because different
layers may have different kinds of
vulnerabilities followed by that the
backend developers must be able to code
unit testing and other types of
functional testing for the back end part
followed by this we will move ahead into
the next type of developer which is the
full stack developer
the full stack developer is the one who
does both the front and and the back end
he or she has the skills required to
create a fully functional web
application also we will discuss some
additional features to become a full
stand developer
the first one is knowledge of both front
and and the backend fundamentals as we
made it clear that a full stack
developer is concerned with front end
and the back end they must be possessing
the fundamental design skills
followed by that the next important
skill is knowledge of database which is
crucial all the web applications need a
database where all the data will be
stored this is to ensure that developers
can access the data later
database stores calls for an experience
and skilled full stack developer who
knows relational databases and database
storage Inside Out finally back in
programming languages like Ruby and PHP
while we have covered the two most
critical front-end languages that is the
HTML and CSS along with JavaScript the
other important part of software is the
backend while the backend development is
a whole new different game there's
plenty of programming languages to
choose so out of fetch the major
programming languages that I would like
to mention are Ruby PHP python Java
followed by the full stack developer we
have the mobile developers so the mobile
developer is the one who codes the
applications that run on mobile devices
such as smartphones and tablets mobile
development was almost unheard before
the early 2000s and the explosion
smartphone market before then mobile
development was considered as a subset
of embedded development so the major
programming languages that you might
want to consider to become a mobile
developer are
bison kotlin JavaScript and Java so
majorly Java and kotlin are used for
Android development so the Ides and
Frameworks that you might want to learn
to become a mobile developer are visual
studio Android studio app code and
webstrom followed by that we will also
discuss some of the additional skills
that you might require to become a
mobile developer
you should have the ability to learn
quickly and you should also possess the
ability to interpret and follow the
technical plans followed by that you
should be having the major skill that is
the instantaneous problem solving skill
and finally strong communication skill
to understand your client requirement
followed by the mobile developer we will
enter into the desktop developer
so the desktop developer is the one who
works on software applications that run
on desktop operating systems such as Mac
OS windows and Linux back in the 80s
these were one of the most common types
of developers popularized by inexpensive
development environments such as turbo
Pascal turbo C Visual Basic coax C
visual studio and Delphi so to become
one of the desktop developers you might
want to learn the following programming
languages and programming Ides or
Frameworks
so the programming languages that you
might want to learn are python full
JavaScript Java also the major Ides that
you might want to learn are visual
studio IntelliJ pycharm and netbeans
followed by that the additional skills
that you might require are
you should be able to build a reusable
code and reusable libraries code
optimization for maximum speed and
scalability of the desktop applications
and to use automated testing platforms
and write unit tests and finally to be
able to test debug and document any
custom codes that you might want to add
to your desktop application moving ahead
we shall enter into the next type of
developers which are the web Developers
so the web developers or the software
developers who specialize in creating
websites they either the front-end
developers or the backend developers or
sometimes even the complete full stack
developer
web development became a very common way
to enter the software engineering world
in the late 90s and early 2000s so the
major programming languages that you
might want to learn to become a web
developer are python CSS JavaScript and
PHP also the major Frameworks or the
Ides that you might require to become a
web developer are
Visual Studio IntelliJ Dreamweaver and
the pycharm
so some of the major additional skills
that you might require to become a web
developer are to understand the standard
lawsuits on web design copyrights you
might think that this is not a necessary
skill for you and there is a legal
department which will be taking care of
this but knowing a basic up-to-date
copyright laws is something you should
keep in mind especially when you are a
part of a large development project
where your team is given a lot of
creative control likewise if you are
coding entrepreneur trying to build the
next Facebook or Twitter knowing
copyright and cyber loss regarding
privacy could either mean a success to
you or a devastating lawsuit over your
head
so it's better you know some basic
lawsuits on web design copyrights
followed by that you should be having
some strong basics of HTML and followed
by that you should be well versed with
Version Control Systems and finally you
should have some decent knowledge of
debugging tools
so with this we enter into our next type
of developer which is the graphics
developer
so the graphics developer is specialized
in writing software for rendering
lighting shadowing shading curling and
management of scenes these developers
are often responsible for integrating
Technologies in gaming and video
production industry
graphic development used to be a form of
low level development requiring advanced
math and computer science training
it is becoming more accessible with the
introduction of commercial and open
source Frameworks for example very few
people today are able to write a Shader
from scratch so the basic programming
languages and the programming Ides or
Frameworks that you might require to
become a graphics developer or C plus
plus and c and similarly the idea is
that you might require a opengl webgl
DirectX and unity
so some of the additional skills that
you might require to become a graphics
developer are
understanding the client requirement as
it is a key to create a successful
project
followed by that creativity is one of f
note the most important skill for a
graphics designer and finally having a
sound knowledge of HTML and fundamentals
of programming languages such as C plus
plus and c will be an added weight on
your resume next ahead we have the data
scientist
so a data scientist is a special type of
developer who writes software programs
to analyze data sets they are often in
charge of statistical analysis machine
learning data visualization and
predictive modeling so the important
programming languages that you might
want to learn to become a data scientist
are are programming language MySQL
Python and even sometimes Java so the
important Frameworks or IDs that you
might require to become a data scientist
are and Shop with a notebook spider
pycharm and rstudio so some of the
additional skills that you might require
to become a data scientist are these
knowledge of data edl2 status data
extraction data transformation and the
loading a data scientist has multiple
data sources such as MySQL mongodb
Google analytics and many more so data
scientists have to extract data from
such sources and then transform it for
storing it in a proper format or
structure for the purposes of querying
an analysis so having fundamental
knowledge of aerial tools is always
important
so followed by that the next important
skill is the data visualization tools
like Tableau and
power bi results that cannot express are
considered ineffective
hence using some top-notch data
visualization tools like Tableau and
power bi is really important for a data
scientist
followed by that we have communication
skills so communication skills are
really important to understand your
client requirement and help them with
the right data which he needs
so finally the Big Data Frameworks most
of the organizations are using big data
analytics to gain hidden business
insights it is therefore a must-have
skill for data scientists so with this
we will move ahead into the next type of
developer which has the big data
developer
so what exactly is a big data developer
so big data developer is the one who
writes software programs to store and
retrieve wise amounts of data and
systems such as data warehouses
relational databases data Lake
management systems Etc using the most
crucial tools which are the extract
transform and load
so some of the major programming
languages and the Frameworks that you
might require to become a big data
developer are
scalar programming language are
programming language Java most
importantly and next is the python so
the major Frameworks that you might
require to become a big DNA developer
are Jupiter notebook spider Python and
Apache Spark so Apache spark is a
processing layer similar to mapreduce so
this is the fastest processing layer
compared to mapreduce so I prefer you to
learn the basic terminologies and the
components of Hadoop along with Apache
spark processing layer so followed by
this we should also learn some
additional skills required to become a
big data developer
so the additional skills include to be
capable enough to design build and
install configure and support the Hadoop
system working on Desperate data sets
create scalable and high performance web
services for tracking data maintain
security and data privacy so for Hadoop
we have Kerberos for security and data
privacy and finally high speed querying
so high speed querying can be done by
Frameworks such as Hive hbase Etc so
finally we will enter into the last type
of developer in today's session which is
the cyber security developer
so who exactly is a cyber security
developer so the cyber security
developer specializes in trading systems
methods and procedures to test the
security of software system and exploit
and fix the security flaws so this type
of developer often works as a white hat
ethical hacker and attempts to penetrate
systems to discover their
vulnerabilities so the major programming
languages and Frameworks that are cyber
security developer must know are python
JavaScript and PHP also the important
Frameworks that the cyber security
developer must know are Information
Security Management Systems CIS controls
and nist CSF adding on to that the
important additional skills that a cyber
security developer must know are the
fundamentals of hacking to be a cyber
security developer you need to think
like a hacker to fully understand how a
system could be breached and in turn
creative effective solutions to stop
these attacks from penetrating into your
system
followed by that the next important
skill is to have a fundamental knowledge
of computer forensics so what if your
efforts fail and your confidential data
gets recovered even after you destroy
every single clue of it while computer
forensics and cyber security are two
separate Fields they actually are
closely related so having a foundation
on computer forensics can help you Excel
your cyber security career followed by
that the next important skill is to pay
attention to every single detail so
being confident is good but being ready
is not a crime
being a cyber security developer you
will be responsible for continuous
network monitoring and will need to be
able to quickly identify concerns and
come up with real-time Security
Solutions to address them
so whether you give some attention to
every single detail and be ready for the
next Potential Threat so the last
additional skill is fundamentals of
cross-platform security cyber security
isn't just limited to computers you'll
need to be comfortable working on
variety of operating systems computer
systems mobile devices Cloud networks
and wireless networks and to keep up to
date on advances in the field of all of
them
with that we have come to an end of this
session on software development
fundamentals tutorial if you have any
