now without further ado let's get
started with the agenda for today's
session
first we will get started with what is
an algorithm
followed by that we will look into the
characteristics of algorithm
next we will learn how to write an
algorithm
moving ahead we will look at algorithm
analysis and algorithm complexities
after that we will discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of
algorithms and finally we will see some
differences between algorithms and
programming
i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda now let's get started with the
first point that is what exactly is an
algorithm
how does algorithm work in real life
so we'll have a use case here
on my screen we have a lady and she is
shreya shreya wants to make some tea and
for that she is following some steps
so the first step is she'll take a pan
and fill it with water and place it on a
gas stove
followed by that the second step is
she'll make sure that the water comes to
a nice boil and then she adds some tea
leaves and sugar followed by step 2 we
have step 3 where she'll allow the leaf
to be fully expanded and she'll add some
milk after that
next we have the stefo where she will
wait for the tea to come for a good
decent boil
next we have step 5 where she'll turn
off the gas and she'll take the pan off
from the stove and the tea is ready to
get filtered and lastly we have the step
6 where she is all set with the tea
in computer science an algorithm is a
method or set of rules that we must be
following to perform some specific
calculations or other problem solving
operations
as a result an algorithm is a collection
of rules or instructions that govern how
a work needs to be conducted step by
step to achieve the desired results to
accomplish a task
we first provide some input and then
follow a sequence of steps to acquire
the required outcome of the input so
that is the fundamental definition of an
algorithm and we also had a use case and
now we will move ahead and understand
the characteristics of algorithms
so basically we have six characteristics
of algorithm so the first one is it
should be clear and unambiguous the
second one is that it has to be well
defined inputs and the third one is that
it has to be having well-defined outputs
as well the fourth property of an
algorithm is its feasibility followed by
that
finiteness and finally we have language
independence
now we will look into each one of the
characteristics in detail so first we
have clear and unambiguous so this
statement is the one which states that
the algorithm should be straightforward
simple and easily readable
each one of its steps should be distinct
in every way and lead it to a single
conclusion
so the next one is it should be having
well-defined inputs so this means that
an algorithm should indicate what output
can be expected as well as the input
should be properly well-defined now we
have the third one similarly we should
also have well-defined outputs so the
well-defined output characteristics of
an algorithm means that the algorithm
must clearly indicate what output can be
expected as well as the output should
also be well defined followed by the
third characteristic we have the fourth
characteristic that is the finiteness of
algorithm so the finiteness of algorithm
says that the algorithm must be finite
and it must not result in infinite loops
or similar situations
so followed by the fourth one we have
the fifth characteristic that defines
about the feasibility of an algorithm
so feasibility of an algorithm states
that the algorithm must be really simple
generic and practical
it must be able to be executed with
resources available
now the last characteristic of the
algorithm is being independent of the
language
so it means that the algorithm should be
defined in such a way that it is
completely independent of the language
it must be simple instructions that can
be implemented using any programming
language
so these were the six major
characteristics of algorithm now let's
move ahead and understand how to write
an algorithm
writing an algorithm does not have any
hard and fast rules
next algorithms are never created to
support a specific programming language
as we all know algorithm should be
capable enough to support the
conditional statements such as if if
else switch etc
an algorithm should be capable enough to
execute some of the conditional
statements such as if if else switch etc
and also it must be capable to execute
the iterative statements such as for
loop while loop do while loop etc
we usually create algorithms in a
step-by-step manner however this isn't
always the case
after the problem domain has been well
defined algorithm writing is a procedure
that is carried out
we build an algorithm to find a solution
to a problem a problem can be resolved
in a variety of ways let's look at an
example of how to write an algorithm
consider the following scenario we need
to create an algorithm to determine the
largest number among the three given
numbers x y and z as a result the
initial solution to the problem can be
written in this manner so we begin with
reading all the three numbers and in the
second step we will have a condition
that says if x is greater than y we will
proceed to step four else we will
proceed to step 5.
next in step 4 we establish a condition
that if x is greater than z then x is
the largest of the three numbers
otherwise z is the largest
if y is greater than z z will be the
greatest number otherwise y will be the
largest number amongst all the three in
step five
and the procedure will be terminated
let's have a look at what the next
solution has to offer in this algorithm
we begin by reading all the three
variables then compare all the three
numbers in the third step to determine
the largest number which is if x is
greater than y then there is another if
else statement that states that if x is
greater than y then x is largest
otherwise z is the largest
then this if else statement which says
that if y is greater than z then y is
greater otherwise z is the greatest of
the three numbers so this is how we have
multiple solutions to the same problem
so after discussing these solutions we
will move ahead and understand algorithm
analysis
the algorithm may be studied in two
levels first before it is made and then
after it is created the two analysis of
an algorithm are as follows the first
one is priori analysis and the second
one is the post analysis so first we
will talk about the priori analysis
priori analysis refers to the
theoretical analysis of an algorithm
performed before its implementation
before implementing the algorithm other
parameters such as processor speed might
be considered
which does not affect the implementation
component next we will talk about post
analysis
a practical analysis of an algorithm is
called as posterior analysis and it
utilizes any computer language to build
the algorithm the purpose of this
analysis is to determine how much time
and space the algorithm takes to operate
now after being understood the algorithm
analysis we will be able to comprehend
the algorithm complexity two methods can
be used to assess the algorithm
complexity the first one is time
complexity which states that the amount
of time required to finish an
algorithm's execution is known as its
time complexity
followed by time complexity the other
one is the space complexity which is
calculated by the quantity of space
required to solve a problem and produce
an output of space complexity of an
algorithm
let's take a closer look at these
complexities
now we will begin with time complexity
of an algorithm the big o notation is
used to express an algorithm's time
complexity the asymptomatic notation is
used to depict temporary complexity of
big o notation
the time complexity is mainly determined
by counting the number of steps required
to complete the task
let's take a look at an example to
understand this time complexity in a
much better way
if we want to find out a multiplication
of n numbers we can do it by executing a
loop from 1 to n then calculating
multiplication when the loop ends then
multiplication holds the n numbers
multiplication and last we return the
calculated multiplication
the loop statements time complexity will
be at least n and when the number of n
increases the time complexity will also
increase
while the code's complexity that is
returns multiplication will remain
constant because its value is unaffected
by the value of n and it will obtain the
result in every single step
next we will discuss about space
complexity which is expressed with big o
notation just as time complexity
these four items are stored in space
complexity it initially saves program
instructions then stores constant values
then stores variable values and finally
it keeps track of function cells jumping
statements and so on the sum of
auxiliary space and input size is used
to calculate space complexity the extra
space or temporary space used by an
algorithm is referred to an auxiliary
space after learning about algorithm
complexity we will look at some of the
algorithms pros and cons so let's start
with the advantages of algorithms
firstly algorithms are easy to
understand
next algorithms are step-by-step
representation of a solution and lastly
the problem is broken down into smaller
bits or steps in an algorithm making it
easier for the programmer now an
algorithm also have various drawbacks
one of which being it takes long time to
write hence it is time consuming
second con of the algorithm is
algorithms make it harder to demonstrate
branching and looping statements
so followed by the advantages and
disadvantages of algorithms we now enter
into the final segment where we discuss
the differences between algorithms and
programming so the first difference is
that
an algorithm is a type of programming on
the other hand a program is more
directly associated with the computer
performing one or more tasks but an
algorithm is more of a notation a
technique for solving a problem
now let us discuss the second difference
an algorithm can be decoded or run by a
human whereas the program is only run or
decoded by a set of compilers of the
computer
now the third difference
basically an algorithm is a design of
the solution to the problem
here we can only analyze the solution
but we can never run it
but whereas on the other hand
programming is completely a different
ballgame here you can directly implement
a certain phase or an entire program and
test the programs and get an output
so the fourth and the last difference
between an algorithm and programming is
an algorithm is written using natural
human vocabulary
whereas programs are written using any
programming language such as c c plus
plus java python etc
now with that we have come to an end of
this tutorial on what is an algorithm if
