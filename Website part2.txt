so the goodness of this site is again
when you're entering into the exam when
you're starting the exam it's going to
ask the password again so again you need
to type the password so it is we heard
all of the multi-level security because
the protocols or the analysis in this
site is a bit high-end okay so I mean no
need to check out all these things or
the instructions because these
instructions are taken from your need
okay neat aspect because need you will
have a similar screen so you just need
to click this and you need to go for I
am ready to begin so this is the
examination this is how it won't start
see the first question that is MTI can
be used for all of the following except
ok so the answer is ok none of the above
so now you have a multiple options here
you can go for next so one question is
answered so this color is and for
example if you want to keep this
question as mark for review so so info
is it is mark for review so a review is
a low color okay so for example if you
want to clear the response for example
next question you thought it as Massell
but it's wrong so if you wanted to get
the response click on clear the response
and go for that right answer ok so this
is how you need to handle this make sure
if you are planning to open a new thing
or if you are planning to come out of
this or if you're planning to go for any
other thing it's going to ask it's going
to ask because
if you see this see this statement if
you navigate three times out of the
window your exam will be automatically
submitted means it is warning you please
don't go this is an exam please don't go
out of this try to focus on the exam it
is warning you if you repeatedly do that
okay so please try to avoid this so if
you repeatedly do this it's going to
submit right so now it's going to
clearly ask like are you sure to submit
this and if it does submit so the
questions will be submitted and next is
directly you can go to navigate to the
result
