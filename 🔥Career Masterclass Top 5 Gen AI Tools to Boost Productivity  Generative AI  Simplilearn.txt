introduce simply learn simply learn is
world's number one online boot camp we
have been uh providing online courses
for a variety of topics including AI
machine learning data science business
analytics cyber security and so on we

we are operational in over 150 plus
countries uh we have about 40 plus
global accreditions and about 800 plus

we have we'll be discussing what the
Genera in brief uh then we will get into
the right into the meat of the session

geni tools we also have some bonus tools
at the end if you have some additional
time and we also will be introducing the
bonus free courses as well followed by a
quick Q&A session at the
end I'll just quickly look at the
chat let's get started so what uh before
we begin sorry uh we have a poll
question for everybody we would like to
know how many of years how many years of
experience do you currently have have
I'll quickly run a
poll so the poll is launched uh you may
be currently studying you may be 0 to
three years of experience 3 to 5 years
experience or more than five years of
experience please punch in your
responses I'll keep the poll open for
another 10 15 seconds so that everybody
is able to
answer uh great I can see the responses
already I would request all of you to
please punch in your responses this will
help us understand our audience and
tailor the session
accordingly I'll keep the poll open for
another 10 seconds before I close it I
would request all of you to punch in
your
responses great great great great great
I'll end the poll
now so as I can can see uh I just
quickly share the results as well to
everybody to see we have about 30% of
our audience currently studying about
20% in the 0 to three years of bracket
about five years in the three to five
years and a majority of our audience are
more than five years of experience
that's great to
know moving on so what really is
generative AI uh we have been hearing
this term time and again in the recent
past and what really is geni I would
love if we have an active audience you
can punch in your answers as well in the
chat as well uh so quickly going taking
you through the definition so generative
AI is one of the types of artificial
intelligence that can help you create
new content or data that didn't exist
before so uh this may include text
images music or anything such sort of
things so what are the really the
benefits of generative AI uh it helps
enhancing your creativity so if if you
have something like a writer's block
you're not able to write any content or
come up with new ideas it can help you
to enhance your creativity it provides
the tools for humans to enhance their
creative process uh it helps in
efficiency and productivity that's what
we here for how can tools help you
improve your productivity it automates
the generation of various types of
content saving time and resources and
accessibility it makes it easier for
people without any specific skills to
create content and so
on so that was about generative and its
benefits quickly let's get into the meat
of the session live demo
so uh I would like to ask the audience
what are
the top geni tools that you have used in
your daily life like do you use on a
daily basis the chat is open I would
love to see some
responses charge yes uh I think this is
one of the most common mid Journey
people have using
Gemini Bing AI Char jbd Excel oh great
great great so we have an experienced
crowd today so I'm glad uh it's a very
interactive crowd chat jpt is one of the
most common answers so yes let's get
started with chart
GPD I'll quickly change my screen so
this is basically the screen which you
must most of you might have seen of
chart
jpt so basically chat jpt is a chat B
where you can help uh yourself with some
chatting and asking
it just looking through the chat you
have any
questions great great I love to see
this so basically chat jpt is a chat B
you can basically ask it anything around
the world maybe I'll just give an
example uh say create
uh
email title for uh job application
email or let me say create a
few so this will read your response and
create some responses for your
application proposition your full name
these are some of the uh types it has
given the email title
copies so it gives you a plethora of
options which you can pick and choose
similarly you can ask it for anything
you
want great so let's get a little bit
complicated with the so you can ask for
uh a lot of things like create email
copies create uh blogs topics even
recipes
or brilliant anything in everything so
uh one thing Ive noticed is that people
use it very in know like how I just
created a prompt here saying create a
few email title for job application this
is a very plain prompt so to get better
responses and how you can make best use
of chat GP you need to give a proper
context and
tell chat GPT what exactly you want so
I'll give you an example uh if just
imagine you are the uh Chief marketing
officer of a company and you are
launching a new product so how would you
uh create
um marketing strategy for your new
product so basically a beginner who is
using just started using chat jpt you
can say create a
marketing plan for Save for example we
are doing a market research for a say
you're starting your
own and you want to launch it in a city
maybe I for example I'll take a
Bangalore City so create a marketing
plan for a cab
service
provider and let's see what is the
response
it can say executive summary situation
analysis maret
analysis competitor
analysis spot analysis so it's basically
telling us what we can do as part of our
marketing
plan it's amazing isn't it how it's
generating the
responses if you think this is amazing
please put in put it in the chat it's
amazing I would also show you how to use
it
better budget it's given us strategies
and tactics the budget measurement and
evaluation
kpis and so on timeline implementation
amazing
and implementation and finally
conclusions marketing plan nams to have
position the cap service provider great
great great great so now I can this is a
basic plan it has given me which has 10
points so basically it has told me what
exactly to do to get started with the
marketing plan so now as an experienced
CH jpt user I will show you how exactly
you can use it better so it can create a
better response so uh I will quickly I
already have a resp
prompt Yeah so basically you need to
give a context and tell charge to act in
a certain way so let's begin how to
start writing a effective prompt so you
can say act as a
chief getting officer of a cab service
providing
company
uh so basically give it some context
that you are a chief marketing officer
you have to act as a chief marketing
officer of a cap service providing
company uh then you can add your prompt
I'll quickly paste it paste The Prompt
so I don't waste time typing so I've
written create a detailed marketing plan
for a new cap service in Bangalore City
give it proper context give it as many
uh lines as possible so it can create a
better response our main competitors
will be Ola and Uber
as we have create a detailed comparison
on their features and how we should
project ourselves to stay ahead of them
so you're looking to launch your own cap
service and it's better you study the
competitors first before entering the
market so give it proper context and now
let's see what kind of magic chat does
I'll just press
enter it has started generating
the
meanwhile I'll just quickly go through
the chat if you have any
questions so somebody has asked about
chat gity pricing so the basic plan is
obviously free you can do a lot of
things with the basic plan itself if you
are going to use it uh extensively I
would recommend you to take the paid
plan but that is not necessary you can
do a lot of things with the basic plan
as
well so let's see what it has given exe
it's started with an executive summary
this marketing plan aims to publish
situation analysis market analysis
competitor analysis so it has also given
uh about each of your competitors you
can add more competitors so you'll get a
better idea you can add multiple things
here it has given me about Ola about
Uber what are the strengths weaknesses
opportunities and it's a complete SWAT
analysis in the earlier prompt it had
just told me you can do a SWAT analysis
you can say assess the company's
strength weaknesses it's just that but
when I gave it a better prompt it
actually gave me what are the strengths
what are the weaknesses opportunities
and threats marketing
objectives Strate strategies and tactics
so you can understand how different the
response is when you give it a better uh
prompt so do you think this is amazing
how you
can improve the prompts basically give
it a context say tell it act as a if you
if if you're planning to write a blog on
say top digital marketing Trends in 2024
so you need to give it a context saying
that act as a SEO based content writer
of a leading publishing company uh you
need to write an article on so and so
topic and analyze so and so URLs or your
competitors and then it will be in a
better position to generate a better
article for you so that's uh beginner
charity uh users will just say write a
blog on so and so topic and that's it so
it it will have its inputs in a limited
form and it will create the outputs also
in a limited form once you give that
more context it will be able to give you
better results so that is the point here
so here we can see Implement it's given
me an implementation timeline phase one
first three months then for to 6 months
7 to 12 months and a conclusion so the
two different prompts have created
different uh results and the second one
is obviously the better one so do you
think this tool can be used in a lot of
ways and it's an amazing
tool
so what somebody has asked what is the
uses of chat GPT for a student students
can it's amazing students uh you can use
it to uh learn different skills uh get
your doubts cleared uh then maybe get
assignment answers uh get project ideas
how can Implement a particular
project lot of things it's a great tool
to use certainly
uh and the opportunities are endless but
due to the shortage of time we will be
discussing only a few points uh there
are lot many more tools coming up so
please stay
tuned yes uh somebody said you can also
give it uh you can also tell the tool to
give you a more comprehensive answer if
you're not obviously yes if you're not
satisfied with this answer you can
always chat again and type in your
responses here so it'll create another
output for it great Point moving
on the next tool we will uh before that
uh I would like to introduce uh

like a featured image for your blog so
say example create a featured
image for my
blog uh say I'll use the
same today's topic top five gen
tools here and say
enter so image creation takes a bit of
time so it will take a few seconds
before it creates an
image meanwhile I'll just go through the
chat and
so yeah uh this is a topic so this uh
chart GPT Di has created two images for
our blog image uh how cool is this image

won't have any copyright issues uh with
this image you can use it in your blog
and the publish your blogs as you can
always tell it to change give it a

change it if you don't like the text you
can change it you don't like the image
you can change it and you can change the
bullet points it has given some bullet
points here as well the first tool

line of input so imagine if you give
them the perfect prompt it will create
the almost perfect product it has given
you a conclusion as well with some stats
which are obviously taken from certain
sources but certainly it has done the
job in just five minutes not even five
minutes I can say a minute or so so how
cool is this
tool I hope uh you guys are taking notes
and uh give taking the links of
these and
uh it can help you to do a report as
well yes once data is shared you can do
it with chat GPT as well chat GPT also
uh the pro version obviously but uh it
also allows you to upload some files
maybe like an Excel file which have a
lot of data a CSV file and it will
always give you insights from that so
chat jpt is one tool which will which is
amazing and I have used it myself so yes
I can vouch for
that how cool is this
gamma great great great for coding yes
we will get
there can I use it my data yes uh you
can always give it another PPT with data
it will refine it it will make it
better so let moving on how cool was
this uh we have many more tools coming
your way so stay tuned moving on we have
the next tool which is descript so
similarly if you have to do PPT I'm sure
some of you must be working with videos
creating videos and how many of
you create videos on a daily basis are
graphic designers or video
creators yes you can give it your own
content and have create pbts yes some
yes yes there are people from media team
as well and they create videos so this
all this tool is for you guys or even
for content creator on Instagram or
Facebook uh you find it difficult to
create videos I have a very cool tool
called the descript so I will take you
through that so similarly uh you need
to uh log to descript something called
descript
doc escript
need to log in it's a free tool to begin
with get certain credits you can create
a certain number of videos once you
login you'll have a dashboard like
this uh let me start by creating a new
video so you get an idea of how to use
this new video
project so yeah so once you are here you
can say media uh there is
a a library of free videos which you can
use so I can select any one
video some video just to show you how
this tool is here you need to enter your
text the video is being loaded here says
loading
media so if you want some voice over uh
you can what better tool to use than
chat GPT itself I quickly go to chat
GPT I just have a look at the video
first it was something to
do
text
[Music]
motivation video of 20
[Music]
seconds
okay you can write your own text as well
uh you can just pick up what chart it
gives you just pick up this add it to
your tool
here it has taken
the add the text here can add a speaker
uh there is a stock a list of stocks
speakers different uh voices and so you
can just pick up anybody I'll just pick
up Al
here and just add a
title
sample then I
will
publish so you just need to publish the
video video here can just play the video
before sure if you guys can hear it but
there is a voice over which is being
spoken with these
words
once you click hit publish it take some
time so that it SNS all the video with
the text and the voice
over meanwhile I'll just check the chat
if I got any
questions yeah you won't be able to go
the voice I just copy the link
so yeah your video is
ready you all you can all you guys can
also try it on your own on your systems
as
well uh were you guys able to hear
the
voice no okay sorry uh but there is a
voice over
uh so you basically get the idea right
so it has created a video with a sample
video and a text it has a voiceover I'm
just not able to figure out how I can
play the audio as well but it has an
audio and it is actually speaking these
text and it has created a video so you
can
always create uh videos in Just 2
minutes descript Watermark you can
remove it yes obviously you can remove
it uh uh you need to buy the pro verion
but yes you will have certain
limits Yeah so basically you get the
idea you get can create videos you can
create text you can create images in
just a click of a button so I'm sure all
you video editors and creators are glad
to figure out that such tools exist
there are many more tools like this like
in
video uh this is descript and many other
tools you can always check these out
online and create your videos so I hope
you found this tool helpful if yes
please put it in the
chat
and great great great great
great you can all you guys I would
request you to all try it out on your
own as well you can actually hear the
voice over you can change the voice over
change the name of the person uh make it
into a female voice or male
voice great great great moving on let's
move on to the next Tool uh I have a
very interesting tool tool called the
Merlin AI so it's basically
a Chrome
extension which you can use for multiple
things I'll give you a simple
Chrome just Google for
this get the Chrome extension here
Google
logo go to the page say add to your
Chrome or
whatever
extension browser you're
using so once it is
added you'll be able to
login you need to login with your Google
account that's it uh so one of the key
uh applications of Merlin is uh using
YouTube so I will quickly show you what
I use it for I'll go to YouTube
uh if you are if you usually when you
have a long videos right so I'll say go
to the pr simply learned
channel here if there are like now for
example this
video say top 10 Technologies to learn
in
2024 thank you please skip the ad so
this is the video on simply learn
Channel and this is the Merlin extension
so what this Merin extension will help
you do is if you are don't have the time
to listen to long long videos like maybe
20 minutes 30 minutes it will help you
summarize this video so now I'll say
just summarize this video and it is
creating a summary and now here you can
see it has created a summary so it has
given me points with the Tim stamps so
according to to in 2023 60% of
profession from non- Tech careers to
Tech careers it has given me pointers
what the person is saying in the
video uh how different Technologies are
revolutionizing that video is about top
10 Technologies to learn so it has given

videos you can always use this extension
and summarize your videos this is a gen
AI tool which uh uses learning models
and it will help you summarize videos

forth it has a lot of uh
applications uh did you find this tool
helpful great great great how many of
you will use any of these tools in your
day-to-day
life I hope you're finding the
session
helpful amazing amazing
amazing which is the best tool you like
till today till now which you think
really will change your life charp Merin
gamma charp oh amazing I we have a great
audience to a really interactive
one
awesome awesome
awesome moving on so since you have been
a good audience I have a little more
time so I will have quickly running
through two bonus tools uh which I have
planned for you guys one is something
called so how many of you use Excel in
your daily
life but
are not good at it or you cannot
remember the formula or
anything great so we have the Right
audience today so one amazing tool I use
on a daily basis for my Excel needs is
something called Formula dog you need to
Google it say keep on the link
and so uh we have a lot of formulas in
Excel it's practically impossible to
remember or so what you can do is you
can just type what you want and this
tool will create the formula for so I'll
just say I'm just I'll just give you a
short example so that we don't waste
much time but you can put in anything
and everything even the most complicated
formulas will be generated here so I
will say
U if you if I have a Excel sheet with
text and it has links in it and you want
to separate the links from that so I can
say uh create a
formula which
will
separate separate uh URL
links
from the my link
text
that's it we have
to save this and generate
formula let's see what it gives
us so it has given us a formula if is
number find so answer add
HTTP I think this is the right formula
you can always copy this paste it in
your Excel and find it I'll give you a
simpler example say add two
numbers from
column one and
two baste the
answer the fifth
column some a this is a simple one but
it has created a formula you can just
pick up this copy it in your Excel sheet
and get done with this so even if
you you come across like something you
need to do maybe compare two columns get
the highest number pick up the header
from there and pick put it up in that
desired cell you can type anything you
want and it will create a formula for
you so it has uh if you're using msxl
use the msxl tab if you're using sheets
you can use sheets add table motion it
has a lot of options well
similarly if uh if somebody some of your
boss or manager gives you an Excel sheet
and says just provide insights and you
just can't figure out what is happening
in the entire sheet it has like
thousands of rows and columns and you
unable to even figure out what formula
is there so one good option is uh just
Google for
some duplicated Serv
formula
say I'll copy this formula so you can't
figure out what formula this is so you
can use Formula
dog click on the explain button or for
my Ms XF formula I'll just past the
formula here and say explain this
formula to
this formula calculates the remainder
when the value in cell A2 is divided by
three how cool is this put in whatever
formula you want here and it will
explain it in simple words and you will
be able to understand what exactly is in
the formula this will help you figure
out whatever formula you
want how cool is this tool this is one
of the bonus tools I decided to share it
with you guys
today
yes it generates a VB code you can write
see here VBA code and use this and
create your VBA code as
well before we close the session for
today I have another
tool is called the code
D how many of are you how many of you
guys are in
coding or do coding for a
living SQL mean python
great studing
coding and how many of you get inated
when you find bugs in your code which
you never
expected great great great great great
so I'll show you a cool tool which will
help you find all your box how cool is
that so A Tool called Cod Dam so here is
a tool cam.com
do/ so you can be working in any
platform say python JavaScript or
anything I'll just pick up one language
and one program today I not a coder
myself so I will be using the most
common
probably simple example maybe a
JavaScript code I'll tell chat GPD to
create the code first so that I don't
have to write break my head and write
the code create a
JavaScript oh yes
and Char helps you code AS so you can
write whatever you want create a
JavaScript code to say add two
numbers it's a very simple code please
don't judge me so I would say create a
simple JavaScript code this it has given
a
code
great so I quickly copy this code and go
to my code D it's a JavaScript
code enter the code here so function add
two numbers number one number two return
number one plus number two so obviously
this is a perfect code created by chart
gbd doesn't have any bugs so I will
create a bug I'll just
say I'll just say
number so I created a b here so I'll
just say start solving can be any
complicated code I just use a simple
code for giving an example so here it
has created Hey a it looks like there's
a small error in your code the function
parameter name should match the names
used in the function so these should
match the function it as says number one
number two R number one number two if
you need any code assistance
coding that's it how cool is this to it
has detected the bug in the code and it
has corrected the code and it has given
me so I can use this in my code and go
ahead how cool is this tool you can put
any it is free it's it is a free tool
yes so if you want to uh go to a higher
uh upgrade version they also have a pro
version but most of it is is
free blackbox doai is another code uh
generative AI tool for the same purpose
yes somebody pointed out
so uh I'm getting a lot of questions
about this tool if you can upload Cs and
stuff like that but uh I'm not an expert
but I would recommend you download these
tools these are free to use tools
