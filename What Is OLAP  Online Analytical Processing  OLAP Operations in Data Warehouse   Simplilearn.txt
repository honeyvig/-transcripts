hello everyone and welcome to this
amazing video on what is olap by simply
learn overlap and acronym for online
analytical processing is a technology
that allows for the extraction
transformation and loading of data in
order to perform complex analytics and
create interactive Dynamic visualization
IT addresses the shortcomings of the
data warehouse by providing improved
query performance and allowing for the
creation of ad hoc queries and advanced
analytics the concept of olap was
introduced by Edgar F Court Arbor sbase
was the first olap product released on
the market and is known as the solution
to the problem of long query times in
data warehousing olap works by
pre-calculating all the aggregate
measures in an index data structure
optimized for retrieval the result is a
cube that can be visualized in a dynamic
and initiative way olap is known as a
powerful tool for enterprise-wide
adoption and for providing users with a
drag and drop interface that speed up
the learning curve sounds fascinating
right well olap still persists as one of
the most in-demand analytic systems
because it allows non-experts to ask
questions of business data let's explore
more about olap in this video on that
note elevate your professional growth
through this data analytics program
developed in partnership with Purdue
University and in collaboration with IBM
this comprehensive program offers master
classes and adapts an applied learning
approach that incorporates real life
projects and business case studies to
enhance your practical skills this data
analytics program spans crucial topics
such as establishing a strong foundation
in statistics utilizing Python and our
languages for data analysis mastering
SQL for database interactions and
leveraging Tabu and power bi for
impactful data visualizations check out
the course Link in the description for
more details since we already have an
understanding of what olap is from the
introduction let's now explore into it
further by exploring the working of olap
system the online analytical process
working involves several steps to
analyze and report on data from multiple
Dimensions here's an overview of the
typical olap process olap works by
integration of data from various sources
followed by structuring it into
multi-dimensional model the data is
organized that contain Dimensions
measures and pre-calculated applications
user formulates queries to retrieve and
analyze data leveraging the engine's
optimizations for the fast query
execution the olap system supports
multi-dimensional analysis enabling
slicing dicing drill down and drill up
operations reporting and visualization
capabilities facelates data presentation
periodic maintenance involves refreshing
data and recalculating aggregations to
ensure accuracy and relevance chart
here's are the main steps involved in
the typical process of an olap system
data modeling Cube creation query
formulation query execution
multi-dimensional analysis reporting and
visualization the olap process enables
users to analyze data interactively
perform complex calculations and gain
insights by exploring data from multiple
Dimensions it facilitates flexible and
ad hoc reporting empowering users to
make informed decision based on the
comprehensive data analysis the three
main types of olap that is online
analytical processing systems are
designed to cater to specific analytical
needs these types are multi-dimensional
olap that is M olap M olap system stores
data in a multi-dimensional array or
cube format data is pre-aggregated and
organized based on Dimensions measures
and hierarchies Mo lab offers fast query
performance and support complex
calculation it is suitable for
applications that require quick analysis
of aggregated data such as financial
analysis sales forecasting and bird
dating however Mo lab may need help with
scalability when dealing with the large
data sets next relational olap that is
RO lab Rolex system stores data in a
relational database management system
instead of pre-aggregating data our olap
system perform on the Fly aggregations
and calculations during query execution
aurolab provides more flexibility in
handling large data sets and complex
data relationships it is suitable for
applications that require detailed ad
hook analysis across multiple Dimensions
however lab systems may experience lower
query performance than immolab mainly
when dealing with complex queries
involving large volume of data and next
type of olap is hybrid olap his olap
systems combines the feature of Mo lab
and Arbol app they leverage the
advantages of both types by storing
aggregated data in a multi-dimensional
format similar to Ebola while allowing
the options to access detailed data from
a relational database similar to ro lab
ho lab systems provide a balance between
query performance and flexibility they
are suitable for applications that
require a mix of detail and summarize
data analysis hybrid olap systems can
handle both ad hoc analysis and
predefined aggregation efficiently
analytical processing systems offer
various operations that allow users to
analyze and manipulate data from
different perspectives here are the main
types of olap operations first we have
slice slicing involves selecting a
subset of a data from the olap Cube
based on specific criteria or value of
one or more Dimensions it allows users
to focus on a particular segment of the
data for example let's say you want to
analyze the sales data for a specific
City like New York you can use the olap
system to slice the data and focus on
sales figure for New York only this will
give you a clear view of your business
performance in that City and next we
have dice dicing is similar to slicing
but involves creating a new Cube by
selecting specific dimensions and their
corresponding values it allows users to
examine data across multiple Dimensions
simultaneously for example you want to
analyze sales for a specific City for
example New York and a specific product
category like Electronics by dicing the
data you can create a new view that
shows sales figures for electronics in
New York only this lets you understand
how well your electronic products
perform in that specific City next drill
down drill down enables users to
navigate from a higher level of
aggregations to a lower level of detail
within a Dimensions it involves
expanding the view of data to reveal
more specific information like for
example you can drill down from yearly
to quarterly monthly and even daily
sales this will help you identify Trends
and patterns at different levels of
granularity allows you to see if there
are any specific periods when sales are
particularly high or low next drill up
or roll up drill up or roll up as the
reverse of drill down it allows users to
navigate from a lower level of details
to a higher level of aggregations within
a dimension it involves some Rising data
to a higher level of hierarchy or
consolidations for examples user can
drill from daily to monthly or yearly
sales data to understand overall Trends
and performance and lastly we have pivot
pivoting involves rotating the axis of
the multi-dimensional cube to view data
from different dimensions it allows
users to recognize data and analyze it
from alternative perspective for example
let's say you want to analyze sales data
by city and product category by pivoting
the data you can change the perspective
and view sales figures for each product
categories across all cities this will
give you a comprehensive overview of how
different product categories perform in
different cities helping you decide on
product assortment or marketing
strategies
and next online analytical processing
has various applications across
Industries and sectors here are some
common applications of olap
financial analysis sales and marketing
analytics Supply Chain management
Healthcare analytics human resource
analytics and many more and with this we
