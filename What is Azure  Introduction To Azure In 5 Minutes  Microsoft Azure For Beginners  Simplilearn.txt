Cyra is a country singer and recently
she got sponsored by North American
Music company for her new album
she was really nervous and excited about
the performance once all songs were
recorded she was set to release the
album worldwide
so when she inquired about when it would
happen she realized she barely had one
week left
she panicked and ran to the manager of
that Music Company Mark to inquire how
everything like editing mixing
portfolios and promotions would be done
in just one week
that's when Mark answered don't you
worry our production is managed on
Microsoft azure Cyrus confused and asked
but isn't Azure at cloud service used to
store your data Mark smiled and answered
well it's true but Azure is not just
that but much more let me explain it to
you mark further explained that
Microsoft Azure is an open and flexible
Cloud platform for services such as
analytics virtual Computing storage
networking and more it offers a
constantly growing selection of products
and services designed to satisfy all of
your demands on a single practical
platform it enables its users to engage
in cloud computing and is designed to
manage tasks through Microsoft's data
centers a data center is a structure
with networked computers storage systems
and computational infrastructure that
organizations like us use to gather
process store and distribute massive
amounts of data
upon learning what Azure is used for she
was still unsure how it would help her
in the album release
Mark explained that in Azure every
production happens simultaneously every
day Azure builds Mission critical
solutions to analyze images comprehend
speech and make predictions using data
simultaneously hence multitasking he
further added that all the data of her
album for example footage and audio
travel securely to the cloud from even
the most remote locations all the data
is securely stored in the cloud which
can easily be accessed by the editors
and other production members immediately
on realizing every process would run in
parallel Cyro was under the impression
that all this would be a tedious and
time-consuming job then Mark answered no
only the data relevant to their role
would be accessible to them same
platform same tools same workflow but
just more efficient and secure
service started wondering ask that it
must cost them a fortune to use such
advanced technology Mark further
explained that the costs are easily
controllable so we only pay for what we
use and because our album is stored in
the cloud it's accessible from every
corner of the world for example
producers can review approve and make
changes in real time in video indexing
makes the album searchable and
understandable
Predictive Analytics makes the most of
marketing and distribution strategies
therefore no ad dollars are wasted or
seats are left empty secure distribution
means album releases smoothly and on
time as soon as the audience starts
watching and reacting to every
interaction Azure analyzes their viewing
habits to drive recommendations
advertising and personalization
this makes future production decisions
really easy zyro was relieved to
understand this new technology and how
it would help her build her future
career
