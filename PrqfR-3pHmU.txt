my name is Sunnah Bakshi and you might

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,290
be wondering why I just said video well

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,000
the reason is because this time I'm not

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,880
going over a tutorial well I haven't

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,990
