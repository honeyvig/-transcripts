explain why it is widely adopted
so hi guys welcome to another video by

so now let's begin by understanding what
is ruby
now developed by yukihiro matsumoto ruby
is one of the most popularly used
languages today
now it's the basis for frameworks like
ruby on rails and has an expressive and
easy to use syntax
now providing more than 60 000 libraries
ruby has its own definite set of
keywords and is a dynamically typed
language
now some features include it being a
free format language which means you can
start writing code from any line or
column and it's also case sensitive
it also has a set of reserved keywords
that are only used for specific tasks
and as mentioned it's a dynamic
programming language
some other key features include the fact
that ruby like java and python includes
exception management tools
it has a real mark and sweep garbage
collector ruby has threading that is os
independent and it's exceptionally
portable
so now that you know what ruby is let's
look at what ruby on rails is
now ruby on rails is a server-based mvc
framework for web development and app
programming
now an mvc framework is basically an
architectural pattern that separates the
application layer into a model view and
controller paths
now model relates to all the data logic
view relates to the ui logic of the
application and controller is an
interface between the model and the view
now rails again is a framework written
completely in ruby and it extends ruby
to solve problems without a programmer
having to reinvent anything
now ruby on rails developers prefer it
when writing code because it provides
ready-made code libraries for generating
forms menus tables etc
so this was a simple introduction to
ruby on rails
but you must also be wondering why is it
so popularly adopted so here are some of
the benefits of ruby on rails
first up is cost effective now ruby on
rails is an open source framework that
is completely free now it is simple to
use from the developer's perspective and
with the added advantage of tons of gems
the developer may save a lot of time and
work
next up is speed now ruby on rails comes
with many ready to use plugins and
modules so developers don't have to
waste time developing boilerplate code
talking about easy change management
with ruby on rails altering existing
code or adding new features to the site
is trivial making updates to your site
after it has been launched is
straightforward and quick
talking about security the framework is
installed and enabled by default along
with various security features now you
are following a secure development
procedure when you utilize ruby on rails
talking about efficiency rails employs
front-end and back-end abilities to
construct web applications right now
these are simple and easier to create
a single page web application employs
rails for the back end and possibly
another framework for the front end be
it angular or react now as a result the
application's best attributes are
reliant on ruby on rails so it makes it
extremely efficient
and lastly talking about a large
developer community ruby on rails has a
very active and thriving developer
community constantly improving code and
serving others
it also has several depositories on
github
so these are some of the benefits of
ruby on rails
now let's look at some of the
responsibilities of a ruby on rails
developer
first up is web app development now of
course a ruby on rails developer is
expected to create new applications he's
also expected to
improve existing applications
next responsibility is to integrate data
storage into the current solutions
to incorporate server-side functionality
and to work with front-end developers
to make components for the back-end
to connect the app to the rest of the
online services
to maintain json and liquid-based
application programming interfaces
to collaborate with several departments
to create workflows and titan management
procedures
and lastly to determine bottlenecks and
offer solutions to issues that have been
found
now of course other generic skills like
critical thinking analytical skills and
problem solving skills are also
important for a ruby on rails developer
he should also have good communication
and practice transparency so these are
some of the responsibilities of an ror
developer
now going forward let's look at the
future of ruby on rails
now rails based businesses benefit from
faster delivery times and an agile
development methodology
github airbnb zendesk shopify basecamp
twitch and cookpad are some of the few
top firms that have adopted ruby on
rails
now according to a recent linkedin
search more than 3 400 new ruby on rails
jobs were listed in the united states
alone
furthermore the high wages that these
ruby on rails developers earn show that
ruby knowledge is something that
corporations are ready to invest in
so this opens up new job possibilities
so talking about the salary according to
indeed the average salary of a ruby on
rails developer in the united states is
around 117 000 us dollars per annum
while the average salary of a ruby on
rails developer in india is about 8
lakhs 19 000 indian rupees per annum
this shows that developers are in demand
and now is the right time to invest to
make your career as an ror developer and
