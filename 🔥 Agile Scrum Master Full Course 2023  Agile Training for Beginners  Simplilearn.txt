agile scrum is a framework for project
management and software development that
emphasizes collaboration flexibility and
iterative progress it is based on the
agile Manifesto and uses time box
iteration called Sprints the framework
include roles such as product owner
scrum master and development team who
work together in a self-organizing
manner scrum promotes transparency
inspection and adaptation allowing teams
to respond quickly to the changing
requirements and deliver value
incrementally it is widely used in
software development for its
collaborative and adaptive approach to
project management an average salary of
a scrum Master is around 14 lakhs per
year in India whereas in U.S it is
ninety one thousand dollars per year
companies like Bosch Accenture are
hiring agile professionals with
competitive salaries so are you

begin by understanding what is agile
Alex has just completed his graduation
from Stanford University
one fine day he receives a mail from
Star Trek Technologies for an interview
for the designation of a software
engineer as referred by the University
Alex was really happy and excited about
this and starts preparing for his
interview next week while he was
preparing Alex came across the term
downtime
Alex has no idea what is a downtime
he decided to seek help from his uncle
John the software engineer
John explained that downtime is a
specific time frame allocated to deploy
or update changes for a software product
in a real-time environment and this
happens because most of the softwares we
use today are developed using the
waterfall model
for example
Cisco one of the popular leaders in it
and networking globally is using agile
methodology for their subscription
billing platform SBP as it was
originally developed using the waterfall
model
after adopting the agile methodology
Cisco's product improved its overall
efficiency where defects were reduced by
40 percent compared to the previous
releases and effect removal efficiency
increased by 14 percent
upon explaining what downtime is John
further added that downtime is a small
part of the waterfall model
it is the traditional way of developing
softwares using a software development
lifecycle where the whole product is
treated as one single unit and the
development of one phase starts only
after the completion of the previous
phase adding new features or updating
the existing feature in a waterfall
model based product needs a specific
time frame known as downtime to avoid
disturbance in the workflow of an
organization where applying changes in a
waterfall-based product might produce
irrelevant results or product failure
the waterfall model is the earliest or
the traditional model used for software
development where the output of one
phase acts as the input for the
preceding phase consisting of a series
of steps where each phase has specific
deliverables that act as the input for
the next phase as it avoids overlapping
a phases as these phases are dependent
on each other
this method is simple and easy to
understand where prerequisites are
pre-known documented earlier and
Technology remains static where there is
no need for ambiguous requirements due
to the delay in software delivery in
contrast the final version is available
only after completing the entire
software lifecycle process with any
deviations if available
changes in the waterfall model contain
high risk as changes include a new
revised version of the entire software
running the entire series of steps again
and again
for example a tap and pay machine where
the machine first validates whether the
customer's account is funded with
sufficient funds or not and then
initiates the transaction for money
transfer unless the validation is
processed the transaction cannot be
initiated
Alex was curious and asked Uncle John is
there any way to overcome the drawbacks
of the waterfall model
John replies yes agile methodology was
introduced to overcome the problems
faced in the waterfall model where agile
based products are developed by breaking
the entire product process into
microservices or phases which is faster
to execute and deploy changes on the go
there is no need to worry about other or
previous tasks while working on one
particular phase avoiding product
failure
agile based products don't require any
particular time frame downtime to deploy
changes unlike the waterfall model where
the whole product is treated as one
single unit and each process is
dependent on the preceding processes
where deploying changes leads to
downtime how agile products are
developed
agile based products are developed using
the agile life cycle
at first the developed product is
implemented in an actual working
environment for reviews from clients and
stakeholders to check its deliverables
and functionality
after client reviews the official
product is launched in a real-time
working environment where agile
methodology focuses on satisfying the
consumer needs by efficiently utilizing
the resources and avoiding additional
risks or deviations in the product
for example providing a trial beta
version of the software for the end user
to experience the software towards its
deliverables and results will be helpful
in refining and reviewing the product
like Adobe Photoshop Adobe Illustrator
Etc
after understanding all about agile
methodology
Alex asks Uncle John are companies
implementing agile in their workspace
nowadays
John replies yes
companies are moving towards agile
methodology due to its flexibility and
advantages over traditional systems by
adopting agile for their Sony
interactive environment Sony noticed a
major difference where there was a
reduced planning Time by 28 with their
framework and downtime was reduced to
the maximum which made the company save
30 million dollars a year agile
methodology aims to meet the consumer's
requirements to the maximum in deploying
changes in a rapidly developing
environment where agile Manifesto
principles brings an Innovative set of
rules and protocols to help developers
overcome the challenges faced in the
traditional practices waterfall model
making agile flexible and efficient let
us look at the time in the late 90s what
was happening with software development
forms so they used to follow waterfall
methodologies
so there used to be expression like sir
you have a problem so what happened so
our client want a new feature to the
software we are already Midway creating
the software we can't add the feature so
what does it mean so there is a scenario
where the change is asked so why change
change may be because of adding certain
features removing certain features
modifying certain things already given
what is wrong in that why can't we do
the change so now Point here is not
about doing the change itself it's about
the effort additionally it takes cost
money in terms of which is going out the
effort then the scope which is going to
change at the same time you also need to
put more efforts which will delay the
project
so now is it okay so 90s it was okay
today is it okay a big question mark so
why is that not okay so we need to
understand that very clearly right I
knew we should not have used the
waterfall methodology for development so
is that an issue with the waterfall
methodology
so answer is no if it is today's
scenario answer would be S if it is 90's
answer would be no so what changed in
this 20 years or 15 years the Dynamics
of the market changed the behavior of
consumers changed
so if you look at anyone who is using
any product it may be a software product
or a hardware
like if your mobile phone or a
television or any application mobile
application or application used on your
systems the upgradation of the new
features and functionality of that is
improved more and more and consumer
wants it more and you have a very less
time to respond that is one thing second
thing there is lot of competition if you
do not respond quickly computation will
take over so for you to sustain and grow
it is very essential that you understand
this Dynamics and you need to respond
quickly which was bit difficult when it
comes to approach what is called
waterfall model
now how do we address this so what is
that waterfall model is all about why is
it difficult for us so the methodology
where waterfall model is used involves
teams following a series of steps and
only going forward after the previous
steps are completed so there is a wait
time involved so until the previous
steps are completed only then I can move
to the next so it is a slower thing it
would take certain longer duration so it
is best used in the scenarios where the
teams are small and the project is
expected to move in a predictable manner
so predictability is very important when
we follow waterfall methodology
predictability the variation should be
as lesser as possible so what is the
predictability I'm speaking about as I
create this product as a result comes up
if it takes six months one year two
years three years it's okay so this is
how the product would look like the
predictability how the product would
look like how that particular output
would come so when is that going to come
is it okay if I bring that result after
two years is it okay
so if everything is okay that way
without very less without any variations
as such very less variations then it's
fine
so because of following waterfall model
uh what is that methodology what is that
flow we need to understand that so
requirements Gathering and documentation
is the first thing what used to happen
which is true in agile methodologies
also but the main difference here is the
requirements Gathering and documentation
happens in detail a comprehensive one
now once that is signed off only then it
is moved to the design
now based on that requirement which is
gathered which is full comprehensive
then the design will happen based on
that the consideration of process the
products the people the environment then
the design happens which is again a
detailed design
now once the implementation starts if
you find any deviations the correction
needs to be done since the design is in
detail the deviation possibilities as
less as possible
but the challenge comes up when the
Dynamics in the market when the Dynamics
of customer changes customer asks for
change then you may require to do the
change now when you want to do the
change you may required to do the change
only after understanding what would be
the impact of this change in the entire
output which you're going to create
which is very comprehensive one so
because of this it consumes time it
consumes extra effort so it may be a
scenario where the scope of work is
reduced as well even after that this
exercise has to be done which will delay
the project so this was okay so when
this model when uh things were done
things were taken up for changes it was
okay because the consumer Behavior as I
mentioned there is a lot of wait time
for the consumers also so there was less
competition but today it is not I need
to go quicker so because of this what
are the disadvantages which is came up
to the consumers or to the organization
who actually follow waterfall
methodologies in today's scenario so
what could be those so making changes
would be difficult as I mentioned
earlier
so then it doesn't focus on end user
client customer perspective value so
today I think more and more we're
speaking about creating a value in the
consumer prospective customer
perspective and the time it takes for
Consumer to realize the value how long
it takes the more it delays in realizing
the values by the consumer there is a
delay in terms of making your product
impression better in the consumer's mind
so computation will take over so your
existence will be in bigger threat so
testing phase is delayed until most of
the project is completed because it has
to follow step by step weight the things
to complete and then testing happen then
measuring the progress within the stages
is difficult so why is it difficult
measuring the progress within the stages
because the deliverables or the metrics
what are defined are defined to measure
at a milestone and at a end of the phase
to understand whether everything is
delivered as part of it now let us look
at how agile is going to help us to
address these disadvantages mentioned in
waterfall model so what is agile the
basic meaning of agile is to move faster
be flexible respond to change Etc but to
accomplish this there are a lot of
methodologies now there is something
called agile Manifesto and 12 principles
of agile which we need to understand so
following this accomplishing this can
only help us in becoming agile so in
2001 agile was introduced so that's
where the term agile came into picture
where people start realizing what is
agile and why should we adopt that agile
methodologies
so while it was introduced so agile
Manifesto was also released it's a set
of principles used in project management
and software development so basically
there are four points which we need to
understand very correctly very clearly
so that we can able to understand what
is agile is all about right it enables
team to deliver value to their customers
with ease so agile team deliver work in
small but usable increments then
evaluation of the requirements plans and
results takes place continuously this
allows teams to respond to changes
quickly now change was one of the
scenario what we were speaking about now
responding to change quickly is one of
the disadvantages what we spoke about
and here it is addressed it is
considered to address that is very
important now when we respond to change
quickly it is not that I just quickly
responded but I did not address that
problem or that scenario it is very
essential to address that scenario as
well effectively and efficiently
so now agile is a concept right so it
has a detailed Manifesto based on which
all the agile methodologies are created
so what is this agile Manifesto is all
about so it is created it was created
during February 2001 so which details
out the values and principles of agile
processes which says there are some
values which is mentioned in the left
which has more weightage compared to the
one which is in the right now when we
say this for example let us take let us
go one by one individuals and
interactions over process and tools so
are we saying we don't value the process
and tools that is not the case now let
us look at what were the typical issues
or challenges anyone would have
expressed regarding the processes so
delay may be bureaucracy and they cannot
have a flexibility to move faster so
basically delays because of the approval
which is not happening because of the
processes now how do we address this so
can I eliminate the process itself
answer is no because in the absence of
tools and processes none of the things
which we can do easily can exist so it
should be their process and tools should
be there the way it should be defined it
should also ensure there is individuals
and interactions encouraged to have
their individuals and interactions while
having the process and tools so next is
working products or comprehensive
documentation
so when we say comprehensive
documentation as I mentioned in the
waterfall methodology during the
requirement Gathering during designing
there is a detailed documentation which
is made so which take lot of efforts in
creating those now while delivering the
challenge what anyone was faced was the
change which is coming up and making
changes to these documentations which is
an additional effort now if we have a
working products if I have a bigger
product in that a module of that I keep
creating every small small modules of it
and start integrating to the base model
now I will only focus on the
documentation for that particular model
working piece which I am going to create
in the next iterations then my
documentation changes are less and also
the way I'm making the documentation is
initially I would have a full skeleton
of the entire product which I'm going to
create the roadmap and upon that I am
going to making the detailed
documentation for that only for that
working piece rather than the full
product itself then these working piece
documentation which I am going to create
as I create the working pieces I am also
getting the feedback because I'm doing
the interactions with the users the
consumers the end user so get the
feedback I keep making the changes
quickly and then documentation will
become accordingly the small pieces of
documentation which happens with those
small small working models which are
created and those are Consolidated over
a period of time by the time the product
ends you have a comprehensive
documentation the project ends you have
a comprehensive documentation so it
saves lot of time so documentation is
important but the way we accomplish the
documentation is one by one not in one
go
next is customer collaboration or
contract negotiation so any engagement
or any relationship or any business can
it happen in the absence of contract
answer is no there should be a contract
now how this contract should be when we
want to fall in agile it should allow
the customer collaboration why are we
collaborating to understand what
customer is required to understand what
customer needs is fulfilled right so now
this requires a lot of flexibility in
the contract itself so that commercial
is one area which gets impacted and
there should be guidelines for that also
in the contract so that during the
collaboration during the change during
the effort being put customer is also
informed what is the change which is
going to happen in terms of commercial
as well as time and everything so that
it is documented in the contract so
there is no confusion responding to
change or following a plan now I cannot
have a rigid plan as we were speaking
about waterfall methodology so that we
need to go like this only
So based on the scenarios changes so we
may require to change your directions
and move faster so responding to change
requires a specific flexibility which is
required in the plan so that you I don't
have a plan which is very rigid and that
provides some flexibility that's how I
can able to create my plan so that I can
able to move or respond to that specific
scenarios which are changing so this is
called agile Manifesto and this agile
Manifesto has 12 principles associated
with this now keeping this agile
manifest on 12 principles all the agile
methodologies have created their own
approaches and framework now let us look
at what are those 12 principles the
agile principles so agile principles so
here are some of principles that need to
be followed to make a processes agile so
first principle is about customer
satisfaction so one need to satisfy the
customer through early and quick
delivery of the product now someone who
is hungry if you give them a water or a
food immediately a piece of bread at
least there is some satisfaction there
is some realization is I got it what I
need so energy is back
so it is very much required to ensure
seeing things in a customer perspective
and customer is satisfied so customer
satisfaction is not a result of the
survey what I do it's about how I deal
with the consumer what is that impact
the perceptions I'm building with the
consumer and what do I know about my
customer do I really understand the
couples of my customer how Associated am
I how close am I well how am I
collaborating with a customer that will
help you to understand how satisfied
your customers
it is very essential to consider
customer satisfaction and the second
principle would be welcome change so
changing needs need to be addressed even
late in the development process so
change can happen anytime now these
changes should not become a challenge so
there should be a flexibility in your
design itself which will bring in so
that is the reason I think when you move
faster
so it doesn't mean that you eliminate or
you just keep introducing the defects
and move faster no that is not allowed
so whenever there is a change in the
feature Whenever there is a change to
some specific product functionality
accommodating that should become easier
whatever the methodology I follow that
should help me in terms of accommodating
so I should be welcoming changes it's
okay for me to have the change so that
is not a challenge anymore for me
so principle 3 deliver frequently so
ensure software is delivered frequently
focusing on shorter time scales as I was
mentioning while discussing the
manifesto point like I keep creating a
smaller piece of product modules so that
I keep putting into the base model and
integrating those and ultimately once
all the features functionalities are
integrated we have a product with all
the features and functionality
so this needs to happen more frequently
so the release of those working page
should happen more frequently more
repeatedly so that customer is seeing
those working piece and experiencing and
giving their feedbacks so quick changes
to those working piece making that will
become easier
then work together so when I say work
together it is very essential that
developers and business individuals need
to work together through the course of
project which means involvement of
customers involvement of suppliers
involvement of your own team everyone
should work together each one should
understand each other's perspective view
if there is no proper understanding
about each other's perspective view it
is quite obvious what was expected what
was delivered would not match so there
should be correct understanding to have
that correct understanding one should
work together collaborate so they should
speak Express which is very important so
feedback has to be given by consumers
regularly similarly the organization who
is doing the project should also keep
giving the feedbacks to the suppliers to
make necessary changes and once it works
together in a Unison I think that would
help in terms of bringing out the
results the way it is required that
would help customer to get the value
motivated team so projects need to build
around motivated individuals and they
must be trusted to get the job done
means when will the team get motivated
when the work what they are doing is
acknowledged when the work what they are
doing the results are seen experienced
and then feedback is given there is an
opportunity for Learning and
contribution their contribution is
acknowledged only then team is motivated
when there is a motivated team when team
feels there is someone with whom they
can look up to it is quite obvious team
will also come up with certain set of
innovation in their mind giving their
feedback as well involving themselves in
terms of getting the results what is
required so it is always essential to
ensure the team which is involved in
creating the products is always
motivated so I think when we say team
the conflict also come across there may
be a clash between various different
thoughts and preferences so one cannot
just shy away being a manager one cannot
shy away from it he or she should
involve it with the team resolve those
put things in the right direction so
write lead interpersonal skills are very
important here next face-to-face
interactions so it helps in terms of
most efficient means of communication
which helps in terms of giving a proper
Clarity in terms of what is required so
that I sent an email I expect the person
to do it that is not the case what we're
discussing about so more and more
interactions which should happen face to
face so that each other understand what
requires to be done and there is a quick
feedback which can happen when that
particular interactions conversation
which keeps happening so one can
understand other prospective view as
well
and working software so it is a
primarily the deliverable which you're
speaking about which has to come
regularly so more and more working piece
as it comes customer can give feedback
based on their experience on this
working piece instead of just imagining
something and then giving the feedback
so it should not look like an hypothesis
or something which is in the Dreamland
so I told something the person who heard
visualize something else it should not
end up that way instead of that give the
working piece expect the consumer the
user to give the feedback so that it
helps in terms of creating that
particular product ultimately which is
usable and which is going to create
value to the consumers
so next is constant pace so agile
process promotes sustainable development
so it should not I did it and I sleep I
did it and then I'm waiting for
something else no they should be
frequent deliverables which is happening
so there should be constant moment from
left to right from beginning to end so
that the deliverables which are expected
keeps happening so that consumers or
users are realizing the value of it so
it should be constant Pace the velocity
the speed which needs to be adopted then
good design agility can be improved by
focusing on technical excellence and
good design so when we say technical
excellence and good design it is very
essential to understand Insight towards
what is that product being delivered
inside towards what is the technology
being used inside towards the processes
the capabilities skills so all this
comes together when people sit together
and focus on creating that product or
services so they are putting the effort
towards designing it appropriately so
that that will fit for purpose so since
things are moved step by step in terms
of creating a working piece the detailed
designing of that small working piece
would happen which can happen quicker as
well and since these are going and
fitting into the architecture which is
basically open architecture kind of
scenarios what you're speaking about so
all those modules what you create you
keep plugging into it so that you are
designing the small piece which is
quicker so instead of Designing the
entire system as a whole in detail
you're just creating the small wall
pieces and fitting into that
architecture which is open so pluggable
so that gives flexibility as well and
changes to the design will become easier
if it's not working and the agility
helps in accomplishing that
Simplicity the amount of work that's not
being done needs to be minimized meaning
when we say Simplicity doesn't mean less
right so the appropriate number of tasks
the minimum number of tasks which needs
to be done and mostly I think all
non-value adding activities and
processes would be removed it has to be
removed so the more optimized more
simpler in terms of handling things is
always good so that only those what is
required to be done are done so it is
very clearly visible and there will be
clarity
self-organization so when we say
self-organized teams who is not capable
of everything but when you look at a
team has a whole each one has different
different skills many skills not one or
two skills many skills which they are
complementing to each other so they come
together The discus together they focus
on the architectures requirements and
design and address it together so team
is also owning the ownership is one
thing when it comes to picture when you
say team so here since team is actually
taking up that ownership and organizing
themselves to accomplish the results the
products what is required so then
obviously the results will happen the
way it is needed and they will become
accountable as a team so they cannot
have a blaming scenario where because of
one or two members it is happening they
should collaborate better they should be
self-organizing what should happen so
next is a reflect and adjust so when are
we going to reflect reflect upon what is
that happening learn understand keep
learning it having reflection to that
what is happening means responding to
that so that Improvement can happen
quicker Effectiveness can be improved by
the team regularly reflecting on it so
team is also understanding Tim is also
having that accountability to ensure
that necessary adjustments necessary
actions are taken to make those changes
and Corrections quickly so these are
about 12 principles so which supports
which helps that accomplishment of
Manifesto points the four Manifesto
points what is mentioned so keeping
these four Manifesto points for values
which is mentioned in Manifesto and then
12 principles so keeping these in mind
any agile methodologies have their own
approaches and they accomplish all of
this so further let us look at some of
the advantages what would be there when
following agile so we looked at the
disadvantages what we have when we
follow waterfall so did we overcome
those the disadvantage is what we had in
waterfall did we overcome that using
agent so what are the advantages of
agile so agile is helpful in terms of
handling large amounts of interactions
between client and project team because
it is throwing lights on it so
importance of interactions the
importance of collaboration the what is
that self-organized teams it is spoken
more and more
then improve transparency to claims in
every phase of the project how this
transparency because customer is seeing
those products the products with
features and functionalities are seen
they're experiencing it and based on
that they are given the feedback there
is nothing something hidden like when I
go with waterfall till the end of the
project customer don't know what is
going to come out as a whole but here
since the working piece is given
regularly customer is seeing it the
users are using it and giving their
feedback so interactions increased so
visibility towards what we are creating
a results is more
right then the delivery of the output is
predictable and can sometimes be earlier
than expected because we know what is
being delivered more and more clarity
users are obtaining at the same time the
team which is creating is obtaining
because of it the pulse of the customer
the directions are clear accommodating
changes which was the challenges in it
was a big challenge in waterfall
methodology has become easier here
so then the cost of the project are
predictable and follow a rigid schedule
so it is very easy to handle the
schedules because more and more you
interact and more iterations are in a
creation of small small working piece of
a product working model of the product
so now as you progress in that you
understood the environment better you
understood the clients better the
customers better the expectation better
and moving faster so that will become
easier for you now you have become
predictable You can predict easily what
is that going to happen ultimately so
more and more visibility you start
getting so handling things will become
easier so then it allows for changes to
refine and re-prioritize the product
backlog so when I say product backlog we
need to understand the various different
user stories what is written to deliver
so that is a list of deliverables
product backlog what are there since we
already know what other things needs to
be created so this helps in terms of
prioritizing those changing the
priorities based on the change scenario
and then taking the pace taking the
speed accordingly the client can provide
the priority of features allowing the
team to ensure maximum project value so
since it is visible what are the user
stories what are the effects written
what is that order priorities order of
priority what you are kept now the
change scenario obviously tells us do we
really need to change this priority of
which feature has to be done first so
that will become easier because you have
the list only changing that order in the
list and then going forward accordingly
integration is not an issue because we
have the base model which can integrate
all of this together with no issues now
then by focusing on needs of the users
the team can deliver value to the
customers so users are involved more
often so user policies understood what
user requires is clearly understood so
delivering that value to the customer
will become more easier and simpler so
then project is broken into smaller
units with high quality development
testing and collaboration because you
have that flexibility so since you have
better visibility you can able to do
this and you move one by one iteration
by iterations you progress further
so those were the advantages of adopting
agile now keeping that agile manifest on
12 principles of Manifesto so what are
the types of typical agile methodologies
would come across so there are few which
we are going to look at as part of it
which we need to know so these agile
methodologies definitely considers the
agile Manifesto points and then they
demonstrate it in their own way now
agile methodologies perspective let us
go one by one so some of them to look at
the first one is XP that is Extreme
programming so this is the framework
that enables teams to create high
quality software and improves their
quality of life so it enables software
development with appropriate engineering
practices
so and then when is it applicable so it
is applicable to the scenario where
changing software requirements to handle
risks caused due to new technology while
working with a small extended
development team to use technology to
allow automated unit and functional
tests so that is about extreme
programming so next let us look at
kanban so kanban is a methodology which
is used to design manage and improve the
flow of system it is actually called as
pull system so visual system so
everything which is actually put on a
board and it is visible to everyone what
work need to be done what is in progress
who has to do it is very clearly visible
so organizations can visualize their
flow of work and the limiting their work
in progress so what is limiting what is
stopping is clearly visible so generally
if I look at whenever I'll just take a
scenario of a meeting and minutes of
meeting which always discuss about it
now when there is a minutes of meeting
shared with many people who have
participated in the meeting there are
certain action items given to them for
example now these action items I will
have a Target day to complete and
accordingly those needs to be closed now
when the next meeting happens when you
look at an action item status majority
of them are not addressed what could be
the reason is that people are not
sensitive about answering or addressing
those so more than that the
prioritization changes so one important
thing we need to understand how kanban
works here is it is a visual system
compared to that minutes of meeting
which is not visible to us always the
kanban board is visible to us always
so one which is visible to us always
makes us put a conscious effort to close
it because our name is indicated on the
board the work need to be completed is
mentioned against our name then we need
to take it up and then close it so it
pushes it it will put a conscious effort
because it is visible and I cannot build
any storage telling that why I did not
do why did I not consider this as a
priority rather than consider something
else as a priority so this kanban
straight up addresses it and then it's
also called as pull system because
people pull the work from it and then
complete
right so where is this applicable it can
be used in situations where work arrives
in an unpredictable fashion so that
means it gives lot of flexibility in
terms of adopting to the changes which
are happening the Dynamics environment
so it is also used to deploy work
immediately without waiting for other
work items so since it is visible I
think things can go smoother easier so
that people are owning it rather than
just disowning it
so now let us look at lean so when we
say lean it is very important for us to
understand that value is always in
customer perspective and elimination of
waste these are the two things mainly
spoken about
so lean is a set of tools and principles
that aims to identify and remove waste
to increase the speed of process
development it focuses on maximizing the
value to the client ensuring waste is
minimized so when you look at visualize
our processes process interfaces and the
flow so the interface certain way so
unless the output of One processor
procedures getting into an another
process so that flow should be smoother
like many pipes connected together and
water is Flowing so let us assume series
of pipes which is of around 1 feet in
terms of diameter of each of the pipes
water is flowing in between if you have
a pipe which is of half a feet now what
happens to the downstream after that
half feet pipe the entire capacity in
the downstream even though it has one
feet diameter pipe it leads to the waist
underutilized capacity because this has
become bottleneck no such bottlenecks
such the one which contributes to the
waste has to be eliminated
that is very important so value should
be seen in the consumer perspective and
that value would happen only through the
series value streams then in this value
stream the identification of the
constraints and bottlenecks and
elimination of waste now what are the
contributors of waste so waiting time
more often changing things moving from
one place to another place allowing
defects to flow which leads towards a
rework
so all this likewise many things which
actually end up in giving the waste so
one has to visualize understand realize
what are those non-valuing activities
and eliminating those is very important
right so now when is it applicable lean
principles apply to any sector where
there is waste of any form so it can be
applied easily so one is to know that so
the iterative effort which needs to be
put with the objective to accomplish so
your ability to move faster your ability
to create that product which is more
efficient so only you can achieve it the
effective results can happen only when
there is a lesser delays or lesser waste
non-valuating activities that needs to
be understood and eliminate those so
next one of the popular methodology
would be scrum
so scrum is a framework that is used by
teams to establish a hypothesis trying
it out reflect on the experience and
adjust it is used to enable teams to
incorporate practices from other
Frameworks depending on the team's
requirement it's a simple framework
which speaks about a product owner a
scrum Master a self-organizing team so
some of the terminology is what it uses
is Sprint daily scrum product backlog
Sprint backlog so it's very essential to
understand this framework simpler and
able to adopt it is below is also very
easy when is it applicable it is used
when cross-functional teams are working
on product development when work is
split into more than one two to four
week iterations so these iterations are
called as Sprints Small Time boxed
iterations so this will also help in
terms of accomplishing the results
provides the flexibility and able to
move faster then Crystal
so Crystal is an approach to the
software development that focuses on
people and their interactions rather
than tools and processes it is aimed to
streamline processes and improve
optimization it works on principle that
projects are unique and Dynamics each
requiring its specific methods so where
is it applicable it focuses on
strengthening teams communication it
also focuses on continuous integration
active user involvement and configurable
processes so these are the few agile
methodologies which are there which are
more popular more heard however we can
come across many other methodologies
like safe Agile which is a scaled
scenario for more complex projects so
likewise we have many methodologies
which organizations adopt and these are
few for us to understand
when we think of agile we often think of
high levels of collaboration and
flexibility
as well as iterative environment in
which requirements evolve alongside the
changing needs
so as a result
we also tend to conceptualize agile as
an approach that helps development teams
across various Industries delivered new
features faster but how do we get there
what does history of agile and tile
and how can knowing the history of agile
help us better understand the
methodology and its positive impact on
today's development World let us look at
it
so now historically if you see
the waterfall approach was fine it was
delivering the required value
but it required teams to stick to the
requirements and scope of work set out
at the very beginning of the project
and not make any changes or additions
along the way as the project progresses
and following that fixed plan could
prove trouble sometimes comparing to the
scenarios which we had earlier which is
today the trouble is more
challenges more so reason being
waterfall methodology prioritized
bringing a complete product to Market
meaning it could take years before teams
finished the project in hat
the scenarios of change delay in
responding to problem resolution meeting
changing Market requirements were
challenging which led to introduction of
agile methodologies
so the various development methods like
scrum rapid application development
extreme programming dsdm feature driven
development and pragmatic program were
introduced
so it all started early I think in 2001
it was introduced however it all started
in the spring of 2000 when a group of 17
software developers in Oregon to discuss
how they could speed up development in
order to bring new software to Market
faster
so they recognized two key opportunities
that achieving this goal would make
possible so reducing the time to the
benefits for those users in order to
resolve the product Market
free time development problems secondly
getting feedback from users quickly to
confirm the usefulness of new software
and continue to improve on it
accordingly
so further this group of 17 developers
met again at ski resort in Snowbird Utah
us so they created popularly known as
agile Manifesto so which laid out four
key values
so which says individuals and
interactions or process and tools
working software or comprehensive
documentation customer collaboration or
contract negotiation responding to
change over following the plan are
valued more
now further between the time when it was
introduced till today agile has become
popular and Adoption of that has
increased reason being the flexibility
the agile brought into the system
so several organizations across the
world started using it
but what happened further
so agile gave the result but there was a
challenge
so there were some issues that agile
face to handle widespread usage
that is mainly Whenever there is a
scalability requirements so what is that
scalability challenges
it is quite obvious
how can an implementation of agile for
large and more complex project and how
hard the process to scale agile so this
was not clear
the very reason the challenge which come
across which the practitioners actually
faced was
one is lack of experience with agile
methodologies little understanding of
Frameworks methods and how to implement
them
next large scale coordination so when I
say specific project a small project it
was easy implementation of agile and
then going forward all the Frameworks
what I mentioned earlier it was easy but
the moment you want to do scaling to the
bigger organization the complex
environment
the coordination collaboration
dependency management between usually uh
distributed teams geographically
distributed teams was challenging
and thirdly having a clear understanding
of what needs to be completed in this
prints and what the bigger picture is
so fourth aligning the entire
organization and managing committees
so definitely organization required
alignment the products or Services which
are being produced by the project needs
an alignment
so the need of alignment was basically
to ensure the organization gets the
value out of whatever they have invested
so fifth unrealistic expectation with
respect to speed of delivery
so unable to respond to this particular
scenario so that organization can able
to respond quickly so it was not
happening so time to benefits I I was
mentioning about so generally earlier we
used to speak about time to Market but
today it has been replaced by time to
benefits how quickly the value of that
particular product or Services
introduced to the market is realized by
the users that is very important
so the framework of scaling agile there
are various different Frameworks so some
of the most effective ways to scale
agile would be large scale scrum which
is called as Celeste scale the agile
framework discipline digital scrum at
scale Nexus Chrome the Spotify model
so when I say less the large scale scrum
it is a way of scaling agile and scaling
scrum to large and big product
development groups it has been used
since 2005 in different software and
Hardware products in Industries such as
Banking and Telecom so when it comes to
scale digital framework
so it is a set of organizations and
workflow patterns intended to guide
Enterprise in scaling lean and agile
practices
so it is made freely available by scaled
agile link which retains the copyrights
and registered trademarks
so the disciplined agile delivery which
is also called as dad is a software
development portion of the discipline
agile toolkit
so Dad enables teams to make simplified
process decisions around incremental and
iterative solution delivery so that
builds on many practices by Advocates of
agile software development including
scrum agile modeling lean software
development and others
so scrum at scale so scrum originally if
you look at outline in the scrum guide
is a framework for developing delivering
and sustaining complex products by a
single theme
so since its inceptions its usage was
extended to the creation of products
processes services and systems that
require the efforts of multiple teams
whereas scrum at scale was created to
efficiently coordinate this new
ecosystem of teams it achieves this goal
through setting up a minimum viable
bureaucracy via scale free architecture
now coming to next one the Nexus scrum
so this consists of multiple cross
functional scrum team working together
to deliver a potentially releasable
integrated increment at least by the end
of each print based on dependencies the
teams May self-organize and select the
most appropriate members to do specific
work so lastly the Spotify model which
is basically people driven autonomous
framework for scaling agile while
emphasizing the importance of culture
and network this methodology uses quads
tribes chapters guilds
the foundation of which is called which
acts like scrum team
so further let us look at our Focus area
of this particular video which is
basically what is scaled agile framework
so scale the gel framework as I
mentioned earlier
consists of collection of principles
best practices and processes that would
enable large organization to adopt agile
methodologies
so it would help them deliver products
and services of the highest quality
faster
so safe is best suited for complex
projects that involves several large
teams in the projects program and
portfolio levels the current version of
safe is version 5 which has seven core
competencies based on which it can help
organizations the large organization in
specific
so safe as certain core values
which are basically alignment
built-in quality transparency and
program execution
so when I say alignment so I was
mentioning about aligning with business
requirement business strategies so it is
needed to keep Pace with fast changing
disruptive competitive forces and
geographically distributed teams
while empowered agile teams are good
even great but the responsibility for
strategy and alignment
cannot rest with the combined opinions
of the teams no matter how good they are
instead alignment must rely on
Enterprises business objective
so it also need to require to keep up
with the change the competitions and
then the Dynamics across in the
environment where organization is doing
their business
so next is built-in quality
so built-in quality is basically to
ensure that every element and every
increment of the solutions
reflect quality standards throughout the
development lifecycle
so quality is not added later
building quality is prerequisite of lean
and flow without it the organization
will likely operate with large batches
of unverified unvalidated work which
leads to the product or Services which
is not okay and also that would lead
towards excessive rework which is not
good and slower velocities which is not
allow the organization to respond
quickly to the Dynamics of the market
so third one is transparency so
transparency which basically need to
enable teams to rely on each other there
should be trust which needs to be built
So based on which high performance can
happen so wherever the trust exists
so when the business and development can
confidently rely on each other to act
with Integrity particularly in times of
responding quickly or to work out a
solution for resolving something which
is actually not allowing things to move
forward
so without trust no one can build high
performance teams and programs
so the confidence needed to make
reasonable commitments is very very
essential
so fourth is program execution
so safe focuses on working systems and
business outcomes which mainly for
example for teams to execute and
continuously deliver value
safe places and intense focus on working
systems and business outcomes
so this is because while many
Enterprises start the transformation
with individual agile teams
they often become frustrated as even
those teams struggle to deliver more
substantial amount of solution value
reliability and efficiently
so delivering Solutions with better
value reliability and efficiency
Effectiveness is very very essential and
here we're speaking about ensuring the
scalability to the bigger organization
so program management plays a very
important role so that requires lot of
communication collaboration so without a
better execution of that without
handling it better things cannot go the
way it is required
so various competencies safe recommends
so safe competencies involves
team and Technical agility
agile product delivery
Enterprises solution delivery lean
portfolio management
organizational agility continuous
learning culture and then lean agile
leadership
so when I say team and Technical agility
so agile teams are high performing and
cross-functional
Business Solutions are built by business
and Technical teams
delighting customer with high quality
output so this requires an able team
which understand agile Frameworks which
follows it which complies with it and
also technically sound
so agile product delivery which actually
refers to the scenario where the
customer is at the center of
organization's product strategy so
development is based on Cadence and
releases on demand exploring Integrity
deploying and innovating continuously
then Enterprise solution delivery
so building big system with the help of
lean coordinating and aligning the
entire supply chain evolving the live
system continuously requires to ensure
the visibility of entire Enterprises and
providing solution accordingly
lean portfolio management which
basically focuses on aligning the
strategy funding and execution
optimizing operations across the
portfolio
decentralized decision making powered by
lightweight governance
then organizational agility
a lean agile mindset is created across
the Enterprise it is very essential for
example I am working in a project I have
an attrition if HR does not understand
my Project Dynamics and if they are not
agile
me as a project organization becoming
agile will not help similarly the one
the procurement similarly the processes
so very essential for all the
organization units to become agile so
that business operations are able to
complement contribute that speed or the
change what is required
so opportunities and threats are
addressed quickly so risks are
identified
and addressed quickly so they have
worked on it so risk management can
become easier with the involvement of
right stakeholders
continuous learning culture so in this
scenario everyone learns and grows
together
exploration creativity are a very
important part of organization where
there should be an innovation
creation execution maybe I think I come
across certain terms like intelligent
risk taking
so learning through failures
failure should lead towards inquiry not
towards blaming so this these are all
the things which are more and more
discussed when we want to make an
organization a learning organization
The Continuous Improvement of solutions
services and processes is everyone's
responsibility
then lean agile leadership
so by modeling desired behaviors
inspiring others aligning words actions
and mindset to lean agile principles and
values lead change and guide others so
this requires lot of accountability and
ensuring the correct information well
informed individuals to take forward
things
now how does safe work
so safe
considering those competencies what we
looked at the seven competencies so let
us see what happens in each of the
competences how to save work using this
competencies so firstly let us look at
team and Technical agility
which basically involves an agile team
of five to eleven members which helps
defining build test and deploy products
so this is done by dividing the task
into small easier to manage time boxed
iterations
right
then Chrome team led by the scrum master
and supported by product owner plan and
then deliver the product and increments
so further after delivery they have a
retrospective to determine how the
iterations went and how it can be
improved this is incorporated into next
iterations planning space
so the method used here would be scrum
or kanban so both are popular the
combination of this can be used
so scrum basically helps in ensuring
that things moves in iterations and
everything is visible and delivered
whereas kanban supports in terms of
making it more visible and able to
manage it better
so agile product delivery so a large
organization usually consists of several
agile teams it led by their respect to
scrum Masters
so these teams together represent agile
released range also called as art
so they usually involve 50 to 125 people
so art are cross-functional and involved
everyone who understand customer needs
and can help with building and
delivering the solution required
so art uses an agile delivery practices
like the one used by the teams to
deliver value to the customers so it
uses time boxed iterations called
program increments or pis which usually
involves four to five iterations
all the teams they get together to plan
their work during Pi planning events so
they should work together they should
have full visibility while doing it
so three major components which are
required when we do a gel product
delivery is released in engineer then
project management and then system
architect so release train engineer
represents the coach of the art
facilitated the pi planning process
the project management provides the
vision for the project and backlog of
the tasks
system architect provides architectural
guidance for the process
and then the teams then make plans
regarding what they would be able to
deliver
so the program board is also drawn up to
determine dependencies between the teams
which also goes through program
iterations the pis as I mentioned
earlier
then after every iterations the art
shows the integrated output to all teams
through a system demo
so after the pi is complete all team get
together to retrospect event called the
inspect and adapt events
so further a continuous delivery
pipeline is set up based on the art
divorce practices are also used to
ensure values available on demand I
think the term devops is becoming more
and more popular today which actually
providing that visibility need for
collaboration need for cultural
transmission
so which helps in terms of bringing that
agility across the organization as well
as learning organization so one of the
principles of devops itself says
continuous learning there should be
continuous experimentation and learning
risk taking intelligence risk taking and
also we come across picking the concepts
like say Main Army concept like
introducing failures into existing
systems and learn what can fail and what
is the solution for it and that can help
in terms of becoming more resilient and
reliable system
so devops has become popular and
Adoption of that discussion on that is
become more common across the
organizations
so next Enterprise solution delivery so
Enterprise solution delivery let us look
at the scenarios where a single art may
not be able to deliver an appropriate
solution
a solution train which coordinates
multiple arts and suppliers would be
able to provide Solutions in large and
complex scenarios so meaning
consideration of Enterprise has a whole
seeing end-to-end organization entire
visibility
so basically what is that we are trying
to achieve so alignment we discussed
about which requires the objective
organization because organization is
investing so whatever we do at various
different levels should complement to
each other rather than contradicting so
that complementing thought or
complementing visibility can happen only
when someone has a bigger visibility
Enterprise World Wide Outlook
then the three major components that are
required in the Enterprise solution
delivery would be solution Management
Solutions architect and solution train
engineer
the solution management holds content
authority over what needs to be built
solution architect handles the
architecture across the Arts
solution train engineer enables coaching
and facilitating of solutions train
events
so next is lean portfolio management
so lean portfolio management provides
ways of creating and combining strategic
themes and portfolio vision
this enables solution development to be
aligned with Enterprise strategy so the
moment I say lean firstly we should keep
in mind that it's about creating value
to the stakeholders that is first thing
second thing is elimination of waste
now when I link this to strategy when a
link to towards the organization's
directions what it sets and while going
in the directions I should ensure no
defects are actually moved downstreams
or are eliminated when it goes to
Downstream
so customer should see the value which
is very important and identification of
all the contributions of waste has to be
done and eliminated
so this ensures there is a value in
organization's value stream which also
ensures that these value streams remain
funded so funding plays a very important
role
so next is organizational agility
so when I say organizational agility it
should ensure the organizations various
business units in the organizations
should be with that dynamics of agility
which organization is going through
which organization is moving through as
I mentioned earlier if you have a
project where you have you have adopted
agile methodologies it's quite obvious
for your pace for your flexibility for
your speed other business units which
are working with you to support you
should also complement to that
they cannot become slower they cannot
have their own pace of doing things like
in your project you have a procurement
you have a recruitment you have some
claims to be cleared from a char
maybe you're dependent on certain tools
and environments now if these are not
agile if these are not responding in the
same flexibility or same speed what the
agile project team requires then
obviously things will not flow further
now when I say agile obviously we
introduce products or Services quickly
to the environment now someone needs to
manage we have operations
now can operations manage the products
or Services which they are not aware of
now even there the agility is required
as I keep introducing the new products
or services to the environment
operation should also be well informed
and educated about it so that they can
monitor and manage them effectively and
efficiently
if they fail I think users will not have
a good experience your product or
Services may have a great features
functionalities but however if Whenever
there is a query about that product
features or functionality Whenever there
is an issue the incident which user
actually calls the first point of
contact foreign users would be the
operations
the moment operations fails to respond
with the right clarifications or rights
resolution quickly then obviously user
experience will result in not a good way
I think customer satisfaction or
customer Delight will be at stake say
when operation should be committed
so rest of the business units which are
supporting like funding we spoke about
the funding is not done in agile way
obviously the things cannot move
smoother or easier so everything across
organization should become agile
organizational agility has to be ensured
so enabling portfolio with strategic
agility making change in the direction
depending on the scenario
then encouraging the growth of lean
thinking people and agile teams so
people should be working towards
ensuring creating value always every
task every transaction is what they do
should be enabled through it so they
should also know whatever we are doing
how this particular task or the work or
the results what I am creating
results in value addition or value
creation to the organization does it
really align to the organization's
requirement is it fulfilling maybe
customer as a stakeholder or my own
organization the business unit which is
actually investing on this project so in
that context or in that perspective
everyone should be aware of that
alignment the directions the vision
then focusing on value and helping with
organizing and reorganizing building an
environment for the flow of value across
the organization so everyone should
realize value so value is what value can
be defined in the perspective of every
individual's background and every
individual's requirement because it's a
perceived one
so there may be real thing what we have
created but perception is different so
the perceived versus what is actually
created
should be as closer as possible so zero
deviation is expectation but difficult
but however it should have a tendency
towards it it should actually be very
near to that perceived reality but two
things involved one is that I create a
features and functionality for my
product or Services which fulfills
customer requirements customer may not
know not well educated not aware of it
and don't know how to realize that value
how to know how these features in
functionalities can be used
so now if you educate that customer the
user how to use it what are the values
it can create and do some exercise in
terms of educating training coaching
customer can visualize or understand
that that is one possibility second
thing is customer is very mature and our
product does not have features and
functionality required so these are the
two scenarios which required lot of
interactions and engagement so that
increasing in terms of usage of product
and services and realizing those values
so this has to be encouraged more and
more
so further continuous learning culture
so when we say learning it's quite
obvious
organization should keep maturing
individuals in organizations should keep
maturing in terms of capabilities in
terms of ability to do new things
innovate the knowledge the capability
skills competencies so that can be
possible only through learning so
learning should be continuous
so this ensures an atmosphere of
innovation
and constant Improvement until
organizations becomes a learning
organization
so many at every level each individuals
each professionals each Engineers each
executives
invest their time in learning
they learn through what they are doing
they go through formal training they
bring in that formal training learning
into the actions here for there they
learn so continuous experimentation
creating an hypothesis working on those
hypothesis aligning that to the
requirement of organizations and seeing
how is it complementing to the
organization's requirement so seeing
through this are very essential so the
organization which is having the culture
of continuous learning can sustain and
grow
continually
there is a question of looking back if
organization has a scenario of not
learning they will fade away they may
fail to exist so it is very much
required to understand the market
dynamics continuous learning there
capabilities and skill enhancement
continuous learning here Innovations and
making things better continuous learning
so continuous learning helps
organization to be there in the industry
and continue with the competition
so next is lean agile leadership so it's
quite obvious leadership plays very
important role it's about guiding it's
about owning it's about showing
directions it's about ensuring everyone
does the task everybody is motivated so
the leaders must embody teach and
exhibit
lean and agile principles and values so
firstly they should understand what it
is they should be aware of it they
should have an exposure to it they
should have full awareness of it as I
was learning about continuous learning
culture in the previous point so leaders
should do that first so only then I
think the followers will actually have
learning adopted to themselves and
things move smoother and better
and this should happen across the
organization
so by doing this it is quite obvious
organization can become better agile
organization is complemented to achieve
the objectives and goals what they
wanted to accomplish
and uh there is a safe configurations
which one needs to ensure which involves
essential safe Raj solution safe
portfolio safe and full save
so when I say essential safe it acts as
the foundation for all safe
configurations and is the easiest
starting point for implementation
so large solution safe it is used for
building large and complex Solutions
whereas portfolio safe provides
principles and strategies that can
enable business agility in an Enterprise
so when I say portfolio it should be
understood as a portfolio of an
organization as a whole the service
portfolio the product portfolio the
business portfolio so understanding of
that and complementing to that is very
essential
so full safe is a comprehensive
configuration that includes all
competencies and ensures business
agility
so advantages and disadvantages of safe
so advantages involves
enabling decentralized decision making
it eases collaboration across
cross-functional teams
it ensures decisions are made with
strategic objectives in mind
so disadvantages include additional
layers of oversight which makes it
resemble the waterfall approach
the top down approach can limit
understanding of the software lifecycle
and cause bad planning so visibility
providing that visibility is very
essential
then larger planning cycles and roles
that are fixed in development Cycles so
before we go and understand what is the
scrum itself so let us look at the
history of scrum where it started how it
started So Right Down the Line during
1986 the name scrum is first introduced
by the management experts
and Hiro takat kuchi so Japanese
so now this terminology introduced but
later in 1995 Jeff souderland and Ken
Schubert creates the early version of
what would become the agile
methodologies so now earlier 1995 so
need for agile was sensed and it was
spoken about I mean why do we need a gel
methodologies in future what would be
the Future Organization which would look
like so that would trigger in terms of
what kind of approaches we may require
to have
so for the 2001 the agile Alliance is
founded and first look on scrum the
agile software development with scrum is
published so then further down the line
2002 the scrum Alliance is founded by
zweber and certifications are added
then later 2006 the scrum ink is created
the certified scrum courses are taught
so people started getting certified on
scrum
then later 2009 scrum.org is created
which offers the professionals scrum
series of certifications
then 2010 the first scrum guide is
published so which made available to
everyone so from then I think the more
and more people start adopting scrum
methodologies now interesting part is
the journey started from 1980s till 2010
various changes which has happened to
this particular methodology but one
thing we should keep in mind is same 20
years back or 15 20 years back if we go
the need for a jail was not seen so it
was spoken but need for a gel was not
spoken much but today we are speaking
about it more and more the reason is I
think the change in the market condition
the increase in the competition the need
of responding to the change which is
asked by the consumers or the market
variations has become more and more
important for organizations and service
providers if they don't respond to the
change they may lose out in the
competition so their survival is at
stake so it is very essential for them
to understand this Dynamics and respond
to those scenarios quickly so that's
where the adoption of agile the benefit
of adopting agile were realized and
scrum become popular
so what is Scrum so let us look at that
so now scrum is a framework that enables
teams to work together
means collaboration is very important
while we become agile
so with scrum team one can look I mean
see and experience so learning from
experiences happens so those are
captured
self-organize working on problems so
they work together they discuss
brainstorm reflect on their victories
means any achievements has to be
celebrated acknowledged quick tweens
recognized and their losses to improve
so wherever the things doesn't go good
necessary Corrections has to be done I
think scrum approach would help in terms
of doing it quicker better
then some of the benefits using scrum
would look like steam can provide
project deliverables and in an efficient
manner so in time a we are completing
all the features and functionality so
the the entire model the methodology
what is there which helps in
accomplishing those
then further time and money are used
efficiently so time is very important
giving results in uh mentioned schedule
is very important ensuring results are
coming up effectively is important
efficiently the performance of that
products now since we are creating those
small piece working piece in every
iterations
so that experience of using that would
also be there and quick feedbacks will
come back so that time and money is
saved
and we are doing in time so projects are
divided into smaller units called Sprint
so the iterations what I was speaking
about the quick iterations of activities
which happens during the adoption of
scrum when organization adopt the scrum
methodology so it is called as print
it's a time box iterations which will
have a set of subset of product backlog
taken as a Sprint backlog and those
users stories and epics are delivered as
part of that Sprint and then those are
reviewed on a daily basis as part of
daily scrum meeting and also we have
other meetings which will happen when we
go and look at scrum methodology how
this happens I think we'll get better
visibility
work best for fast moving projects now
whenever we need to respond quickly
whenever we want to move faster now
remember when we say moving faster means
it doesn't mean that we can allow any
defects to happen we can ignore
something we cannot do that we need to
ensure everything is taken care at the
same time all those results what are
created has to be acknowledged
right confirm yes it is defect free so
all those which is supposed to be
addressed are taken care and things are
moving faster and better and the results
are according to what was actually
expressed as a requirement it is
fulfilling those
then scrum meetings provide the team
great visibility since there is a daily
scrum meeting which keeps happening
people speaks about what they have done
from the previous daily scrum what is
that they have accepted they will
complete and what is complete is
everything is complete or something is
pending if it is pending why is that
pending and what is that you are going
to do further before the next daily
scrum meeting so these are discussed
understood so that there's a quick 15
minutes meeting which gives the insight
and further wherever there is a
dependency deviations which occurs
further maybe scrum Master sit with them
separately to understand that in detail
so daily scrum meetings give the quick
insights
so that it increases the visibility what
is happening on ground
constantly involves feedback from
clients and customers as I mentioned
earlier while discussing about agile
active involvement of customer is very
essential so customer should give the
feedbacks whenever that working piece of
the application or a product is given so
only then whether the product or that
module what is created is having that
features and functionality which helps
in providing necessary requirement
fulfillment is that happening or not
then making changes based on feedback
are very easy because everyone is
informed and they are aware of what is
being changed and what needs to be
changed
then individual efforts of the team
members are given Focus
yes individual efforts is essential at
the same time each team member cross
kills we call it a self-organizing team
as I was mentioning earlier so each team
member will have a different different
skills different different capabilities
and also cross killing within the team
is encouraged so that the ownership on
individual's deliverables and team as a
whole working together to deliver some
features functionality can also be
accomplished right
then scrum team involves product owner
scrum master and then scrum team so each
of these are different roles having
their own objectives to accomplish with
the specific directions and each of
these cannot be merged like for example
the roles and responsibilities of
product owner cannot be given to single
individual who is a scrum master so both
the roles cannot be given a single
individual because it conflicts the
objectives of both the rules so thinking
about putting this one of the team
member becoming scrum Master product
owner thinking in that angle is also
something which is which will not work
which will not give the required results
so now what are these roles what are the
responsibilities where is the focus of
each of the roles so let us discuss on
that now when it comes to product owner
so the product owner is primarily
responsible for maximizing the ROI by
determining the product features
prioritizing it into a list what needs
to be focused on for the next print and
constantly re-prioritizing and refining
it so the key points what we need to see
here is so one is determining the
product features
maximizing the ROI the second one and
then re prioritizing and refining the
product backlog now why is that needs to
be done so maximizing Roi in the sense
obviously product owner should closely
work with the business and have an
Insight towards what is that business
require what is that customer require
how it helps customer to accomplish that
result so that it helps the justifying
that investment what they're doing with
the products features and
functionalities
then speaking about re-prioritizing and
refining it it depends on what features
needs to be delivered in what order so
there is already an order which is
defined So based on the change scenario
you can reorder it and product owner has
that ownership and responsibility so the
entire focus is on ensuring the right
product backlog prioritizing it and also
adding that user stories and epics into
product backlog
depending on what makes sense to the
business
so the scrum Master the next role helps
teams learn and apply scrum to obtain
business value means scrum Master
closely works with the team so he or she
helps remove impediments what is
impediments
something which stops to move forward
something which doesn't allow to deliver
things the way it is required something
which stops right so that needs to be
eliminated that needs to be understood
what are the impediments so when we say
impediments what are the impediments we
can think of the skills and capabilities
of the team that is one thing maybe the
testing environment may be a process so
anything comes as a bottleneck or
impediments which stops things to move
smoother forward
so scrum Master should work on it
identify that and support team or guide
team to overcome those so protects them
from interfaces that helps the team to
adopt agile practices so encouraging
team to adopt agile practices and
ensuring they demonstrate it and
provides the required value as it's move
forwards so since scrum Master focuses
one side in terms of making scrum team
to work whereas product owner is looking
at the entire product backlog and
working more closely with the business
so they need to have a good handshake to
ensure things go well but these two
roles cannot be merged because since it
has a two different angles and two
different Dynamics so spending time
accomplishing both the things may become
very challenging and conflicting
and the prioritizing will also be
difficult
then scrum team is a collection of all
the individuals who work together to
deliver the requirements of the
stakeholders so self-organizing team
whatever is mentioning what we were
discussing earlier
so these teams comes together each of
the team member will have various
different capabilities so they
contribute at the individual level and
as a team has a whole complement or
contribute towards ultimate output and
outcome and value what they need to
create and this team should have a clear
understanding about the deliverable what
is being done
so is that deliverable what features and
functionality what they're thinking is
that going to create that value
ultimately what is need to be achieved
the requirements fulfillment which is
which needs to be happened to the
customers so they need to have that
understanding the direction should be
clear to the team
so there are certain artifacts to look
at when it comes to scrum so let us look
at that
so now we speak about the artifacts
which are the components of the scrum
process that can improve transparency
and understanding of the work so there
are three artifacts mainly which we call
it as a product backlog Sprint backlog
then product increment so let us see
what is this one by one
so when I say product backlog so it
consists of list of new features
changes to be made to existing features
the bug fixes changes to the
infrastructure and several other
activities that the team needs to
deliver to ensure a particular outcome
so this let's show product backlogs
becomes with required features and
functionalities what needs to be
delivered so the prioritization of this
has to happen in what order what needs
to be delivered so the product backlog
is the full list which needs to be
delivered as part of this project and as
the project progresses a lot of new
backlog item would be added to the
product backlog as the Dynamics of the
particular scenarios keeps changing so
keep keeps adding reprioritizing
additional items to the backlogs are
added depending on what are those
Dynamics
so further looking at a Sprint backlog
so Sprint refers to that short period of
iterations
right so which the team aims to get a
given amount of work done so it helps
teams deliver working software in a
frequent manner so Sprint could be
between one to four weeks long depending
on what is the deliverable is so Sprint
backlog is a subset of product backlogs
so that prioritize the item what is
taken into Sprint which is a Time boxed
iterations
the Sprint backlog contains the task the
team aims to complete to satisfy the
Sprint goal so what is that Sprint goal
so each of those iterations the time box
iterations will have a specific
objective to accomplish
so the Sprint goal is the objective
decided for the Sprint as an outcome of
negotiation between the product owner
and the team so what can be delivered
how long it takes to deliver so when it
has to be delivered the target may be
given by product owner but is it
possible feasible to complete it then
there is some negotiation which happens
there so they decide they agree yes we
can do it we cannot do it if at all we
can do it what is that it takes in terms
of effort time and cost so everything is
decided discussed so that objective of
that particular iterations is agreed
upon so once it is agreed I think a team
should first identify the tasks from the
product backlog that need to be
delivered to achieve the goal so these
tasks are then added to split backlog so
there should be an agreement between
both and once it is added once it is
agreed as part of that print the
deliverable the output of the Sprint
would be the one which needs to be
completed as part of it the objectives
the goal the results which is specific
working software
then product increment so this refers to
the combination of all product backlog
tasks completed in the Sprint and the
value of the increment of previous
prints now when we speak about lean
clean speaks about elimination of waste
it speaks about value streams
now in each of these prints as we have a
working software being delivered now
each of these piece should keep
complementing to the what is the one
which is already delivered and what is
being delivered in future
so keeping that in mind every
deliverable will be implemented or
configured in such a way that there is
no specific bottlenecks there is no
specific constraints which arises so
this needs to be kept in mind which
requires the entire visibility into what
is that ultimate objective we are going
to accomplish so in this product
increment all those combination of the
product backlogs task which is being
done should keep this in mind team
should be very clear about it so I in
the first Sprint I delivered something
the Sprint 2 I delivered something but I
cannot integrate them they cannot work
together it will lead into the further
issues and then complications that
should not happen so when we say agile
it's about moving faster fine so
responding to change fine but that
should not lead towards further
complexity it should make things simpler
smoother so scrum is stressing on that
part
so an increment refers to
inspectable usable work done at the end
of the Sprint it represents a step
towards overall goal or vision of the
project as I was mentioning then the
outcome should be in usable condition
even if the product owner doesn't decide
to release it so it should be an usable
condition so two things we speak about
so one is uh release other one is
deployment
now people usually get confused between
release and deployment so release about
this part what we're speaking about
product is usable
so it is released product is usable but
only after deployment user will have an
access to use it
so that is a difference release makes a
product usable whereas deployment makes
it available to the user to use so this
difference people should know so release
doesn't mean that it is already
available for user to use so this
understanding of the difference should
also be there so that one can understand
what it means by release as well and
what it means by deployment that's why
when we speak about divorce we keep
speaking about cicd in cicd we speak
about continuous integration continuous
uh delivery and continuous deployment so
in continuous delivery you're speaking
about release basically so once it is
released it becomes usable so once it is
deployed it is available for user to use
and that's about the scrum artifacts now
let us look at scrum framework how that
scrum framework looks like in entirety
so what are the components comes into
picture already we spoke about the scrum
approach itself what it is
now we spoke about understanding
artifacts then we spoke about roles in
scrum the activities for each of the
roles we understood now where do we see
all of this when we look at a scrum
framework so that picture let us see
so when we say scrum framework already
we spoke about the product backlog we
can see that it is in the left side in
the beginning you have a Sprint planning
so we spoke about Sprint the time box
iterations and from the product backlog
the items which is moving towards Sprint
to a specific Sprint what needs to be
delivered which become Sprint backlog
now the backlog items are taken and
scrum team work on it and does this
daily scrum meeting and once the
deliverables of that particular Sprint
happens then there is a review on it
then the increment is delivered and at
the same time that retrospective what
was planned versus what is delivered
that is checked if you look at from
Sprint review so you have a
retrospective to check what is plan
versus what is being delivered at the
same time the review points will come
out get updated to product backlog as
well to the product owner so product
owner should be aware what is delivered
what is spending to be delivered and
that increment is further delivered so
this is increments what is delivered to
production what is deployed in the
production should have values that
integration which happens both all the
increments coming together to provide
that fulfillment of the requirement as
well as creating that value what is
required
so product backlog is the first step of
scrum framework is a set of list of
tasks of successfully achieve the goals
of the stakeholders we discuss that
while discussing on product backlog so
further Sprint planning happens where
the team determines the tasks from the
product catalog they will work on and
aim to deliver during the Sprint now
this is negotiated understood agreed and
then most words
Sprint to get delivered
then Sprint backlog are the tasks
discussed during the Sprint planning
means the previous step and I'll show
you the script planning and then add it
to the Sprint backlog once it goes to
the Sprint backlog as part of the time
boxed iterations print the deliverables
should happen
now scrum team the scrum team which is
actually self-organizing team as we
mentioned maybe five to ten nine members
of Team working on the task in the
Sprint backlog and they will also have a
daily scrums where the team also
discusses for 15 minutes on the events
where the team member synchronizes
activities and plan what they aim to
achieve in next 24 hours what is
accomplished against what is discussed
in previous daily scrum and then if at
all any further discussions need to be
done in the correction of those that can
be taken as a separate meeting not as
part of the daily scrum so generally
daily scrum meeting would be 15 minutes
it should not go more than that it's an
indicative time so quicker updates to
understand what is happening
then the Sprint review happens where
once the Sprint is complete so Sprint
review happens which involves the team
the scrum master and product owner and
stakeholders to understand what is being
agreed upon and what is being delivered
so reviewed is that fulfilled in the
entirety that is discussed and then
during this meeting the team shows what
they accomplished during the Sprint it
allows time to ask questions make
observations
give feedback and provide suggestions
right
then the product owner also presents the
product backlogs talk to the
stakeholders to get feedback for
upcoming Sprints and about things
related to the backlog now this one
Sprint is complete for the next print
what should be the prioritization
so the product owner has to speak with
the stakeholders so that there is a good
understanding good handshake that what
needs to be delivered and what is the
priority in the given list
then Sprint retrospective happens so
after this print review Sprint
retrospective happens so during this
meeting what went well like past
mistakes potential issues what are the
new ways to handle them which are
required to be done correctly in the
next iterations or next prints needs to
be identified
data from found from here are
Incorporated when planning the new
Sprint so it works like a Lessons
Learned what went well what did not go
well what is that we did for those what
did not go well so what is that learning
we have in these iterations so how can
we ensure that in the upcoming
iterations the same mistakes or will not
repeat so those can be uh discussed
documented and then consider while
moving to the next spring
then the increment is a workable output
which is given to the stakeholders so
this is where the user actually sees
their workable piece working item and
then they give necessary feedback as
well on the particular application piece
or software piece
then there is something called scrum
board which is used during this flow of
scrum right from product backlog to the
creation of that increment so let us
look at what is a scrum board which is
used during the scrum practice so scrum
board is a physical or virtual tool that
helps team to visualize items in the
Sprint backlog so it helps in tracking
what is being delivered what is in
progress and what needs to be delivered
further so it shows all action items
during the daily scrum helping keeping
the team focused on tasks that need to
be completion and the priorities of
those the scrum board is usually present
in a place that's accessible to all team
members it is a visual board right and
can be physical whiteboard and stickers
or virtual software tools which can be
used and displayed on the screen
so the scrum board is divided into
different slots like to do in progress
and done
so when new Sprints are started the
existing board is reset and new scrum
board is created so since it is visual
system I think it is taking the thought
from kanban so visual system always
works effectively because
the moment I know I see something is put
against my name that I need to complete
this it's quite obvious to me that I
will put efforts to complete it so it's
a conscious effort what I will put it
works on my Consciousness so something
which is not visible to me it is not out
of sight is out of mind so I will not
work on it so I may there is a tendency
to forget so if I see it regularly if I
have that feeling or that wipes which
comes to every individual that someone
is everyone is having a visibility to it
something is bending against me so I'm
answerable that the conscious that comes
to the mind so when people start working
on it and closing of that will happen
quickly
so everything is visible there is
nothing hidden
there are two main approaches to project
management the traditional waterfall
approach and the agile approach
originally agile developed as a way to
better manage software development
projects agile emerged in the late 1990s
specifically in response to the
challenges encountered when managing
software development projects using the
traditional waterfall approach
specifically addressing the burdens of
heavy documentation and frequent changes
in requirements
agile techniques and best practices
began to emerge and gain prominence in
software development projects this led
to a meeting in February 2001 in Park
City Utah where 17 leading software
developers wrote what has become known
as the agile Manifesto
let's review the agile Manifesto for
software development together
we are uncovering better ways of
developing software by doing it and
helping others do it
through this work we have come to Value
individuals and interactions over
processes and tools working software
over comprehensive documentation
customer collaboration over contract
negotiation
responding to change over following a
plan
that is while there is value in the
items on the right we value the items on
the left more
before you take your agile scrum
Foundation certification exam I
recommend you memorize these four lines
we call them the statement of value and
you can see that on the right hand side
those are items that are more relevant
for the traditional or waterfall
approach and on the left you have those
things that are more agile in nature
let's review each of these four lines
individuals and interactions over
processes and tools clearly any project
requires processes and tools however
individuals and their interactions
deliver better results when the emphasis
is not on the processes and the tools
working software over comprehensive
documentation
documentation here refers to things like
status reports progress reports detailed
specifications
which do not really demonstrate any real
progress or value
therefore the emphasis is on working
software that can be delivered and
demonstrated
customer collaboration over contract
negotiation
organizations need to be flexible and
accommodating rather than following
detailed definitions listed in contracts
responding to change over following the
plan
in agile small pieces of working
software are delivered to the customer
incrementally and the customer is
involved in the project from the
beginning to the end so in agile we are
responsive to the customer and willing
to make even mid-course Corrections in
order to deliver to the customer the
value that the customer wants
remember you will be tested on these
four lines so again I urge you to
memorize them in fact knowing these four
lines
and having a feel for what they mean
will actually help you get to the
correct answer on many questions in the
exam
here we can see what it might look like
to manage a project using the waterfall
approach you can see that the system and
software requirements would need to be
identified and documented up front
that would be followed by the necessary
analysis and program design work then
comes the actual coding and testing
that's Then followed by the handoff to
the customer or to operations
as you can see there is a heavy upfront
cost of documentation as well as the
status reporting that would need to be
done during the course of the project
you can also see that it would be
difficult to respond to change in this
kind of an approach
in fact the Standish group issued a
study that showed that software
development projects using the agile
approach succeed three times more often
than when using the waterfall approach
the Standish group defined project
success as being on time on budget and
delivering all of the planned features
the study summarized as follows
the agile process is the universal
remedy for software development project
failure software applications develop
through the agile process have three
times the success rate of the
traditional waterfall method and a much
lower percentage of time and cost
overruns now let
us agile firstly let's have a look at
methodologies
now agile is a set of principles that
are iterative and incremental agile has
a number of different methodologies you
can choose from there's XP Crystal
kanban even scrum for that matter
let's talk about strum now
scrum is an implementation of the
concepts of agile so basically most of
the important components of a child can
be applied to scrum as well
it provides the customer with
incremental builds that are delivered to
the customer in the span of two to four
weeks an organization can be agile but
not practice crop however an
organization cannot practice scrum
without being agile
next up let's have a look at projects
agile is more suited towards projects
that have a small development team that
consists of experts whereas on the side
of scrum it's usually better suited for
projects that are subject to a large
amount of change and that would rapidly
next we have leadership
now for agile a project head takes care
of all the tasks and has a very
important role to play in the process of
a gen
a project head represents the entire
team and is responsible for getting
issues resolved by assigning them to the
appropriate members of the team
in scrum there's no leader there's a
scrum master who can overall guidance
process but the team addresses issues by
themselves
it usually involves cross-functional and
self-organizing teams
next up we have flexibility
agile is relatively more rigid than
scrum and cannot handle changes with
these
it also requires a lot of upfront
development process and changes within
the organization
with scrum you can enable teams every
agile requires frequent deliveries so
that they can get feedback from the end
user
this in turn will help make the product
better
the product is delivered as well as
updated on a regular basis
with scrum after a Sprint feedback from
the client for a build is provided to
the team
scrum involves daily scrum meetings to
review and get feedback to determine the
next steps of the project
the next print is only planned by the
team after the current Sprint is
complete
next we have collaboration
with agile collaboration involves
face-to-face interactions with team
members of other cross-functional teams
for scrum daily stand-up meetings take
place with specific roles like scrum
Master product owner and the scrum team
and finally we have design
the design as well as its execution It's
relatively simple
with scrum the design and its execution
can be Innovative and experimental
so you might be wondering which one
should you choose
now among both these options there's one
thing that will remain common agile
now what you can decide upon is which
agile methodology you will be choosing
is it lean is it kanban or is it scrum
now if you do want to know more about
how scrum and kanban are different from
one another you can check out our video
scrum versus kanban
comes from the Japanese word can bam
which literally means signboard
like scrum kanban is a popular agile
framework that is a visual system by
which the work can be managed with ease
as it progresses
kanban uses something known as the
kanban board to make these things
possible
with this you can easily identify
bottlenecks and then fix them cost
effectively at optimal speeds
the main focus with kanban is
transparency
since everything related to the tasks
are on the board
everyone can keep themselves updated
it also ensures the team's focus on
their current tasks until they're done
this limits the amount of work that's in
progress
so on the kanban board work is divided
into smaller more manageable pieces
the work that's needed to be done is
written on a note or card and placed on
a board
columns on the board help represent
where each item is with respect to the
workflow now let's have a look at what
these are in detail
let's find out how kanban works
now the board consists of three major
components
there's the to-do list which represents
items that need to be completed
the ongoing column which represents
items that are being currently worked on
and the completed or the done column now
these represent tasks or items that have
already been completed
now although this is a physical
representation of the board several
organizations use software versions of
the board that replaces the sticky notes
with cards that can be moved from one
column to another as work progresses now
an example of such a software is Trello
so if you want to learn more about
Trello you can check out the link I'll
be adding to the live chat in a moment
at this point you guys must have
realized how similar these two
Frameworks sound
so let's run through some more of their
similarities
let's find out how they are similar
firstly they both have principles of
lean and agile which means reduction of
waste and both of them are time boxed
and iterative approaches that enable
product delivery in an incremental
manner
both these Frameworks aim to reduce the
amount of work in progress
this forces the teams to ensure that
they focus on a smaller set of tasks
this also makes blockers and bottlenecks
a little more visible
in both cases the work is divided into
smaller more manageable units
both of these Frameworks use pull
scheduling now this means that products
are only Built based on demand rather
than forecasts
transparency plays a major role in both
these Frameworks by helping them Drive
process Improvement
and in both cases the release plan is
continuously optimized and finally both
these methods aim to deliver releasable
software often and earlier than expected
so now that we've reached Midway let me
ask you guys a question
do you guys use scrum or kanban in your
workplace or do you use the software for
personal reasons what exactly do you use
these for let me know in the live chat
now let's have a look at how these two
Frameworks are different from one
another
firstly let's have a look at Cadence
Cadence refers to the amount of time in
a Sprint or before a release
so when it comes to scrum the entire
project is divided into time constrained
iterations that is into smaller
manageable units
but when it comes to kanban it's even
driven
next criteria we're going to have a look
at
is release methodology
in scrum releases take place after each
Sprint which usually takes two to four
weeks to complete
for kanman releases take place in the
form of continuous delivery
they happen in such a way that changes
like new features configuration changes
bug fixes and experiments get to the
users in a safe quick and sustainable
manner
next up let's have a look at how changes
are addressed in both these Frameworks
in scrum no change can be made while the
Sprint is in progress
once it's complete changes can be
considered in the Sprint plan and then
add it to the Sprint backlog
with kanban changes can be made at any
time and incorporated into the workflow
now let's consider the metric that's
being measured
in scrum for planning and process
Improvement velocity which is the
measure of the work that can be
completed by a team in a Sprint is the
key metric
in kanban lead time is the key metric
this represents the period of time
between a new task's appearance in your
workflow and its final departure from
the system
next let's have a look at how teams work
in these Frameworks
in scrum you need a cross-functional
team to achieve your goals in a Sprint
in kanban cross-functional teams are
optional but specialized teams that
focus on particular aspects of the
workflow are required
now let's talk about new additions
in scrum just like handling changes you
can't add any items between a Sprint or
night ration
in kanban new items can be added to the
board as long as there is capacity
available for it
now let's have a look at the job roles
Within These Frameworks
scrum has three major job roles product
owner scrum master and scrum team
with kanban you don't have any specific
job roles
now let's talk about representation
or moreover let's talk about how data
can be represented
with scrum the Board needs to be reset
once a particular Sprint is complete
with kanban the board stays persistent
throughout the entirety of the project
and finally let's have a look at project
length
with scrum it's better suited for longer
projects
and with kanban projects that can be
completed in a shorter period of time
are better
so which one should you choose
now selecting from these two methods is
mainly based on the requirements of the
team
do you expect your project to be shorter
do you want to make changes at any time
you don't want to set up job specific
roles then kanban is the framework for
you
or do you want a long running project
with different job roles and involving
cross-functional teams
scrum is the answer for you
based on the differences we discussed in
the last topic you can make an informed
decision
now let's have a look at some of the
popular companies around the world that
employ both these Frameworks
some of the companies that have
successfully implemented scrum are
Facebook General electronics and Adobe
companies that have implemented kanban
are Siemens BBC and sap and what I want
to do team is I want to before we get
into the user stories I want to go to
the Whiteboard and I want to just give
you a little bit more information
that might help us in organizing our
discussion that we're about to embark on
here
so a word that is not
in our slides is themes
themes are epics
and user stories grouped together
you know similar ethics and user stories
grouped together for planning purposes
so an epic is Big you would never do an
epic in or pardon me a scene in a Sprint
it's too big
so it's used for planning purposes
below that I would put epics
ethics are low priority
large user stories
meaning that an epic will eventually
have to be disaggregated into multiple
user stories
the reason it would be low priority is
because if it if an ethic was higher up
on the product backlog
it would have to be more detail that's
when you would break it down so epics
are usually going to live at the lower
uh priority levels of a product backlog
and as user stories are completed in the
Epic rises in priority it will
eventually be broken down into more
manageable user stories so great big low
priority user stories
then we have user stories themselves
user stories
are functions
or features
that the product owner wants to have
developed a user story turns into
working software
that provides value to the customer and
um and the product owner is the customer
voice the product the owner is the one
who would accept the reject completed
user stories
and then
there are tasks
and a reminder when we were talking
about the Sprint planning meeting we
said the Sprint planning meeting is uh
got two parts to it the first part is
selecting all of the user stories that
are going to be included in the Sprint
and then disaggregating each of those
users stories into tasks
that's then in the Sprint planning
meeting and then those tasks are the
things that are actually then done when
the work of the Sprint begins
user stories can be estimated in story
points
or ideal days
most teams favor story points they might
start with ideal days but they will then
usually end up going to story points
tasks are estimated in I
deal time
which is usually ours okay so now back
to our slides
so at the top left a use case could be
an example of a user story so it's
something that the user wants to do and
how the system should support it
um like a use case could be
select and pay for items in a catalog
now that could actually be an ethic or
maybe a theme because maybe it would get
disaggregated into log on screen uh
catalog shopping cart and checkout but
the so the use case could either be a
standalone user story or it could
actually be a number of user stories
that would result from it below that
requirement it could be a functional
requirement a technical task or even a
bug fix
so I'm going to go back to the
Whiteboard and a product backlog
is going to have a lot of user stories
that come from the customer
right whatever the customer wants done
but the team may know that it has to do
some development work in order for the
user stories to even be able to work you
know there's some system level
non-functional requirements that need to
be done and so there could be
Tech user stories and then
can you see this low
I can't see your chats but then there
could also be defect user stories there
could even be risk user stories now what
could happen is that
the product owner ranks these
in priorities so this one first and that
one then that one and the team says well
the only thing is is that we have to do
some development work before we can
actually do user story two and so what
we really need to do is insert that
before the uh the second priority user
story
and so the priority of the user stories
in the product backlog while it might
start with just being you know simple
functional user stories coming from the
uh product owner it will evolve until it
includes some other things that are also
considerations when it comes to uh
priorities because of you know successor
predecessor relationships dependencies
and things like that are considerations
um
a user story be uh back to the the uh
screen
um bottom left now the user story
um can use a fictitious user or a
Persona to help uh the team or the the
team and the product owner to get an
idea of okay who's going to be doing
this function uh what are they going to
need in order to be able to complete the
function Etc so you try and come up with
an actual well a fictitious but a person
who's actually doing it to kind of get
out of the realm of you know listing
requirements and you know specs and
things like that and say okay what's the
user experience need to look like top
right template a portion of a user story
is
um let me back up so a user story card
is usually going to contain
um a brief description of the user story
using some kind of a meta language
format like we're suggesting right here
as a user or Persona I want this feature
so that I can
so not unlike our
um
estimating session here as a frequent
Graveler I want to eat grapes so I can
be healthier in the one that we didn't
do uh the inventory system as a customer
okay there's a a user I want to get cash
back so I don't have to wait in line at
the bank okay
here's another user story as a
consumer I want the shopping cart
functionality to easily purchase items
online and maybe that could be customer
as well
as an executive right as a suit
I want to generate a sales report so I
know which departments need to improve
their productivity
as a buyer so you can see I tried to
come up with these different roles right
here executive buyer sales rep Etc
and that's the format as a type of user
I want some kind of goal
um or feature and uh so that's some kind
of a reason
um the below that connect
connect the dots by writing all of the
user stories necessary to uncover
the entire use case so like we were
talking about right here if you want to
be able to purchase items online from a
catalog that might be a multiple user
stories in order to support that use
case and so of course we would want to
be able to connect the dots and see
where all the user stories fit in into
the overall goal of the project or
release
and the stories
um
excuse me
are grouped
to form an epic or higher level story so
epic or theme
stories can then be split into child
stories or tasks and so that's what we
were covering before right you see you
have themes
up at the top that's the biggest
grouping if you will used primarily for
um you know high level planning purposes
so you have your themes then you have
your epics which are large user stories
um low priority and they're going to
have to be broken down into smaller user
stories like in the question that we had
at the end of the the last section where
the product owner needed something done
and the team said well based on the size
of this user story it's going to take
three Sprints to do well a user story
has to be small enough to be completed
within a shingle Sprint
so a Sprint can contain more than one
user story but a user story cannot stand
Sprints so that feature or function that
was in the question was probably more
like an epic it was something that would
need to be
disaggregated into smaller user stories
or perhaps it was more of a use case
that would need more than one user story
in order to actually deliver the overall
use case
let's see as a product supervisor I want
to see an unfinished part list
at the end of the day so that I can
reallocate work the next day
great user story description
well done barrage
um did you hear that team as a product
supervisor I wanted to see an unfinished
part list at the end of the day so I can
reallocate work the next day that is a
well-crafted description of a user story
that I want you to memorize you were
hoping I was done with the memorization
part
so I want you to
um
remember that we have to invest in our
user stories
and I was going over to the Whiteboard
and I didn't change cameras so let me do
that
I recommend
um
you know figuring out how you memorize
best
so that you can if
um well not if you wanted to what I
recommend is being able to write out all
of this stuff on plain white scrap paper
in about 14 minutes because that's the
amount of free time you have in the
tutorial when you're at the uh or when
you're taking the test
engine does a little bit different you
maybe won't have a tutorial the only
time you'd have a tutorial is if you
were at a center taking a test exit has
other options like you can do a
paper-based test
where you get a third party you know a
buddy or somebody who will agree to sort
of Proctor the test for you or you can
do it on your laptop all by yourself and
they have software that watches you
while you're taking the test and they
require you to take the laptop and do
like a 360 so that they can verify that
you don't have any cheat sheets up on
the wall or anything like that but the
point is is is you got to have this
memorized whether you're going to dump
it out on the paper or not when I took
the test I actually did the paper-based
option
um and that was because of some time
constraints and it was the quickest way
to get me into the test and so I didn't
write out any of the stuff I'd memorized
but I had it memorized and I had it
memorized well enough that I could kind
of recall it in my mind's eye
Okay so
we're talking about user stories and you
have to invest in your user stories you
know I like memorizing things by
creating these charts that have the
first letter
of the word or phrase that you're
memorizing in a separate column and then
I make up a story you know that
reminds me that I've got to have i n v e
s t this one is pretty easy probably
just invest works
um
but so let's go over that I stands for
independent
independent meaning that each user story
stands on its own
um you don't have
when we're doing scrum you don't do a
user story that won't result in working
software
we just talked about the description of
user stories right so it's a user that
needs some kind of functionality for
some kind of a reason and they're all
independent will they work together of
course they'll work together if that's
the necessity but
um if you developed a log on screen you
could demonstrate working software for
the login screen there might be another
user story that is
um you know has to do with displaying uh
the catalog and being able to flag or
select items that you want to purchase
but there'd be working software for that
would they work together yes but each
user story would complete or result in
some kind of working software and they
have to be independent
negotiable
negotiable in the way the user story is
going to be implemented the product
owner doesn't dictate to the team the
team doesn't say it it's only this way
and we don't want to hear anything from
you so there are discussions about the
size and implementation for each user's
user story so the product owner can't
make it so detailed
that there's no room for discussion and
the possibility of you know the team
coming up with Solutions other than what
the product owner was attempting to
dictate
um V stands for valuable
meaning each user story has to create
value for the customer or the end user
e it has to be estimable
as an estimatable except estimatable is
not really a word it's estimable
um and answers for small
has to be small enough to be done in a
single Sprint if we're doing two-week
Sprints has to be able to be done in two
weeks or less if we're doing four week
Sprints it could be a larger user story
but it would still uh have to be done in
four weeks or less
and then the last one the t is testable
every user story needs to be testable
and it needs to be testable at two
levels remember our triangle needs to be
testable at the intrinsic quality level
unit tests Etc and also testable at the
extrinsic level which is the customer
point of view which is acceptance so
every user's story uh has to be testable
okay so that's invest and so let's add
that to our list of things to memorize
invest
and then the next one we have here is
um the three C's of a user story
so the first C team is card
so user stories should be able to be
written on a four by six inch index card
or some media similar to that
card
does the second C is conversation
the user story card is the item that is
used for the team and the product owner
to talk and discuss in order to make
sure that the product owner and the team
are on the same page when it comes to
what is actually supposed to be
developed and
um
uh what you know so what it's supposed
to look like at the end which leads us
to the third one which is confirmation
each user story essentially has to have
acceptance tests
um in it itself
so card 4x6 conversation that's the
starting point that's where uh the team
and the product owner discuss and then
eventually there will be acceptance
tests included on the user story card
um in order to be used during the Sprint
review to
assure that it's acceptable that there's
confirmation
oh oh let's add that to the memorization
list
so
three C's
all right now I've got an example here
of a user story card
so we're looking right here
and if you were to go out on the
internet and search user story cards
they would be similar there would be
some differences of course
um
but typically what you're going to have
is you're going to have a title or a
name for the user story and then there's
going to be some kind of unique
identifier like user story 321 then
there will be the description like we
just talked about
as a librarian I want to have the
facility of searching a book by
different criteria so that I will save
time while serving a customer
other descriptive words or links to
other information that might be
necessary and then there would be
acceptance criteria or tests sometimes
these get included on the back of the
card but the point is is that they are
on the court on the card rather
then there will be an estimate of size
it could be ideal days or story points
as I mentioned most teams do story
points that's more likely what you'll be
tested on as opposed to
Ideal days but you know we'll cover both
so you understand
the differences
there's probably it's not listed here
but there's probably going to be a
value point assignment this is where the
product owner
um kind of determines in a relative way
the value of the stories just like we
were doing in planning poker the product
owner might say well this story is twice
as valuable as this other one comparing
them together and this is what
um these value points are what's used to
prioritize the user stories that's
supposed to be a v as in value points
and then typically there's also going to
be a indication sometimes it's just by
colors it could be words that has to do
with you know where the story came from
did it come from the customer that would
be considered a functional requirement
if it came from the team that would be
from the technical domain I'm trying to
write where from
uh you know it's not meeting it's the
mouse
clearly
it's hard to uh do that that's from
where from
um here it's got uh customer tech you
could also have defect you could maybe
have risk
um and then there's also going to be an
X Factor
um which would be
some kind of word probably like
um
stable
um erratic
um incomplete
something like that to uh so that the
team is designating the user story in uh
respect to the amount of uncertainty or
risk that's associated with that user
story and because all of that's a part
of the story right the story is going to
be turned into working software there
may need to be some efforts to actually
figure out how to actually do that user
story
to the right here on the same chart we
have some comments about
if you are using a software package
excuse me like Trello or jira or
something like that excuse me the user
story cards will generally be able to
contain more information using you know
dynamic links and things like that could
even include things like responsible
team member or depending on how you're
doing it you would break the user Story
down into tasks and you might have team
members assigned to various tasks for
the user story
um okay so that's typically what a user
story card is like sometimes they're
cards sometimes they're like on sticky
notes and they're put up on a kanban
board if you're using kanban to track
the project
if you have a story that is too large to
be completed in a Sprint it's going to
have to be subdivided or we call it
disaggregation into
smaller user stories and there's uh
three ways that we're proposing here
that you could go about doing that you
could split it based on operational
boundaries for example as an operator
one needs to manage reservations which
could be split for example there could
be one portion that is that has to do
with making a reservation another one
that has to do with modifying it and yet
another one that has to do with
canceling it so
um that could be split into in this
construct here three separate user
stories you could also separate based on
exceptions or cross-cutting concerns for
example in the beginning develop only
one main path like accept repayment for
a loan
then address exceptions like what if a
person overpays
then come up with a user story that
recognizes that and processes a refund
and or gives the option of allocating
the overpayment to a future payment or
something like that
and then all
um
earns like the check
attractions or record name of operator
so maybe
um you know when you're working on
accepting payments or processing refunds
it's going to check on who the operator
is or track that so that if at a later
time you know who is it that gave this
uh refund here well you could look and
see you know okay the the operator's
name was recorded or maybe you put some
restrictions so that maybe not everybody
is allowed to do a refund and so you
would have levels of users that have
different privileges
okay and then down at the bottom split
Based on data boundaries for an example
you know as an accountant one needs to
enter balance sheet information
um which could then be split into
summary information
and separately
um uh receivable details or you know
maybe you could have AP you know so you
could have different portions of the
overall
um
balance sheet activities that need to be
done
so enter AR enter AP
etera
make sense
so just to kind of prompt you give you
some ideas about what to do
um in a scrum project if you have the
scenario arise where a user story is
being estimated by the team and it won't
fit into a Sprint
too big
now when it comes to determining value
for user stories this is primarily owned
by the product owner right and it always
comes back to money but money you know
the value can be looked at from
different points of view so new Revenue
obviously you know getting new customers
and having them buy stuff
um well below that there's another
consideration incremental Revenue uh so
somebody's in the process of placing an
order
um maybe there are some premium features
that could be add-ons at that point in
time
um or maybe added later on so you have
an existing customer who actually buys
um more of or enhanced parts of the
existing thing they already purchased or
are in the process of purchasing
retained value so this is
um
you know
retaining customers so that they don't
go to a competitor
and then the bottom one is operational
efficiency you know how could things be
done to speed up the process of whatever
it is so that the cost of delivering the
product is reduced
let's do a discussion about priorities
recognizing that there are some priority
concerns that come from both the
customer domain as well as the technical
domain
and there are some prioritization models
um if we look right here there is
value-based prioritization and the
hierarchy of that would be high value
followed by high risk followed by high
value
and then low risk followed by low value
and then low risk
so you know we might have written this a
little bit differently but that's
value-based prioritization and this is
primarily the product owner with maybe
some input from the team just simply
deciding what he or she wants done most
listening to the team sayable you know
there's some you know greater risks with
this user story than that and so you'd
probably want to persuade the product
owner to take care of high-risk stuff
first because that would happen
yeah
a uh oh excuse me sorry an impact on the
future things that need to be done
there's the the Cano model
which looks at each of the user stories
and classifies them as being mandatory
linear or exciters
and the mandatory items are those user
stories that are musts and they'll never
move Beyond move the customer or the end
user Beyond neutral it's if they're not
there it creates dissatisfaction if the
the you the product owner the team has
done a good job at identifying what are
the mandatory or threshold items
um you would see that
um
it just gets it to neutral that's what's
expected for the product
linear items user stories are those user
stories that as they are implemented
progressively throughout the project and
added to the feature set it will linear
increase customer satisfaction and it
can be you know in their absence
dissatisfaction all the way up to high
implementation creating a great deal of
satisfaction for the customer and then
the third category is exciters and
delighters
um and those are features or functions
those are user stories that are not
mandatory and the absence of them will
never result in satisfaction going below
neutral but by adding them
um you could create excitement and
Delight for the customer
these would typically be things that are
features that would be included in a
premium version of the product or maybe
add-ons that are promoted you know at
the point of sale you know if you
thought about this because it'll really
help you or whatever
it's a channel model and then there's
uyghurs relative weighting method and
um this is all using numbers so each
feature is given a value for its benefit
and its penalty given a value for
penalty meaning what's the pain is that
feature or function is not included
and then there is
um
um the cost side and the risk side
and then those are all calculated
together and that results in
excuse me a ranking or a hierarchy which
gives you the priority for the user
stories
um we also talked about Moscow didn't we
did we talk about Moscow
uh Moscow is another prioritization
model must could
I said that differently must should
could won't mosh cow mscw must should
could won't
and we talked about that one thank you
for that confirmation
does it seem like a long time ago or is
it just me I know it was just last
weekend but it's like last year
okay so now let's talk about velocity
um uh Priyanka that is exactly right
um
velocity is the capacity of the team
to complete
work in a single iteration
so the team has estimated the user
stories uh for size or ideal days and
um the Sprints are going to be three
weeks in duration obviously not all user
stories can be completed in a shingle
Sprint and be done with the project well
I guess maybe I shouldn't say Obviously
what I'm saying that I'm thinking well
maybe you had a very small short
duration project so you could but the
point is is that it's the team's
capacity to complete work in a given
Sprint and it is
an observation it's not a prediction
so if we're working on Sprint five
and we're working on determining what
our velocity is
then um it would be the average of the
previous four sprints
if there were any uh outliers you'd you
would disregard those
um
and so it's an observation
if we look over to question or uh box
number two here velocity is used to deal
with
determining how many user stories we are
going to include in a given Sprint and
also how many Sprints are we going to
need to create a release or a set of
user stories
and here's an example
in box number three a team completed
five user stories that were sized five
three eight thirteen and two
two user stories each sized five were
left half complete
what is the velocity of the team
and the answer is either going to be
31 or 36.
31 is the sum of the completed user
stories if you were 36 you were claiming
half of the two that were five so that
would be a total of 10 so you claim half
of it which would be 5 would take you to
36.
but it's not going to be 36 because the
only thing that
cards
progress is working software so even if
the team had finished nine out of 10
story points for a user story meaning
it's almost done and then the Sprint
ends that doesn't get counted towards
velocity
and you don't mess around with velocity
you can mess around with your estimating
and you can mess around with
um you know what user stories are going
to be completed in a Sprint but you
don't the the velocity is not variable
it is what it is based on past
performance
when it comes to levels of planning
we have What's called the planning onion
and let me walk you through this here up
at the the brightest area is the vision
level so the vision level that's the
suits right they're the ones that have
the strategy and objectives for the
company and where it's going and so they
have that overall big vision for the uh
company
which is likely going to include
products and each product should have a
road map
my example of that website that I'm
working on has uh three versions which
make up the product roadmap version one
is the free site version two is the
membership site and version three is the
um uh the pay referral commissions uh uh
version of the site
and the product roadmap
road map ported by
it by so for my project I have three
releases so all of the user stories
needed for the free version are in
release one all of the additional user
stories that are needed for the
um
uh paid version the subscriber version
uh and then also for version three those
are all releases three releases
and then for each Sprint we will be
pulling user stories from the release
that we're working on a release is
likely going to take multiple Sprints
and
um and then the Sprints are populated by
the individual user stories which are
then disaggregated into tasks
and we do the
excuse me the daily scrum
which is the daily level of planning and
coordination so we call that the
planning onion
we already kind of talked about the
release and road map
um concept here so let's just review
this quickly
um proprietories high level ethics and
determine goals and releases so we'll
use epics and themes in order to group
things together you know what should be
included and what's released so what are
the goals for the releases then the
first bullet point established goals of
release based on market demand
regulatory needs or customer
expectations
for each release you want to estimate
the target stories
repeat until the target stories are
assigned and iteration length
I should that should it's blending some
things here
um be able to estimate velocity and then
assign stories to the Sprints so we keep
estimating the user stories and we keep
organizing uh that until we can do that
we can come up with an iteration length
of Sprint length and then figure out
what our velocity for each Sprint is and
then assign stories to the uh the
Sprints uh the the next bullet down
iterate until the user stories and
release date meets conditions of
satisfaction
so that's a definition of then or
acceptance for the release and try not
to pack too much into a release backlog
so
uh
you would not want to pack too many user
stories into a Sprint you want to have
the timelines appropriate and what are
included in the event makes sense
okay so here's a bit more about release
planning on this slide here
um you've got the product backlog here
on the left and then we might come up
with a release plan which could be
flipped and could be looked at uh
horizontally and you probably plan
um about
three releases in advance
um or at least you're doing more of the
detailed planning on that because things
are going to emerge when we do you know
Sprint one that's going to help in
Sprint two and things that happen in
Sprints one and two that are going to
help
release three and then you've got
um you know your subsequent releases
where we're just doing very high level
planning it's called rolling wave
planning where we do detailed planning
for things in the future and tandem with
doing high level planning for things in
uh the future
did I say that right detail planning for
things in the near term intend them with
high level planning for things in the
future
um and we talked about deciding as late
as possible I believe meaning that it's
better to actually plan the latest
releases
uh for purposes of
making sure we have more information uh
the most information available
okay so estimation
let's start at the top left the
principles behind estimation understand
the cone of uncertainty which is an
estimate or best guess to begin with and
then progressively becomes more accurate
in fact let's just take a break and look
at the cone of uncertainty so at the
very beginning of a project there's
going to be a high level of uncertainty
if I were to draw this chart I would
make it a little bit more like
this
so clearly you're going to de-risk the
project
as early as you can and then eventually
all risk disappears when the project is
done risk is uncertainty
okay below that the only estimate that
matters is the one given by the chain
foreign
by this uh comment here nothing is
impossible for the one who doesn't have
to do it so the product owner is like
Keem come on you can do this the team's
like no we know what our velocity is no
the product owner says I'm telling you
there's no way that that can't be done I
know you can do it I trust you I believe
in you
but the product on it doesn't ask you to
have to do the work okay copyright
overestimation and underestimation is
always going to be an issue that we deal
with
it's more likely that we will
underestimate than overestimates
and by looking at our velocity from
iteration or Sprint to Sprint
um there could be some information that
is
um showing us that we're underestimating
for example meaning we're thinking we
you know the user stories are smaller
than they are and that we can get you
know a certain number done in the Sprint
and then there's a fail
well that would mean then that would be
discussed during the retrospective and
then we would do something different
going forward which might include doing
some re-estimating
scrum estimating is not necessarily more
difficult however scrum exposes bad
estimates sooner which is a good thing
when we were doing our
um
uh planning poker you could see that
um the first time as a team you know we
didn't know each other we didn't know
everybody's thoughts and concerns and
those kinds of things you know get
shared and absorbed as a project goes on
and so there's a higher awareness of
that
so
um what we would say is that
um using estimation techniques from
estimation techniques might be more
inaccurate at the beginning of a project
but they will quickly become very
accurate as the project advances forward
excuse the question here can velocity be
increased over a period of time for the
project yes it can now it's not that it
can't it will increase if the team is
learning how to work together better and
better you would expect that if I can
just use my mouse here if we were
tracking
velocity so this would be points
completed over here let me just do pts
for points and down here is time
and we go from Sprint to Sprint right
you would expect that maybe you know the
first couple of Sprints the team would
be learning how to work together and
there would be a steep curve and then it
would kind of flatten out and maybe have
you know a slow rise going forward as
the team emerges as a high performing
team they get better at their cross
functional Behavior you know somebody's
 the team just keeps chugging along
um other things you know just
um oh sorry
I bumped the thing on my screen there
um
um so the team you know learns how to
work better together and you know they
ask them it's become more accurate Etc
and you would expect a high for a high
performing team to have a uh a result
like this for velocity where there's
quick Improvement and then it kind of
stabilizes and then begins to tick
upwards
okay we talked about the tone of
uncertainty let's talk about ideal time
um when we do estimating for user
stories
um we do it in ideal days when we do
estimating for tasks we do it in ideal
time which means hours I think that's on
the Whiteboard or it was on the
Whiteboard oh it was on it
um so ideal time is the amount of time
it takes to complete a piece of work
but that's based on
the notion that
the team member or members are available
to do just the work
with no distractions or anything at all
so assuming that
um Priyanka could sit down add a
keyboard and code for eight hours
without taking a break for lunch no
phone calls no discussions no meetings
of any kind just work eight hours how
much could be done in that eight hours
by Priyanka that's what ideal time is
but the thing of it is is that there is
no such thing as somebody being able to
spend every minute of every day only
doing work there will be distractions
so it has to be converted into elapsed
time now we don't convert it to elapsed
time at the user story level but we do
convert it to elapsed time when we are
dealing at the task level
and what that looks like is
you know for each team member you're
going to have to do it separately
because some team members have more
distractions than others some might have
other duties that pull them away
um whatever the case may be you
determine how much time in a given day a
team member is available to do work so
say it's five hours out of eight for one
maybe it's six hours out of eight for
another maybe it's four out of eight but
you figure out what it is and then you
take the average and that average
availability is used then to convert
Ideal Time into elapsed time
um I should have circled this box here
because we talked about this as well
um and then I already mentioned this
year only considers actual work time not
the distraction so that's the concept of
Ideal Time
when it comes to story points it's
different than that
they are a measure of size relative to
each other so we were doing planning
poker this morning where we were looking
at grapes versus apples and then we were
looking at oranges and and what else do
we have watermelons and coconuts and we
weren't trying to figure out how much
time it would take to eat grapes as
opposed to how much time it would uh
take to eat a coconut it's clear that
it's going to take longer to eat a
coconut because there's more effort
involved so we have a sense that it's
going to take more time but comparing
the coconut to our Baseline of two right
we came up with a baseline of two for
the smallest user story We compare
eating coconuts to that Baseline and we
say okay you know what it's going to
take more effort to eat the coconut than
it is to eat grapes or apples
so you so you get like we did you can
also triangulate for example when we did
our planning project this morning or
this morning for me rather at the
beginning
um oh that's not it that is the daily
stand-up
here it is
if I had said Team I want you to pick a
small user story a medium user story and
a large user story
um and then we would then compare other
stories to those three and so we would
kind of triangulate on it let's say that
we did uh you know two was small
uh I'm sorry I'm saying that wrong
grapes was small apples were medium and
coconuts were large
well if we then looked at Orange and we
said well you know orange is
um smaller than Apples but bigger than
grapes so we would know this would fit
in between grapes and apples
um
and so let's say you know we had apples
at five and grapes at two then we would
say an orange is probably going to be
three
and the values you know now I used in
our example the modified Fibonacci
series
what we do in scrum and agile if we're
using story points we're going to use a
non-linear scale for the values so down
at the bottom
here there's the modified Fibonacci
Sequence the way the Fibonacci sequence
works by the way
um
um it's the
the value is the sum of the two on the
right so let me break this right here
because this is a modified Fibonacci so
13 is five plus eight a is three plus
five five is two plus three and three is
one plus two
if we were doing the real Fibonacci
series this wouldn't be 20 it would be
13 plus 8 which would be 21.
um I I don't know why some use modified
Fibonacci and others not but that's just
kind of
a common thing to do if you're doing
planning poker you give everybody seven
cards one two three five eight thirteen
and twenty
another non-linear scale is doubling one
two four eight sixteen you typically
don't go too far to the left with the
values because that either means that
you're being too granular or you've got
stories that are probably too big and
they need to be just aggregated
now somebody just chatted here
um should some buffer time be included
in the actual estimates
um
let me answer that question first by
going back to Ideal time and then I'm
going to come back to story points and
answer the question
when we're estimating in ideal time we
don't add a special amount of time that
we would call a buffer we just allow for
the distractions and the interruptions
which could look like a buffer right
you're saying you know
um you know priante if based on your
duties in the organization and our work
day of eight hours you're typically
available to be doing your project work
five out of those eight hours
so when we are converting ideal time to
elapsed time
um you know we will be building in extra
time based on distractions and
interruptions we would not call it a
buffer but that's essentially what we're
doing now when it comes to user stories
that we're using story points it is
different
the points are for the entire amount of
the work and why might we need to have
some extra time for a user story well
it's likely going to be driven by
uncertainty there might be other uh
things that impact it but that's the
main thing
sorry team
so when the team is estimating the size
of the user story they will be including
in their discussion and estimates any
extra time or buffer time that would be
needed for uh that user story to be
completed
so do we accommodate
um uncertainty when we're using story
points yes we're looking at the The X
Factor and if we've got an unstable user
story then we're probably going to say
you know this is going to be a bigger
user story than one that's similar but
has a much lesser level of uncertainty
um so that's the story points let's
compare the two
um Ideal Time uses things like hours and
days which is easier to explain outside
the team
right the suits like things in days and
hours everybody's estimate may be
different not a bad thing it's easier to
do at the beginning because we're
oriented to think about time and it does
kind of shine a light on wasted time
waypoints
are harder to explain outside the team
um you know the suit says well how long
is it going to take to do user story 301
and our answer is
um well that's a 10 user story Point
user story and the suit's saying what
does that mean tell me how long it's
going to take
um so the suits have to be converted to
uh uh story points now here's the thing
it's a lot easier to get consensus when
we're estimating in story points and
once we get good at it it's going to be
much faster
we have to remember it's not comparable
across teams so you know a team working
together will have its own tennis system
for sizing the stories and another team
that might even be working on the same
project will have a CO a whole different
uh scheme and so if the velocity of one
team is 25 in the velocity of another is
50 it doesn't mean that the team with
the velocity of 50 is able to do more
work than the teams whose velocity is
25.
we did when we got our day going we
started with
a planning poker exercise and so you
know we used all of the team members so
we selected the team the product owner
was there to answer any questions
the team discussed each of the story
cards and then decided what their vote
was going to be and then everybody voted
it once if there were outliers they were
discussed and the reasons for that those
variances those outliers were then part
of the discussion and then we did
another round of voting and we would
keep doing that until we had our
estimates converge or we reached
consensus on them
okay so advantages of planning poker
it's fun it's quick it gets the whole
team involved the the team understands
um a little bit about all of the stories
everybody contributes his or her
expertise and the discussion during the
estimation provides Clarity in the
direction approach and even a bit of
design if we were in the same room team
and we were doing a planning poker
activity like we did at the beginning of
our day uh together
we would be able to you know model it a
little bit better or if we tried to
unmute everybody but you could hear the
background noise I've tried doing it it
doesn't really work but you get the idea
that if the team's discussing and things
like that you would actually get to the
point where your estimates would
converge and the team would say okay
this user story size is you know
whatever it is
okay so we need to wrap things up for
the day so we are ending right here and
that means tomorrow when we get together
we're going to be doing slide 20. you're
starting with that which is Affinity
estimating
and let's see Affinity estimating we go
through that we're going to talk about
tracking progress using
um information radiators and then we're
going to talk about what we do when we
find variances between the plan and the
actual results and then we'll have our
quiz so we're almost finished
um I think we're good on time
now let us look at a typical scenario of
an organization where the need of user
stories would come in so looking at this
scenario say an organization would have
a scenario where uh the existing
products are sold very well in the
market and they may think about
introducing new product or they may
think about introducing a new feature or
functionality to the existing product so
the scenario what we are considering is
it says our previous products sold
really well in the market now let's
think about new products so we'll need
to make sure we can understand the
requirements and fulfill the
requirements now how do you do this so
how are you going to understand the
consumer requirements user requirements
and how is that going to help the user
to accomplish the requirement and
fulfill the need whatever it's required
to be fulfilled so user story helps one
who understand user stories would look
at the perspective of the users and
these user stories provides those
Insight towards what user would exist
so as we go through we will understand
in the perspective of the users the
requirements and how user stories helps
in terms of fulfilling those
requirements this requires certain
amount of visualization let us see what
it is so what are user stories
users stories are an agile software
development project management tool that
provides users with simple natural
language explanations of one or more
features written from the end users
perspectives
so for a given product we may have many
end users so we may develop an
application within an organization and
use that application for an organization
that is one scenario second scenario is
we create a product we sell it and
employees of our customer organization
will become users of those products
these are the two scenarios so having
these scenarios what kind of product it
is what is the objective of this product
which is going to fulfill so let me
assume an HR application which is used
for submission of claims from the
employees so what is that requirement so
this application should accept the
claims submission from the employees of
the organization and then that needs to
be processed and the claims needs to be
clear now what will happen now the user
Community if you visualize there is a
user as an employee of an organization
who submit claims so there is an user in
the finance perspective who is going to
deposit the money similarly there is an
user who is going to approve so many
such user interfaces we will see the
existence of the roles of users we will
see who would be using these particular
applications so in their perspective
there should be an interface provided
there should be some privileges provided
through which they would do their
transactions and activities when we
write the user stories we don't write
them in detail so a user story doesn't
go in detail it just mentions how a
certain type of work will bring value to
end user so what is this role specific
end user would be doing at that
particular role in this particular
product what is the transactions
involved so the end user in this case
could mean external end user or even
internal customer or colleagues within
the organization so looking at these
points if I look at the same application
HR claim processing application who are
these internal users the employees of
organization so who are these external
maybe the people who sold this
particular application to our
organization so they have installed it
they manage it there is an
Administration role for this particular
product that is a role similarly another
set of internal users maybe someone who
is like from Finance from HR so in each
of these roles perspective this
particular product should provide the
interface and then there should be a
transaction in their perspective which
is very important so user story should
explain this in very brief so that it
helps in terms of visualizing what kind
of interface has to be provided and why
would this particular role use it that
is very important
so user stories also form the building
block of a gel Frameworks like epics and
initiatives so what is this epics what
is this initiatives let us look at it
now Epix refers to the group of user
stories where the large amount of work
broken down into user storage so many
user stories together forms epics which
will provide certain Insight towards how
these user stories are connected with
each other
so similarly initiative refers to
combination of multiple epics forming
that initiatives so which is very
essential to groups of managing
perspective it will become easy and also
looking at the objective what is that
particular group of user stories group
of epics are going to accomplish so user
stories can also help ensuring that
teamwork to goals of the organization
through epics and initiatives it should
be looking at that objective exactly
what is the directions we are getting
into and how these combination of user
stories so as an employee I'm submitting
my claims so what is that required in
that user's perspective there should be
story so I as a finance person I'm going
to clear this claims I'm going to pay
with the money deposit the money so that
is that particular role needs certain
interfaces and that visualization
requires how this interactions happens
so user story should help in terms of
understanding those so the requirements
for making user story reality are added
later after discussing with the team so
I we made an user story we created an
user story it doesn't end there so there
needs to be a discussion which happens
further to decide yes it is a valid user
story
so this will also helps in terms of
prioritization which needs to be taken
up first so user stories are recorded on
post it notes or an index card or a
project management software and this
would help in terms of prioritization or
for tracking as well so what is the
advantages of user stories
so advantages of user story involves it
helps in delivering high quality content
because what is required to be
accomplished in the user perspective
that will be very clear
eases collaboration with team members
because finalization on the user stories
and understanding of the user
requirements would happen after
discussing with the team members each
one would give their own viewpoints and
a prioritization of particular user
story or keeping a specific user story
or not considering that user story would
be based on the feedback which team
provides this cannot happen in terms of
having team members together and
speaking about it helps understanding
users better so user roles are discussed
users requirement is discussed and what
is that they are going to accomplish
through this user interface that is also
discussed so user role is understood
user requirement is clearly understood
by writing and user story this will also
help in improving transparency because
since the collaboration is happening
since the Hilton user story is not just
taken just like that the discussion
happens and that will have an intact
interaction and collaboration so
definitely improves transparency
so now it reduces risks so when I say
risk it's obviously uncertainty
so it reduces risk because the clarity
one would have about the requirement of
users so accordingly the features
functionality of the product are defined
so that they can fulfill those user
requirements then supports iterative
developments as I mentioned earlier the
collaboration the transparency everyone
working together and in the agile
perspective users stories epics and
initiatives gets into the specific
iterations only after this discussion
with the team members and after
prioritizing it so the user story will
be there in the product backlogs which
will be prioritized based on that
particular scenario of requirement in
agile scenario so as when we say agile
it's quite obvious we need to be
flexible to the changing scenarios so
since we are working together and when
we go for an iterative mode of approach
it's quite obvious we're going for it to
get adopting to the changing scenario so
that we can select that particular
features functionality by pulling that
particular epic or user story as a
priority in the given list so that
prioritization making will also become
easier focuses on opal Communications
means lot of interactions happens while
discussing on user stories so since
people are doing it locally so there is
some Personal Touch also established
collaboration can get established save
the story also provides that visibility
because of that people working together
in a collaborative manner invest in user
stories so what is invest so investing
in user stories so what does that mean
so it is a concept that helps creating
meaningful user stories so it stands for
independent negotiable valuable
esteemable sized appropriately testable
so when I say independent
so whenever we write the user story that
should be self-contined if at all
possible
to avoid dependencies on other user
stories so it should be independent of
one another so that each of them can be
developed and delivered separately
so negotiable so when we say negotiable
user stories can always be changed or
Rewritten so at any given point in time
so we should be able to do the
modifications required so that should
support the flexibility associated with
the agile methodologies so since
requirements often evolve changes and
these changes comes for various
different reasons so how do we change
this user stories or modify this so that
it can fit into the requirement so that
adaption can happen to the changing
requirements so story should be
discussable and should be open for
negotiation for any change scenarios so
next valuable when I say valuable it's
quite obvious we're speaking about value
what is being created for the users or
consumers
so a user story would represent the goal
or an objective or end user who is going
to look for means value is always in the
consumer's perspective so now I created
certain features functionality is fine
but did that really create the value to
the consumers
so the value realization plays an
important role So Stories must ensure
there is a value being added to the
consumers and customers or users always
otherwise user story doesn't make any
sense so esteemable so when we say
estimable one should always be able to
estimate the size of the user story so
sometimes developers may not have the
experience required to size the
particular situations or needed for news
story reasons may be anything it may be
not having specific Insight towards it
or don't know how to estimate there may
be someone specific who needs to
understand that scenarios and then come
and discuss reasons may be anything so
stories if you cannot estimate then it
will become difficult in terms of
handling it better so it should give
some visualization so it should be
estimable and can be divided into tasks
so now small
means sized appropriately
so user story should not be very big or
should not be too small and then how do
we decide on this size
so now when we say any user story that
can be completed by a developer in
single iterations then can we call it as
too big quite obviously that is again
indicative
so user story should be subdivided in
two or more small stories into multiple
pieces multiple stories small small
stories so that it can be handled better
so story should not be too big and
should be completed within 40 hours or
three to four days these numbers are
indicative so not necessarily you should
be fixing with this number so just an
indicative to show you that what would
be the focus when I say use the story in
what is that effort it would take to
accomplish that now testable
so when we say user story is testable
one has to ensure that development is
complete and has been done correctly so
means one once you create a user story
so that needs to be articulated in such
a way so that it becomes measurable when
I say testable obviously there should be
metrics a Target Matrix which can be
created which will help me to State yes
this particular requirement is
accomplished so they should have an
acceptance criteria that can be tested
to check if they fulfill the customer's
need so then how to write user story
this is very important uh point to look
at so how to write the user story so
writing users stories comes up with a
specific template with a simple language
so what is it so now as a role I want to
so that so you keep filling it so
typically role means what the specific
user role who would be using that
particular product and their
requirements which are being fulfilled
so that is the role the name of the role
we are going to put it here
so the role refers to an individual that
would be interfacing or interacting with
the system now uh one two when we say
one two the want or action which
represents the behavior of the systems
so what is that it's supposed to do this
action would be unique to each user
stories now so that this refers to the
benefits or results that non-functional
and external to the system as a result
what would happen what is that we are
trying to accomplish out of it
so let us look at an example how does it
look like as a CEO I want to track my
subordinates progress to ensure
organizations goals are met similarly if
we take the reference to those examples
what we discussed earlier like we took
the example of HR portal so claim
processing requirement now this can be
same user story as an employee of an
organization what can I write so as an
employee of this organization
I want to submit my claims online so
that claim processing will become
smoother easier faster without any
errors so that can also be user story so
it gives certain visualization what kind
of users are there and what is that they
need so the moment you write the user
stories you should visualize that rule
it is very important so there is three
C's of user stories which we call it as
card then conversation and then
confirmation
so when we say card card provides a
written description of the user story so
what do I mean by return description of
the user story
so same thing the user story what we
just saw as an example so that can be
written on a card so this will help in
planning and estimating so what and that
will also gives that visualization of
users and their requirement so that that
can be articulated further and also
estimated so that it can look in the
perspective of invest what is invest
what we discussed so it is independent
it is negotiable it is valuable it is
estimable it is sized appropriately
means it's not should not be too big too
small the examples what we saw was
appropriate and testable so now when we
see this particular user story is it
fulfilling all those points what we
discussed in invest that is very
important now this card whatever the
description is provided should elaborate
on that very clearly so then further
what happens
conversation
after the user store is written in a
card and given and it is shared with
every individuals who is participating
in that conversation
so then there will be a discussion so
conversation represents discussion
between users team product owners so
this helps in terms of whatever the user
story is written is it making sense is
it in line with the user's expectation
and at the same time whatever the
understanding we have maybe as a product
owner or the team member a developer is
my understanding correct the user
perspectives or whatever the user story
is written is that user story is
speaking about the requirement which
needs to be fulfilled as they require so
this helps to build a shared
understanding between all those
individuals so that there is no
confusion further
so once people Converse together once
the stakeholders Converse together then
you will confirm confirmation
so this represents the condition that
need to be satisfied to ensure that the
Story meets all requirements so you are
confirming so all the stakeholders are
agreeing to that
so firstly to summarize this three C's
refers to card conversation confirmation
card provides the user stories which
actually represents as we took an
example so which will capture that so
that it also fulfills the thought of
invest then uh conversation is required
to understand what is this user story is
speaking about is that a real
requirement so confirmation further in
terms of confirmation from users as well
as all the stakeholders before you go on
develop or execute that so what is life
cycle of user story so when we say life
cycle so we may require to understand a
life cycle starts when you conceptualize
when you visualize when you say this is
what we may require to accomplish they
should be conceiving someone should
conceive that idea so it may be a
related to a problem it may be related
to a specific product for an opportunity
what is seen so whatsoever the reason it
is there is a scenario where something
is conceived trigger may be a problem
trigger may be some is what is being
faced trigger may be an opportunity what
is seen so then the initiative the
trigger which actually pushed towards
creation of the requirements and user
stories so the life cycle of user story
starts from there so how does it go so
it involves
right from the point pending to to do
the discussion then developing
conforming and then finished so when I
say pending I'm basically saying user
stories in their most basic forms where
they are created after communicating
with the user and the project team these
acts as a reminder for further
discussion so first level of
understanding on user stories in the
basic form so which will help in terms
of further
discussion and taking a call on that so
will there be a possibility that this
user stories will be modified as we
progress answer is yes and no both so it
may be modified but discussion is
further which goes on from this basic
understanding of that particular user
story
so further discussion is to elaborate on
that make sense out of it and confirm so
then after discussion with the
stakeholders users stories that need to
be addressed are decided and put into
sprints
so in between the point where we set
pending to to do so in between this
there is a lot of discussion so where
decision is happening here so decided
and put into Sprints means there is a
prioritization also which is happening
so now discussion at this stage user
confirms users confirms the requirement
and acceptance criterias
so acceptance criterias helps in terms
of
once you test that particular user story
after executing you will check based on
these acceptance criteria so that you
can conclude the requirement is
fulfilled
the end users are shown a preview of
upcoming features
so that they understand yes this is what
we were expecting they can provide their
feedback necessary feedbacks or insights
whatever is required to be provided so
then once the discussion is complete the
team would be able to design and
Implement features to fulfill user
requirements so once user concludes yes
this is what we were expecting and there
is a sign off during the discussion then
features are developed and implemented
so that it can goes to that product
which can be used so then after
developing confirming so the end user
confirms there is a story features are
confirmed to testing environments Alpha
versions and acceptance criterias are
looked at before
saying yes it is confirmed user is
accepting so that will happen as part of
confirming means that features or
functionality what was written in user
story so that specific users are using
it and concluding or acknowledging yes
this is fulfilling our requirement and
this is according to the acceptance
criteria what we discussed and agreed so
that is very important so we write a
users to refine but users are not
agreeing to it that is not a good
scenario to be with user should accept
and confirm then finished so the user
store is completed at this stage for new
requirements or new features a new user
story must be created any new features
or new functionality I am required to
add to this particular product then I
would write another user story and the
same life cycle starts continuous and
this is not an ending thing so as I keep
modifying the features as I add new
features add a as I look at improving
the performances so I keep writing the
user stories now one question keeps
coming to me so we write a user story
while fulfilling the requirements fine
as a specific user I want this easy to
narrate that so how are we going to look
at a scenario where there is an
improvement of something so whenever we
are going to discuss about Improvement
of something it is quite obvious we need
to look at it what is that Improvement
user is looking at now when I am
submitting a particular request or
accessing something it is taking some
time means there is some delay now user
experience can be enhanced by reducing
that particular time that is Improvement
as a user the user story basic user
story doesn't change but in the
performance perspective you may require
to visualize that so problem statement
has to come in accordingly user story
has to be articulated then once the user
store is written it is required to put
the user story mapping so user story
mapping represents and arranges user
stories that help with understanding the
system's functionalities the systems
backlog planning releases and providing
value to the customers
so typically this involves arranging or
organizing user stories based on the
priority along the horizontal axis so I
will horizontally when you move so I
will say which one is the priority which
user store is a priority first thing
which I need to focus on so vertical
Arrangements represents how in a given
specific user Story how the activities
perspective task perspective sub task
perspective further down how it gets
elaborated to improving the levels how
it goes forward
so now let us look at an user story
mapping with an example of admission net
banking services
provided by a bank for account holders
when I say net banking service it is
quite obvious it is also has to be
provided through having a product
which banking application would use
so but here we need to visualize the
user's Journey while accessing the net
banking portal
viewing the Account Details paying bills
like utility bills doing a lot of
transactions within that particular
portal net banking access the moment
they do like generating statements or
transferring money to one of the benefit
beneficiaries
Etc so all these transactions so what is
being done so in this user story map let
us see how does it look like so few
activities are considered here like
logging into the account means net
banking portal will come in then one
would input their credentials and then
they login now that journey of the users
in a specific activity what they do is
visualized Now log into account in a
sense obviously one has to go to that
portal so go to login page then enter
credentials login ID and password so
once that login ID and password is
entered obviously there is a process
engine which runs behind to provide the
necessary access now if that credentials
are not working or if I don't remember
it reset password is an option
immediately
now as I go through further from this
sub task in all the particular columns
which I have given here as you go
through this as I deep dive into it
further it goes on so until the person
gets an access to the account and then
start doing the transactions it goes up
to that level so I can keep writing the
subtasks further so manage account so
you would go to account page once you
access it then you'll select a specific
account because you may have many
different account types which is there
with the bank you may be having one or
many so in the scenario you have more
than one obviously you will select that
account and Account Details will be
displayed to you so this user will not
do but user will get that so we are
visualizing that and further after
Account Details are displayed what user
would do then further you would keep
visualizing that so some of the
transaction like generating statement
transferring money so even for that the
steps are written so going to statement
page then selecting the account for
which you need a statement then
selecting the period from when to when
the statement one is requiring and then
further clicking on it and downloading
that particular statement or choosing an
options mentioning that I need this in
an email or I need an art copy of this
so similarly transferring money so you
will go to that specific wage where you
need to transfer the money so you may
have the beneficiary there in the list
already added if you have added earlier
or newly you're adding a beneficiary so
the various types of transfers like so
International transfer you will have
local domestic transfer you live within
a bank accounts being within the same
bank bank a two consumers so from me if
I'm a consumer transferring money to
another consumer of the same bank and
vice versa that is one of the options
second is a bank consumer having and
transferring your money to some other
bank account of someone else that is
another scenario or transferring money
for my own account in another bank so
various different scenarios you come
across so then limitation or depending
on what kind of beneficiaries are this
what is the limitations and how are you
going to authenticate them so the moment
I visualize a specific transaction and
activities of user stories what are the
things an user can do then I can keep
writing the mapping this to each of
those flow and see how the flow happens
so this flow helps me to bring in all
those features and functionality and
also prioritizing them so can I say the
beneficiary option would be the basic
thing which a consumer would give I
think initially if I go back when actual
net banking features were provided by
the bank the basic thing was just
viewing the account that was the given
statement download was given otherwise
uh there was no opportunity to transfer
money there was no opportunity to do
something beyond that so now as we see
today the lot of flexibility has brought
in with lot of new features
functionalities in the net banking or
mobile banking options so they evolved
so as they evolve it is quite obvious we
may require to keep adding those
features functionality by writing the
user stories this is how the
announcement happens so overall if you
look at user story mapping helps in
terms of understanding not just the user
story of one transaction
Associated transaction in the user study
what happens throughout the journey that
will help
so this will also support to understand
and visualize what needs to be created
to ultimately give that access to the
user so the end-to-end flow should be
visualized and also needs to be
prioritization and has to be looked at
as well now what are the advantages of
user story mapping so the advantages
wise helps with prioritizing work as I
explained in that example
similarly the focus is on user value the
moment I click on web page
www.abcbank.com now the bank page will
come I will have an interface of login I
will go and click on login now from the
point I open a browser and input that
URL and then click on login and login
page comes in how long it takes so there
are many things which is involved the
browser things are involved the system
from which the person is accessing is
involved so removing that part so
thinking that both of them working well
and what should be the response from the
server where this particular website is
hosted that experience needs to be
looked at so that's how you look at a
user value in the transaction now once I
put a credentials now how quickly the
authentication happens what are the
checks the bank portal does to ensure
that the person who is logging in is is
a genuine user is it just a password
is there any captcha codes
is there any OTP sent or is there any
secret code the person has to put in
so likewise many things are involved
while giving that experience to the user
so in today's user if you just put in
various different checks points they
understand because they are well
educated
so white all those things like captcha
or OTP scenario scheming so these are
came in because more and more informed
the people has become then their ability
to hack also improve
so more and more levels added to ensure
that only that genuine user will enter
the user account similarly when you
visualize any product and user journey
in the user's interest
what are the things which is going to
create value that needs to be understood
so only that experience will help for
the user to realize the benefit then
roadblocks are highlighted so as we
visualize this journey so this will tell
me so what would stop me to move forward
is there any concerns is there any
constraints
like for example if you want to activate
a beneficiary but for some limited
period you can only send the limited
amount of money why is that done by
chance if the beneficiary is added by
that individual who is not a genuine
user so we are actually holding it right
so by the time that freezing time
whatever is given so by the time the
message goes to the actual consumer
telling that there is a user activated
like this and if at all if it is not a
genuine user obviously the person can
call to the bank saying that this is not
the beneficiary which I have added
there's something which is not correct
so they are giving that space so how did
they visualize this has to be done so as
we looked at the Journey of adding a
beneficiary it's quite obvious when
beneficial is added if by chance someone
who is not authorized adds it so who is
going to disbenefit obviously user will
be disc benefited so that block is that
constraints are visualized similarly in
making or creating that features
functionality what should be the basic
features or in the product should be
ready only then I can add this feature
even that will be visible right so
roadblocks will be highlighted and that
those will be made visible so that easy
for you to move forward prioritizing and
ensuring that it goes in the flow
required to accomplish that value so
then ensuring team unity because
everyone will have a visualization user
stories and mapping reads lot of
discussion brings the people to have a
common understanding so obviously that
Unity the collaboration would come in
focus on constant Improvement
so Improvement is the key whatever you
do you you are just adopted a waterfall
methodology you have just adopted an
agile you write a user stories you raise
your Peaks you write bring in that uh
various different methods to do
something whatever you do whether it's a
product or a service or a process or a
specific uh transactions task reports
whatever we make
so all that should help in terms of
identifying the opportunities for
improvement and making that improvements
that is very important
there are three distinct roles in scrum
the scrum Master the product owner and
the development team the scrum Master
assists both the development team and
the product owner the scrum Master works
with the product owner to maximize
return on investment
the scrum Master empowers the
development team by fostering creativity
removing impediments and coaching and
mentoring as appropriate
the product owner is responsible for
project success by defining the project
Vision requirements and priorities
the product owner has to resist the
temptation to manage the team or add
more important work after a Sprint has
begun
the product owner has to be willing to
make the hard choices during Sprint
planning
the development team is comprised of
five to nine members with a mix of roles
and has the autonomy to self-organize
and choose how best to meet the goals of
the product owner and is responsible for
the same
a scrum Master is a skilled servant
leader a scrum master has very little
formal Authority however he or she is
expected to assist the team achieve the
intended outcomes without interfering
with the team's autonomy
the scrum Master facilitates the scrum
ceremony such as Sprint planning daily
stand-up Sprint review and Sprint
retrospective
the scrum Master removes obstacles or
impediments faced by the team
the scrum Master is also a process coach
and mentor
the scrum Master must not be a line
manager of the team the scrum Master is
not to be a Taskmaster either
the scrum Master is not a technical or
design Authority nor is he or she a
decision maker for the team
throughout the course of the project the
scrum Master must not do anything to rob
the team of its empowerment and ability
to self-organize
let's talk about the attributes of a
scrum Master scrum Masters need to
exhibit responsibility even though they
are not solely accountable for the
team's output
they will consider it their
responsibility to remove anything that
impacts the team's productivity
they will try to enable the team to do
the best that it can
they are humble
they will work in the background and let
the team take all the glory
they will use we statements and seldom
use any I statements
they're able to set aside their ego and
shower all their attention on the team
they are by Nature collaborative they
will encourage the team to have
conversations among each other and with
other stakeholders outside the team they
will nudge all the right people into
getting involved and work together and
trying to solve problems they are
committed to the team cause
even if being a scrum Master is a
part-time task for them they will give
the highest priority to the team's needs
hence the scrum Master's work allocation
especially if they are part-time needs
to take this into consideration
they are able to influence
they are naturally good communicators
and able to convince others to adopt
different approaches they apply various
techniques to mobilize organizational
resources when required
walk the political tightrope when
required and in general do whatever it
takes to get the team the assistance it
needs
they are knowledgeable
it is clear that as process coaches for
the team scrum Masters need to be
experts in the method
they may not be the technical or domain
experts however they are knowledgeable
enough to be able to have productive
conversations about the project being
done by the team tasks for the scrum
Master the scrum Master is a crucial
role and it is important for you to be
able to be clear about exactly how the
scrum Master serves the team
scrum Masters are servant leaders this
means that they put the team before
themselves and assist the team for
example they set up ensure that the
scrum ceremonies are effectively carried
out
they ensure that there is smooth flow of
information within and outside the team
and that there is a spirit of
collaboration in decision making and
problem solving
scrum Masters must make it their mission
to resolve issues that hinder team
progress it doesn't matter what the
nature of the issue is a scrum Master
needs to mobilize the right resources
within the organization to resolve those
issues in a timely manner and escalate
promptly if that does not happen
we need to understand that in the short
duration of a Sprint even a few hours of
being stuck can make the difference
between a successful and unsuccessful
Sprint
scrum Masters protect the team they
ensure that the team is not Disturbed or
asked to deviate from their commitments
if pressure mounts due to unreasonable
expectations they will step in and push
back on the team's behalf
they will also play the role of
Peacemaker when conflict arises by
encouraging the parties to focus on the
issue discuss the issue with an open
mind and resolve the conflict
finally scrum Masters are the process
coaches of the team
they use their understanding of agile
methods and scrum in particular to guide
the team through the do's and don'ts of
scrum
they ensure that the team stays true to
the principles of Agile development
scrum Master roles scrum teams
before we discuss the role of a
developer on a scrum team let's talk
about the desirable characteristics of
scrum teams
they should be small and Nimble team
size should be no less than three and no
more than nine so that would be six plus
or minus three
exceptions are possible but uncommon
the small attribute makes the team
Nimble and improves productivity
it avoids the phenomenon Mike cone calls
social loafing and instead produces
focus on work
the team size should be just large
enough that the team members are able to
produce and showcase a significant
increment of work at the end of each
Sprint
Sprint after Sprint
self-sufficient and cross-functional
for example if a team needs user
interface development skills database
expertise and service expertise all of
those skills must be present on the team
ideally team members are generalizing
specialists team members should not only
be an expert or a specialist at one
aspect of the development effort but
should also have enough skills and
knowledge to fill in in other roles as
necessary for example if you are a UI
developer
you should be able to don the Hat of a
Services developer if needed
if a large team is to be split up into
smaller scrum teams scrum favors feature
teams over component teams
autonomous and self-organizing
teams choose for themselves how they are
going to organize and meet the goals of
the product owner
no one gets to dictate to the team how
to get their work done
the team decides in collaboration with
the product owner the project Direction
and the pros and cons of different
approaches
let's talk about some key decision
points or factors to consider when
assembling scrum teams
feature teams over component teams the
first issue is whether it's best to
align team members based on features or
components scrum favors feature teams
over component teams for example
it's best to avoid putting all of the UI
developers together and all of the API
or Services developers together why
because each feature or user story will
require both the UI and services or API
organizing based on components will
reduce the incentive to collaborate the
only reason component teams may be
justified would be if the components are
likely to be used by multiple other
teams
assemble the right people it's important
to get the right mix of people together
for the team the right level of
Technical and domain expertise teams
will naturally have both senior and
junior level developers this works
perfectly as there will be stuff that is
more appropriate for the junior
developers and stuff that is not also
one of the risks of a small team is that
the team may miss out on broader
perspective and dissenting views one way
to work around this is to deliberately
favor diversity in all aspects gender
ethnicity personality traits Etc it may
take some time for the team to advance
through the storming stage of teen
development and develop the trust
necessary to work effectively together
but it can be done once a team has been
formed it's best to preserve and assign
whole teams rather than individuals to
projects
it's best to avoid assigning team
members to multiple projects at the same
time
distributive team
a distributed team may be unavoidable
those based at the same geographical
location should be co-located in the
same team room
and Technology processes and ground
rules should be put in place to overcome
the disadvantages of all team members
not being co-located
plotting team size and productivity will
likely result in an s-curve you can see
here that a team can actually be too
small or too large Remember The Sweet
Spot is 6 plus or minus three first you
need to have a strong understanding of
scrum and agile Concepts as a scrum
Master you need to ensure that your team
follows the principles of agile and
scrum
you need to have a clear understanding
of different teams and phases within
scrum to ensure you can understand and
teach the usage of framework to the
organization properly in short having a
detailed understanding of the systems
and terminologies is mandatory a scrum
certification can also greatly help with
this more on that in a little bit you
need a fine-tuned organizational skills
you need to be able to structure the
team and plan out their actions to
ensure everything stays organized and to
make sure everything stays on track you
need the ability to plan things out you
should be able to ensure that the team
stays on schedule and all the tasks are
completed successfully you could also
use online project management systems
like monday.com nutcase and sam9000 to
keep things organized you need to be
familiar with the technology the team
uses you need to ensure that the team is
able to complete their project in a
timely manner this can be done if you
have an understanding of different
technical terms and processes that the
team is involved with hence some
technical familiarity and training is
really important you also need to have
the ability to coach and teach the team
to follow scrum properly for teams that
are new to the scrum methodology your
ability to teach them the different
concepts terms and principles play a
very important role in the future
success of the team you need to be able
to tell the team not only what it needs
to be done but also how and why you also
need to be able to increase the team
members to work together and improve
themselves you may also need to work
with individual team members to maximize
their potential you need to have the
ability to handle conflicts and resolve
them quickly considering how teams are
filled with people with different
personalities ideas and working Styles
it is only likely that they may clash
with each other every now and then if
disagreement cannot be handled among
themselves you need to be able to figure
things out if left unsolved this could
inhibit the entire team's progress
so you must be able to negotiate and
resolve the conflict in a way that
satisfies everyone
and finally you must be a servant leader
a servant leader puts the needs of the
team before their own and helps each
member to perform the best of their
capabilities you need to be both a
leader and the team member you need to
be the part of your team while making
sure they can successfully fulfill their
requirements
now let's talk about certifications to
become a scrum Master at a certified one
at that one of the most important things
you can do is to get through the
certified scrum Master test this test
tests your understanding of different
principles and processes that are the
part of scrum process moreover to take
this test you need to have completed an
in-person or an online course thought by
a certified scrum trainer or certified
agile coach you'll also need to have at
least 14 hours of face-to-face
interaction with the affirm mentioned
trainer or a coach
welcome to scrum interview questions
tutorial from Simply learn I am CMR
Chandra Mr a certified professional in
itl with the expert itl for managing
professional BMP prince2 practitioner
Prince to Agile practitioner agile scrum
master devops and kobit 5. so as part of
this tutorial we are going to understand
the typical interview questions which
would come across when someone faces the
interview for any of the roles in the
scrum so question number one what is
Chrome
so scrum is a framework that enables
team to work together
so with scrum teams can learn from
experiences self-organize working on
problems to reflect on their victories
and their losses to improve
so this is a simple framework which will
provide a better ability and methodology
one can able to handle it better
so scrum is very well defined
articulated and this provides a better
insights and capabilities building
access is very easier and roles are well
defined
so Define the roles in scrum so what are
the typical roles we come across in
scrum
so one of the roles we come across is
product owner
so product owner is primarily
responsible for maximizing the ROI by
determining the product features
prioritizing it into a list what needs
to be focused on for the next print and
constantly reprioritizing and refining
it so what happens is whenever we may
require to deliver it is very important
for us to have the requirements clear
what requirement needs to be fulfilled
to fulfill the requirements the products
what is produced should have specific
features and functionalities
so product owner will have the list of
features and functionalities which needs
to be created when product comes out as
a result of a project
so product owner owns this primary
responsible to ensure this list of
features are identified and those are
prioritized as required
so next role we can think of is Scrum
master who helps teams learn and apply
scrum to obtain business value
so scrum Master helps removing
impediments impediment is anything which
can stop things to flow smoothly
so protects them from interface and
helps the team to adopt agile practices
now scrum is one of the methodologies
for agile approaches and practices now
remember the term agile itself is not a
practice it it refers to indicate that
move faster become flexible respond to
change be flexible now scrum methodology
especially scrum Master should
understand this Dynamics and ensure the
team understands this and scrum Master
should guide the team to adopt these
methodologies and ensure the results are
accomplished accordingly
so next row is Chrome team
so scrum team is a group of individuals
who work together to deliver the
requirements of the stakeholders so
scrum team is generally of the size like
five plus or minus two who are
self-organizing so various different
capabilities the scrum team members
would have so each of these capabilities
complement to accomplish the results
required so question number three what
are the responsibilities of this chrome
theme
so scrum team is self-organizing as I
mentioned earlier so it is a
self-organizing team that has five to
seven members and the responsibilities
would include the development and
delivery of working products during each
Sprint now we are seeing the new
terminology Sprint so what is the
meaning of this print
now Sprint refers to an iteration a Time
boxed iteration which will have a
specific deliverables to be accomplished
as part of it so self-organizing team
takes that specific working piece what
needs to be delivered so that is a
Sprint backlog we call it as so from the
product backlog the features
functionalities which needs to be
delivered as part of this specific
iteration called Sprint time boxed
iteration and those Sprint backlog items
are delivered the output of the Sprint
would be the features what is been taken
is a working piece working product
so to demonstrate ownership and
transparency for work assigned to them
so they own it the entire thing assigned
to them there is there should be
ownership so ensuring the success of
daily scrum meeting by providing crisp
and correct information
so scrum has one event there are five
events basically so one of the events
which happens daily is daily scrum
meeting where the team comes with the
scrum master so they would speak about
what is that they have accomplished from
the previous stand up to till now is
there anything which is stopping them to
move forward
so giving the crisp updates a specific
summary updates so that scrum Master
understands the status so any specific
uh changes or any specific support which
are required scrum Master would discuss
separately with those individuals and
get it done so it should be minimum 15
minutes meeting when we say daily
stand-up meeting
so scrum team collaborate with each of
the team members they work together
under self-organized so next question
the different state between agile and
scrum now it is very essential to
understand the terminology's differences
so if we just end up with looking at a
wrong understanding of each of the
terminologies then explaining will
become difficult so what does it mean by
agile and what it is when it comes to
the terminology called scrum the term
agile refers to ability to move quickly
and easily by becoming more flexible and
adaptable this is what the meaning which
gets associated with the term agile so
many times I have seen people answering
agile is a methodology is a iterative
and increment methodology and also I
think when you search through the
popular search engines you may come
across that which is wrong so agile is
the terminology which is used to state
to move quickly and easily by becoming
more flexible and adaptable this we
should keep in mind so if the question
may be like what are agile methodologies
then you can come across like one of the
agile methodologies scrum and you can go
on on various different methodologies
what we have
so scrum is an agile methodology
right the term scrum is the name given
to the gel Metro methodology which
enables organization to become agile
right so to become agile obviously there
are various methodologies scrum is very
popular so that is the main difference
so further if you look at agile
Manifesto on 12 principles which acts as
guidelines to become a child so there is
something called a gel Manifesto Four
Points clearly articulates what needs to
be focused on to become a child and that
support that is supported through the 12
principles which guides
so scrum is used in projects where
requirements are constantly changing
means I want to become agent so I adopt
scrum so this definitely
has to align to Agile Manifesto and take
the guidelines whatever is mentioned in
12 principles of agile Manifesto then
looking at a leadership perspective
roles perspective so Manifesto mentions
the required collaboration interactions
to become a child
whereas scrum defines the roles like the
scrum Master the product owner the
self-organizing teams which is
cross-functional self-organizing team
so these are the main three roles which
scrum defines now generally when we say
projects we come across a role like
project manager so do we see uh the such
project managers in scrum answer is no
because the scrum master who engages
with the team regularly
more than management they focus on doing
facilitating role to the scrum teams so
that things can be delivered the way it
is required and more flexibility is
given to the team to take the calls to
accomplish the results so scrum Master
facilitates whereas the product owner as
I mentioned earlier looks at the product
backlog and prioritizes and provides
what are the features functionalities
needs to be created in the next
iterations
So speaking about flexibility definitely
agile Manifesto mentions the required
focus on working software and focusing
on changes
so that that's the focus the direction
what it provides so scrum approaches
enables teams to react to changes
quickly Jessica methodology is made such
a way the team understanding that can
able to react and those changes and
modifications are made visible to the
team so delivery perspective Manifesto
provides necessary guidelines on
frequent delivery of product or software
so scrum with time boxed iterations
called sprints builds delivers to the
users regularly and half-held agile
principles that is very important so
delivery here is as per the user's
requirement as per the customer
requirements because customer when we
want to become a child customer has to
involve very closely stakeholder has to
collaborate without that you cannot
become a jack
so next point is about collaboration
a jail Manifesto stresses on individual
interactions and customer collaborations
So based on this if you look at in the
scrum how are they demonstrating this so
there are various events which happens
in scrum so as I mentioned earlier we
have daily stand-up meetings and other
scrum events like sprinters
retrospective Sprint reviews daily
stand-up meetings which happens like
Sprint planning which happens regularly
so it it becomes a reason for
collaboration and everyone to discuss
and take the call so question number
five what are the main artifacts of the
scrum process Now product backlog
so which consists of list of new
features
changes
which are looking organization is
looking for to bring into the existing
features changes to existing features
bug fixes changes to the infrastructure
and several other activities to ensure a
particular outcome so product backlog
so then we can speak about Sprint
backlog a subset of product backlog
so the Sprint backlog contains tasks
that the team aims to complete to
satisfy the Sprint's goals so set off
product backlog things are taken put
into Sprint backlog and those are the
features which are supposed to be
produced as a result as part of that
particular Sprint the team first
identifies tasks from the product
backlog that need to be delivered to
achieve a goal so these tasks are then
added to the Sprint backlog so the team
first identifies tasks from product
backlog
as per the priorities the list which is
prioritized in the product backlog that
is taken put into Sprint backlog and
then those are delivered
so next you can think about product
increment the product increment is the
combination of all product backlog tasks
completed in the Sprint and the value of
the increments of previous prints the
outcome should be in the usable
condition even if the product owner
doesn't decide to release it it is very
important each of the increments which
comes out
so needs to fulfill this now question
number six how are the product and
Sprint backlog different from one
another product backlog versus Sprint
backlog let us see few differences
so product backlog is the list of items
that needs to be completed for
developing the product which is the list
of all the features functionality
Consolidated one
but a Sprint backlog is a list of items
to be completed during each Sprint which
are taken from product backlog
the backlog when it comes to product
backlog the backlog is collected from
the customer by product owner and
assigned to the team whereas
in Sprint backlog the teams collect the
backlog from the product owner and sets
up the time frame for the Sprint
so product backlog is specific to end
goal ultimate objective whereas print
backlog is spread specific to that
Sprint specific iteration called Sprint
in scrum
what is that we are going to produce as
part of it
product backlog is based on customer
Vision whereas Sprint backlog will vary
based on the product Vision defined by
product owner so priorities list you
take from the product backlog so product
backlog is independent of Sprint backlog
whereas Sprint backlog is dependent on
product backlog reason we know already I
explained so this is the prioritized
list of backlogs we take from product
backlog and create this uh specific
product as part of Sprint which become
Sprint backlog
so product backlog refers to until the
project is complete the product owner
maintains the product backlog
when it comes to Sprint backlog each new
Sprints as backlogs added by the team as
each prints are initiated
so next question who is the scrum master
and what does he or she do
so a scrum Master promotes and supports
the adoption of scrum in the team scrum
Master helps everyone to understand the
theory practices rules and values in the
scrum so scrum Master's playing the role
of facilitation enablement
right so scum Master ensures the team
follows scrum values principles and
practices
removes blockages that may hamper the
progress of the project
protects the team from being distracted
ensuring the team delivers value during
every Sprint
so next question what happens in Daily
stand-up sessions so daily stand-up
sessions are the discussion which are
done daily
that takes place under usually 15
minutes in duration the objective is to
understand what went well what tasks are
completed from the last stand-up session
and the obstacles the team was facing
if at all any specific task is not
accomplished for certain reasons so what
are stopping them stopping the team to
accomplish that that needs to be made
visible
so that separate meeting can be held to
discuss on that and do the necessary
Corrections by taking proper actions
so the objective of this daily stand-up
meeting is to understand the overall
scope and status of the project
further individual discussion can be
taken up after the daily stand-up
sessions
as I mentioned earlier if at all if you
find something is not accomplished as
per the plan now how do we ensure that
is corrected and why is it happening is
there anything any support is required
by the team to focus on that so
something like that can be checked on
question number nine what is Scrum ban
so scrum ban is a development
methodology that is a combination of
scrum and kanban
so this can be used to meet the needs of
the team that aims to minimize the
batching of work and to adopt a pool
based system
so kanban is called as pulled by System
so which actually helps in terms of
visualizing what work is in progress and
since it is a visualized visualized
system it is visible to everyone
so it works in terms of making people
become conscious to take that work and
get it closed quickly so it's also
called pool system because work is
pulled from that particular list
so and this kanban approach or
methodology or thought is applied in
scrum we call it as karamba it's a
combination of this definitely helps in
terms of making that entire Journey
successful and supports the scrum
methodology
so scrum burn includes the structure of
scrum along with the flexibility and
visualization of kanban
so scrumban is used by the teams that
need to be
structure of scrum that has the
structure of scrum and the flexibility
of a flow based method
like on one
so question number 10 what is print 0
and Spike so the term Sprint 0 refers to
the short amount of effort put for
creation of vision a rough skeleton of
the product backlog so now we do this
whenever we need to understand certain
things how things looks like to get
certain insights so this also includes
Insight towards estimating the release
of products so you get some Vision it
gives some clarity right so this Sprint
zero are required to create project
skeleton alongside research spikes
keeping minimal design
develop a small number of stories
completely have low velocity and be
lightweight So speaking about this Spike
so spike is set off activities used in
extreme programming I think this was
introduced there in extreme programming
that is one of the agile methodologies
so involving research design
investigation making proof of Concepts
Etc
so the objective of spike is to reduce
the risk of technical approach by
gaining knowledge which helps
understanding requirements and to
improve reliability so more aware we are
more clarity we have I think putting
step further will become easier so
informed decisions you can take so next
question what is Scrum of scrums
now scrum of scrums is a terminology
used for scaled agile techniques which
is required to control and collaborate
with multiple scrum teams
so when will we come across the need for
collaborating between multiple scrum
teams so these are the scenarios where
organization has a complex structure is
complex in nature very you may require
to handle them together all of them
together for accomplishing the common
objective for business various crumb
teams you would have so scrum off scrum
helps in terms of
better collaboration and handle them
easily or better way better control it
is best used in the situations where
teams are working together on complex
assignments just visualizing the system
various different deliverables which are
not a simple deliverables which we can
do with the simple scrum team
instead we have various different
deliverables which needs to be made and
Dynamics are too complex
so bigger projects then scrum of scrum
approaches can be taken so scaling the
agile methodology to that level
so it is used to establish the required
transparency
collaboration adoption adoption to the
required scale to ensure the products
can be developed and delivered so
whatever the products are delivered
whatever we consider to be delivered so
those needs to focus on the business
objectives which is very essential
so what is user story mapping
so user story mapping represents and
arranges user stories
that help with understanding the
system's functionalities the systems
backlog planning releases and providing
value to the customers so first of all
we write user stories to understand the
required features functionality in their
user perspective
now if we map those user stories which
use a story link to other user story
which functionality links to the
functionality determining that will
become easier
so now uh user story Maps arranges user
story based on the priority along the
horizontal axis on the vertical axis
they are represented based on increasing
level of sophistications
so this will help in terms of handling
in a regular flow in a specific flow not
regular flow specific flow so that
things can be done in order with full
clarity so question number 13 what
happens in Sprint retrospective so after
this print review
so Sprint completes so Sprint review
happens
the Sprint retrospective is done so
during this meeting
the Lessons Learned what went well what
mistakes we did
what were the issues
so is there any new way of doing things
so all these are discussed so that these
necessary Corrections can be considered
in the upcoming iterations the Sprints
so data from here is incorporated when
planning the new Sprint so the learning
what you had you are going to collect it
what went well what went wrong what was
supposed to be the best approach and how
did we approach it is there any other
way of doing it so these are discussed
and very essential to do it at the end
of completion of each of the Sprints
review
question number 14 what is empirical
process control in scrum
so empiricism refers to work based on
facts experiences evidences observations
and experimentation
so empirical process control is
established and followed in scrum
ensuring project progress and project
interpretation is based on facts of
observation so actual facts and figure
is very important any decisions what we
make any uh progression what we make
should be always based on
on ground facts and actual pictures we
should not debate from it
so these rely on transparency
observation adoption obviously when
you're working on the data on ground
reality so you are working on the actual
one it is transparent it is on the
observed data
the mindset of the team and the shift
required in thought process and culture
are very essential to accomplish the
agility required by organization
so mindset of the team is very essential
and Adoption of process compliance to
the process the culture the behavior
obviously plays a very important role
when
you do something within the organization
so that needs to be done as per the need
which should complement to the business
objectives
very important and that should be based
on facts not on some thoughts or
assumptions or ideas
so next question is what are some
drawbacks of using scrum so scrum
requires individuals who have experience
without whom the project risks will have
a risk of failure
so one does not have a capability
difficult scrum requires team to be
collaborative and committed
so while people collaborating
individuals collaborating itself is a
big challenge in many organizations so
bringing this into the place is very
important when you want to adopt scrum
so scrum requires teams to be
collaborative and committed to ensure
the required results they should work
together
and also they should collaborate with
customers stakeholders
the less experienced scrum Master can
cause the failure of the project
so be careful
scrum Master is the one who is
facilitator we should understand this
who enable the scrum teams who ensure
scrum teams goes the way we need them to
work if scrum Master doesn't understand
his Dynamics does not have the clarity
on this obviously the he or she can not
enable to team to become that
if tasks are not well defined the
project can have any inaccuracies
scrum works better for smaller projects
and would be difficult to scale to large
complex projects that's where we are
discussing on a few questions before
this scrum off scrum we are discussing
about when it becomes a complex project
which those needs to be handled together
which will become complex so next
question is what are the skills of a
scrum master so a strong understanding
of scrum and agile concept
scrum Master should have fine-tuned
organizational skills so when scrum
Master is working with self-organizing
team with various different capabilities
so unless the organization skills
interpersonal skills if scrum Master
does not have working with them will
become difficult
so scrum Master should be familiar with
technology that the team uses basic
understanding of that how it works the
Dynamics associated with that and scrum
Master should have an ability to coach
and teach the team to follow scrum and
its methodologies and very clear about
the terminologies artifacts and all the
events what happens
so scrum Master should have an ability
to handle conflicts and resolve them
quickly so conflict is a scenario which
would happen for various different
reasons however when conflict occurs
the scrum Master should not shy away
from it
own it to resolve in the interest of the
project whatever is being done it is
very important
scrum master has to be a servant leader
so it is not like I'm a specific manager
or leader of certain kind and I am doing
this with certain way no I am actually
facilitating I am guiding I am showing
certain direction
to the organization so that access to
the team when I say organization
speaking about scrum team so that they
are unable to take up the specific
project and accomplish the results
accordingly
question number 17
how can
Discord be dealt within the scrum team
now the root cause of the issue need to
be identified and interest complete
ownership needs to be established when
you deal with this
and try to diffuse the disagreements so
emphasizing on the focus area that
complements the project
so here when we take up any of the
discussions any of the opportunities or
any actions what we take everything
should be revolving around objective of
ultimate objective of whatever we are
doing
so when we need to resolve something
when we get into the root causes always
it helps to look at the actions in terms
of eliminating those causes so once the
causes are eliminated it is quite
obvious you can able to deal with it and
address it with easily with the right
set of actions
so emphasize on Focus areas that
complements the project in the sense
that should be the ultimate Direction
not my individual interest not that
individual interest I favor this person
I favor that person that's not to be the
case
so favoring this solution or favoring
that solution I'm okay with this
particular technology I'm very happy
with this technology not such thoughts
it is the direction what you said I
should move things in that direction so
to establish a common understanding and
to guide the team to the direction
performing continuous monitoring and
providing complete visibility very very
important the next question what is a
user story
so user stories are an agile software
development project management tools
it provides the team with simple natural
language explanations of one or more
features written from the end user's
perspective
now for example I'm a account holder in
a bank
so first what is the facility a bank
would give to
um account holders there is ATM banking
there is net banking there is Mobile
Banking and there is over the counter
now when bank is working on creating
certain specific features or specific
mobile app to the account holders now
what are the things user needs that
needs to be visualized
now if I say the role here is account
holder as a account holder I want to
download the statements of every month
as a account holder I want to download
the statements every month this is what
my requirement is how will you
facilitate this this will provide the
Insight towards
how
the bank what are the features and
functionalities and how this
requirements are can be fulfilled by the
bank and what features functionality the
particular mobile app should have so
that
account holder can download the
statements so user stories will provide
that insights whatever users so account
holder is not just an user here there
are many users when it comes to mobile
app of a bank
we have uh people who monitor it manage
it would develop it
so they need to have a Clarity on what
exactly they need and that needs to be
written
as part of user story that what features
functionality can be easily determined
out of it
so a user story does not go into detail
it just mentions as I given example it
just mentions how a certain type of work
will bring value to the end user the end
user in this case could be in external
end users or even internal customers or
colleagues within the organization so if
I'm an organization I produce an HR
application I create an HR application
for claim processing which I don't have
till today
so that is for internal users in the
bank example I'm speaking about external
customers
so user stories also form the building
blocks of agile framework like epics and
initiatives
these help ensure that the teamwork to
the goals of the organization through
epic Sun initiatives so further the
requirements for making the user story
is a reality or added later after
discussing with the team so to write a
user story The involvement of the team
members are very essential they should
discuss and come out and agree yes this
is the features functionality which
should be there
user stories are recorded on Post-it
notes index cards or project management
software whatever is visible and
whatever is available there next
question
how are the user stories epics and tasks
different so if the stories provides the
team a simple explanation of business
requirements created from the end user
perspective as we saw the few examples
in the previous questions epics
are the collection of related user
stories they're usually large and
complex so these epics are created with
specific objectives in mind and user
stories are grouped so that will form an
epic whereas task refers to the one
which are used to track work so they are
used to further broken down
from the user stories so there is a
smallest unit in the scrum used to track
work a person or a team or two people
usually work on the tasks so these tasks
are these through this task I think the
features functionality what are required
to be accomplished are done so question
number 20
what is Sprint now as I mentioned
earlier in the earlier question number
four
so Sprint is the terminology used in the
scrum I think we explain various
different concepts as we went through
so Sprint is the terminology is used in
scrum which refers to time boxed
iterations so we understood what is this
iterations in scrum approaches when we
are going through that the creation of
specific modular feature which is part
of a product is done during the Sprint
the duration of Sprint varies between a
week or two so means it's a short
duration simple few features
functionalities are taken and created so
what is velocity
so velocity is the metric used in scrum
that is a measurement of the amount of
work that is completed by team during
the Sprint
so this is help to measure how how
things are moving how fast are they are
moving it refers to the number of user
stories completed in single Sprint
so this speaks about that speed so or
velocity velocity how faster we are
going how slower we are going this helps
to vary the variations we can do that
velocity depending on what business need
so what are the responsibilities of a
product owner
so product owner Define the vision of
the project
they anticipate the needs
of the customer and to create
appropriate user stories so they don't
write user stories as such they
definitely have a set of people who
should get involved the team to write
the user stories lot of discussion has
to happen brainstorming has to happen to
write user stories but
product owner is accountable
so product owner has to evaluate the
progress of the Project based on this
backlog what project a product owner has
and has stabilized in for all product
related questions the team may have
certain questions there's prints as the
Sprint progresses the scrum team may
have certain questions clarification
relating to the user stories those needs
to be clarified
what is burn up and burn down charts so
generally when we say chart it is a
graphical representation so burn up
chart is a tool that is used to track
the amount of work that has been
completed so it is a bar chart the
amount of work completed the height of
the bar keeps increasing in burn up
chart based on what is completed
which will show the total amount of work
the need to be done for a Sprint or a
project
so it is it is a bar chart where each of
the bars keeps increasing in its height
as number of things get delivered
increases
so burn down charts typically again a
graphical representation a bar chart
so what is spending to be delivered it
shows that now initially will have a
bigger bar and as the project progresses
the height of the bars reduces
indicating what is that spending for
deliverance
it is a representation of how fast the
team is working through the user stories
it helps you to understand that
so it shows total effort against the
amount of work for each iterations
which is helpful for a 2C to that what
is spending to complete question 24 how
is estimation in the scrum project done
so the estimation of user stories is
done based on its difficulty
a particular scale in which which is
used to assess the difficulty of user
stories set only list how difficult or
easy is that some of these scales which
are used like numeric sizing one to ten
t-shirt sizing like s ml Excel Fibonacci
series or dog breeds based on their
value
so many such approaches are taken what
are some risks in scrum and how are they
handled
so first of all we should know what is
risk so some types of risk in scrum are
related to budget people
Sprint
product knowledge and capability
now when we say budget risk of uh
increase exceeding that allocated budget
taking more looking for more variations
I estimated for X it is going like X
Plus Delta X so can we control it we
need to look at that so you need to
assess that risk when what possibilities
the cost can escalate people related
like team members need to be of
appropriate skills and capabilities if
they lack that obviously
uh difficult it's not about just skills
and capabilities the culture the
behavior the attitude
the energy
the Synergy that collaboration what
people will have then Sprint related in
terms of duration and deliverables
exceeding the duration
addition of scope to that Sprint in
between so that challenges
that difficulties
so product referring to user stories and
epics having ill-defined user stories
and effects not properly articulated
there is no proper visualization when
you look at that user story not
understanding so nobody's explaining it
correctly
so then knowledge and capabilities so it
is not just related to the people here
it's a entire system everyone was who is
involved with a specific resource with
its capability it can be technology
capabilities also
so when I say risk it basically involves
identification assessment analysis and
defining risk response plans and
implementing them
now
when I say assess assessing the risks
should be qualitative as well as
quantitative
so depending on the impact and
probability of a risk if it is high
impact risk obviously you are required
to do both qualitative and quantitative
if a simple one with a very less impact
you can take the call accordingly to
what extent you may require to analyze
and have the response plans for it so
once you have implemented or defined and
implemented the response plans quite
obviously should keep monitoring it and
manage the risks the risk impacts and
probabilities may vary as the project
progresses so we may require to keep
assessing the identified risk and keep
identifying the new risks as you as we
progress in the project
so these are done on a continual basis
right from starting of the projectile
completion the reason I told it is
essential to understand that the impact
of the risk is based on the proximity of
actual occurrence of the risk
now for example if we start working on
something nothing is delivered at the at
the moment
now if specific risk of Peep no people
not available
now you are made of project so again you
will have a different kind of impact 50
is delivered now you need to progress
because active involvement of
stakeholders including customer is very
important when you are becoming a child
so when that is not happening as an
example I am taking the involvement of
customers the collaboration part of it
that is not happening now here the
impact level is not equal to the impact
level when when this happens in the
starting of the project same type of
risk what we are assessing
so that is the reason each of the risks
you should keep assessing the identified
one keep assessing as the project
progresses and check on is there any new
risk is introduced as the project is
progressing
so next question what are some popular
tools used in scrum so these are the
list so you can think of gtab Soho
Trello jira software yodex where is a
version one so now what I am saying is
these are the tools technology tools
so when we say tools we cannot just
limit our thought to technology tools so
what exactly this tool does what are the
techniques used that we need to be very
clear
right The Matrix what is measured and
methodology of measuring it and what
processes are used what steps are used
so what needs to be used
so unless we are clear relating to
specific type of project usage of these
tools may not make any sense you cannot
even implement or customize this for the
requirement what you are trying to
accomplish so you'll be clear about it
when you're selecting the tool so 27 how
does scrum Master track Sprint progress
so we have various different events
which happens in scrum like daily scrum
meetings scrum retrospective scrum
planning scrum review
and checking on the defects which are
escaped density of the defects
burn down
uh Sprint burn down velocity so so
checking all of this uh provides the
better insight to scrum master so that
tracking the progress of the Sprint
would become easier
then how to deal with the scope creep
now before we understand the dealing
with scope trip we need to understand
what is scope creep
so the term scope creep refers to the
change which is uncontrolled and added
without checking the impact on the
constraints like scope time costs
now what happens is you will be doing
certain delivering certain features
now you are forced or you are influenced
or without your knowledge some
additional things are put in place so
which may impact later it may add value
it may not add value later doesn't
matter but it may lead in terms of
impact your cost time and schedules
which is unexplained
and that extra effort what you have put
in extra cost what you are put in uh
will become like uh uh right not
recognized by customers and you will not
get anything paid for it so scope to
avoid the scope creep to deal with it
one has to ensure close monitoring of
Works being done on day-to-day basis
because scope creep can happen through
team members influencing team members
are influenced by consumer because of
that it may happen
so understanding communicating the
vision to the team for ensuring the
alignment so the team is very sensitive
about that changes what is happening
then capturing reviewing the project
requirements regularly against what is
delivered
to emphasize
to the team and customer about the
requirement signed off so that someone
will not comment
uh influence you or make that additional
things to be delivered they need not
push you right ensuring any change
introduced to go through change control
so no changes
without any proper approval by the
authorities so that only those what is
required to be implemented is
implemented and that is done formally
through the formal change request
so avoiding gold plating so it is with
different thought process when we say
gold plating
so we were doing the projects are trying
to add certain things into the scope to
please the customer as an example doing
something additional providing some
additional features and functionality
for which we are not paid so scope creep
is not a terminology used for it but
gold plating is the term used but
however since it is an additional
scoping so we just added here
so don't say that when the moment scope
creepy says that is not gold plating
gold plating has a different direction
so just to explain you
along with scope creep what else would
happen to where the additional
deliverables would come in which is gold
plating so question 29 what is MVP and
MMP which means minimum viable product
and minimal marketing product so now
minimum viable product is a concept of
Lean Startup which stresses upon the
impact of learning while performing
product development so this allows one
to test and understand the idea by
getting exposed to the initial version
of the product for Target customers and
users so to accomplish this one has to
collect all the required relevant data
and learn from the collected data so the
thought behind MVP is to produce a
product to provide access to the users
and to observe how the product is used
perceived and understood
this will also provide more insight
towards what the customers or users
needs are
so when it comes to minimal marketable
product
this refers to the description of the
product which will have a minimal number
of features that addresses the
requirements of the users
MMP would help also the organization
reduce the time to Market because you
have the clarity what is that we may
require to provide now question number
30 what does DOD means definition of
done right so DOD refers to the
collection of deliverables which
includes written quotes comments on
coding unit tests integration testing
design documents release notes
Etc this would add variable and
demonstratable values to the project
development
so devote is very helpful to scrum while
identifying the deliverables to achieve
the objectives of project for the stated
reasonable so defining the steps
required to deliver the iterations the
usage of appropriate tool like burn down
to make the process more effective
ensuring on-time feedback throughout the
Project Life Cycle
ensuring the walkthrough of the product
backlog items are done and understood
correctly so then creation of checklists
for product backlog item
ensuring the devote is defined to become
task oriented involving the product
owner for reviewing during this print
and Sprint retrospective that is about
DOD the next question how can a scrum
Master be a servant leader it's a very
important thing to understand
so what is the meaning of the servant
leader the term servant leader mainly
stresses on service orientation which a
leader should demonstrate
so today we say every organization is
service organization
even an organization who is producing
car if there is no service orientation
they cannot sell
more stresses on being service
orientation the scrum Master needs to be
facilitator a guide a mentor Etc
this helps the team have increased
involvement and empowerment so now
question number 32 how can one
coordinate within multiple teams so one
of the most common approaches for this
is Scrum of scrum's meeting so where
members representing each scrum team
discusses the progress
so explain a jail in brief if this is
the question what would be the typical
answer so the term agile refers to
ability to move quickly and easily by
becoming more flexible and adaptable
so most of the times I have seen people
say whenever I ask the question what is
agile they say agile is a methodology
the term agile itself is not a
methodology it actually refers to this
flexibility adaptability so all those
methodologies which are there defined
for a child for example scrum so they
have an approach towards to become agile
and do the projects in agile way so this
requires adoption and Adoption of
continual changing scenarios in modern
dynamic business environment which means
the flexibility and adaptability is
required because of the changing
business environment the Dynamics to
quickly adopt to the change to become
flexible agile approaches are required
it is very essential for organization to
become agile for their sustenance and
growth
there are various agile methods and
practices that focuses on iterative
development typically any agile
methodologies follows iterative
approaches
requirements and solutions are obtained
through self-organizing cross-functional
teams collaborating so collaboration is
very important any of the agile
methodologies we come across we speak
about cross-functional self-organizing
teams
so this is the basic details one should
know when they hear the term agile
so question number two explain the
difference between a traditional
waterfall model and agile testing
so when we say agile and waterfall it
has two different Dynamics all together
so agile model is a continuous iteration
life cycle model for developing and
testing software whereas waterfall is
linear sequential life cycle model for
developing and testing the software
so similarly the rigidity
so agile methodologies is flexible way
of building a software which provides
lot of flexibility Whenever there is a
change adopting to the change will
become very easy adapting and adopting
for the change scenario whereas in
waterfall methodology it is a bit
difficult it is rigid because it is very
much structured any changes which comes
in adopting that and changing things to
according to the change Dynamics
requires changing many things which
makes it very tedious and rigid so
thirdly collaboration so agile model is
highly collaborative that's what it
approach considers mainly towards
software development where involvement
all the members involvement of all the
members like customers
maybe the team members the project
managers
so their active involvement is very much
required so that things can be handled
better so whereas waterfall model
generally don't insist on that so it is
least flexible and follow sequence of
steps which are predefined and that
doesn't allow the team to collaborate
even the collaboration happens it will
have a limitation because everything is
defined and one has to follow it and
comply to it there is no opportunity or
options to change anything so easily
when it comes to Waterfall model then
processes the entire process of
development is divided into iterations
which are of short period so that in
each of these iterations the working
model working piece of that product will
come out so in waterfall approach the
software development process is broken
down into several phases sequential
phases linear phases so things which has
to be delivered in each of the bases are
very well defined and accordingly it
happens
so changes
changes may be made even after the
initial planning is completed in agile
approaches or an agile uh whenever over
a follow agent it is easy to adapt to
that change scenario whereas in
waterfall approaches development
requirements cannot be changed once the
project development begins it will
become difficult because everything is
defined in a comprehensive way detailed
so that small changes may impact other
parts of the the products or
descriptions which is defined
so software development is a collection
of many different projects which can
happen in agile whereas waterfall
software development is completed as a
single project or deliverable so testing
testing is performed in same iterations
as programming or building so within
that iteration since we built the
working product all the testing will be
done within that so that one would be
fully informed about that product which
is being developed in the Declarations
so that users can give the feedback
quickly whereas testing phase is
separate
in waterfall approaches but however
testing can be built in parallel in
waterfall also if it is planned that way
but still it does not give that
flexibility as it is there in the agile
because the product will not be
available to the users to give their
feedback so that necessary Corrections
cannot be made so whatever testing
reveals in waterfall methodologies the
corrections will be done by the team
limiting to their understanding whereas
in agile since users are very closely
involved working model is ready so the
feedback is straight from the users in
their perspective so that Corrections
can be made and ultimate product will be
very much useful to the people who are
going to use their product ultimately so
question number three what are some
important parts of agile process
so here are some of the important
principles that need to be followed to
make a process of agile so one is
customer satisfaction so very much
important one has to ensure customer is
satisfied customer sees the product
gives the feedback they uses it gives
the feedback necessary Corrections are
made in time so that quick delivery of
the product can be made
according to the requirement of the
customers which would result in high
customer satisfaction then changing
needs so agile welcome changes so any
changing needs will be addressed even
late in the development processes when
the entire life cycle of the project
wherever the change comes in taking the
changes making the necessary changes
will be easier when it comes to agile
delivery frequently so ensuring software
is delivered frequently focusing on
shorter time scales which is very well
uh understood the full clarity of the
product and the working piece of the
product will come out of the iterations
so as I mentioned earlier as well quick
feedback from the users will also obtain
so that products which are delivered
will be as per the customer requirement
so agile approaches helps that way
work together so agile Manifesto
emphasizes on working together
collaboration so that each one of them
contributes so developers and business
individuals has to work together through
the course of the project so that
necessary outcome can be created
so motivated team so projects need to be
built around motivated individuals and
they must be trusted to get the job done
so as I mentioned in the previous Point
collaboration is very important so we
cannot ignore team as well who is
actually actively involved in creation
of those products so they should be
motivated and their active involvement
is very much required face-to-face
conversation is most efficient means of
communication so since the agile
methodologies whatever is defined
actually emphasizes on having the
face-to-face conversation collaborating
better uh contributing proactively and
involvement proactively is very
essential so conversation communication
plays a very important role so working
software working software is a primary
measure of progress which will be
delivered in each of the iterations so
that users can give the necessary
feedbacks so constant peace a gel
process promotes sustainable development
because all the products which are being
developed used
feedback obtained are in real time so
people actually know what is being
produced and what is that they can
expect as it progresses so Clarity is
also one of the things and that pays has
to be maintained and agile approaches
helps to accomplish it so good design
agility can be improved by focusing on
technical excellence and good design as
you progress as the changes comes in as
you adapt and adopt so since it has the
flexibility technically as well as
process wise as well as any of the
configuration wise it is easy to do the
necessary changes and have the design
which is required to accomplish the
ultimate results
simplicity
the amount of work that's not being done
needs to be minimized so we say
Simplicity is Ultimate sophistication
means what is that required to be done
consider only that not anything else
above or below that so whatever we may
require to do focusing on that the
minimum thing what need to be done will
be done and has to be done when one
follows HL approach
self-organized the team is
self-organized so self-organized teams
provides best architectures requirements
and design because they having various
different capabilities come together
contribute together with their
capability with a different capability
multi-skilled as well will be present in
the self-organized team reflect and
adjust
Effectiveness can be improved by the
team regularly reflecting on it because
as I mentioned earlier in every
iterations there are feedback obtained
testing is being done in each of the
iterations as it progresses so this will
help us in terms of providing the
Insight towards how is it progressing so
that will help in quickly doing the
necessary Corrections which are required
to be done so next question number four
explain iterative and incremental
development in a chart
so incremental development when we say
the process is divided into many small
workable increments so which can be done
one after the other each successive
increment Builds on the top of the work
done in the previous increments
overtime functionalities are added based
on what was already created so iterative
development involves the development of
system by following repeated Cycles or
iterations based on the results from the
most recent iterations of the process
changes are made this helps the project
evolve over time so the term evolve is
the one which one should keep in mind it
is not that I am just going that is my
destination
yes definitely there is a destination
while progressing there are a lot of
variations which happens those
variations has to be considered and
accordingly the necessary deviations or
Corrections adjustments has to be made
and things to be progressed further
which is very important because of this
iterative approach it helps to become
adaptable and flexible to adjust to
these varying conditions so that's where
projects should evolve it cannot go in a
straight line it has to evolve based on
the variations while progressing towards
the destination or the results what we
are supposed to accomplish
so agile definitely iterative plus
incremental
so agile involves consideration and
creation of working product in an
iterations
which is part of the overall final
product so the consolidation of all the
products which are produced in each of
the iterations will become part of the
ultimate results ultimate product
each iteration is an enhanced working
increment of the final product
this process continues until all the
products functionalities are satisfied
so organizations and user can use and
experience the product and provide
feedback that can be incorporated into
next iterations so each iterations when
the working product is produced those
things are used by the users experience
uh they will look at the features and
functionality and based on the
requirement what they're supposed to
fulfill they may also give the feedback
for necessary Corrections or they add
new requirement to it because the
minimum requirements what is being
fulfilled by this product may be some
requirements which are not expressed
earlier there is an opportunity to
express at this point in time to State
we can involve some of the features of
this kind in the next iterations so that
we can able to make this product better
so such kind such a conversation the
incremental iterative approach helps our
loss or provides that opportunity to
express
so causing product roadmaps to be built
produced tested and conformed before the
next iterations so that's where before
we move to next iterations there will be
better Clarity in terms of what is
produced what we are supposed to produce
further and what is that modification
we're supposed to do so that product can
ultimately fulfill the requirements
so question number five what are the
different types of agile methodologies
so there are various kinds of agile
methodologies some of them are briefed
here so let us go through them one by
one
extreme programming so it is a framework
that enables team to create high quality
software and improves their quality of
life
it enables software development with
appropriate engineering practices
so next is kanban
this method is used to design manage and
improve the flow of systems
organizations can visualize their flow
of work limiting their work in progress
so basically kanban comes from the
Toyota system so here when we use the
term workflow the work in progress so
this will help in terms of monitoring
what is happening what work is in
progress what work is completed and it
uses a visualized system so one can see
it what is happening so it also enables
the individuals who are doing it to know
what is that pending against them and
they can pick it up pull it up and then
complete it lean lean is a set of tools
and principles that aims to identify and
remove waste to increase the speed of
process development it focuses on
maximizing value of the to the client
ensuring waste is minimized so lean
principles real approaches says the flow
in a flow if there is any bottleneck
that tends to be removed so this
bottleneck would limit the flow and that
would add towards the waste so
identification of the waste the the
reason for that creation of the waste or
who is the contributor of the waste and
eliminating those causes and moving
forward this will help in smoothening
the flow at the same time improving the
system for better outcomes
so that's where lean is become popular
and well acknowledged
so scrum is a framework that is used by
teams to establish a hypothesis try it
out reflect on experience and
adjustments it is used to enable teams
to incorporate practices from other
Frameworks depending on the team's
requirement
so that's about scrum scrum is a bit
popular and it is mostly used for a
smaller projects the bigger the project
more complex I think scrum would not
help but scrum is very popular in
software development organizations
so where it has a simple uh five events
three roles and three artifacts so it
helps uh to adopt and adapt to the
changing conditions and it has become a
proven practice now crystal crystal is
an approach to software development that
focuses on people and their interactions
rather than tools and processes it is
aimed to streamline processes and
improve optimization it works on
principle that projects are unique and
dynamic so next question what are the
principles of agile testing so testing
continuously to ensure the product
improves continuously so as we know when
we progress when we adopt when we follow
agile approaches there is a reason
because we need to Able we should be
able to respond to that changes quickly
we should be able to understand what is
going right what is not quickly and do
the necessary correction then and there
itself so testing continuously become
very important because as we develop as
we test we can reveal any of the issues
any of the defects in the product what
we develop so that it reveals so obtain
feedback continuously to ensure the
product meets business requirements so
looking at the performance does this
feature's functionality of the product
is helpful to accomplish that business
requirement
so this feedback comes from the
customers and users when we produce a
working piece of the product
so all team roles testing development
Etc need to be involved in testing
process so one cannot work in isolation
they should be very good collaboration
people from various different teams
working together complementing to each
other very essential to become a jack so
the active involvement of business teams
and representatives can provide quick
feedback for each iterations
so clean and simplified code ensures it
is defect free during iterations
the documentation created must be
limited into a particular rate relations
so when we speak about waterfall
approach the documentation will be very
comprehensive for the entire project but
the moment we speak about agile the
documentation will get limited to
what is being produced in their
iterations which is very important so
what is being produced in iterations and
that is based on the actually what is
produced something I planned in for that
iterations some changes happens we
developed it create rate there is a
feedback which is coming up
documentation is limited to that so
Corrections which can be made to the
documentation will be easier and quicker
so along with development and
implementation testing is done to ensure
the product is defect free
continuous involvement of users and
shows the final product matches their
requirement which is Ultimate need so
question number seven
what are some agile metrics that need to
be focused on
so some of the popular metrics which are
used are measuring burn down of
deliverables which is usually
represented using burn down charts
similarly we have burn up chart also
where as we complete the task the height
of the bar keeps increasing in burn up
charts but most popular is burned down
so that what is to be delivered will be
easily visible
so the velocity lead time
cycle time code quality
code covered in unit test
deployment success rate net promote
score so these are the basic metrics
which are really needed when we are
speaking about the velocity and speed at
the same time how quickly we are able to
produce what is supposed to be done and
plan are we going accordingly or not so
this will help in terms of making our
job as per the need so Matrix has to be
selected very carefully so Matrix is not
just a number it should have an
interpretation and that interpretation
should actually complement the business
needs and requirements so Matrix should
have a clear description of what is this
measurement is all about and what is
that we are going to understand from
that measuring that Matrix
so next is what is kanban
so kanban system is visual system
which helps better management of work as
work moves through processes
so it is it visualizes and provides
visibility into the process workflows
and works passing through the processes
So when you say it is a visual system so
there will be bored or a display system
where each of the tasks which needs to
be accomplished are displayed there and
the person who is who is supposed to
complete it and what is the status of it
so people would look at it pull the work
and complete it so since people pull
that work it is also called as pull
system
so because the new works are pulled in
taken up from the list for execution and
move them from in progress status to
done
so kanban since it is a visual system it
also makes people more conscious about
what is spending against them what work
is pulled that is also visible so there
is no reason for anyone to say that I
did not do this because of XYZ reasons
since it is visible it is my job since I
pulled that task it is my job my
ownership to complete it it becomes like
that so that discipline comes into place
so tracking the work will also become
easier as the workflow is clearly
visible and put on the display board
modern organization can also use the
digital display systems
we're seeing this more adoption in many
many organizations today because if the
value of using it the contribution of it
is seen by organization and can't learn
playing its roles in the organization
and it's very essential to have this
practice
so the goal is identification of
constraints that is potential bottleneck
in the process and ensure they are
addressed this ensures that the workflow
becomes smoother and more efficient I
think I mentioned the reasons question
number nine
what are some popular agile tools
so some of the tools which we keep
hearing today whenever whenever people
say we do Agile is uh some of these are
listed here like jira software Trello
Zoho your dicks where is Zone one and
many more I think before we choose a
tool it is very important for anyone to
understand what is that they require
first and what tool can help them in
terms of accomplishing it so it requires
lot of
analyzes uh assessment on the tools and
the comparison with what is being done
in the organization and how this tool
would suit that organization's
requirement is very essential so tool is
not first the requirements
the need analysis and then what tools
best suit the environment
that is the step only then selecting the
tool makes sense
however studying the tools and comparing
the tools and the features functionality
will also help defining what needs to be
there in place in the organization when
they become agile or adopt and adopt
certain practices what are the obstacles
to the agile process
so some of the obstacles that one could
face are not having the appropriate or
sufficient tools and Technologies
so it is quite obvious organization
struggle not having the right tools and
Technologies as I mentioned earlier it
is very important to understand what is
our need first and what tools suits best
at the same time I also mentioned study
the tools and Technologies and what to
do they offer and what do we have do we
really need that additional things the
Gap whatever we find do we really need
those in our environment is that
Dynamics is there in our environment
that needs to be understood
the lack of active involvement from the
customer so when we say agile
involvement of all the stakeholders are
very very important because the changing
needs comes from users and customers
whenever the iteration is complete
working piece is delivered if customer
doesn't respond or explain or provide
the feedback then moving towards the
next iterations will become difficult it
is very essential the active involvement
of the stakeholders and very important
stakeholders is users and customers
the team members lacking in skills and
capability
so one has to ensure the team members
are groomed with the right capability
and that should be evaluated on a
continual basis so that organization can
handle things in an agile way and
contribute towards the projects what is
being done and become agile
some of the obstacles further if you can
look at is the inability to design
system based on unseen requirements so
these unseen requirement is very Dynamic
so when they will crop up we will not
know but however the system is what
we're designed should able to provide
that opportunity whenever such
variations happens you can able to
easily adopt or involve or take that
particular new requirement and plug in
so otherwise one cannot become so rigid
there should be flexibility
adapting the agile culture to the
organization
so culture plays a very important role
so a lot of resistance would come across
to adopt the new way of doing things
people may not appreciate the agile way
of doing things so it requires a lot of
effort motivation and making people to
understand why the organization has
taken up the task to make it agile and
building a culture where people would
think in agile way and contribute to the
organization question number 11
differentiate between agile and scrum so
the term agile as I mentioned earlier
refers to ability to move quickly and
easily by becoming more flexible and
adoptable
whereas scrum is an agile methodology
which enables organization so
organization can become
agile so agile Manifesto on 12
principles acts as guidelines to become
a child
whereas scrum is used in the projects
where requirements are constantly
changing aligning to Agile Manifesto and
12 principles they should follow what is
told in Manifesto and principles
so agile manifests to mentions about the
required collaboration interactions to
become agile
whereas scrum defines the roles the
scrum Master the product owner and
cross-functional self-organizing teams
who are involved in making the project
delivering the project in agile way so
agile manifest also mentions about the
required focus on working software and
focus on change
whereas a scrum approach enables teams
to react to changes quickly so means how
to become flexible what is that we have
to consider to become flexible is
defined in Manifesto means stressed on
it whereas a scrum follows with that
approach one can become easily flexible
so delivery the manifesto provides
necessary guidelines on frequent
delivery of software so where scrum with
the Sprints it builds our delivered
users regularly and upheld agile
principles so collaboration agile
Manifesto stresses upon individuals
interactions and customer collaboration
so scrum does it through various events
like daily stand-up meeting and other
scrum events select Sprint meeting
Sprint retrospective whereas people
sitting and discussing about writing an
user story their pics or selecting the
product from the product backlog to the
Sprint backlog so various events which
happens in scrum demonstrating that uh
point which is trusted in agile
Manifesto about individuals interactions
and customer collaboration by are
demonstrated with various different
events in scrum methodology so next
question what are some popular agile
certifications
so some of the popular result
certifications are PMI ACP certification
which is offered by PMI us
scrum Master certification
then certified scrum master
prince2 agile certification
then scrum product owner certification
so next we will move to a scenario based
questions
so before we go and answer the scenario
based questions let us look at the
scenario what the scenario says the
manager X was having the discussion with
the team about the upcoming event
the event was scheduled to conduct the
online marketing campaign to increase
the sales
due to increased computation and rapidly
changing customer behaviors
the campaign is very crucial and
organization has decided to do it more
often
this is done through the online platform
the organization has the requirement of
integration with organizations website
with all the features and
functionalities
the various roles involved in the
marketing campaign or marketing manager
marketing team campaign coordinators
creators of content and brochures for
campaign and the participants of the
campaign
all of these rules should have access to
platforms registration so that they can
have the required access and make the
marketing campaign successful besides
marketing manager has told the reports
needs to be generated which depicts the
number of campaigns conducted responses
registrations conversations
Etc
so this scenario speaking about the
marketing
challenges or problems what organization
has and through the problem statement
they wanted to ensure to the marketing
campaign and also they want to have an
online platform to ensure to make this
marketing campaign successful and also
speaks about the various different roles
involved in this
so let us look at what are the typical
questions which would come across in
such scenarios
so first question says can you write a
user story from the perspective of
marketing manager and participant so
firstly we need to understand what is
this user story is All About so in the
perspective marketing manager is
something anyway we will look at it what
it is
but user Stories the one which depicts
the requirements assuming the role as a
specific role I need to do this I want
to have this it gives it an explanation
so that one can easily understand about
that requirement what need of consumers
or what need of business this particular
features functionality is going to
fulfill so let us see what is that user
story relating to marketing manager and
participants
so yes why not here are a few examples
marketing manager user story says as a
marketing manager I need to assign the
activities tasked to the team members
so now whenever we develop that platform
there should be an access to marketing
manager and marketing manager can able
to assign the activities to the team
members so what feature that particular
platform should have has to be defined
and designed accordingly and this is the
requirement
a participant perspective as a
participant I need to register for the
campaign so now there should be a
registration page obviously and then
whatever the process needs to be
followed to create that registration for
the participant that needs to be made
and this simple user story helps in to
visualize what features functionality
has to be there when we go and create
that product and services
so this will help understanding the
requirement thoroughly and creating the
designing the features accordingly and
visualizing the flow as well so next
question
is agile the best approach to make a
marketing campaign and why
so now question arises should when we do
marketing campaign why should I follow
HL why not I do just like that so why do
we need agile what is that essential
need because already I mentioned the
need of agility
requires I mean whenever there is an
adaptability Whenever there is dynamics
of changes whenever I want to become
someone who can able to become
competitive because competition is also
responding to the Dynamics of the market
quickly I should be there in that
business so obviously does the this
question make sense can this marketing
campaign can be done in the agile way
so obviously yes
because the agile approach is the best
way to go with for marketing campaign
reason being the rapidly changing
behaviors of the consumers which has to
be understood and detail should be put
in their perspective and accordingly the
features has to be provided so always in
the consumer perspective customer
perspective
secondly with increased competition the
organization has to consider the unique
differentiator to sustain and grow they
should be uniqueness that needs to be
understood and that requires exercising
continuously and creating the products
according business marketing campaign
would help to understand that so next
question what are the typical product
backlog items so for this what could be
the typical backlog items means the list
of user stories list of epics which can
help in terms of defining the features
and functionality
the typical backlog items may include
the features like registration page
login page campaign contains platform to
conduct campaign assess requirements so
likewise you can keep writing so user
stories helps us to list what is that we
may require to develop in this product
so this requires a lot of collaboration
and discussion only then I think uh that
will become more visible next question
is what are the some considerations made
while selecting the items for product
backlog while selecting the backlog item
to each iterations from the product
backlog the backlog item has to be
prioritized definition of done for those
items to be selected value delivered
Improvement considerations Etc has to be
made so prioritization is very very
important what features functionality I
should develop first and how it makes
sense to my business how users will be
helped how customer will get benefited
so
these will help in terms of having those
features functionally developed in such
an order where for that moment that
which is in functionality are available
we're not just jumping into everything
and doing it one by one in a order in a
priorities list so
it is very essential to prioritize
defining the definition of done and
selecting the items accordingly and then
what value it delivers understanding
that and improving next question is the
involvement of marketing manager
required during the project and why it's
quite obvious
marketing manager in involvement is very
essential because it is a marketing
campaign yes the involvement of
marketing manager is very important and
crucial and it is the role who will have
the full visibility into the
requirements to be fulfilled and on
ground realities besides one cannot
become a child without the active
involvement and collaboration of
customer users with agile teams hope you
