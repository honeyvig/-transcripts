1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,640
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,279
tutorial my name is tim mubakshi and

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,199
this time we're going to be going over

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,000
how you can use sirikit with the new ios

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,080
10 frameworks that apple released in

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,199
order to create a messaging application

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,000
let's begin so now to begin first of all

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
siriket now with ios 10 apple has

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
released a new like just numerous new

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,640
apis for developers uh and one of them

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,520
is actually siriket and personally and i

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
know a lot of other developers have been

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
waiting for this for a long time in fact

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
since ios like seven or maybe even six

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
uh and so

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
of course

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
finally in june of this year apple had

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
released sirikit kiss

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,399
and now the iphone 7s have released

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,960
i just thought you know what why not

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,960
create something that makes use of this

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,159
new hardware and software so i created a

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,880
simple application that can help you as

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
a sort of proof of concept of how to use

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,320
siri kit let's begin

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,119
so now to begin uh what is syria what

27
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,439
will what will it allow you to do

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
so now to begin

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
let's take a look at the apple website

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,119
and you can see the apple website right

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
now

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
and the apple website it says that there

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,079
are only a few sort of ways you can use

34
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,960
siri with ios right now

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
and a few and one of those ways is

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,720
messaging which we're going to be using

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,600
today however in later videos i may be

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,920
covering other types of series uses as

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,079
well such as ride booking

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,600
continuing though

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,520
so now today we're going to be talking

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
about how to use sirikit for a messaging

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,320
application let's begin so now

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,159
essentially we're going to be creating

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,680
an application called chatter

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
now uh essentially what we're going to

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,720
be able to do is say to siri

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,400
uh hey send a chatter message to timothy

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,040
saying hi tim how are you

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,400
that's essentially what we're going to

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,319
be able to say to siri and then our

52
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,959
application chatter will parse exactly

53
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
or technically siri will parse what i

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,560
said uh and give that information to my

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
application which it will then use to

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,480
actually send uh to i mean they can send

57
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,000
the actual message if it wants i could

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
just display it on screen depends on

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
what it wants to do with the data but

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,519
once it has the data it's free to do

61
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,360
whatever it wants with it

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,519
continuing though

63
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,840
so now as you can see of course we have

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,680
our chatter application now how will

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,640
this work

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
essentially

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
i'm going to create first of all our ios

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,879
application

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,959
i'm also going to create an intense

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,760
application extension

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,959
intense and there's also an intense ui

72
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,120
which we won't be covering today but

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
essentially we're gonna have our ios

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,640
application and our intents

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
which will of course i mean uh by the

76
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,680
way on screen right now there's another

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
video that i had released about mm

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
wormholes

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
you should go check that out before you

80
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,319
watch this video if you're going to be

81
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,480
following along with the code so i'd

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
recommend you go watch that now

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,440
all right continuing

84
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
so as you can see we're going to have

85
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
sort of this ios and the intense end

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,200
and using the wormhole

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,799
we're going to be able to communicate

88
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,239
um

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,440
with intents

90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
all right

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
and that's how we're going to work now

92
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
essentially what is intense if you're

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,560
wondering uh now essentially if we take

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
a look at the apple website again as you

95
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,200
can see there are many types of siri use

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
cases uh and in this case we're using

97
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
messaging again and so uh now when

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
you're messaging there can be many user

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,720
intents there can be a user intent to

100
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
look up for messages that are unread

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,520
there can be intents uh to

102
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,600
like the user could intend to look at

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,759
all unread messages from

104
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,880
timothy for example or from james

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,600
or the user could want to send a message

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
or a you know there's so many types of

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
intents that or things that the user

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,520
could want to do

109
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
and that's what intents will allow us to

110
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
do with siri uh and so essentially

111
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,720
we're going to have this uh function

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,680
this class uh which will inherit from or

113
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
conform to

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,240
a delicate uh for this sort of siri kit

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
or intense and so

116
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,919
what's going to happen is it's going to

117
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,320
make us sort of create these functions

118
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,280
which will handle what happens when we

119
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,160
receive an intent and that intent data

120
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
so let's say the intent so let's say

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
we a function is called and we're past

122
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,000
an intent to send a message

123
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,560
all right

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,840
okay and this message is supposed to go

125
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,880
to i don't know john

126
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
to john

127
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,639
all right this is going to be from

128
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,120
yourself of course uh but we're going to

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
say what else what do we say in the

130
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,960
message the content

131
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,400
that's going to be let's say like hi

132
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
john

133
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,000
that's going to be the content of the

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,919
message uh and that's essentially what

135
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,120
we're going to receive in the intent

136
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
and so what we can do with this is of

137
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,400
course we can send the message we can do

138
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,320
whatever we want but essentially siri

139
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,880
has parsed this out and given it to us

140
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
let's say the user wants to search for

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
messages they can do that as well and

142
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
that's handled in a separate intent and

143
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,639
that's essentially how it's going to

144
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,840
work

145
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,319
all right so that was a quick rundown of

146
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,560
siri kit itself and

147
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,319
now let's get to the mac part where i'm

148
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,000
going to be showing you how you can

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,560
create a simple chatter application

150
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,039
with siriket and of course i may just

151
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,639
integrate this with my chatting

152
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,639
application video that i created a

153
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,919
little while ago uh so you can of course

154
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,800
there's a link to that in the

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
description uh and so you can check that

156
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,120
out and check that out if you'd like to

157
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
uh and i'm going to be integrating siri

158
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,919
with that soon all right let's get to

159
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,280
the mac part where i'm going to be

160
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
showing you how to implement this

161
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,600
so welcome back to the mac part and now

162
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
i'm going to be showing you how you can

163
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,199
actually use siriket in your

164
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,919
applications and of course as an example

165
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
today i have the chatter application

166
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
open so as you can see here uh on my mac

167
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
screen uh i have my iphone mirrored uh

168
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
to the actual to

169
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,160
my mac

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,479
uh and so let's begin so now essentially

171
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,479
what i'm going to be able to do is talk

172
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
to siri and have it send a message for

173
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
me through chatter and then chatter

174
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
should be able to display who the

175
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
message was supposed to be sent to

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,479
and what the message said so let's try

177
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,280
it out shall we

178
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,680
send a chatter message to james archieri

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,800
what do you want to say to james r siri

180
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
hi james dash how are you question mark

181
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,560
i was just wondering when you have time

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,120
to come down to toronto for the facebook

183
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
event period

184
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
ready to send it

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
yes

186
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,479
it's sent as you can see we were able to

187
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,319
tell it to send a chatter message to

188
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,919
james archieri

189
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,000
it asked us what the what to say in the

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,680
chatter message

191
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,520
i told it exactly what i wanted it to

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,720
say it showed me a quick little ui here

193
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,879
uh that shows us it's going to james

194
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,680
archieri uh and the actual message with

195
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,599
a nice little interface there then i

196
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,599
told it that yes i do want to send the

197
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,479
message and of course it's been sent and

198
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,039
then i can actually go to my application

199
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,199
and if i click anywhere on the screen of

200
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
this application here you probably

201
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
cannot see this on the camera but if i

202
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,160
click anywhere on the screen of this

203
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
application

204
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,160
it'll update and as you can see my last

205
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,959
message was sent to james archery and

206
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,880
this is exactly what it said hi james

207
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,399
how are you i was just wondering when

208
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
you have time to come down to toronto

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
for the facebook event which is exactly

210
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,120
what i said

211
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
all right so that was a neat little

212
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,959
example but now let's go over the code

213
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,399
and then i'll show you some more neat

214
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,800
examples of how you can actually sort of

215
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
rephrase what you're talking about and

216
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,760
siri will still understand how and who

217
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
to send the message to

218
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
all right continuing

219
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,360
so now let's begin with how we begin so

220
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
first of all you create the chatter

221
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
application uh and once you do you have

222
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,279
to you i mean you start out with general

223
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,519
so now here uh you don't really need to

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,519
do much uh so when you go to

225
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
capabilities however uh you need to

226
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,399
begin you have to you have to enable the

227
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,920
siri capability uh in your app id uh and

228
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,200
of course the app groups uh capability

229
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
uh now again if you haven't already i'd

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,839
again really recommend that you watch my

231
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,160
wormhole tutorial first uh this will

232
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
really help you out but continuing so

233
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,200
now uh with ad groups i can essentially

234
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,279
say okay so the current app group that

235
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,000
i'm using is

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,279
group.com.tbss.sirikit example uh

237
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,720
because i mean this is the sirikit

238
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
example that i'm creating however you

239
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,640
can really use whatever you want i'd

240
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,880
recommend using your app's name

241
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
because that just really makes it simple

242
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
when you need to find your app group in

243
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,560
the future uh but essentially of course

244
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
i'm using this uh so it would have a

245
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
hole or a sort of way to transfer data

246
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,839
between the siri kit

247
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,920
app extension and the actual ios

248
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
application itself

249
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
continuing however

250
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
now once you are done this you need to

251
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,200
also go to your info.plist file

252
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240
and add this row privacy siri usage

253
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
description and in this case i just have

254
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
chatter here you should actually

255
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,720
probably put in a real uh description of

256
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,079
why you want to use siri in your

257
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,240
application uh if you are planning on

258
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
submitting this to the app store however

259
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
i just have a chatter written here

260
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
continuing though

261
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
as you can see i have also integrated

262
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,560
the files from the mm wormhole source

263
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,680
code

264
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,320
and as i said in my wormhole tutorial as

265
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,680
well once i dragged these in i selected

266
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,480
all three of my targets chatter chatter

267
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
intense and chattery intensity y which i

268
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,880
will get into in just a moment

269
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,600
and as you can see uh it has created

270
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
three bridging headers one for chatter

271
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
one for chatter intense and one for

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
chatter intense ui

273
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,480
and for each one i've imported

274
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,279
a wwe wormhole.h and m oh sorry mmw i'm

275
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,560
sorry m m wormhole dot h and m m

276
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,040
wormhole session.h

277
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,640
these are the two sort of essential

278
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
files that you need to use wormholes in

279
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
your application

280
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,880
continuing however

281
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,160
what your next step is is to go to

282
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
general again

283
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
go to this little uh tab here as you can

284
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
see

285
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,839
click on the plus button

286
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,360
down there

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
and click on an intense extension under

288
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,959
ios

289
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
call this really whatever you want in

290
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,399
this case i'm just going to call it

291
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,800
chatter intense

292
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,920
all right

293
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,000
and so the rest can stay the same make

294
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
sure that the include ui extension is

295
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,160
selected i'm not actually currently

296
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,560
creating a ui extension uh but in the

297
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
future with a part two if i do want to

298
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
create one it just really helps out to

299
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
already have the ui extension there and

300
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,120
linked to your project

301
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,399
continuing though

302
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,560
if i continue now

303
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,959
essentially what i can do uh is if i

304
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,560
click on finish

305
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
oh well i mean the uh target already

306
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,360
exists but yeah yeah what i can

307
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,200
essentially do uh is i can um just a

308
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,120
second uh so i can essentially

309
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,880
uh sorry so i can essentially uh have

310
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,399
those two targets for the chatter

311
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,240
intense which is essentially the main

312
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,800
siri kit uh thing that you want

313
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
visible

314
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,920
for siri and of course the chatter

315
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,120
intense ui which is what i mean as i saw

316
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,839
as you saw in the ios and when you

317
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,079
actually use siri there's that little ui

318
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,760
that pops up once you tell it to send a

319
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,959
message

320
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,800
and so essentially

321
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,959
you can actually design that ui

322
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
which i will be covering in a separate

323
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,200
tutorial today i'm just teaching you how

324
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,360
you can actually integrate siri with

325
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,680
your application

326
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,519
continuing though

327
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,040
now let's go over the uh interface shall

328
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,079
we so now in the interface uh very very

329
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,000
simple uh just two labels over here uh

330
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
one for who the message was sent to one

331
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,399
for what the message said

332
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,000
and of course the actual labels that

333
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
contain the content themselves one is to

334
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,279
label

335
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,079
and one is content label and if i go to

336
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,639
my viewcontroller.swift file as you can

337
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,880
see those are the ib outlets for those

338
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
two labels

339
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
i'm also of course creating the constant

340
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,959
for my wormhole in this case i'm using

341
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,440
my uh app group that i created and my

342
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,560
optional directory is sirika example

343
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
i'm also creating two variables two and

344
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
content that will store whatever comes

345
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,399
back from the wormhole

346
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,519
uh and in my viewdidload function uh now

347
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,680
there's something here

348
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
essentially what you need to do is on

349
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,079
your first run of your application you

350
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,440
need to ask the user if they want your

351
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
application to be able to be compatible

352
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
with siri uh and so essentially this is

353
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,079
what this code does it'll use the

354
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,639
intense preferences and it'll request

355
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,360
siri authentic authorization uh and so

356
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,800
of course you're going to need to import

357
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,399
intents for this

358
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,320
uh and of course this will essentially

359
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,199
and uh this will of course request for

360
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,519
authorization to use siri uh using that

361
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,959
description that you provided in the

362
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,639
info.plist file and it'll also make sure

363
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,880
not to ask twice if it's already asked

364
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,199
and if it has permission it will not ask

365
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,639
again which is just great so i don't

366
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,560
need to implement logic for finding out

367
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,480
if it's the first run of the application

368
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
really convenient

369
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,399
next in the view did appear um

370
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
function uh which i'm overriding of

371
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
course from uiviewcontroller i've

372
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,079
essentially allowed the wormhole to

373
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,160
listen for a message that has the

374
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,519
identifier to message uh so now this is

375
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,399
essentially the channel i guess of the

376
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
wormhole which will contain

377
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
who we're sending the message to

378
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,680
uh and of course content message will

379
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,920
contain uh who what the content is of

380
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,240
the message that we're sending

381
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
and so essentially what i can say is in

382
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,240
each of these code blocks as you know

383
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
from the wormhole tutorial which again i

384
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,279
highly recommend you watch uh there is a

385
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,160
sort of

386
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,040
parameter or variable that comes in with

387
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,760
this asynchronous function or code block

388
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,839
called result or in this case i'm

389
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,079
calling it res for result

390
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,839
uh and so i'm just checking really

391
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,079
quickly uh making sure that's not nil so

392
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,839
i'm checking if let message is equal to

393
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,480
res uh in which case this will run uh

394
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
it'll set the two variable that i

395
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,839
created uh to the message as a string

396
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,759
because this as i mentioned my previous

397
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,399
tutorial is an optional any and so i'm

398
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,519
converting this to a string

399
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,120
and same thing for content message

400
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,440
except this time i'm setting the content

401
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
variable to my message as a string

402
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
and then in the touches began function

403
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,959
which is where i do most of my updating

404
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,040
i'm just sending the two labels text to

405
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
the to variable and the content labels

406
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,920
text to the content

407
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,519
but now how does siri actually integrate

408
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,839
with this well that's where as you can

409
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,120
see i created my chatter intense target

410
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,759
and using this chatter intense target i

411
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,440
have the intent handler.swift file

412
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
and this is essentially where all the uh

413
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,120
heavy lifting happens for siri and this

414
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,519
is where all the calculations are not

415
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,120
calculations necessarily but this is

416
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,079
where you

417
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
handle what happens with siri in your

418
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
messaging application

419
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,160
and so let's begin so now i'm going to

420
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
just run down this code uh and so as you

421
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
can see uh we are at the beginning uh

422
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,320
importing intents and foundation uh and

423
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,079
there are a few comments already created

424
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,880
by apple as to how you could use uh this

425
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,320
code

426
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,759
but continuing now first of all we're

427
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,720
creating a class called 10 handler

428
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,319
which uh inherits from or conforms to uh

429
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
intense extension intent send message

430
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,520
intent handling uh intense search for

431
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,799
messages intent handling and intense set

432
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,280
message attribute intent handling now

433
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,559
you don't exactly need to know what

434
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,959
these mean it's essentially sort of the

435
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,360
delegates or the handlers

436
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,600
for creating a messaging application

437
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,679
which is compatible with siri and siri

438
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,120
kit

439
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,039
now in this class of course i'm creating

440
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,039
my constant for the wormhole which is

441
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,799
again using the same app group that i

442
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,039
gave it in my viewcontroller.swift

443
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,200
and the same optional directory as well

444
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,320
in this case called sirikit example

445
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,840
now this is just you know the default

446
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
implementation we don't really need to

447
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,919
uh worry about this function

448
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,039
but this is the first really uh useful

449
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,039
function that we need to uh worry about

450
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,280
now essentially this is the resolve

451
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
recipients function now this function

452
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,320
will allow me

453
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,360
uh to essentially take uh an intent

454
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,480
called intent send message intent uh and

455
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
it'll have a completion which i'll get

456
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
into but essentially what this is going

457
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,480
to do is it's going to be a method that

458
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
will choose which contact uh you are

459
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
sending your message to now

460
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
in this specific case it's just going to

461
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,240
go with whatever you give it if you tell

462
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,840
him if you tell siri to send a message

463
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,520
to um i don't know

464
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,559
tim

465
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,640
and let's say tim isn't in your contact

466
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,039
list it'll still go with it but you

467
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,440
could integrate some sort of logic to

468
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,280
tell siri that hey tim isn't in the

469
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,679
contact list did you mean timothy or

470
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,679
something of that sort but in this case

471
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
it'll just go with whatever you give it

472
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,919
in siri

473
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,080
continue i mean in a future tutorial i

474
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
can of course uh tell you exactly how

475
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,720
you would uh do that but for now it just

476
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,799
goes with whatever siri gives you

477
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
next the resolve content which is

478
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
actually very very simple uh this is

479
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,440
just uh now also one more thing really

480
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,760
quickly these resolve functions

481
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
essentially take

482
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,320
whatever you gave from siri

483
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,520
and it's sort of asking you hey did the

484
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,640
user give enough information in what he

485
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,520
said

486
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
and let's say the user said send a

487
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,120
chatter message to james archieri

488
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,360
well then he said the recipients but he

489
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
didn't say what exactly he wanted to say

490
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,600
to them which is the content

491
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
and so in this case in the resolve

492
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
content as you can see we're checking if

493
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,440
they've actually given

494
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
that content if they have then great

495
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,200
success

496
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,280
if they haven't then we need that value

497
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,559
and we're calling that completion

498
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,799
handler for siri which will handle what

499
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,440
happens next and then of course apple or

500
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
siri specifically handles all that

501
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
natural language processing uh and all

502
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,440
those steps in between as well which

503
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
makes it very very convenient for

504
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,840
developers

505
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,919
but then once you're done resolving all

506
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,840
those things you are done handling all

507
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
the recipients that we need to send to

508
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
done handling the content and in

509
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,200
different types of applications there

510
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,799
could be more things to resolve or less

511
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,280
things to resolve then in this case

512
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,360
we're going to confirm

513
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
that of course do you actually want to

514
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
send this message

515
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,400
and

516
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,720
if the user says yes then great we're

517
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
just going to continue with whatever

518
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,120
siri wants us to continue with

519
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,600
and then this is the actual logic that

520
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,799
sends the message itself now this is

521
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,960
where it gets a little interesting where

522
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,440
uh now before if i show you this is the

523
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
code that i've added before it was just

524
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,320
this much uh but with my code added in

525
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,080
essentially what this does is it'll

526
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
check uh

527
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,120
first of all we do have the message

528
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,720
content we have the message recipients

529
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,760
and once we have determined all that

530
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,159
it'll create a two message variable and

531
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,919
it'll take the first recipient and get

532
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,000
the display name of that recipient uh

533
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
because i mean this application isn't

534
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,760
designed to send to multiple people only

535
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
one person uh and so it's going to take

536
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,799
the first recipient uh and get the

537
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,080
display name which is a string of course

538
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
and then what's going to happen this is

539
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,600
the really interesting part it uses the

540
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
wormhole and passes a message object

541
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
which is to message as an ns string to

542
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,159
the to message channel and so you know

543
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,559
view controller will get this variable

544
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,480
and sort in the two variable that i've

545
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
declared in view controller

546
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
and then the wormhole pass message

547
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,760
object message content sns string now as

548
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,280
i said in my wormhole tutorial the

549
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
reason i'm converting these to ns string

550
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
is because it has to be ns coding

551
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,960
compliant again if you have questions

552
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
about that just check out my wormhole

553
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
video and you'll find out

554
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,720
and of course i'm sending this on the

555
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
channel content message if we go back to

556
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,960
view controller as you can see two

557
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
message and contact message our content

558
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,159
message sorry

559
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,159
and after this it has sent through the

560
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,080
wormhole and we are calling our

561
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,559
completion and then siri can continue

562
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,840
with whatever it needs to continue with

563
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,360
then finally uh there's one last handler

564
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,320
uh which is let's say the user asks uh

565
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,120
let's search uh through my unread

566
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
messages uh and so this is essentially

567
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,360
the function that will get called for

568
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,159
that

569
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,880
i n search for messages intent uh and

570
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
then of course you can sort of give it

571
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,000
the messages that it needs to search

572
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,320
through or the unread messages that it

573
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
that siri should respond with which is

574
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,480
an in message which in turn takes the

575
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,640
identifier the content of the message

576
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,120
the date sent uh the sender which in

577
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
this case is uh sarah and the recipients

578
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,720
which in this case is john

579
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,159
and that was it for that uh code walk

580
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,960
through uh so now let's actually i'm

581
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,799
going to show you really quickly a quick

582
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,440
demo of a a few more siri phrases here

583
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,200
uh so now let's try this out let's uh

584
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
try out this time um

585
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,480
chatter marcus kempen

586
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,200
what do you want to say to marcus kempen

587
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,720
hi marcus dash i was able to practice my

588
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,919
table tennis serve comma so do you have

589
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,640
time this weekend to meet up question

590
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
mark

591
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,200
ready to send it

592
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
yes

593
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,240
it's sent

594
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,880
all right great us now as you can see

595
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
essentially what i was able to do

596
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,919
is i was able to uh say chatter marcus

597
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,440
kempen as a verb this time uh and so i

598
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,799
could say chatter and it would

599
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,240
understand that hey chatter marcus

600
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,159
campin means send a message to mark's

601
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,159
campaign via chatter

602
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,840
it asked me what i wanted to say to

603
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,080
marcus kempen so i told it exactly what

604
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,880
i wanted to say it asked me uh it just

605
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
you know confirmed and once i said yes

606
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,600
it was sent and so in that step it got

607
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,320
sent through the wormhole and if i click

608
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
on the application

609
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,080
it says your last message was sent to

610
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,320
marcus kempen and it said hi marcus i

611
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,600
was able to practice my table tennis

612
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,679
serve so do you have time this weekend

613
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,039
to meet up

614
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,320
all right let's try out one last thing

615
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,640
let's say

616
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,559
chatter john maxwell cohn

617
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
what do you want to say to john maxwell

618
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,799
cohn

619
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,240
hi john

620
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
dash i had some really new and

621
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,000
interesting watson iot ideas come on so

622
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
do you have any time to meet up soon

623
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,640
question mark

624
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,960
ready to send it

625
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,720
yes

626
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,080
it's sent

627
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,679
and as you can see if i click on the

628
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,919
application it will the application was

629
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,960
given information by siri uh and it was

630
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,240
able to uh parse that uh and display in

631
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,440
a label

632
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,039
all right so that was pretty interesting

633
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,360
so now again really quick recap siri

634
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
does all the natural language processing

635
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,559
you can phrase it really however you

636
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,120
want you can use it as a an action in

637
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,200
this case like for example you can say

638
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
chatter john maxwell cohn instead of

639
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,440
just send a chatter message to john

640
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,080
maxwell cohn uh and then it'll be able

641
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
to parse that out uh and tell chatter

642
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,400
that we want to send a message through

643
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,720
your application uh and then siri will

644
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
do as i said all the nlp and give you

645
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,799
who the message is supposed to be sent

646
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,039
to even if there are multiple recipients

647
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,799
uh it'll choose from the contact list

648
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,039
for you it'll do all that sort of stuff

649
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,279
and it'll even take out the content and

650
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,600
plus you can uh create your own little

651
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,880
ui for siri uh so you know you have your

652
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,279
own little message interface

653
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,279
and that is very interesting and of

654
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,240
course a more detailed look at surrogate

655
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,559
is going to be coming soon uh to the

656
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,400
channel but that's going to be it for

657
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
today thank you very much i hope you
