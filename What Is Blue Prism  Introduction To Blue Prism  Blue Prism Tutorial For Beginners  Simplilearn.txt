hey everyone i welcome you all to this
video
in this video we will understand what is
blue prism let's look at today's agenda
we shall begin with what is blue prism
and see the different features of blue
prism
followed by which we will look at the
architecture of blue prism and different
components of blue prism
proceeding further we will see the key
benefits of flow prism
and some of the real-time applications
of blue prism
finally we will see the companies using
blue prism and salary trends but before
we begin make sure you have subscribed
to our youtube channel and clicked on
the bell icon so you never miss an
update from simplylearn so without
wasting any further time let's get
started with blueprism
what is blue prism
blue prism is a software that develops
enterprise robotic process automation
allowing businesses to automate complex
end-to-end operations
blue prism developed the virtual
workforce platform concept and works on
an enterprise robotic process automation
platform that is strong highly scalable
secure and reliable
blue prism software complements standard
i.t solutions by utilizing an agile
virtual workforce that follows
rule-based business processes and
interacts with the system in the same
way that users do
blueprism's rpa software solution
automates tasks that would otherwise be
carried out manually by humans or
through major customization of current
i.t systems
resulting in a higher level of
automation with significantly lesser
investment and faster deployment
features of blue prism
intelligent execution technology
organizations can instruct the
autonomous engine on process priorities
feed amounts of work and leave it to run
without human involvement responding to
systems business scenarios and change in
priorities
robots like humans can be used to do
tasks based on sla volume and priority
as well as adjust and change robot
allocation dynamically without human
intervention
high security
a software robot securely locks into an
application and manipulates the
presentation layer in the same manner as
a person would but in a controlled
non-invasive environment ensuring that
the application's integrity is never
affected
on premises or in the cloud on-premises
or hybrid enterprise deployment
provisioned in a public or private cloud
the robots are existing and running any
operation set in blue prism can be
conducted on any number of robots in the
virtual workforce
built on microsoft sql server
blueprism is built on microsoft.net
framework it is technology flexible
working across different platforms and
technologies such as mainframe windows
app wpf app java sap custom apps citrix
thick client thin client web services
and so on
scalability blue prism is object
oriented allowing for rapid scalability
by utilizing reusable items and
libraries
analytics and reporting
blueprism provides high quality data
that can be used to produce relevant bi
and mi reporting as well as providing
in-line process statistics and real-time
operational insights by capturing each
step
work queues
work use provides a cue-centric approach
for dynamically controlling the number
of resources or robots operating against
a given queue at any given time allowing
for the greatest flexibility in the
adjusting the number of resources
assigned to collaborately work items
architecture of blue prism
blueprism technology is backed by a
comprehensive methodology for rapid
business process development deployment
and operational support allowing for a
whole business process cycle to be
completed within the same environment
this diagram depicts the architectural
components of blue prism deployment
including all aspects to enable
governance security and control as well
as the inherent flexibility to support
operational agility and self-service
monitoring and referrals
technically service monitoring and
business-owned referral management for
work items requiring additional manual
steps
operational and methodologies
a comprehensive framework for
implementing blue prism methodologies
including analysis design development
and implementation
i.t governance
the principles that underpin best
practice in the process selection change
management and release procedures
operational configuration
ownership of blueprism product for
operational configuration testing and
execution
roles and responsibilities within the
methodology there are clear developed
roles for managing and implementing the
many aspects of ongoing agility
security functions of security products
infrastructure and methodology that
provides secure and compliant
implementation
support and hosting
a robust scalable infrastructure that
allows for rapid deployment and
expansion based on business requirements
components of blue prism
object studio
object studio allows business users or
i.t professionals to construct reusable
blue prism objects as the building
blocks for the business process by
modeling current applications and
training blue prism as a robotic user
object studio is the design canvas on
which the blue prism robot is programmed
to conduct the fundamental system
activities that serve as the foundation
of process
the presentation layer which provides a
library of elements with which to
operate quickly models and validates the
target desktop application
process studio
process studio provides a similar
interface to object studio and allows
you to sequence and test business logic
control loops variables and object calls
in a visible business flow
process studio allows the company or it
to design build edit and test processes
made out of reusable blue prism elements
as the library of business object grows
actions can be scheduled and controlled
in the process layer the top tier of the
blue prism architecture
process in blue prism are comparable to
software procedures in that they can
invoke objects and operations in order
to run applications automate rule-based
process and business logic
control room control room allows
business or iit services to schedule
perform and control processes
blue prism platform administrators can
use the blue prism control room
interface to monitor and review the
status of interconnected runtime
resources in the production environment
the interface also allows for manual
process start and stop
automated process schedule setting and
extensive management information and dig
downs into blue prism task queues
applications of blue prism
blue prisms rps software is used in the
following process types
rule-based processing using digital
structured inputs such as credit card
activation or fraud detection
transactional processing that is
repeated such as sim swaps or invoice
processing
transaction quantities that are high
such as billing or new handset order
processing
issues with process adherence quality
such as policy renewals or policy
migrations
complex mission critical procedures such
as pension redemptions and financial
reconciliation
changes in demand or backlogs such as
new product launches
it is used in hr onboarding or the
introduction of new online product where
no integration exists
benefits of blue prism
the first benefit is automation speed
days and weeks to automate processes in
blue prism that would take months and
years to automate using the standard
automation methodologies
less expense
robots are programmed with the business
rules of repetitive duties and deployed
to drive existing applications
eliminating the requirement for costly
integration and process redesign
expertise
improved performance a small specialist
ability within the iit department
collaborates with the robotic workforce
to train them manage referrals and
continuously enhance the robot's
operational performance
secure
the robotic automation platform is
secure
audited and governed with a governance
i.t corridor
the usage of software robots invariably
increases compliance with applicable
data standards confidentiality and the
speed and accuracy of record keeping
scalable
because the software robots operate in a
virtualized environment they can be
rapidly scaled up and down based on the
demand
