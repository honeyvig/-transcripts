do you know friends that at Toyota
management was grappling with high def
rates in cardo assemblies in response to
this their product manager turned to Six
Sigma a quality improvement methodology
pioneered by engineer Bill Smith at
Motorola in the 1980s which specifically
designed to minimize Errors By
identifying and eliminating variability
in manufacturing processes the team
started by thoroughly collecting and
analyzing defect data identifying faulty
Machinery human error as the main
culprit based on these insights targeted
improvements like worker retraining and
Equipment upgrades were implemented
these changes were initially tested in a
control environment to ensure
Effectiveness this methodological
approach cut a defect rates by 50%
within a year and significantly boosting
productivity and customer satisfaction
companies seeking this remarkable
results started adopting Six Sigma
methodology and the demand for Six Sigma
certified individuals increased
significantly since the last decade
typically salary for Six Sigma certified
individual ranges from
$65,000 to over 100,000 US dollar
annually with variations based on role
industry and geography Six Sigma built
professionals can earn in the higher end
of this range reflecting the value of
their Advanced expertise and ability to
drive significant Improvement and the
complex
processes craving a career upgrade

further updates so here's the agenda of
our today's session we are going to
start with what is sex Sigma moving
ahead we are going to discuss about what
is lean sex Sigma then we will discuss
the five key principles of Six Sigma the
Six Sigma methodology and the Six Sigma
process of business transformation
moving ahead we will have a thorough
discussion on Six Sigma techniques and
the Six Sigma tools and at the end we
are going to conclude our session with a
discussion on Six Sigma levels so guys
let's start with what is Six Sigma the
term Six Sigma refers to a statistical
measure of how a process deviates from
Perfection a process that operates at
Six Sigma has a failure rate of only
0.34% which mean it produces ually no
defects Six Sigma was developed by
Motorola in 1980s and it has since been
adopted by many other companies around
the world it includes like General
Electric Toyota and Amazon it is used in
Industries such as manufacturing
Healthcare finance and service
Industries to improve customer
satisfaction reduce cost and increase
profits Six Sigma is basically a set of
methodologies and tools used to improve
business processes by reducing defects
and errors and also minimizing variation
and increasing quality efficiency the
goal of Six Sigma is to achieve a level
of quality that is nearly perfect with
only 3.4 defects per million
opportunities this is achieved by using
a structured approach called dmic which
means Define measure analyze improve and
control to identify and eliminate causes
of variation and improve processes Six
Sigma is a disciplined and datadriven
approach widely used in project
management to achieve process
Improvement and minimize defects it
provides a systematic Frameworks to
identify and eliminate variations that
can impact the project performance I
hope so guys you would have got a brief
idea regarding what is Six Sigma now let
us move on to our next part that is what
is lean6 Sigma so guys lean6 Sigma is a
methodology that combines two powerful
Improvement techniques that is lean and
C Sigma
lean focuses on minimizing waste and
maximizing efficiency by identifying and
eliminating non-value adding activities
this involves streamlining processes
reducing defects improving quality and
optimizing resources to deliver more
value with less effort on the other hand
Six Sigma is a statistical approach to
process Improvement that aims to reduce
variations and defects by using
datadriven decision making it involves
like defining measuring analyzing
improving and controlling processes to
achieve consistent and predictable
result so guys by combining the strength
of these two methodologies lean Six
Sigma provides a comprehensive approach
to process Improvement that can be
applied to any industry or sector this
technique is widely used in
manufacturing Healthcare finance and
service Industries to improve efficiency
and reduce the cost and enhance the
customer satisfaction now let us discuss
about the five key principles of Six
Sigma Six Sigma has it foundations in
five key
principles the first one that is is
focus on the customer this is based on a
popular belief that the customer is
sking the primary goal is to bring
maximum benefit to the customer for this
a business need to understand its
customer their needs and what drives
their sales or loyalty this requires
establishing a standard quality as
defined by what the customer or market
demand
measure the value stream and find your
problem so guys map the steps in a given
process to determine the areas of waste
get the data to discover the specific
problem area that is to be addressed or
transformed have clearly defined goals
for data collection including defining
the data to be collected the reason for
the data Gathering and insights to be
expected ensuring the accuracy of
measurements and establishing a
standardized data collection system the
third one that we have is get rid of the
junk once the problem is identified make
changes to the processes to eliminate
variation thus removing defects remove
activities in the process that do not
add to the customer value if the value
stream doesn't reveal where the problem
lies tools are used to help discover the
outliers and problem areas streamline
functions to achieve quality control and
efficiency the fourth one is keep the
ball rolling involve all stakeholders
adopt a structured process where your
team contributes and collaborates their
varied expertise for problem solving sex
Sigma processes can have a great impact
on an organization so the team has to be
proficient in the principle and
methodologies used and finally we have
uring a flexible and responsive
ecosystem the essence of Six Sigma is
business transformation and change when
a faulty or inefficient process is
removed it calls for a change in a work
practice and employees approach a robust
culture of flexibility and
responsiveness to changes in procedures
can ensure streamlined project
implementation the people and
departments involved should be able to
adapt to change with A's so to
facilitate this process should be
designed for quick and seamless adoption
ultimately the company that has an eye
fixed on the data examines the bottom
line periodically and adjust its
processes where necessary and can gain a
Competitive Edge so these were some of
the five key principles of Six Sigma now
let's move on and discuss about the Six
Sigma
methodologies the two main Six Sigma
methodologies are dmaic and dmadv each
has its own set of recommended
procedures to be implemented for
business
transformation if we talk about demac
it's a data driven method used to
improve existing products or services
for better customer satisfaction it is
the acronym for the five phases like
Define measure and improve the next one
is dma DV if I talk about dma DV it is a
part of design for the Six Sigma process
which is used to redesign different
processes of product manufacturing or
Service delivery now let us understand
each one of them one by one so as I have
told you earlier that dmac is a
datadriven method used for improving
existing product or services for better
customer
satisfaction and it involves five phases
Define measure analyze improve and
control dmac is applied in manufacturing
of a product or delivery of service
whereas if you talk about dmadv as I've
told you earlier it is also a part of a
Six Sigma process which is used to
define or redesign different process of
product manufacturing or Service
delivery the five phases of DMV are
defined measure analyze design and
validate dmadv is employed where
existing process processes do not meet
customer conditions even after
optimization or when it is required to
develop new methods it is executed by
Six Sigma Green bels and Six Sigma Black
belts under the supervision of Six Sigma
Master black belts the two methodologies
are used in different businesses setting
and professionals seeking to master
these methods and application scenarios
would do well to take an online
certificate program taught by industry
experts now we are going to discuss
about the Six Sigma process of business
transformation although Six Sigma uses
various methods to discover deviations
and solve problems the dmac is the
standard methodologies used in Six Sigma
practitioner the first one that we have
is Six Sigma uses a datadriven
management process used for optimizing
and improving business processes the
underlying framework is a strong
customer focus and robust use of data
and statistics to
conclude now each of the other phases
have business transform
as several steps the first one is
defined the Six Sigma process begins
with a customer Centric approach step
one would be the business problem is
defined from the customer perspective
then the goals are set what do you want
to achieve what are the resources you
will choose to achieve these goals and
finally in defining the third would be
mapping the process verify with the
stakeholders that you are on the right
track then comes measure the second
phase is focused on the metrics of the
projects and the tools used in the
measurement how can you improve how can
you quantify this so for this step one
would be measure your problem in numbers
or with supporting data step two would
be defining performance yard stick fix
the limits for y and in step three
evaluate the measurement system to be
used you can ask questions like can it
help you to achieve your outcome the
next one is analyze the third phase
analyzes the process to discover
influencing variables in this the step
one would be determine if your process
is efficient and effective does a
process help you achieve what you need
then you move to quantifying your goals
in numbers for instance reduce your
defective Goods by 20% and finally in
step three identify variations using
historical data the next phase is
improve this process investigates how
the changes in X impacts y this phase is
where you identify how you can improve
the process implementation for one and
step one you have identify possible
reasons test to identify which of the X
variables identified in the process
three influence Y in step two discover
relationships between the variables the
step three would be establish process
tolerance defined as a precise value
that certain variables can have and
still fall within acceptable boundaries
for instance the quality of any given
product which boundaries needs X to hold
y within specifications
what operating conditions can impact the
outcome process tolerances can be
achieved by using tools like robust
optimization and validation set and
finally we have control in this Final
Phase you determine the final
performance objective identified in the
previous phase is well implemented that
the design improvements are sustainable
for this the step one would be validate
the measurement system to be used
establish process capability is a goal
met for instance will the goal of
reducing defective Goods by 20% be
achieved once the previous step is
satisfied implement the processes so
these were some of the Six Sigma process
of business transformation now we are
going to understand about the Six Sigma
techniques so Guys these are some of the
six segma techniques like the 5S
methodology value stream mapping Kaizen
events just in time production Canan
systems POC yoke or error proofing next
one is total productive maintenance and
finally we have Continuous Flow so these
were some of the Six Sigma techniques
now let us discuss about some of the Six
Sigma tools the first one that we have
is all over here is cause and effect
analysis then you can use
flowchart moving ahead you are going to
get a Pito chart next is histogram
moving ahead in the category of Six
Sigma tools in the industry they also
apply check sheets and control charts so
these were some of the Six Sigma tools
that are applied in the industry now we
are going to move ahead and discuss
about the Six Sigma levels so guys the
Six Sigma training levels conform to
specified training requirements the
education criteria job standards and
eligibility the first one that we have
is white belt this is a simple stage
where any newcomer can join people work
with teams on problem solving projects
here the participant is required to
understand the basics SE Sigma Concepts
moving ahead we have the yellow belt
here the participant takes a part as a
project team member he reviews the
process Improvement gains understanding
of the various methodologies and dmac
finally we have the green level this
level of expertise requires the
following criteria minimum of three
years of full-time employment understand
the tools and methodologies used for
problem solving hands-on experience on
projects involving some level of
business transform
then the guidance for black belt
projects in data collection and Analysis
leads the green belt projects or teams
so these are some things that come under
the green belt now moving ahead we are
going to discuss about the black belt so
this level includes the following
minimum of three years of full-time
employment work experience in a core
knowledge area proof of completion of
minimum Two Six Sigma projects
demonstration of expertise at applying
mult variate metrics to diverse business
chain settings then you also have to
lead diverse team in the problem solving
projects and training and coaching
projects teams and finally we have
Master black belt to reach at this level
a candidate must be in a possession of
black build certification have a minimum
of 5 years of full-time employment or
proof of completion of a minimum of 10
Six Sigma projects a proven wor
portfolio with individual specific
requirements as given here for instance
like have coed and trained green bills
and black bills developed key metrics
and strategies have worked on
organizations Six Sigma technologist and
internal business transformation advisor
so Guys these were some of the Six Sigma
levels so if we talk about what are the
six segma career choices and salary
prospects then six segma is widely
adopted by many Industries in the domain
of manufacturing Healthcare finance and
Retail and it also offers a range of
career opportunities with attractive
