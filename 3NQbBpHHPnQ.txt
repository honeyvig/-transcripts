2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,240
all right so just before I start the

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,760
actual tutorial today I just like to say

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,430
that an early access copy of my book

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,859
hello Swift has been released for the

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,680
first eight chapters you can find it on

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,170
many bookstores online such as Amazon

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,380
chapters and indigo as well as the

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,380
publishers website I really do hope that

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,840
this helps you throughout your journey

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,460
of learning the Swift programming

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,090
language alright so let's get into the

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,940
tutorial now so closer and welcome to

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,840
another tutorial

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,360
my name is Ken Lee battery and this time

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,280
we're going to be going over how you can

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,949
use the SS speech recognizer in swiftly

18
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,770
in a Mac OS application in order to

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,620
transcribe the Metro phonetic alphabet

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,690
or the North Atlantic Treaty

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,960
Organization phonetic alphabet numbers

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,880
call this is because the natural

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,280
organization is actually adopted this

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,890
phonetic alphabet but before I go any

25
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,200
further about this application I like to

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
say a big thank you to Ryan for sending

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,799
in this video request and idea so

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,990
beginning today though basically the

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,180
point of this application is let's just

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,729
say that you wanted to write out cat CA

31
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,000
T on your computer instead of saying C

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,420
18 or cat you would say Charlie alpha

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,110
tango which is the meta and SRC natural

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,020
phonetic alphabet form of cat and

35
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,909
basically this application will write

36
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,009
out cat free and this is based

37
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,590
completely off of my older and a speech

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,229
recognizer videos code so if you like to

39
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,970
learn a bit more about how the NFC's

40
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,460
recognizer actually works you can find a

41
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,960
link of that video down in the

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,170
description below and so cool so today

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,119
I'm going to be showing you how I was

44
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,829
able to implement the Semitic alphabet

45
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,799
into this speech recognizer so without

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,329
any further ado let's get straight to

47
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,239
the code part where I can show you how I

48
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,129
was able to implement this phonetic

49
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,900
alphabet with my

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,810
Mac OS application using the NS speech

51
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,379
recognizer let's get to it

52
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,700
alright so welcome back to the color

53
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,739
part and now I'm going to be showing you

54
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,620
the actual implementation of this

55
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,439
application so if you already seen my

56
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,290
older in a speech recognizer video you

57
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,239
actually find this you probably find

58
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,180
this code very very familiar example

59
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,519
facts this is a very this are a flicked

60
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,760
3 version of that same code and so

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,310
basically the point on this code is that

62
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,200
we are I mean I'm not going to be

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,239
explaining into too much depth basically

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,829
we are declining or we're Kotori

65
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,260
declaring our speech recognizer with

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,609
setting the delegates itself we're

67
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,109
setting the commands clean china

68
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,150
phonetic alphabet plus them and I'll

69
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,220
talk about that in a second and we're

70
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,780
telling the speech recognizer to start

71
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,840
listening for commands once that's done

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,150
we implement the speech recognizer did

73
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,670
recognize command function and in this

74
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,530
function we basically set the break

75
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,629
state which you probably understand from

76
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,939
my older video I'll be playing in too

77
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:17,010
much detail here though but we said in

78
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,109
blank state to either true or false

79
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,449
depending on what the user said and we

80
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,959
set the output text view to of what they

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,709
said and usually before what I did in my

82
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,519
video is we would set this that we look

83
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,280
at this texting a user could say text

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,549
not to basically just a command but this

85
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:39,629
time what we're doing is we're setting

86
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:42,690
up the commands first character so for

87
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,150
example to use just this alpha for a we

88
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,829
only want the a from the beginning of

89
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,239
alpha we don't want the entirety of

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,159
alpha to be printed out onto the

91
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,049
textview in fact let me show you a quick

92
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,750
example of this in action

93
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,040
so as you can see it's going to take a

94
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,949
second here

95
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:00,209
now let's actually try something else

96
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:07,579
like maybe YouTube so Yankee after

97
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:13,650
uniform tango uniform

98
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:21,120
Bravo echo take a break alright so

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,010
basically what I've done here is I

100
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,620
actually recited out YouTube in the NAT

101
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,199
hell phonetic alphabet form and what the

102
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,699
NSE truck is nigel has gone ahead and

103
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,190
done is actually understood that and

104
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,370
roll out YouTube in this text you over

105
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,740
here and the text fusing tire I guess

106
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,690
you could say window here I don't you

107
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,240
can see in this array that I'm defining

108
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,669
here I'm actually defining the entire in

109
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,860
NATO phonetic alphabet something alpha

110
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,889

Yankee Yankee sorry

115
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,880
Zulu space take a break and get to work

116
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,220
now apart from the phonetic alphabet I

117
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,169
have three commands as well those would

118
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,330
be space take a break and get back to

119
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,160
work now if you've already watched my

120
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,110
older tutorial you'll you already know

121
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,729
what take a break and get back to work

122
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,580
means basically take a break tells E and

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,889
a sweet recognizer to stop listening and

124
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,060
get back to work tails at the start

125
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,580
listening again however space work that

126
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,810
what that's going to do is that's a new

127
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,700
command that I just put in and so what

128
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,080
that will do is it'll put a space

129
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,300
between what the characters that you say

130
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,520
so we actually give you a quick sample

131
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,000
of that as well like just for example if

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,620
I were to say maybe Oh get back to work

133
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,240
okay

134
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,740
get back to work and if it doesn't

135
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,660
realize that I just said that let's just

136
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:58,410
rerun the application and it should all

137
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,349
right

138

tango take a break as you can see it

141
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,310
wrote out hello Swift the title of my

142
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,800
book and so basically this proves that

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,750
it is able to understand commands like

144
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,980
space and so that's basically how this

145
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,220
application functions and of course as I

146
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,230
said I have not gone into the code to

147
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,210
very much detail basically what I'm

148
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,160
saying here is that taking the exact

149
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,250
same one out oh 10 15 Marco Daria around

150
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,040
30 ish lines of code that were from my

151
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,350
older tutorial I basically converted

152
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,570
them to Swift 3 and instead of channel

153
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,220
foods my favorite foods like chicken

154
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,620
lemon mangoes bananas etcetera etcetera

155
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,990
I'm actually just putting in the Nano

156
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,420
phonetic alphabet and instead of taking

157
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,160
the entire command what the user just

158
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,930
said to the NS speech recognizer and

159
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,150
putting that onto a text field I'm

160
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,920
actually just taking the first letter of

161
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,170
those commands and putting them onto the

162
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,510
text view but if those commands aren't

163
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,580
actually you know the parts of the Nano

164
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,650
phonetic alphabet and they're open

165
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,510
they're just real commands like space or

166
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,700
get back to work or take a break what's

167
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,290
