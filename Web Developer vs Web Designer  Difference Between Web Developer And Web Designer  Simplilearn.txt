hey guys
welcome back to another video by simply
learn
in today's video we're going to be
learning all about the differences
between web designer and the web
developer
now i'm sure you must have heard of
these terms and you must also think that
they are almost the same
however they are completely different
now in this video i'll help you
understand the different job roles and
responsibilities and skills of a web
designer and then we'll compare the same
with that of a web developer
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make

so now let's begin by understanding who
exactly is a web designer
now a web designer is basically a
graphic artist who is responsible for
designing the layout usability and
visual appearance of a website
now he plans and designs the layout adds
elements to the website he also performs
digital retouching and image editing
other responsibility includes meeting
with clients to discuss requirements and
also designing products that are user
friendly appealing and visually
effective
first up is ui designer
now ui designers play an important role
in the design of a website they
prioritize interactions
more specifically speaking their role is
to enhance the usability of a website
and optimize it in a way that helps
encourage conversions
moving on we have ux designer
now ux designers help ensure that the
website is structured in a way that
encourages
visitors and delivers a positive
experience
their role is to create human centric
designs that are based on data driven
decisions
this involves conducting a lot of
research and testing to gather and
analyze data which is then used to
create final design choices
lastly we have visual designer now
visual designers as the title suggests
work with the layout and visual elements
of the website
this work combines the aspects of both
ux and ui design
the duties of a visual designer are
based on ensuring that the interface is
both aesthetically pleasing and easy to
use
now that you've learned about the
different types of web designers let's
look at the skill set required to become
a successful web designer
now this generally depends on the role
and the specialty however generally
speaking here are some of the important
skills
first up is html and css
then we have understanding the
principles of website design responsive
and interactive design understanding
user journey mapping
being updated with branding color theory
and typography and also being proficient
in design tools and software like adobe
now of course there are a few
non-technical skills that are important
for web designers they could be strong
communication skills and time management
skills
so this was all about web designer now
let's look at who exactly a web
developer
is now a web developer builds a website
and maintains them using different
programming languages they basically
take the web design and turn them into a
website
now they also have to collaborate with
clients stakeholders and designers to
understand the vision
in a nutshell they take the ideas and
concepts laid out by the designers and
turn them into real live and fully
functioning websites
so what exactly are the different types
of web developers
first you need to understand that a
website basically has both the front end
and the back end so the front end is
something that you see and use something
that the user interacts with and the
backend does all the nasty tasks now the
backend also involves fetching data from
the database
so depending on these we have front-end
developers that code the actual website
using css html and javascript
and then we have back-end developers
that code the database and server using
advanced programming languages such as
php c-sharp java ruby and sql
and we have a full stack developer
who does both the front end and the back
end for a website they have a solid
understanding of how these parts work
and function together in addition to
coding websites using css html and
javascript full stack developers also
set up and configure servers code
application programming interfaces query
databases and more so now that you know
the different types of web developers
now let's look at the different skill
set of a web developer
first up is html css and javascript now
as we discussed earlier these are
required to
create the front end of the application
html is used to format text titles
headings arrange graphics and so on css
is a style sheet that allows to alter
and style different web components be it
spacing font size etc and then
javascript is a powerful client-side
scripting language which is used for
enhancing the interaction of a user with
the web page
now javascript also offers a wide range
of frameworks and libraries we have
react angular view that help in creating
interactive and beautiful
end we also have jquery that helps with
back-end
we have version control systems like git
and github now git helps manage project
files it keeps track of the entire
history of things that the user is
working on
github is also a web-based service for
version control using git
now the user can look at other people's
code identify issues or errors and even
propose changes
lastly we have several back-end
frameworks like django there's python
there's node
there are different databases like mysql
postgresql and we have oracle so having
the knowledge of all of these make a
very good web developer so now that you
know who a web developer is and who a
web designer is
now let's go ahead and look at the
differences between the two job roles
now web development refers to building
user friendly websites based on client
specification while web design deals
with the aesthetics of the website
now a web developer transforms designs
into fully functional websites while a
web designer transforms ideas into
visually appealing designs
a web developer builds applications
using languages like html css and
javascript
while a web designer designs web
applications using tools like adobe
photoshop sketch and so on
it is crucial for a web developer to
have good coding skills
while a web designer should have good
graphic design skills
and lastly a web developer has to keep
themselves updated with the latest web
frameworks and libraries while a web
designer has to keep themselves updated
with the latest design trends and color
palettes
so then you must be wondering which one
to choose
well that depends if you're inclined
towards coding then i'd suggest a web
developer role and if you're inclined
towards creative aspects and aesthetics
of a website then i'd suggest the web
designer role now this isn't that easy
is it so i'd suggest one way to decide
between a career as a web developer or a
web designer is to think about the
skills and attributes required by each
position
now compare those to the skills you
currently have keep in mind that lacking
knowledge in one area isn't necessarily
a reason to rule it out if you're just
starting out there are plenty of
resources you can use to improve and
expand your skill set now there are
several web design and web development
books online courses and development
resources that will help you hone your
skills

website for courses and get a
certification on completion
they offer a postgraduate program in
full stack web development check out
their course and the overview if it
suits your requirements then go ahead
and opt for it they also offer a ui ux
design
expert masters program you can also
again check out the overview and if
that is what you're looking for then go
ahead and enroll
and so with that we come to the end of
this session if you have any doubts or
queries let us know in the comment
