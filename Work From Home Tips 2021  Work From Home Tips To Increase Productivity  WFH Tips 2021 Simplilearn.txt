the corona virus pandemic is making us
go through some difficult times having
little to no social interaction
facing massive losses of life and so
much more
now ironically the most difficult thing
we're facing is working from home now i
say ironic because working from home was
like a dream to most people
but now that we've experienced it for a
few weeks most of us can agree it's
anything but a dream on that note i'm
raul from simply learn and welcome to
the session and how to work from home
effectively today i'm going to give you
some work from home tips that can make
the process a whole lot simpler for you
firstly let's talk about how you can
pretend like you're still at work
number one you need to set up a morning
alarm and wake up as you usually do
now one of the hardest things to do once
you start working from home is to
maintain the schedule that you used to
follow
number two take a shower before getting
started with work
now this step has two advantages
one it seems you up with your normal
schedule and two it freshens you up
number three
get dressed like you're going to the
office
now this tip is more psychological
in a way you're tricking your mind into
thinking it's still following the usual
routine
if you think completely dressing up is
too much effort you could also just
dress up your top half
that way you can look presentable in the
mini zoom calls or hangout beats that
you're part of
number four don't start work immediately
now this one ties back to all the points
i mentioned earlier
without the routine it's possible that
over the span of the day you could lose
interest in work and end up not being
productive at all
number five
communicate expectations with everyone
at home
now most of us have families with us at
home
it's really important for them to know
that even though you're at home you're
working from home
number six put your phone in another
room or on silent mode now this one's
self-explanatory i don't have to explain
why this is really important
number seven and this one's probably the
most important
follow your work routine like nothing's
changed so on a normal day if you start
off by checking your email i would
suggest you do the same from home as
well
now let's talk about your workspace
you need to create a workspace for
yourself at home
a place where you can get your work done
without any distractions
number two in this workspace you need to
make sure only work is done and nothing
else
number three you'll also need to avoid
having food in the area
by physically going to another place to
have food you're subconsciously
cementing the thought that the workplace
is for work only
number four make sure the workspace is
comfortable
just make sure that you're not fed up
with the place after sitting there for
long periods of time
as you know all work and no play makes
jack a dull boy
so let's talk about taking a break
number one make sure you have at least a
10 minute break for yourself every two
hours
now it's very easy to get lost in work
and forget to give yourself some rest
remind yourself to take a break every
now and then to ensure that you're
refreshed
number two spend some time watching
stuff on youtube create songs videos of
kittens or puppies trailers anything
that catches your fancy
number three spend some time on social
media get in touch with friends through
video call and so on number four take
some time off for food eat breakfast or
lunch take a coffee or tea break as well
number five communicate with some real
people at home
it's important that you have some real
interaction with people during this
period of time
talk to your family check in on them get
the conversation going
and finally the end of day
you need to log off and stay logged off
now once you're done try to make sure
you switch off from work for the day
unless there's an emergency that is
and with that we've reached the end of
the session we hope you guys found this
