waiting for check out the link mentioned
in the description box below for more
details now let's move ahead and we'll
talk about the duties and
responsibilities of a full stack
developer the first one is front-end
development full stack developers create
user interfaces using languages like
HTML CSS and JavaScript making website
Grizzly appealing and user-friendly
across different devices they use
Frameworks like react angular or vue.js
to add interactive elements and work
closely with designers to bring design
to life back-end development full stack
developers build the server side of
applications using programming languages
such as python Java Ruby or node.js they
create apis to manage databases and
ensure data security they write
efficient codes to handle user requests
and perform tasks from behind the scenes
database management full stack
developers design databases and write
queries to store and retrieve data they
ensure data is structured effectively
and Implement measures to keep it safe
and accurate the optimized queries for
better performance and make sure the
data remains consistent full stack
developers set up development testing
and production environments automating
processes through CI CD pipelines they
monitor application performance
troubleshoot issues and ensure smooth
deployment they make sure the
application can handle different stages
of usage
collaboration and communication full
stack developers work in teams
collaborating with designers developers
and stakeholders they communicate
technical ideas to non-technical team
members and participate in code reviews
to maintain code quality and standards
problem solving and troubleshooting
full stack developers identify and fix
books errors and performance bottleneck
in their application they analyze user
feedback to make improvements and keep
the app running smoothly their problem
solving skills are crucial for
maintaining a high quality application
becoming a full stack developer requires
a diverse set of skills encompassing
both front-end and back-end Technologies
as well as a strong understanding of
software development principles with
best practices
some of the most sought after skills
required to become a full stack
developer include
front-end skills like HTML CSS
JavaScript and familiarity with popular
front-end libraries and Frameworks like
react angular or view.js for building
interactive user interfaces along with
knowledge of responsive design cross
browser compatibility are essential for
a full stack developer
back-end development skills Proficiency
in one or more backend programming
languages such as node.js python Ruby
Java c-sharp or PHP along with the
knowledge of database management is a
must familiarity with server-side
Frameworks like Express Django rubion
rails and not just that but full stack
developers should know about API
development and server deployment
devops and deployment familiarity with
continuous integration and continuous
deployment pipelines and tools to
automate testing and deployment
processes web security awareness of web
security best practices including
protection against common
vulnerabilities such as xss csrf SQL
injection and data breaches testing and
debugging experience with unit testing
integration testing and debugging
techniques to ensure code quality and
reliability Version Control proficiency
with Git and Version Control best
practices for collaborating with other
developers and tracking code changes
so what sets these two rules apart
the first is education and background
data scientists often come from
background in mathematics statistics or
computer science they are skilled at
exploring data and extracting actionable
insights to inform decision making in
contrast full stack developers typically
have degrees in computer science or
related fields they are responsible for
developing both the front-end and back
end of web applications ensuring their
functionality and user experience
skills and responsibilities data
scientists excel in data manipulation
statistical analysis and domain
knowledge they are experts at working
with tools like python are and data
visualization tools to uncover valuable
insights from data
full stack developers on the other hand
have a deep understanding of programming
languages like Java but they primarily
focus on web development they create
user interfaces Implement server side
logic and manage databases and work with
Frameworks like react or angular
applications
while data scientists build data
products such as recommender system
fraud detection algorithms and custom
Healthcare recommendations full stack
developers build a wide range of web
applications from voice assistance to
self-driving car interfaces
job demand and earnings data scientists
are high in demand given their ability
to extract valuable insights from data
in India a data scientist salary ranges
around 13 lakh rupees per annum while
the same data scientist earns 152 000 in
the United States
full stack developers are also in demand
as companies strive to develop web
applications in India the average salary
of a full stack developer goes around 11
lakh rupees per annum and the same web
developer earns 97 000 per annum in the
United States the last one is tools and
Technologies data scientists rely on
tools such as Apache Hadoop Apache spark
python R SAS SPSS and Tableau for data
analysis and visualization
full stack developers use a different
set of tools including HTML CSS
JavaScript node.js databases like MySQL
or mongodb and Frameworks like Express
or Django for web development
so in summary data scientist and full
stack developers have different
educational backgrounds skill sets and
job responsibilities while they both use
programming languages like python their
focus and roles within the tech industry
are distinct making them essential part
of the digital landscape choosing a
career as a data scientist or a full
stack developer is a decision that
ultimately depends on your interests and
skill set both professions offer a
promising future with a strong job
outlook and high salary potential it's
