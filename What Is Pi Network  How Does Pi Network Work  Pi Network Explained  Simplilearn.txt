imagine paying your pizza Bill using
Bitcoins sounds crazy right but you see
back in 2010 when Bitcoin was just a new
digital currency a person named leslo
did something that would go down in
history imagine this this guy llo
sitting at his computer craving some
pizza instead of grabbing his wallet he
had a wild idea he wanted to see what he
could do with this new thing called
Bitcoin so he said I'll pay for two
pizzas with Bitcoin at that time Bitcoin
wasn't worth that much but someone else
who like Bitcoin said sure and just like
that leslo got two hot pizzas all
because of his digital coins but get
this leslo didn't use just a few
Bitcoins no he actually used 10,000
Bitcoins for those pizzas now those same
Bitcoins would be worth over 800
Millions today that's some expensive
pizza alongside bitcoin's Journey

in The Cutting Edge field the link is in
the description box all right so let's
get start with the first topic all right
so let's first understand what is I
Network so imagine you're playing a game
on your phone and the more you play the
more coins you earn these coins can be
used to buy cool stuff within the game
or even trade with your friends who are
also playing that's kind of like how Pi
network works
you do simple task on your for and in
return you earn Pi coins then when pi
network is fully up and running you will
be able to use those coins for different
things just like in the game p network
created by Dr Nicholas and Dr shario in
2019 is a cryptocurrency project it
wants to let anyone mine and own
cryptocurrency using a phone app people
can mine p cryptocurrency on their
phones without causing much slowdown
this method is unlike regular mining
which needs a lot of computer power and
energy so you don't need a fancy and
power hungry mining machines but hold on
this app is like a new store that's
still being built so you can't actually
spend the pie coins yet the more people
who join the more valuable the pie coins
might become someday but it's not for
sure just like the new store might not
have many things to buy yet all right so
this was about the p network now let's
understand understand what makes Pi
different from others so Pi Network
stands out from others cryptocurrency in
few ways first is mobile mining you can
mine pie coins using your phone app
unlike most cryptocurrencies that
require strong computers it's like
finding gold nuggets with your phone
instead of a pickax the next is early
stage however p network is still in its
early stages of development think of it
as brand new gold mine that's still
being built you can't spend the p on you
mind yet because the system isn't fully
operational all right now the next is
focus on users so p network aims to be
more accessible by focusing on user
growth the idea is that the more people
join like more miners finding gold the
more valuable pie coins might become in
the future all right next is uncertainty
so there's uncertainty about the future
value of pie coins similar to how
there's no guarantee a new gold mine
will strike get rich additionally pie
coins is under investigation by some
authorities adding another layer of
caution so this was about how is pi
different from others now let's
understand how the pi network works so
pcoin works as the currency for the p
network a platform for digital money you
can mine P coins on your phone using the
p network app the creators who are from
Stanford made it so that users known as
Pioneers can mine P by tapping a button
on the app once every day this mining
process doesn't use much energy or your
phone's resources like other
cryptocurrencies users tap a lighting
button to start mining pip which
initiates a 24-hour countdown after the
countdown ends user must check in and
tap the button again to continue mining
unlike some cryptocurrency mining
processes Pi mining doesn't require
leaving the app open simply opening the
app and tapping the button every 24
hours is sufficient the hourly mining
rate VAR is based on when a user signs
up with earlier members earning at a
higher rate than the later ones users
can increase their mining rate by
inviting new users to join Pi or by
building a security Circle within the
app right now P coins doesn't have a set
value because it's not on any exchanges
but its availability is controlled by
Hing mining rewards the network is still
getting ready for a full launch and
users have to complete the certain
procedures to join it which helps keep
things legit and safe the goal of Pi
network is to create a strong system
where Pi coins have real uses in the
world all right this was about how Pi
network works now let's talk about the
pricing that is the pi Network price all
right as of the latest update the price
of Pi stands at a roughly $
4.58 with a 24hour trading volume of
approximately $ 143k Us in Indian rupees
it is the price translates to around 30
500 so the pi Network a digital currency
aiming for widespread adoption through
its unique mining approach on mobile
devices has seen fluctuations in its
value since its Inception like any
cryptocurrency its price is subject to
market demand and various factors
influencing investor sentiments and
adoption users continue to monitor its
value as the project evolves and gains
traction within the crypto Community all
right so this was about Pi Network price
now let's move on to the next topic
which is what is the future of pcoin so
the future of P coins looks promising as
its creators plan to roll out several
phases aiming for its Manet to become
fully operational once this happens they
intend for pcoin to be usable for buying
things from different stores not just
for investing or trading like some other
cryptocurrencies however for pi to
become widely accepted it needs to
transition to the main net and become
available for trading on cryptocurrency
exchanges this transition is crucial for
establishing pi as a real and valuable
cryptocurrency if Pi achieves these
Milestones it could gain legitimacy and
widespread adoption potentially becoming
a popular choice for everyday
transaction but since the project is
still in development its success will
depend on how well it progresses through
its planned phases and how the
cryptocurrency community responds to it
so in conclusion by network is
developing project with the goal of
making cryptocurrency accessible to
everyone through mobile mining but while
its future value and success depend on
achieving a fully functional mainnet and
tradability it presents a unique
approach to cryptocurrency by focusing
on usability and everyday transactions
however it's important to remember that
due to its current stage of development
p network remains a speculative
investment so all right guys with that
