1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,439
tutorial my name is tammy bakshi and

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,799
today i'm going to be showing you

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,520
how you can run minecraft natively on

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,720
apple silicon

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,160
and this is really exciting stuff a

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,840
little while ago i got my hands on one

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,320
of the new

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,320
m1 macbook airs overall it's a great

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,400
device and of course it's a brand new

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,600
instruction set

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,199
apple switching over from intel to their

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,960
own in-house processors

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,080
and of course this means that they're

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,920
using arm instead of the x86

16
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,960
architecture

17
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,199
now arm has traditionally been viewed as

18
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,359
you know the low power

19
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,320
sort of mobile chipset but really that's

20
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,760
not inherent to the instruction set

21
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,280
itself that's just where it's been used

22
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,880
mostly so far because well

23
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
intel and amd well they've been doing

24
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,760
desktop chips for for many years now

25
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,320
and so now apple's bringing over arm to

26
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,640
their computers to the max and so far

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,239
it's been amazing the transition is

28
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,280
going really well

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,719
and they have this software called

30
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,800
rosetta or is that as incredible what it

31
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,280
does

32
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
is it actually translates x86 software

33
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,120
right before you run it to the new arm

34
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,399
instruction set

35
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,160
just in case you want to run an old

36
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,920
intel application on your new apple

37
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,799
silicon mac

38
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,560
in case the developer hasn't recompiled

39
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,920
it yet now there are lots of different

40
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,360
great examples of different software

41
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
that runs amazing under rosetta

42
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,439
things like zoom and discord and

43
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,040
previously google chrome and these sorts

44
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,920
of things

45
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
work really well through rosetta because

46
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,799
they haven't yet been compiled for arm

47
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,400
now of course the hope is that within

48
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
the next couple of months to years

49
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,759
all these different applications that we

50
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,520
use will become universal applications

51
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,360
meaning they run both on intel and arm

52
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
they've been compiled for both

53
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,000
both uh instruction sets and then in the

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,119
further future

55
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,880
after a couple of years they will be

56
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
exclusively for

57
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,479
apple the arm architecture kind of like

58
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,439
the transition from power pc to intel

59
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,600
now there is one application though that

60
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
i really wanted to get running natively

61
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,079
using arm code and that is minecraft

62
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,439
now the reason for that is because

63
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,680
rosetta is great of course it has pretty

64
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,040
good performance

65
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
but remember though that because we're

66
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,079
translating instructions from one

67
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,360
instruction set to another

68
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
we're still fundamentally losing a

69
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,719
little bit of performance

70
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,399
usually rosetta apps will run at about

71
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,399
80 percent of the original

72
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,440
intel performance however with minecraft

73
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
i don't want to lose any performance

74
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,160
right i want to be

75
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,000
pushing this processor to its max i want

76
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,280
to be getting the most frame rate i

77
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,959
possibly can i don't want to be dropping

78
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,760
any frames

79
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,959
so how can i do that well the hope is

80
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,879
that eventually uh there will be

81
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,040
official builds of minecraft and all of

82
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
its dependencies

83
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,959
for apple silicon but until that happens

84
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,480
i don't just want to wait

85
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,080
i want to play the game and so what i

86
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
did is i took minecraft 1.16.4 and all

87
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,480
of its dependencies

88
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,720
and i recompiled them from scratch to

89
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,760
run natively

90
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
on apple silicon i think it's really

91
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
exciting stuff

92
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,040
now this was a little bit more involved

93
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
than just going into the dependencies

94
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
and compiling them

95
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,959
because there are a couple different

96
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,200
things that sort of work against me here

97
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,879
first of all we're transitioning from

98
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
mac os x or mac os 10

99
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
to mac os 11 this year so with the big

100
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
sur update it's no longer 10.x for your

101
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
version numbers for the operating

102
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,080
systems it's rather 11.x

103
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,200
this means that a lot of different

104
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,720
dependencies don't know where to look

105
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,200
for

106
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
for example sdks because they all

107
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
usually come with the 10 dot prefix not

108
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
the 11 dot prefix

109
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
similarly pretty much every single

110
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
dependency expects that if you're on mac

111
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
you've you gotta be using x86 because

112
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
all mac so far have been

113
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
intel and so i've gotta modify a lot of

114
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
different build environments to get it

115
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,959
all to work with all these new updates

116
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,159
that are here

117
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,959
but i did get it working in the end now

118
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,519
there's

119
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,040
there's another challenge on top of that

120
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,799
though and that is that while i can get

121
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
it running locally on my system you may

122
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,840
have seen the teaser video that i

123
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
released a little while ago

124
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,599
it's another challenge altogether to

125
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
actually distribute that running

126
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,480
application

127
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,760
because then what i've got to do as a

128
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
developer is i've got to do things like

129
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,159
code sign

130
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,239
and notarize in order to make it so that

131
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,000
the application that i build

132
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,799
actually runs on your computer now

133
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,319
before i get to why that's so much of a

134
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,120
challenge let me

135
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
take a little step back and talk a

136
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,920
little bit more about the minecraft

137
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,879
architecture

138
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,920
they're really two different

139
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
applications when you take a look at the

140
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,120
world of minecraft there's the launcher

141
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
and then there's the actual minecraft

142
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,959
game

143
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,040
minecraft itself is written in java and

144
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
it has a couple of dependencies written

145
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,879
in c which are native code

146
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,560
which i need to which it needs to call

147
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,840
in order to have high performance

148
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,359
graphics and things like this

149
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,440
but then the launcher well that's just

150
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,400
something you can download from the

151
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,840
minecraft official website

152
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,520
the launcher doesn't actually contain

153
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
the game the launcher is only

154
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,160
responsible for doing things like

155
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
allowing you to sign into the game

156
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,360
and then actually invoke the game java

157
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,800
in order to get it to run on your

158
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,360
computer now there are also different

159
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,880
open source launchers that exist

160
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
so for example there's multi-mc which is

161
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
a launcher that you can download the

162
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
code for from github

163
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,960
in case you don't want to use the

164
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,759
official minecraft one and you can use

165
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,240
that to actually you know log in and

166
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,000
edit your minecraft jar files and do

167
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
things like modding and things like this

168
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
and it's really useful in some cases but

169
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
the launcher in this specific

170
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
case for apple silicon is actually

171
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
another bit of overhead

172
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
because the launcher has its own

173
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,759
dependencies for example

174
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,639
multi-mc depends on a library called qt

175
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,400
and it uses qt for a bunch of different

176
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,919
things including actually showing

177
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,400
itself in a window on screen so what

178
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
i've done for you is i've gone ahead and

179
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
made it super super simple

180
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,479
to run minecraft on apple silicon it is

181
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,520
exclusive to version 1.16.4

182
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,440
for now but i may end up updating it in

183
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,280
the future if you have any requests for

184
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,880
specific versions feel free to leave it

185
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
down in the comment section below and i

186
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
can try to give you

187
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,039
uh versions that'll actually run on

188
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,360
apple silicon but the idea is

189
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,680
that all you got to do is run a couple

190
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,039
of bash scripts

191
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,720
through your terminal and you will get

192
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,240
minecraft running

193
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,919
natively on apple silicon it's actually

194
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,600
a lot easier than it sounds it's just

195
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
like two commands

196
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,479
so let me show you how you can go ahead

197
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,320
and do this let's take a look at my mac

198
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,080
all right so now as you can see on my

199
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
mac over here i've got

200
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
just a single folder on my desktop

201
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,199
called mc apple silicon

202
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,039
this is actually in the description you

203
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,039
can go ahead and download this exact

204
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,840
folder and within it you get a bunch of

205
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,080
different things that i ship with it

206
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
now included in these things are for

207
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,000
example a couple of python packages

208
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,280
a new launch.jar file um a minecraft

209
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,840
folder

210
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
and a bunch of python scripts that'll

211
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
actually help us uh in getting the

212
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,639
environment set up

213
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,639
now what do all these different files do

214
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,160
well what i had to do is sort of write

215
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,880
my own

216
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
custom mini launcher that doesn't use a

217
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
gui but rather uses a bunch of python

218
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
and bash scripts

219
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,639
in order to invoke the game directly now

220
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,759
this is of course

221
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
a lot more complicated than it might

222
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,440
sound because a lot of this is very

223
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,319
undocumented

224
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,000
and not a lot of people actually take

225
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,720
the time to document how exactly you can

226
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
call minecraft natively here

227
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,440
um or rather directly should i say

228
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
uh so what i had to do was sort of go

229
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,800
through the multi-mc source code and

230
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,479
extract a couple of components that i

231
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,680
thought were really useful

232
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
in specific new launch.jar is a

233
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
component of multi-mc that i've gone

234
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,479
ahead and taken

235
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,599
and used for my application so now let

236
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,720
me actually show you how you can get

237
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,840
minecraft running

238
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
all right so there are really three

239
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,680
steps the first thing you've got to do

240
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
is download the minecraft libraries

241
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,039
second thing you got to do is download

242
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,800
the minecraft assets the third thing you

243
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,280
got to do

244
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,880
is launch the game that's all there is

245
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
to it let's take a look

246
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,759
now the first thing you're going to do

247
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,120
is you're going to open up your terminal

248
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,160
and you're going to

249
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,599
cd into the directory that that you just

250
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
downloaded so you will have downloaded a

251
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,639
zip file from the download from the

252
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,319
description of the video

253
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,720
once you extract the zip file you should

254
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
have the mc apple silicon folder

255
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,199
now what you can do is you can simply

256
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
type cd into your terminal

257
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
and then take this folder and drag it

258
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
into your terminal like so

259
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,880
and when you cd into it you should now

260
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
be within this

261
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
this folder now to start off let's

262
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
actually go ahead and download some

263
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,039
libraries

264
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,440
so what you're going to do is go cd

265
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
libraries

266
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,479
and there we go you're on the libraries

267
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,479
folder now if you go into your finder

268
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,759
and you take a look at the libraries

269
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,240
folder

270
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,919
by default there should be two files in

271
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,800
it there's lwjglfat.jar

272
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,879
and that is what i've compiled right

273
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,199
that is a jar file containing references

274
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,639
to a bunch of classes

275
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,319
um or containing the source code really

276
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
for all the classes um

277
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,360
that minecraft is actually going to use

278
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,919
to interface with lwjgl

279
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,000
and then of course there's also a

280
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,360
download.sh file which will go ahead and

281
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,000
download

282
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
all the different um important

283
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,360
dependencies and libraries

284
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
from the official minecraft website and

285
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,919
so in order to actually run the script

286
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,280
and download the dependencies

287
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,720
simply go sh download.sh

288
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
and there we go it's going to start

289
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,959
downloading all these different

290
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,159
dependencies there are a couple

291
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
different libraries that it's going to

292
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,120
download it's also downloading the

293
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
official game

294
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
file um so just wait for that to go

295
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,120
ahead and complete

296
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,039
and right after that you should be good

297
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,560
to go ahead to the next step

298
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,040
downloading your assets all right once

299
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,800
your libraries are done downloading the

300
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
next step is to download the assets

301
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
so go ahead and run cd space dot dot

302
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
that's going to bring you back directory

303
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
and then once you do that simply run

304
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,839
python 3

305
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
download assets dot py now when you run

306
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
this what it's going to do is it's going

307
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,200
to download essentially

308
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
all the different resources that

309
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,959
minecraft uses in the game

310
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,279
now remember that minecraft of course

311
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,399
uses a bunch of different

312
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,399
well what they're called assets so for

313
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,000
example when you break a block it makes

314
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,640
a sound

315
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,480
or there's music in the background or

316
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,600
the textures for all the different

317
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,399
blocks

318
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
these are all called assets and so of

319
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
course i can't give you those assets

320
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
directly already in this package because

321
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,880
that's not legal

322
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,519
um that's minecraft property not mine

323
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,160
and so

324
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,279
i can't just give it to you

325
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,760
unfortunately however by running this

326
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,320
script

327
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
within just around two minutes it should

328
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
go ahead and download all the assets for

329
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,839
you as a matter of fact in the little

330
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,839
time that i've explained what assets are

331
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,760
um it's already done more than half of

332
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
the assets there's about 26 ish 100 of

333
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,560
them

334
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
um it's already you know close to being

335
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,240
done um

336
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,920
and then once it actually downloads this

337
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,760
you're actually pretty much ready to go

338
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
ahead and play the game

339
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,200
now there is one more dependency just to

340
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,240
sort of let you know in the in the

341
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,120
meanwhile

342
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,399
um and that is the azul zulu jdk

343
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,600
now you don't need to worry about what

344
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,360
that means in case you're not interested

345
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
but the basic idea is that of course

346
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,399
minecraft runs on java and therefore you

347
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,560
need a version of java that itself

348
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,279
runs natively on apple silicon otherwise

349
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,120
the game's not going to run natively

350
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,760
and so i actually do ship the azul zulu

351
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,640
jdk

352
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
with this package as well so you don't

353
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,360
need to download anything you don't need

354
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,160
to

355
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
you know get anything installed yourself

356
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,880
all you got to do is download the

357
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
package run three commands and you're

358
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
good to go

359
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
so it's almost done downloading the

360
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,519
assets once it's done let's go ahead and

361
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,640
continue

362
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,000
all right as you can see it's done

363
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
downloading now it doesn't just download

364
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,279
like one at a time since there's like 2

365
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,160
600 of them

366
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,839
it actually downloads about 20 at a time

367
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
it'll start 20 processes to actually

368
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
start downloading

369
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,560
and then spin them down once they're

370
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,640
done their individual chunks

371
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
but that's that's how it actually goes

372
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
ahead and downloads its dependencies

373
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040
now that we're done that you can go

374
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
ahead and actually launch the game

375
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
now the way that you would do this using

376
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
the script is actually pretty simple

377
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
so i've set up a little launcher that

378
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,399
you can actually invoke from the command

379
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,000
line so all you got to do is do

380
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,519
sh launch.sh and then here's the

381
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,560
interesting part

382
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,839
you give it your email address over here

383
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,519
and you give it your password over here

384
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,720
so this is the email address and the

385
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
password associated with your minecraft

386
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,959
account

387
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,800
now this email address and password you

388
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
can take a look at the script

389
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240
it goes nowhere except the official

390
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
mojang authentication servers

391
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
now this is not stored anywhere it's not

392
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
sent to any other server you can take a

393
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,959
look at the source code all it's doing

394
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,560
is it's sending it over to the mojang

395
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
authentication servers it's getting your

396
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
user udid which is unique identifier for

397
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,320
your username

398
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,320
and it's also going ahead and taking

399
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
your your access token which is what it

400
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,040
actually uh uses to authenticate against

401
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,399
of course mojang's authentication

402
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,079
service inside of the game

403
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,480
and it goes ahead and runs it for you

404
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,639
now you would actually go ahead and run

405
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,680
this command

406
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
however i want to show you actually

407
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,360
launching it without necessarily showing

408
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,839
you

409
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,760
my email address and password so what

410
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
i've done is i've put those into

411
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,560
environment variables so i just do this

412
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,839
but what you would do

413
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,000
is actually put your email address and

414
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,040
your password

415
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,519
enclosed in single quotes that's really

416
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,320
important

417
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
your email address and your password

418
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
enclosed in single quotes

419
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,959
so watch this i'm going to go ahead and

420
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,360
run and at first it's going to look like

421
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,480
nothing's happening

422
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,279
but right as you run that command there

423
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,519
we go minecraft is now running

424
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,639
natively on apple silicon all right you

425
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,360
can

426
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,959
maybe hear that so i'm going to go ahead

427
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,519
and turn down my volume there

428
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
but there we go minecraft is now running

429
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,639
natively on apple silicon

430
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,160
and that's all it took you right i've

431
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,279
gone ahead and compiled all the

432
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
dependencies that you need everything

433
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
and shipped them in that package and all

434
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
you've got to do now

435
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
is run those three commands to download

436
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,959
the things that i can't ship you

437
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,200
and you get minecraft running natively

438
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
now just to sort of show you that this

439
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,200
is

440
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,519
indeed working i can create a new world

441
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,639
for youtube

442
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
um you know create the new world it'll

443
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,200
generate it pretty quickly

444
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
after it generates i can go ahead and

445
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,399
actually you know move around in the

446
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,040
world and

447
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,519
uh right now just keep in mind uh that i

448
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,760
am recording a video like i'm recording

449
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,560
the screen as

450
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,720
as we play and so keep in mind that it

451
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
is going to be a little bit

452
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,079
laggier than if i weren't but it still

453
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,000
is absolutely incredible

454
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
performance so like if i go into video

455
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,839
settings um i'm gonna turn you know

456
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,920
render distance up to maybe like

457
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
um actually let's start off with 12 and

458
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,519
then i'll bump it up and show you what

459
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,720
the performance is like

460
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
i'll make it unlimited max frame rate

461
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
i'll bring the brightness to bright turn

462
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,839
off v-sync

463
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,360
maybe increase the gui scale a little

464
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
bit even though that shouldn't really

465
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,680
affect performance and let's just go

466
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,480
ahead and continue

467
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,079
yeah there we go it's super smooth we're

468
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,600
not dropping any frames

469
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
take a look at the fps counter we're

470
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,800
currently at 90 fps

471
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,199
ish on average i guess or maybe more

472
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,560
like 80 on average

473
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,680
um while i'm recording that is and uh

474
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,600
for a macbook air with no fans that's

475
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,399
currently being you know actively used

476
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,000
that is incredible performance my

477
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
macbook pro probably couldn't reach

478
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,440
a 16-inch macbook pro probably couldn't

479
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,720
reach that level of performance

480
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,760
and it's all thanks to the fact that

481
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,880
this is running natively on apple

482
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,079
silicon

483
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,240
now just in case you are curious if i go

484
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,000
ahead and go to video settings and bring

485
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,199
this up to like

486
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,320
32 chunks i expect performance to oh it

487
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,839
actually is still pretty great

488
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
um we dropped below 60 just now

489
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,959
drop below 50 even or we're at 40ish

490
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,800
but considering that we're bringing the

491
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,720
render distance up to 32 it's still

492
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
incredibly smooth this is

493
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,480
not only playable it's actually really

494
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,079
nice um

495
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,560
and so that's running minecraft natalie

496
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,440
on apple silicon

497
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,680
now of course if you have any questions

498
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,480
or any

499
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,720
um suggestions as to different versions

500
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,240
you want to see porta dapple silicon or

501
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,680
different things you want to see

502
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
done that maybe i haven't shown you how

503
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,880
to do yet feel free to leave that in the
