hey everyone welcome to the simply L
YouTube channel today we will be
exploring prom tuning and we'll be
commencing with a story in the heart of
techn a city powered by the Marvel of AI
lived the universal language model ULM
an AI capable of understanding and
generating text like human like fluency
while the ULM was a Cornerstone of
innovation serving varied purposes
across education Healthcare and Beyond
it faced challenges in meeting the
specific needs of its diverse users and
here ULM term is intended to illustrate
a conceptual all-encompassing language
model capable of understanding and
generating humanik text across various
applications and domains that is similar
to how large language models like llms
and GPT generative pre-trained
Transformers act so let's enter the
world of form tuning a technique Ain to
providing the ULM with a compass guiding
its vast intelligence to focus precisely
on the task at hand consider Mrs Eda a
teacher who leverage prom tuning to
direct the ULM in creating customized
educational materials on ancient
civilizations filtering out the noise
and horning in on relevance similarly
entrepreneur Leo used prom tuning to
refine his virtual assistance
recommendations for eco-friendly travel
ensuring accuracy and personalization
prom tuning transform the ULM from a
journalized into a specialist allowing
it to adapt its respons to fit the
unique demands of techn inhabitants
however the journey revealed a critical
balance from two narrow risk stiffling
the ulm's creativity while too broad a
scope led to diluted relevance through
the tale of techn we witnessed the
essence of prom tuning a testament to
human Ingenuity demonstrating our
capacity to shape AI to our nuanced
needs it's a story not just of
technological advancement but of
creating a harmonious dialogue between
humanity and artificial intelligence
illustrating the endless possibilities
when we Master the art of guiding AI
with precision and insight and before we
move on just a quick info for you guys

algorithm supervised and unsupervised
learning model training and optimization
and there's much more on the list so
what are you waiting for hurry up and
enroll now you can find the course Link
in the description box below and pin
comment so let's get started so let's
first understand what is prom tuning so
promp tuning is a method that enhances
the adaptability of large language
models for Noel task by fine-tuning a
minimal set of prom parameters this
technique involves appending a tailored
prompt before the input text directing
the llm to generate outputs aligned with
specific objectives its efficiency and
versatility have made it a local or
focal point in natural language
processing advancements so let's
understand prom tuning so prom tuning is
the practice of customizing llms for new
applications by adjusting a limited
subset of parameters known as prompts so
these prompts placed before the input
navigate the llm toward producing the
intended output and now we talk about
the advantages of prompt tuning so the
number one comes is efficiency so unlike
comprehensive model find tuning prompt
tuning modifies only a select few
parameters enabling quicker task
specific model adjustment and then comes
the versatility so this approach is
applicable across a spectrum of task
from text generation and Analysis in
natural language processing to image
recognition and automated coding
showcasing its adaptability to different
domains and then comes the
interpretability The modifiable Prompt
parameters allow for an examination of
how the models output generation is
influenced offering insights into the
models processing so this was about the
advantages of promp tuning Now we move
to the key challenges is promp tuning
and we will write some prompts and see
how we can promp tune the Chad jpd model
and we can generate the outputs we want
so let's move to CH jpt and here first
we'll draft or craft effective prompts
so crafting prompts that effectively
guide the model without being overly
complex is challenging So to avoid them
we will write some prompts and let's see
so we will take a fresh example for
crafting precise prompts so let's
consider a scenario and consider you are
part of a financial analysis firm
specializing in renewable energy sectors
like solar and wind power
you aim to leverage a language model for
extracting market trends investment
opportunities and Regulatory impacts
specific to these sectors however you
wish to exclude General energy Market
data or information about fossil fuels
and nonrenewable sources as well as omit
any direct mentions of rival firms or
their investment products so what
challenge we will face here is your
objective is to direct the AI model to
furnish targeted insights on renewable
energy sectors while filtering out
nonrelevant information and avoiding any
specific mentions of competitors and
their offerings so for example uh we can
write a prompt that give me all details
on renewable energy sectors including
solar and wind power but skip all info
on other energy types and ignore data
about companies like you could name the
companies like Ecco power Ventures and
their solar boost investment fund so
this is the in in effective prompt so
this prompt is ineffective because it's
overly detailed and instructs the model
on what to exclude in a way that could
be confusing potentially leading to an
over focus on the exclusions rather than
the desired content so we talk about the
optimized PR what you can write is
provide an analysis of current trends
investment opportunities and the impact
of regulations in the renewable energy
sectors specifically focusing on solar
and wind power excl General energy
market trends and specific investment
products so this refine prompt clearly
directs the model towards the needed
information that is market trends
opportunities and Regulatory impacts
within solar and wind energy without
cluttering the request with too many
exclusions it certainly implies the need
for exclusively by focusing on
specifically focusing which naturally
guides the AI to a unrelated sectors and
competitive products facc facilitating a
more focused and relevant output so now
let's see this example and this is the
inefficient prompt so we'll copy this
and paste it to chat jpt and let's see
what output it will provide to
us
so you could see that it has provided us
the output but this prompt is
ineffective because it's overly detailed
and instructs the model on what to
exclude in a way that could be confusing
now we'll write the correct prompt as
that is the optimized prompt what I've
told you that is provide an analysis of
current trends investment and
opportunities and the impact of
regulations in the renewable energy
sectors specifically focusing on solar
and wind power and exclude General
energy market trends and specific
investment products so this is the
optimized prompt and it will provide a
good result and a good
output so you could see that it has
started with the current trends
only
you could see the output and this is the
desired output what we need and the CH J
has provided with the optimized form Now
we move to the next challenge that is
avoiding overfitting so there's a risk
of the model becoming too specialized to
the training promps reducing its ability
to generalize so strategy for this broad
application is to prevent over
specialization prompts that should be
designed to be broad enough to Encompass
the range of related queries enhancing
the models versatility so for this also
we will draft and optimized and
unoptimized prompt so let's think of a
scenario that you are developing an
educational platform that uses a
language model to generate study
materials for high school biology
covering topics from cell biology to
ecology initially you fine tune the
model with prompts focused on very
specific areas like photosynthesis and
plants so initial prompt we can write is
explain the process of photosynthesis in
Plants focusing on chlorophylls rool and
light absorption so while the model
excels at generating detailed content on
photosynthesis it struggles when asked
about broader or slightly related topics
such as cellular respiration or plant
adoptions to different environments so
the issue we encounter here is when
students query how do plants adapt to
low light conditions so the model will
fail to provide comprehensive answers
because it's been too narrowly trained
on photosynthesis specifics so the
solution for this overfitting challenge
is to prevent overfitting and enhance
the model's ability to journalize Across
the broader subject of biology you
should utilize more inclusive prompts
that cover a range of topics within the
field so we have the Revis prompt here
that is provide an overview of plant
biology including key processes like
photosynthesis cellular respiration and
adaptions to environmental factors so
this broader approach encourages the
model to generate content that's
relevant across various biology topics
improving its utility for educational
purposes so this is the prompt and we'll
ask CH GB that is provide an overview of
the plant biology including key
processes like photosynthesis cellular
respiration and adaptions to
environmental conditions so this will
improve its utility for educational
purposes
so let's move to the next concern that
would be scalability concern and you
could see that it has provided the
desired output for the photosynthesis
and the environmental factors for plant
biology and as you we talk about the
scalability concern so as the training
data volume grows maintaining the
efficiency of prom tuning becomes more
challenging necessitating innovative
solutions to streamline the adaption
process so now we'll talk about its
prompt also so scalability that is
implementing AI for diverse customer
service inquiries so let's consider a
scenario your company aims to deploy an
AI chat board to handle customer service
inquiries across different departments
from technical support to billing and
account management initially the
chatboard is trained with specific
prompts for each category performing
well in small case test so what
challenge will you face with this prompt
is or with this scenario is as you scale
the chatboard to handle thousands of
inquiries daily a gross of wide range of
topics you find that the initial
approach of using highly specific
prompts for each category is
unsustainable so the chatboard struggles
to adapt the vast and varied nature of
customer queries and we'll face the
scaling issue also here that is the
specific prompts used during initial
training don't cover the breadth of
potential customer inquiries leading to
inadequate responses in unanticipated
scenarios so what strategy we can apply
for scalability is instead of relying on
narrow specific PRS for each inquiry
type your transition to using broader
more adaptable prompts that can guide
the AI in understanding and categorizing
a wide range of customer questions so we
can have an adapted prompt example and I
have one that is or we can write here
that would be identify the category of
the customers inquiry that could be
technical billing account management and
provide relevant assistance based on the
identified category so this strategy
allows the chatboard to more effectively
process a variety of inquiries by
understanding the context and
categorizing questions before generating
responses making it more scalable and
versatile in handling customer service
task so if we address prom tuning
challenges it is simplifying complex
proms that is Begin by clearly
identifying the core information or
action desired from the llm breaking
down multifaceted prompts into simpler
more focused request employ
straightforward language and eliminate
non- Essential Elements to clarify the
prompt and then we have utilizing soft
prompts So Soft prompts which are non
textual signals trained from examples
guide the llm without explicit worded
instructions so these are particularly
used for task with limited training data
or where interpretability is less
critical and then we have Innovative
optimization techniques so the
development of parameter efficient
fine-tuning techniques such as ptuning
optimizes the search for Effective proms
in a continuous space making it feasible
to tailor llms to specific task without
extensive retraining so this was all
about the prom tuning and there you have
