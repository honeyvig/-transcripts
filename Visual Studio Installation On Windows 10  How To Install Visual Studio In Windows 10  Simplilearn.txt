learning to code can be intimidating so
make it easier by yourself by using a
tool specifically designed for beginners
visual studio code is free coding editor
that allows users to get started quickly
with coding it allows you to code in any
programming languages without having to
switch editors
several languages are supported by
visual studio code that is c sharp
python java c plus plus javascript and
so many others
and on that note hey everyone i am
pepper khandelwal and i welcome you all
to yet another exciting video from
simply learn
in this session we will learn to install
visual studio code in the windows 10.
however before you begin
make sure you have subscribed to our
youtube channel and clicked on the bell
icon below so you never miss an update
from simplylands youtube channel
so let's get started
let's open up google and search vs code
vs code
we will pull up our first website
here we can choose which build we want
for our pc
you can decide it according to your
platform since i am using windows i will
be downloading windows installer
i will save it on desktop let it
download
let's open
we will run it
now it will ask for the permission
we will agree to the agreement
then next
we will leave the default
destination location as it is
then next next we will create a desktop
icon
we will add these board as well
and next
and then we will install it will take
some time to install
let's launch this visual studio code
it will take some time for it to open
we will start by going to extension
here we can use what languages we want
to code in
since i like to code in c sharp so i
will be using that so i will search for
c sharp
i will go for the first option and click
install
and we will also install
code runner
this helps in running the code much
faster
c sharp is still installing
we will set the color theme it's dark
let's close this
now to get started
we will create a folder
let's write it hello world
we'll open it and in the search bar we
will type in cmd
this will open command prompt in this
folder
now we will be using dotnet for the c
sharp codes
so you have to install.net cores sdk
you can check the version
like this
latest visual code studio only
dotnet framework 5 so you need to
install dotnet framework 5 since it is
the only version which is supported by
latest visual studio code
now
we will create a project
in this folder
so dotnet
new
console
this will create a project in this
folder
now since you can see in this folder
there are several files which have been
opened
now to open the visual core studio we
will type in code
and space period
and this will open visual core studio in
this project
we will open program.cs from this place
and here it is our basic program
let's change some text
world
i am
weber
let's run this code
there is a possibility for the first
time working you might have to build
some assets
so you will you may be prompted by this
so you will click yes
let's try and run it again
as you can see it is printing it
correctly
