1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,250
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,620
tutorial my name is Tammy Bakshi today

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,870
I'm joined by Mark Sturdivant once again

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,420
you may have seen another tutorial that

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,670
having mark just a little while ago and

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,290
now mark is joining us back so thank you

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,940
very much for joining mark sure of

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,690
course

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,500
glad to have you one so now mark today

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,930
we're going to be talking about powering

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,400
a vision we're gonna be talking about

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,670
this great new tool runs on power AI and

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,070
it allows us to do object detection and

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,619
age classification tasks in really easy

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,020
ways in fact more specifically it works

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,780
with images and videos as well they may

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,340
have already seen I do have a video on

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,579
power and vision on my channel already

19
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,590
however now there's a new version and

20
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,899
let's talk about power and vision and

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,300
what it can do now so Marvin do we know

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,800
the quite a few of your code patterns

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,390
and what you do or rolling around power

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,280
AI so would you like to quickly sort

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,860
walk us through why you like powering

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,780
our vision and what you've been doing

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,480
with it sure well I like power a vision

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,049
is well partly being built on power EIU

29
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,900
get the performance of platform you

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,060
don't think a whole lot about installing

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,770
all the pieces you need to deep learning

32
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,090
so I don't even think about that

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,189
whatever they scour a vision and then

34
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,080
what I really like is how easy it is use

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,070
mm-hm

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,009
you don't really have to think about you

37
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,630
know putting your images in different

38
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,090
folders and writing code to label them I

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,049
like to code but a bunch of that is it's

40
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,119
things you just don't need to do yeah so

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,740
it's very simple in there if you want to

42
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,750
classify images you're just gonna drop

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,439
them in there

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,420
and say what the classification is if

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,360
you want to do object detection you just

46
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,970
grab your images and you draw boxes and

47
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,430
press buttons and go and train and then

48
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,979
it's easy to test right there in the UI

49
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,600
as well you don't even need to write

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,950
code to test it and see how it's working

51
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,890
out so it's mostly about ease of use to

52
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,930
me yes that's great that's great in fact

53
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,430
there are lots of extra features as well

54
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,640
like I mean as you were men

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,770
the code and stuff really deep learning

56
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,320
the majority of it isn't about the code

57
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,270
it's really more about the technique

58
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,770
that you're putting behind that to do

59
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,330
that you're giving it the technique they

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,500
are pretentious that you're using with a

61
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,210
deep learning models and then of course

62
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,250
a big part of it is still the code and

63
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,080
the optimizations you put into it and

64
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,910
how exactly they're implementing it your

65
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,400
platforming but now we've talked about

66
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,350
sort of why you like power a vision

67
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,150
let's just quickly go over a few of the

68
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,740
things that allows us to do like for

69
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,440
example of course you can actually take

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,970
a look at the code patterns that we have

71
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,190
on power AI vision that Marcos developed

72
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,410
if you'd like to find out exactly how

73
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,030
you can use power and a vision in fact

74
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,560
in just a moment mark will be giving you

75
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,500
a demo of power a vision in action but

76
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,730
one more feature that I'm really a fan

77
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,489
of is the fact that for example let's

78
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,290
just say I'm trying to protect st.

79
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,330
Mark's demo cars and videos

80
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,420
now of course videos are facts they have

81
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,700
lots of images and they're basically all

82
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,040
put together so if you're trying to find

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,560
cars and all those images you're gonna

84
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,350
need to label a lot of cars and very

85
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,130
large changes from one image to the next

86
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,549
very little cars are moving fine Avenue

87
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,230
pixels each time because they have such

88
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,150
a high frame rate you don't want to keep

89
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,640
labeling those boxes over and over and

90
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,650
over again and that's where power and

91
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,690
vision comes in what it allows you to do

92
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,840
is create training corpus purposes and

93
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,600
then upload those over to a model so we

94
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,580
can make sure we get trained and once

95
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,989
you've got a trained model and you can

96
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,370
actually choose the kind of model you

97
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,709
can use early faster our CNN partner

98
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,630
recurrent convolutional neural network

99
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,700
you can use the you only look once the

100
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,310
yellow network the tiny version you can

101
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,540
use practically any kind of model you

102
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,660
want and from there you can use that

103
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,440
model to actually retrain or not retrain

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,110
to auto label data that's already in

105
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,090
your training set so let's just say

106
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,290
there's some data that you haven't

107
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,959
labeled yet like repetitive data and it

108
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,220
frames after something you've already

109
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,910
labeled

110
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,560
you can go ahead and have the service

111
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,930
automatically left for you using that

112
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,000
train model and then you as the domain

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,410
expert you know the person who's trying

114
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,010
to find

115
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,810
is human you're just going to go through

116
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,939
that and all you need to do is make sure

117
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,920
that the data is correct you need to

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,349
make sure that the data is exactly what

119
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,810
you want a model to predict once I once

120
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,930
I draw a bounding box around a car I

121
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,790
don't need to say and here's the card

122
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,020
here's the card here's the front here

123
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,539
here's the car it can figure that out

124
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:28,389
even on their models not complete you've

125
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,729
got enough to do that and they will also

126
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,590
say here's a similar car similar car

127
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,660
similar exactly you can save yourself a

128
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,430
lot of time with that that is growing

129
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,979
and also the augmentation thank you that

130
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,260
gives you a much bigger data set the

131
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,850
better accuracy oh yeah

132
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,550
so there again it would be a little bit

133
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,620
of code if you're doing this in a

134
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,270
notebook or something to say alright

135
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,060
let's take these images and also augment

136
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,610
them to expand my dataset so I can

137
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,770
recognize a car that's a little blurry

138
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,199
or a little fuzzier yeah their angle

139
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,270
well it can do that with a push of a

140
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,630
button

141
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,110
yeah so you've got the easy interface to

142
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,400
do some labeling spring

143
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,530
you've got the auto labeling so it says

144
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,330
oh I'll do some similar work for you

145
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,789
like that yeah but then you also press

146
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,830
that button it's just a button and you

147
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,360
say what kind of augmentation do you

148
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,860
want

149
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,530
sometimes upside down is it yeah

150
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,720
sometimes it's not exactly and if you're

151
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,919
trying to do faces you all flip it

152
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,169
upside down well I don't mind

153
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,849
recognizing faces when they're upside

154
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:28,410
down

155
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,400
still a face you would really you're

156
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,139
going to do say facial recognition in

157
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,669
some cases you might want to recognize

158
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,349
if it's upside down make a right side up

159
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,060
so you can do facial feature detection

160
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,260
but yeah that's all the specific

161
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,970
question if you want to recognize and

162
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,949
and come and press that elevator button

163
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,900
for somebody the up arrow and the down

164
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,099
arrow yeah they are not the same yeah so

165
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:48,849
certain things

166
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,310
yeah but augmentations so you get to

167
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,840
choose those things and it's the press

168
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,070
of a button and then your dataset

169
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,620
expands and your accuracy will be

170
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,990
greatly improved and to do that with

171
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,580
just a push of a button inside out it's

172
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,919
amazing so like for example if we've got

173
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,590
say some sort of data set and we want to

174
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,300
increase the amount of images and all

175
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,889
you really need to do is again as you

176
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:10,300
mentioned mark you just push a button

177
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,210
and it's gonna

178
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,100
by introducing new images by doing

179
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,840
simple things like cropping a little bit

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,110
maybe a little blur to it maybe flipping

181
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,970
around horizontally or vertically doing

182
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,289
all these sorts of little changes to

183
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,849
make lots of versions of all those

184
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,130
images to increase sort of the neural

185
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,650
networks grasp on what these things

186
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,360
actually are so it's actually able to

187
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,610
find out what it's looking for rather

188
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,410
than looking at other things in a scenic

189
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,630
trying to correlate them to what it's

190
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,000
looking for so instead of instead of

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,860
needing a bigger dataset to create a

192
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,900
great model yeah sometimes a small one

193
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,000
that's been tortured and tweaked a lot

194
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,419
of it

195
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,430
yeah is almost as good as having a bunch

196
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,169
of the exactly and even if you have a

197
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:50,610
really big data set it's always good to

198
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,710
augment it so that the neural network

199
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,509
knows what it's doing when it sees like

200
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:56,430
a flick image or anything so it's

201
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,680
invariant yeah you might have too much

202
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,479
of certain angles in language and focus

203
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,729
where the augmentation helps say you

204
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:07,409
know it doesn't really matter whether

205
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,180
it's a fuzzy picture or banks and the

206
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,020
faces faces a button yeah

207
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,370
all right so now that we've talked about

208
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,320
power animation what it allows you to do

209
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,280
of course there are lots of more

210
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,199
features like as I mentioned we just

211
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,520
went through object detection but

212
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,990
there's also image classification the

213
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,300
numerous other components like for

214
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,699
example image classification isn't just

215
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,710
image classification is a bit more to it

216
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,050
what you can do is just like you can

217
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,520
actually go through videos and images

218
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,490
and you can draw boxes around certain

219
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,960
objects and recognize what they are you

220
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,699
can also recognize in general what a

221
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,849
scene what image depends using of course

222
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:44,310
the image classification feature and the

223
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,590
best part is that not only is it going

224
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,719
to as output give you what classic

225
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,580
believes images are it's when you use

226
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,440
some more output like for example it

227
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,780
will use the grad cam algorithm in order

228
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,169
to provide a heat map of how exactly the

229
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,090
neural network activated to each pixel

230
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,310
in that image so for example let's just

231
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,990
say we're trying to detect birds and we

232
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,639
want to figure out is a neural network

233
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,500
looking at the bird to say it's a bird

234
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,539
or is it looking at the sticks and

235
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,210
branches to say it's a bird because you

236
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,430
know some cases a model might over fit

237
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,870
to saying hey if there's a branch

238
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,280
there's a bird because it's easier to

239
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,550
take a branch that work the great thing

240
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,130
deep learning is we didn't have to tell

241
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,590
it exactly specifically how to recognize

242
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,690
the bird gets it figured it out without

243
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,940
that it would be way too tedious to do

244
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,540
oh yeah but that leaves a lot of magic

245
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,860
if you don't know what it was thinking

246
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,600
maybe so it's great to see the map so

247
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,330
you start to I understand that might not

248
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,620
have been thinking the way you wanted it

249
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,450
to exactly sorry I'm gonna see those

250
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,980
activation asking me like here the knurl

251
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,480
number because maybe how we were

252
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,950
supposed to maybe a bit more

253
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,050
augmentation maybe a bit more date or

254
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,520
maybe a bit more accurate classification

255
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,430
this is all stuff that can go behind

256
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,980
your decision thing usually you might

257
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,540
not need to guide it that much you just

258
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,270
tell me I knew your dataset is not gonna

259
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,440
give you the results you will hey

260
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,300
exactly get a different data set things

261
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,190
I add to it do something different you

262
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,860
know absolutely absolutely and there are

263
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,960
lots of other features but now we talked

264
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,630
about power and vision on what I can do

265
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,250
I think it's time to take a look at a

266
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,350
demo of power a I envisioned in action

267
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,880
so mark will just show us a quick demo

268
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,850
sure I'll take a look at the counting

269
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,860
cars code pattern so we can look at that

270
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,360
and that's available online at

271
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,350
github.com slash IBM slash power AI

272
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,700
counting cars

273
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,820
and here we took a video a very simple

274
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,430
short video we wanted it to be easy to

275
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,400
go through for a developer and train but

276
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,800
then as the cars are coming we identify

277
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,300
them and track them and count them

278
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,430
that's burning it's a good example of

279
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,280
what you can do with power bi in a video

280
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,600
absolutely alright let's take a look at

281
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,790
power a vision here we are in power a

282
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,980
vision so what we're going to do is

283
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,990
first we'll create a data set just using

284
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,780
a single short video and then we'll

285
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,300
label some objects in that video so I'll

286
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,880
do manual labeling to label the cars on

287
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,400
a few frames of the video then when we

288
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,410
train and deploy that simple model but

289
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,380
I'm going to use that and use automatic

290
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,830
labeling to label cars in many more

291
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,160
frames

292
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,320
so I'll just create a dataset by giving

293
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,110
it a name and I will drag and drop my

294
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,780
video file to create a dataset based on

295
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,720
that one simple video file it's a very

296
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,220
similar process if you're creating a

297
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,380
data set from images again you can just

298
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,740
drag and drop and import files next I'll

299
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,930
manually label some cars so first I need

300
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,050
to add an object I'll just click on add

301
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,760
object and call it a car

302
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:01,600
now let's manually label some cars in

303
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,149
this video so I'll select the video and

304
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:06,639
going to label objects now you have a

305
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,100
nice editor first the first thing we

306
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,560
need to do is pull some frames out of

307
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,410
this video so that's very easy here we

308
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,689
just click on auto capture frames I'm

309
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,149
gonna select every five seconds it's

310
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,029
only a 30 second video so and I only

311
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,709
need a few frames right now so I'll use

312
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,519
auto capture and you'll notice it

313
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,860
selected the frames now I can go in and

314
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,060
label cars so I'll click on my label and

315
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,560
they'll just draw bounding boxes around

316
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,060
the cars now this part it's okay it's

317
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,500
kind of fun to do a little bit of manual

318
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,470
labeling get to draw boxes around some

319
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,680
cars so I'll do some of this remember

320
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,579
I'm trying to create my initial model so

321
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,759
6 frames about 30 cars should be a

322
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,620
decent model for what I'm trying to do

323
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,230
again this is a simple example but let's

324
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,939
speed this up a little bit and get into

325
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:03,670
Auto labeling so this part that I'm

326
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,290
fast-forwarding it really only took a

327
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,699
couple minutes but you don't need to

328
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:09,310
watch two minutes of me drawing boxes I

329
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,560
think you get the idea that manual

330
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,990
labeling for a larger data set would be

331
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,060
a bit of a problem you really want to

332
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,680
take advantage of that model that you

333
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,810
can create with a small amount of

334
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,000
labeling and then use that with

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,029
automatic labeling to label many more

336
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:31,360
frames with many more cars I labeled 27

337
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,350
cars in 6 frames so now I can click on

338
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,149
done editing and we're ready to train

339
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:39,660
our model

340
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,100
to train a model power a vision once

341
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,960
again gives us a button so we don't have

342
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,360
to do any coding so I just press the

343
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,610
train button I want to make sure that

344
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,350
the type of training says object

345
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,360
detection remember we're not just doing

346
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,750
car or not car we want to detect each

347
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,960
car in each image so then I click the

348
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,910
train button now trainings going to take

349
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,680
a little bit longer so again I'll speed

350
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,000
this part up and then we'll come back

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,800
and we'll do automatic labeling wow that

352
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,520
was fast

353
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,590
I guess it's mostly due to movie magic

354
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,140
but also we are running on power systems

355
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,490
and leveraging GPUs so now that I have

356
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,350
this model ready to go I'm going to

357
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,960
click on model details I'll deploy this

358
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,420
model so the model once it's deployed is

359
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,340
ready to use you can call it via REST

360
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,130
API and do object detection in your code

361
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,230
but what I wanted to show you first is

362
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,870
how we use this model with auto labeling

363
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,360
to increase the number of labelled cars

364
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,200
in frames in our video the models ready

365
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,150
so now let's go back to our cars data

366
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,520
set this is the original data set with

367
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,770
the video with the 27 cars that I

368
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,990
manually labeled now I'm going to go

369
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,090
back in and click on label objects I

370
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,910
have a cars model that I can use now so

371
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,700
I'll click on auto label this time let's

372
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,700
do every second and I'll choose my train

373
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,380
model which is already deployed called

374
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,500
cars model I click on auto label now

375
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,090
this time I'm not going to speed up the

376
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,220
video this is going to be much faster

377
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,630
than my manual attempt to label cars so

378
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,640
if you see it's already done it

379
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,940
extracted probably 30 frames and it

380
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,950
labeled the cars in all the frames

381
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,200
actually the ones that are green here

382
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,300
were auto labeling the ones that are

383
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,740
done in blue are the ones that I

384
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,050
manually labeled earlier so I can just

385
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,000
click through them you can see all the

386
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,470
labeling that it did for me it's

387
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,640
significantly increased our data set

388
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,990
from 6 frames to 30 from 27 cars to I

389
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,210
think one hundred and fifty now this is

390
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,550
a very simple example

391
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,860
but in your real-life use cases you

392
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,890
probably have more complicated datasets

393
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,290
you'll probably need more examples

394
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,570
better examples but this is a great one

395
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,029
for developers to try out and experiment

396
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,670
with so now let's train this again now

397
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,370
that I've got 150 cars and that's the

398
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,769
model I want to deploy that I will use

399
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,839
in my example application for my code

400
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,410
pattern I hope you try out the code

401
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,360
pattern if you do this is what you can

402
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,459
produce now this is the same camera

403
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,790
angle the same Road different cars we're

404
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,100
using Python and we're calling that

405
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,399
deployed model to locate cars and then

406
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,339
we're using OpenCV to annotate the video

407
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,829
and track them and count them it's

408
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:39,870
really a great code pattern it's fun to

409
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,320
try out and experiment with feel free to

410
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,029
take it and innovate
