foreign
have you ever wondered why some websites
are so interactive and responsive While
others feel static and outdated the
secret behind these modern websites is
Javascript a powerful programming
language that enables web developers to
create Dynamic and engaging user
experiences with JavaScript developers
can create everything from simple
animations to complex web applications
that rival traditional desktop software
JavaScript allows developers to add
interactive elements to web pages such
as drop down menus hover effects animate
sliders so this makes website feel more
Dynamic and engaging for users so if you
also want to create an interactive and
engaging website then JavaScript is the
right option and you are in the right
place well hello everyone and welcome to

note let's go through the agenda for
today's session we'll start this video
by understanding what JavaScript is
where we'll see how JavaScript came into
existence we'll also go through the
different reasons to learn JavaScript
following that we'll cover basic
JavaScript topics like the document
object model in JavaScript and vs code
installation we'll also create a hello
world program in JavaScript next up
we'll cover the fundamentals of
JavaScript including JavaScript
statements and comments variables in
JavaScript data types in JavaScript type
conversion and operators in JavaScript
we'll move on and cover topics like
control statement and Loops in
JavaScript both topics have the utmost
importance when it comes to any
programming language once we are done
with the basic topics we'll move ahead
and cover intermediate level JavaScript
topics like JavaScript functions strings
and arrays in JavaScript following that
we'll cover essential topics like
objects prototypal inheritance and many
more such Topics in JavaScript once we
are done with the primary and
intermediate level topics of JavaScript
will move on to cover some advanced
level topics like callback function
Arrow functions asyncavate in JavaScript
and regular expressions in JavaScript it
is rightly said that you can Master a
programming language just by programming
in it so we'll work on some specific
projects to end this video we'll create
the most famous Wordle game and a fully
functional website with the help of HTML
CSS and JavaScript so I hope you guys
are ready to learn something new so
without any further delay let's hand
over this session to our training
experts JavaScript was developed in the
year 1995 by a person named Brendan Ike
Brendan was working for Netscape
Communications while he developed
JavaScript in 10 days
there were a few changes in the name of
JavaScript initially it was mocha which
was later changed to livescript and then
it finally became JavaScript the start
of JavaScript wasn't that good as so
many developers who were using Java at
that time
they considered JavaScript as a language
for designers and non-engineers no one
ever knew that this small side scripting
language would have a great future today
more than 90 percent of the websites out
there they are using JavaScript somehow
many of you guys gets confused with Java
and JavaScript let me clear it for you
that both Java and JavaScript they are
different languages they have almost
nothing in common many people say that
JavaScript was named after Java as a
part of a marketing strategy to gain
wider acceptance and recognition in 1995
Java was a buzzword when JavaScript was
developed that's why they renamed
JavaScript after Java let's move on to
what is Javascript
have you guys ever been through a
website where you can see images that
slides automatically one such website is
Amazon the home page of Amazon where we
can see different types of ongoing sales
is an example of JavaScript
in Layman language JavaScript is a
lightweight scripting language used to
make web pages more interactive and more
likely earlier when JavaScript was
developed it was only a side scripting
language to do basic tasks like you can
add pop-ups in your web page or you can
make your web page more interactive
nothing more than that but now the whole
scenario has changed with the help of
JavaScript we can create applications as
well
if we talk about applications let's take
an example let's suppose we want to
create an app we can create it in
Android or in iOS but we have to learn
few different languages to create those
apps for Android we have to learn Java
and XML and Swift We have to learn for
iOS but with the help of JavaScript you
can create hybrid applications which can
work on any platform without any problem
Tech giants like Google PayPal Amazon
and YouTube they are using JavaScript
these days the evolution of JavaScript
in the past few years was unbelievable
suppose you want to create a single page
website every one of us is familiar with
Gmail let's suppose so Gmail is a single
page website which looks more like a
desktop software than a website so Gmail
is based on angular.js it is a popular
framework by Google which is free of
cost and it is totally based on
JavaScript now let's go over some of the
features of JavaScript these features
are actually why it is considered that
using JavaScript is advantages over
other languages
so let's start with some of these points
JavaScript is not a proper programming
language indeed it is a scripting
language
which works in the runtime environment
just like python so there are few other
languages like C plus plus and Java they
need a compiler to work but with
JavaScript you don't need a compiler
once you are done with the script it
will interpret and show you the output
in the browser directly next up is light
weighted JavaScript can provide
programming facility to some extent in
JavaScript you don't need to specify any
data type or return type which helps in
making development more quicker that's
why it is known as light weighted
JavaScript is both client-side as well
as server side technology client-side
technology runs on the user's computer
whereas the server side technology runs
on the web browser initially when
JavaScript was introduced it was
introduced as a client-side technology
but with the introduction of node.js in
2009 one can now work in the back end as
well
there is a way to validate the user's
Data before sending it to the web server
and we can do that with the help of
JavaScript the data will be checked for
correct form and value
all we have to do is start a loop give
it the condition
to check the data JavaScript is also
platform independent although originally
designed to work on browsers only but
now it is a platform independent
language which means once you are done
with the script you can use it on any
browser or platform without any problem
JavaScript is an object based scripting
language although many programmers do
not consider JavaScript as a true object
oriented programming language due to its
lack of class concept it does support
other features of object oriented
programming like it supports
encapsulation it supports polymorphism
and also it supports prototypal
inheritance the last but not the least
feature of JavaScript is case sensitive
so when it comes to keywords identifiers
names and functions JavaScript
differentiates between capital and
lowercase letters we have to keep this
in mind while programming
now I will quickly go over some of the
JavaScript applications where JavaScript
is currently being implemented first one
that comes to every person's mind is web
development it was also the main motive
behind developing JavaScript we have
Technologies like angular we have
node.js we can create beautiful web
pages also JavaScript can be used along
with HTML and CSS to make those static
looking web pages more engaging if we
talk about other applications of
JavaScript we can use it in app
development either mobile app or web app
like we took the example before that how
hybrid apps made with the help of
JavaScript can take over traditional
Android and iOS app one of the most
important and unique application of
JavaScript is in smart watches the
bangle.js is an open sourced Smartwatch
powered by JavaScript Gordon Williams
the man who is currently working on this
project it is said that this new open
sourced stack built around JavaScript
will replace the onboard firmware soon
the next application of JavaScript is
client-side validation as we discussed
earlier JavaScript is used to validate
the user data whether the user's input
is correct or Not by cross checking it
with the given condition like the user
wants to enter in your website and you
want it to be a user with at the rate
gmail.com in his email ID so you will
give that condition to JavaScript and it
will cross check it with the user's
information like when the user will try
to enter in your website it will check
that if at the rate gmail.com is there
or not in the user's email ID
so it can validate the user also apart
from that one more application of
JavaScript is game development
JavaScript can be used to make fully
fledged 2D or 3D games using different
libraries although most JavaScript game
development focuses on creating games
used in browsers only
till now we have an idea about what
JavaScript is its features and its
applications so if you want to learn
JavaScript you need to do some basic
things to make your learning experience
more smoother let's take a look at the
prerequisites to use JavaScript the
first one is the basic knowledge of HTML
and CSS to use JavaScript along with
HTML and CSS you first need to know how
HTML and CSS Works see HTML is used to
create the structure of a web page while
CSS is used to style that web page in
order to use these two with JavaScript
you need to have the basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS because if you want to
learn a new language first of all you
need to know why to use that technology
and to learn JavaScript more efficiently
you need to have the basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS it's better to have a web
browser that supports JavaScript like
Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox or you
can use Safari as well if you are using
a MacBook you will need an operating
system like Windows Linux or Mac
operating system to learn JavaScript a
computer with minimum 512 MB of ram
would be enough for you to start
learning JavaScript but I will recommend
you a computer with 1GB of Ram or 4GB of
RAM for a better experience you can use
any text editor you have notepad which
is free and is already available for
Windows if you don't want to use notepad
you can use other free softwares like
sublime or you can use visual code in
this particular course we will be using
visual code and I'll tell you how to
install visual code and what are the
features of visual code also suppose you
do not have any prior knowledge about
JavaScript don't worry about it we will
take you through the whole course and we
will ensure that you can understand
JavaScript
JavaScript is the only programming
language that a browser can understand
25 years ago when developers were
thinking about a language that a browser
can understand
there were a few languages that were
present in the Market at that time just
like Java still there were some problems
with these languages that these
languages need a server to work with the
browser JavaScript on the other hand can
work directly with the browser you write
the code in the editor the browser will
go through it it will interpret it and
then runs the program
the popularity of JavaScript increased
with time
being a language which can do so many
tasks whether it be designing a
website's front end or going through any
website's backend JavaScript can do
anything by the end of 2018 over 95
percent of the internet was powered by
JavaScript means almost every website
out there is using JavaScript in some
way or another
do you guys know about stack Overflow a
website for every programmer don't worry
you'll get to know about it once you
start with the programming part stack
Overflow states that JavaScript is the
most popular programming language used
by the developers let me quickly run you
through the reasons why one should learn
JavaScript and then we'll briefly
elaborate each of these reasons
JavaScript has the most powerful
Frameworks JavaScript is constantly
growing and is a well-paid job
JavaScript is beginner friendly and it
has the largest community
JavaScript provides wide range of usage
as well let's move on further and see
why each of these reason is important
JavaScript has the most powerful
Frameworks for every task a user wants
to do like for designing a single page
website like you want to design a
website like Gmail you can use
angular.js if you want to design UI
components or user interfaces for single
page application you have react.js you
want to develop a mobile or a desktop
application let's suppose you have
view.js for that as well basically you
can do anything with powerful JavaScript
Frameworks next up is constant truth one
of the main reasons behind one should
learn JavaScript JavaScript is one of
the fastest growing languages and stands
among the top 10 languages used by the
developers with so much increase in
Mobile Market mobile web development has
seen an immense rise in need of
interactivity
which is Possible only with the help of
JavaScript that's why JavaScript is
continuously growing and there is no way
that JavaScript will go down shortly
the developers working in JavaScript are
well paid across the world anyone who
wants to be a web designer or a web
developer needs to learn JavaScript it
is a must have skill for being a good
web developer we will discuss it in
JavaScript jobs section
JavaScript is an easy to learn language
compared to many other programming
languages like Java Python and PHP
JavaScript provides easy entry points to
the world of programming the best thing
about JavaScript is that it comes
pre-installed on almost every web
browser so you don't need to set up any
environment to start development in
JavaScript which means you can start
coding right away JavaScript has the
largest community among all the
programming languages out there
Community size does matter when it comes
to programming language because the
larger the community size is the more
help you would be likely to get
currently JavaScript has the biggest
stack Overflow Community it has
overtaken Java in terms of community
size and is still growing at a rapid
Pace wide range of usage in my opinion
one of the most important reasons why
one should learn JavaScript by knowing
JavaScript you can build an entire
website from its backend to the front
end apart from that you can also build a
full slash mobile application for the
backend you don't need to learn other
programming languages node.js is enough
with a bit of knowledge about database
and apis there is nothing you can't do
with JavaScript when it comes to website
development
let's move on and discuss few jobs you
can take up after learning JavaScript
and we'll also discuss their average
salaries in USA and in India
so the first one is a full stack
developer a full stack developer is one
of the highest paid jobs in web
development sector a full stack
developer is equally proficient in
client-side as well as server side
development a full stack developer earns
around 9 lakh per annum which is quite a
decent amount of money for a person
living in India but if you are a full
stack developer in US you can earn up to
hundred thousand dollars per annum which
is a huge amount
front-end developer is the one who deals
with the front end of any website or
application it's obvious that a
front-end developer will not earn as
much as a full stack developer but the
amount of money a front-end developer
earns in a year is decent a JavaScript
developer works on the front end and
sometimes backend also a JavaScript
developer may be responsible for the
whole website or just a few aspects or
pages of different websites they earn
quite well when it comes to salary a JS
developer in US earns around 75 000 per
annum which when converted to Indian
rupees sums around 55 lakhs approx which
is a huge amount
designing a UI is an interesting job as
it needs creativity along with skills
it's always fun to design interfaces to
attract users one should need a lot of
creativity for this job the amount of
money a UI ux designer earns in India is
around 7 lakh per annum but it can go up
as much as 20 lakh per annum depends
upon the skills possessed and creativity
of the designer so choose your career
wisely Dom stands for document object
model it is an API for HTML and XML
documents which helps JavaScript to
understand what is their return inside
the HTML document API stands for
application programming interface to
understand API better let's take an
example of a restaurant
imagine yourself in the restaurant you
are sitting at the table with the menu
the chef in the kitchen is also part of
the system the waiter here works as a
messenger between you and the chef
that's what API does it works as a
moderator between JavaScript and the
HTML document
Dom defines the whole HTML document in a
hierarchical form to make it
understandable for JavaScript so that
other JavaScript functions can work over
it it represents the entire document in
the form of object and nodes
whether it be elements or text or
anything stored in the document the
entire page content can be accessed or
manipulated by JavaScript
Dom is not used with JavaScript only
other languages like python also uses
dom dom was designed to be used
independently to begin with dom there is
nothing special you have to do different
browsers have different implementation
of the document object model every
browser uses Dom to make the web page of
the document accessible by JavaScript
let's move on and see what is document
object model with the help of an example
I believe you guys have the basic
knowledge of HTML and CSS a prerequisite
for this course let's start things off
with a basic HTML example here we have a
code that consists tags like HTML head
body heading tag Etc we have the HTML
tag here the opening HTML tag and the
closing HTML tag inside the HTML tag we
have the head tag which contains the
documents header part inside the head
tag there is a title tag that contains
the title of the web page then comes the
body tag which contains a heading tag
and two div tags with IDs as div 1 and
div 2. a div tag defines a particular
section in the HTML document the ID used
within the div tag it is an attribute
basically that has to be unique within
the document to make the element unique
from other elements next up we have a
paragraph tag with a class attribute
within it CSS and JavaScript uses
classes to select and access specific
elements don't worry guys if you have no
idea about it let us first see the
output of this code before going to the
document object model of this whole
document so guys this is the output of
the previous code we just came through
here we can see the title of the web
page as well as heading after it there
were two different div tags used in the
code here is the output of both the div
tags the question here is where are
those ID and class attributes seen in
the output the answer to this question
is there is nothing on this web page
that can show both of them we can use
them in our CSS file or through
JavaScript to specify the containers in
which they are used so we have concluded
how a normal document works and how the
browser interprets the HTML code but how
JavaScript uses this code is a bit
different that's where Dom comes into
play when the actual HTML document is
loaded in the browser another
representation of that document is
created known as document object model
here's the model you can see on your
screen
each of the tags used in HTML document
is correspondingly represented as object
in the Dom next starting from the HTML
tag and covering all the other tags like
head title body and few more the same
hierarchy as there was in the HTML
document goes with the document object
model also document to object model is
simply the same HTML document with
different representation the reason
behind this different representation is
that it's easy for JavaScript to
interpret this format
JavaScript can't understand tags but it
can understand these objects JavaScript
can easily manipulate these objects
using different functions which we will
see in future while working on these
function for example if you want to
access the text present inside the
heading tag you can do it by accessing
The Heading tag with JavaScript you can
also work on the style of this text with
the help of JavaScript as well
JavaScript uses the concept of nodes it
can access nodes of the document object
model there are many types of nodes
present in the Dom the basic three types
are element node attribute node and text
node the element node consists of all
the tags used in HTML document like the
head tag and the body tag the attribute
node contains the attributes used in
HTML document by now I hope you have
understood the concept of attributes so
JavaScript can access these attributes
as well and the user can work upon them
as per requirements the text here in the
HTML document that is simply it can also
be accessed with the help of JavaScript
it is the value of that particular
element before installing vs code let's
discuss a few things about what is an
IDE
so IDE stands for integrated development
environment it is a software application
basically it comprehends facilities to a
programmer for software development just
like photoshops makes it easier for us
to edit photos in the same way IDE makes
it easier for a programmer to write code
if you want to write code IDE will help
you write that and it will help you in
software development
there are a number of Ides present in
the market today we have Sublime we have
pycharm we have comodo we have notepad
and notepad plus plus as well but in
this particular course we will be using
visual studio code or vs code we can say
so let me run you through some of the
advantages that why we are using vs code
for this course so first of all vs code
is free to use as it is a open source
software so you can use it without any
cost
it supports multiple programming
languages there is nothing like you need
any web support or work on different
editors for different programming you
can use vs code for different languages
extensions are also one of the main
reasons behind using vs code see you
want to work on a programming language
it does not support all you have to do
is add an extension search for it and
you are good to go it will also not
affect the speed of the editor as it
runs as a different process it can also
detect code snippet whether it is
complete or not like you are using a
variable in your program and you forgot
to declare it vs code will do it for you
this property is known as intellisense
besides all these properties one main
key feature behind using vs code is it
is cross platform it is available for
Mac it is available for Linux and
windows as well I think there are enough
features we have discussed till now
there are many more features we will
discuss them while installing or while
working in vs code so for now let's move
on to the installation process the
installation process for vs code is
pretty simple just go to Google and
search for vs code
the next page which will open here you
can see that the first link available is
from their official website click on
that and you will go to their official
website here in the front you can see
the download this you can download the
stable version from here only or if you
want to download it for you according to
your PC's specifications you can click
on the download button present at the
top right corner of your screen here you
can see that vs code is available for
different platforms it is available for
Windows for Linux and for Mac as well
you can download it from here as well so
if you want to download this for Windows
you can click here
it will take you to another page and it
will start downloading vs once the
download completes open the setup file
from your downloads and it will take you
to the license agreement page you have
to agree with all the terms and
conditions you can go through the full
license but then it will take a lot of
time to go through all this once you
click on it this window will open where
you have to select the location you want
your vs code to locate any ID you
install the default location for all the
editors is the same you can click on
browse and select any other location if
you want but for now I'll be leaving it
as it is and I'll click on next now this
will open and you will click next from
here now it will ask you some questions
like if you want to create a desktop
icon or not select all of them and click
on next now click on install and it will
install vs code for you sit back and
relax it will take time so once you are
done with the installation process click
on finish and the visual studio code
will start automatically
so here we are you can see that we are
on the welcome page so let's start with
these icon present on the left side of
the editor this icon here is Explorer so
vs code works with the folders in your
system click on open folder
and just
search any folder or you can take any
folder of your choice so here in my PC
I'll go to work and I'll
take JavaScript as my folder I'll select
it and see it will open the folder and I
already have a few programs written over
here like this
and I have a few more programs like this
and this you can open any program from
that folder by using this Explorer
option you can open any program present
in that folder so basically what it does
any program you make in Visual Studio
code you will save it in this folder
only so it will be easy for you to open
any program anytime next up we have the
search button to find any keyword or
word present in your code whatever you
write here it will show you where it is
present in your code or in your document
so let's suppose I write here simply
learn C it will show you simply learn in
your main screen so you have a shortcut
key for this also press Ctrl F from your
keyboard and write anything here like
it's written simply linear press enter
and it will show you the result the
third option here is for Version Control
if you want to use any Version Control
like you want to use git vs code has
very good integration with Git the next
button here is for debug or it will run
your program once you are done with
writing the code click here and run and
debug just open it with chrome you have
a shortcut for this as well press F5
from your keyboard and it will do the
same the next button here is for
extensions here you can find many
extensions given by the vs code
Community they are free to use for now
we will use these three extensions the
first one is HTML CSS support just click
on the search button write HTML CSS
support the first option click on that
and install that extension similarly you
have to install few modes you have to
install JavaScript and type script
nightly
and you have to install live server in
the same way I'll tell you the use of
live server in the next video when we
will be writing our first hello world
program let me end this video by giving
you a shortcut let's create a new file
here click here create a new file
this
close it create a new file we will name
it as new DOT HTML
so it's new DOT HTML here one thing you
have to keep in mind while saving a file
make sure to save that file with DOT
HTML extension here we are about to
start writing our first program so just
write
exclamation mark and press enter
it will do this see it will write the
basic HTML code which you will need in
almost every program from now on so you
don't have to write this code every time
just do it this way and start writing
main program we are using vs code Studio
as a text editor to write the script
here we have already discussed the
benefits as well as the features of vs
code in the previous video so as I have
already mentioned you must have a web
browser with JavaScript enabled in it so
if you are using Google Chrome it's
quite easy to enable JavaScript let me
take you through open Google Chrome go
to settings and just write JavaScript in
the search option go to site settings
and scroll down you will find here
JavaScript allow it if it's not allowed
in my case it's already allowed so I'm
good to go once you have downloaded the
editor and you are done with the
environment setup and all you can start
writing the program so let's go to es
code we will open a new file here and
save it with the name let's open a new
file and we will save it with name
first dot HTML make sure to save your
file with DOT HTML extension as it will
make it easy for the computer to
understand that this particular file is
an HTML file so in the last video we
installed an extension named live server
let me tell you how to use it and what
are the benefits of using live server so
let's write a basic HTML program or just
press the exclamation key and press
enter here we are with the basic HTML
program
we have not done anything yet just edit
it a little bit we'll add a heading tag
and inside the heading tag we will write
a heading let's suppose we are writing
hello so now right click on your desktop
and click on open with live server
but this will do it will open your
program in the browser see it's the
basic thing so let me tell you what its
benefits are it will open your program
in the browser and whatever changes you
are making in the programs will be
directly shown in the browser the moment
you save them see just use Google Chrome
or whatever browser you are using and in
the vs code side by side we'll be using
it side by side now let's suppose we'll
change something here let's add a word
here hello
world and the moment we save it it will
be reflected in your browser as well so
that's the benefit of using live server
we'll be using it during our whole code
so now we are done with that let's start
with the program so here we are with a
basic HTML code which has only tags in
it it will print a thing if I remove
this heading tag let me remove and
movement I save it it will print nothing
so guys let me give you a brief
introduction to these tags these HTML
tags are used to render HTML files
properties so that the browser can
differentiate between simple text and
HTML tags you can use as many tags
according to your requirements in our
first program we will write a single
line statement over the browser for that
we will need the script tag don't worry
if you don't know much about script Tech
let me tell you briefly about this text
functionality it is used to embed a
client-side script language remember
guys script tag is used to embed
JavaScript with HTML this is where HTML
and JavaScript comes together
it may contain the scripting statements
or Point towards the external script
through the SRC attribute we will see
the srci attribute as well we'll use the
script tag inside the body tag or we can
use it wherever we want to use it like
it's not necessary to use it inside the
body tag only we can use it anywhere in
a program so let's start with this
first
let's start the scripted
we are done with it now this cryptag we
have to type an attribute
the attribute is the type is it's a text
file
we are done with our script tag to write
on the web page we use a very basic
command the document.write
it is a JavaScript method using which
you can print anything on the browser
let's see what document.write can do
let's write here something
document dot right
and any text you want to write inside it
let's suppose hello world
um welcome to
simply code
so guys we are done with this we have
written a text over here hello world
welcome to Simply code let's see what
will happen when we save it
press Ctrl s and the moment you save it
here it will be reflected on your
browser here you can see in our browser
it's written over here hello world
welcome to Simply code we can Define
JavaScript in an external file as well
let's see how we can do this how this
script tag will Point towards an
external Javascript file here what you
have to do you have written script just
before type use an attribute SRC and
give it the source of the file but till
now we don't have any Javascript file so
let's create a file burst name it as
crypt.js remember you have to save it
with DOT JS extension we are done with
it and we are good to go so here we will
write document
dot right
and any text you want to write here
hello world welcome to
simpler
we will save it the moment we will save
it here
there's something wrong I guess
okay we have not given the source code
of that JavaScript so here we have to
give the name of that file it was
script.js
moment we will save it see the text is
changed here initially it was Hello
World welcome to Simply code but now it
is Hello World welcome to Simply learn
this document.write is not interpreted
by the browser that's because this
script tag is now pointing towards an
external Javascript file anything you
will write inside this script tag will
not be considered now so we are done
with this script tag here we now have an
idea of how to embed JavaScript with
HTML and now let's see some of the
features of document.right so let's
suppose you are you have written this
text here let's erase it and see what
else it can do let's give it a task to
add two numbers let's suppose we have
given you nine plus three let's see if
it works see it will give you the output
directly here document dot right nine
plus three it will give you at the
output as 12. similarly you will do any
mathematical task any calculation you
want to do
let's suppose
7 multiply by
feet
see you can see here 12 56 Square let's
give it another one 9 multiply 5 minus
let's suppose 3 and save it 3 9 into 5
is 45 and if you minus 3 from 45 you'll
get 42 here is the answer for s42 56 is
for 7 into 8 7 multiplied by 8 and 12 is
for 9 plus 3. so with that we are done
with how to embed with a JavaScript with
HTML let's move on to another Concept in
JavaScript that is console.log console
log is a function in JavaScript that
works the same as document dot right but
it will not print anything in the
browser let's give it a try let's
clear this and suppose we write here
console Dot Lock
and give it a command
save it and see there is nothing printed
on the browser let's write something in
the body tag we'll use a heading tag and
write something here let's go again and
go to body tag we'll use a heading tag
here as well
and write something here let's suppose
we write complete code
save it see this is printed on the
browser to open your browsers console go
to browser right click here and go to
inspect element or you can use Control
Plus shift plus I which I normally do
here you can see the console option see
it has many options like elements
consoles sources Network and many more
but for now let's focus on Console here
you can see the text printed here so
what's the point of doing this whenever
we write a code we usually have many
variables and functions and a lot of
these kinds of things we don't always
know what to expect as the output maybe
we expect a particular result but we
might get something else one way of
debugging our code is that we can pass a
value to this function here only and we
can check the result of that value out
of the code let's add two numbers here
so if you don't understand it basically
what we are doing for now we are writing
a small piece of code like the program
is not that big but later on when we are
good with JavaScript and we'll use
JavaScript as a primary language the
size of the program will go longer and
longer so not every time you are
supposed to check the output of your
code by doing that only so if you are
using any variables or you are using any
functions you can check the output here
only if you have to use that variable in
that way or you have to change something
so you will get it here only that's the
use of console.log let's add two numbers
remove it a is equal to 5 and let these
value is 8 suppose okay we are done with
these two numbers and we will what we'll
do we will write
console.log
we have given it the command to add a
and b let's see if it works here
see the value of a plus b is 13. you can
see it here in console the value is 13
you can see it here so here we can see
that the output is 13 you can do any
complex calculation here in the console
it will give you the correct answer you
can see here script.js colon food the
number after the column is the line in
script.js here in our file we can see
that the console.log command is in line
number four so here it is written that
it is line number four here so if you
click on this
you can see the script.js opened in a
very small window and you can edit it
from here as well so this is not a
random line number to prove this let's
go on to our program and let's move this
to another line see now the console.log
is in line 11. save it and here you can
see this also changed to 11. so let's
make this more complex add another
variable C we'll add another variable
here let suppose we add C here we'll
give it a more complex equation let's
suppose let C equals to
the moment we save it it will give it
the answer oh no we are done with the
equation let's change it here also the
value of
C is
let's see if it works or not press Ctrl
s it's saved and the value of C is seven
let's see if this value is correct or
not the value of a was 5 5 into 3 is 15
15 plus 8 is 23 23 plus 4 is 27. 27 plus
a minus 25 value of a is 5 minus 25 is
minus 20 27 minus 20 the value of C is 7
say it's correct
check it yourself if you can do
something more interesting with this
console.log or you can do something more
interesting with document.right so
console log allows us to debug our code
and we can use it if we are not sure
about the output in a lengthy program
before moving forward to statements and
comments here to take a note while you
are performing any calculation let me
show you see if you are performing any
calculation let's copy it from here and
paste it here
so yeah if you want to perform and let's
add two numbers like we want to add 45
and
we'll add let's say five
we will save it and here you can see the
answer is 50 here right so if you want
to perform any calculation you have to
write as it is you can't write any
calculation within inverted comma or
double inverted comma let's try this if
you want to write any calculation within
a single inverted comma the moment you
save it it will print it as 45 plus 5.
what the browser will do the browser
will interpret it as text and print it
as it is so there will be no change so
keep that in mind take a note of it and
we are done with it right now so let's
move on to statements in JavaScript so
guys whenever you use any programming
language you give the computer
some instruction to perform any task or
activity that's common in all
programming languages present out there
like you are giving computers a few
instructions to do a particular task
these instruction you are giving to the
computer are known as statements you see
the code written over here this
document.write function is an
instructional statement given to the
computer to write something on the
browser like if you are writing hello
world inside this function it will print
it in the browser as it is and same for
addition subtraction multiplication and
whatever you are writing inside it it
will basically print it on browser like
let's suppose if we write here something
else
let's suppose we write here inside
double
inverted comma
welcome to Simply code we save it we are
basically giving it the instruction to
write this on the browser so what it
will do it will write it as it is on the
browser these are the instructions we
are giving to a machine to perform a
basic task or to perform a certain task
so if you are writing a whole program
for designing a website or for anything
you must be using more than one
statement you will use a lot of
statements in a single program
so all these statements are separated by
semicolons like here you can see after
every statement I have written a
semicolon it's necessary let me show you
an example see we'll remove this
statement and we'll copy this line and
paste it in the next line and write
something else here but we can say this
is our first program we will write like
suppose I have written it I'll give it
the semicolon here the moment I'll save
it see you can see here it's written
that hello world the first statement
statement is interpreted and written
over here then second it come to welcome
to Simply code see here you can see that
I have not written any semicolon but
it's still showing the output
so let me tell you something interesting
so if you remove the semicolon from any
of these statement here it will work
fine which means JavaScript will forgive
you for these small errors you do but
it's always a good practice to put a
semicolon after every statement because
while writing a whole program in future
you will use n number of statements and
let's see what happen if you try to
write more than one statement in a
single line without any semicolon let's
do this thing here write more than one
statement in a single line and I'll save
it see it won't work the moment I put a
semicolon here and save it it will work
fine
so that's why I am saying that it is a
good practice to use semicolon after
each statement
hope you guys are getting this let's
move on to comments so a comment is also
common for almost all programming
languages it's a line in programming
language which do not have any effect on
the output of the program see it stays
there in the code but it does not affect
the output by any means a comment may be
a multi-line comment or a single line
comment as well to write a single line
comment we just use double slash in
front of that statement like here if we
see the output is Hello World welcome to
Simply code this is our first program so
to make this first statement a comment
what we'll do we'll use two forward
slashes in front of it and it will
become a command so the moment we will
save it this hello world is disappeared
from the output
so this is how to use a single line
comment a comment won't affect your
program by any means let's move on to
multi-line comments to write a
multi-line comment you have to use
forward slash along with the asterisk
sign see if you want to make these two
line cells comments to end a comment we
will use asterisk sign with a forward
slash these two statements are comments
now so the moment you will save it
welcome to Simply code is also
disappeared from the output that's how
comment work they won't affect your
programs out but comments are very
useful in programming it's just a note
for the programmers to remember what
they did at that particular part of the
program suppose you write a program see
here the programs are not that large and
the coding is not that much but in
future when you write a program maybe
the program will be of more than 500
lines or more so suppose you write a
program with more than 500 lines and
come back 20 days later so at that time
you can't go through the whole code this
is where comments will help you in
JavaScript it will help you to remember
what you did at that particular part of
the program so variables are named
storage that a program can manipulate as
the name suggests a variable is a value
that can change according to conditions
variables refers to those memory blocks
inside the computer where we can store
information let's suppose you want to
store any value inside your computer so
variable will represent the location of
that value
in simple terms variables are cups with
stuff inside them and you can use that
stuff later again and again according to
the way you want to before the
introduction of es6 or ecmascript we can
say which is the updated version of
JavaScript variables were declared using
a single keyword only which is where
we'll try to declare a few variables
here we'll see how where keyword works
so let's comment this thing first
so let's declare a few variables let's
suppose where a equals to 15 we will
declare
where B and the value of B will be 6 we
will declare where
C and the value of C would be a plus b
so here we have defined three variables
a b and c a is a variable with value 15
stored inside it and so is B the value
of B is 6 but C is a variable that will
contain the value of a plus b let's try
to print this on browser
document dot right
and we will print the value of C
save it and here you can see the value
of C is 21.
that's the correct answer so similarly
you can also print a and b as well let's
print a and b as well here
what we will do we'll copy this line
we'll paste it for a n
we will update this here as well
so it won't create any confusion
so here you can see the value of C is 21
the value of a is 15 and the value of B
is 6. it shows the value of all the
three variables we declared but with the
introduction of es6 or ecmascript in
2015 two more ways were introduced to
declare a variable these are let end
const we shall discuss these two terms
in the later part of this session let me
show you how to declare a variable there
are a few things you have to keep in
mind while declaring a variable name
here we have seen we use three variables
a b and c that was an easy task to do
but giving a variable any name like
something other than a single alphabet
so you have to keep a few things in mind
while naming them start them with the
letter underscore or a dollar sign you
can't use any sign except underscore or
dollar so if you are giving a variable
name you can't use any other sign except
the underscore or the dollar sign you
can use these two signs only you can't
use any other side
you can't use a number in the starting
apart from that let's suppose you want
to give it a name as 9be you can't do
that in JavaScript JavaScript won't
allow you this if you try to save it it
will throw you an error invalid or
unexpected token so you can't do this in
JavaScript there is no limit for the
length of the variable name but you
can't use reserved keywords in a
variable name like let's try to create a
variable with name as class class is a
reserved keyword in JavaScript we'll
save it and see here throws an error
unexpected token plus but you can use a
class with capital c let's save it and
here it will work fine
why it works because JavaScript
variables are case sensitive if we try
to create a variable with same name
Let's see we try to create a variable
with where girl and the another variable
will be where girl with capital G this
time JavaScript will treat these two
variables differently these two are
different variables for JavaScript as
JavaScript is case sensitive when it
comes to variables
let's declare a few more variables let's
remove it we'll declare a few more
variable let's comment this part as well
it will declare a few more variables
suppose we declare a variable with
keyword where and we'll name this
variable as bikening where byte name
and press enter
if we leave this variable without
assigning it any value the by default
value will be undefined let's try to
print the value of this variable
right we will try to print the value of
byte name
save it here you can see the value it
shows is undefined so the by default
value of a variable if you do not assign
it any value will be undefined let's try
to give it a value let's suppose we
try to give bike name
we use equals to operator to assign it a
value cosine let's suppose we'll assign
it Yamaha
semicolon and press Ctrl s to save this
and here you can see the output as
Yamaha you can also assign a value to
the variable during declaration as we
have done in the previous examples here
we have assigned the variables value at
the time of Declaration only let's move
on to let end const so we will discuss
let and Cones but first we will compare
let with where let is also used to
declare a variable just like where is
used but there is a limitation to use
let
is not accessible outside the Block in
which it is declared
so we will use let here only let byte
name equals and we will change this
value as well we'll change it to Hero
let's say save it and here you can see
the output as hero but if we try to put
this code inside a block let's suppose
we put this code inside this block a
pair of curly braces and we will again
try to access document dot right we'll
try to access bike name again from here
from outside the block we try to access
this save it and here you can see buying
name is not defined it is an error in
line 18. so what's happening here
basically you can't access a let
variable outside the scope you can't
access it from here but it will work
with where if we try to replace let with
where and save it here you can see it
says hero and hero because first it will
interpret this method and then it will
interpret this as well in case of where
due to its limited scope light variables
are used when there is limited use only
like in for Loop or in while loop we
will learn these Loop in future let will
not allow you to redeclare any variable
let's understand this with an example
here's the code as well we have declared
where bike name and we'll remove this
and first we will try to do this with
where let's suppose where bike name
equals to TVs Control Plus s it says
hero and TVs so the variable name the
bike name is same in both cases here and
here as well these are same but with
where keyword you can do that let will
not allow you to do this if you use let
here in place of where we'll write
letter here as well and we will change
the value as well we will give it as
Kawasaki
and
let's suppose Suzuki here
save it
see bike name has already been declared
so that's what let won't allow you to do
you can repeat the same light variable
in different scope it won't create any
problem but it will not allow you to
redeclare any declared variable so let's
move on to const we use const when there
are values we don't want to change or
that will never change basically so the
keyword const is little misleading as it
defines a constant reference to a value
not the constant value we can't change
the Primitive value but we can change
the properties of constant objects let's
write another piece of code for const
keyword
so let's declare a variable const
X is equal to
5.
comma Y is equal to
7 let's say once
so here what we have done we declared a
variable X and a variable y with value
as 5 and 7 we declared this time with
const keyword and variable Z which is X
Plus y we printed Z on the browser and
it shows the value as 12 which is X Plus
y 7 plus 5 is equal to 12. now what we
will do const will let you do this but
if you try to update the value of x
let's suppose we try to update the value
of x as x equals to X
Plus 10.
we'll print X this time
document dot write
X let's save this it will throw an error
assignment to a constant variable in
line 24 so here you want to update the
value of x you can't do this with const
keyword you can do this with let and
where as well but you can't do this with
const also const won't allow you to
re-declare any variable just like let so
if you try to use const x again
equal to 10 save it
so here it says identifier X has already
been declared this thing you can do with
const the scope of const is the same as
lead it can be used within the block
where it is declared data types is an
essential Concept in every programming
language to work on any variable you
should know its type
it refers to the kind of data which is
being stored inside a variable the type
of variable is holding basically every
programming language has its own set of
data types which is unique in its own
way
we discussed earlier that JavaScript is
a lightweight scripting language because
we don't need to specify any data type
in JavaScript after all all the
variables in JavaScript are Loosely
packed or we can say JavaScript is a
dynamically typed scripting language we
shall discuss these properties later in
this video for now let me tell you about
different data types present in
JavaScript
so JavaScript data types are divided
into two categories primitive data types
and non-primitive data types primitive
data types are stored in stack whereas
non-primitive data types they are stored
in Heap I don't want you to go deep in
these two terms as if you are new to
programming so we'll leave it just keep
one thing in mind that primitive data
types are base data types whereas
non-primitive data types are objects or
we can say they are derived
primitive data types they are further
divided into five categories they are
divided as numbers strings Boolean
undefined and null non-primitive data
types or complex data types we can say
on the other hand they are divided into
two parts arrays and objects we'll have
separate videos on these topics for now
let's discuss primitive data types to
understand primitive data types much
better let's declare a few variable here
let's say we declare where X and give it
the value as 16. we'll declare where Y
and will give it value
hello world we'll declare one more let's
say where
flag
and the value will be true
here we can talk about those properties
of JavaScript which I mentioned earlier
JavaScript variables are Loosely packed
and JavaScript is dynamically typed
scripting language these two points
refer to the same thing here you can see
we have defined three variables X we
have defined variable X we have defined
variable Y and flag as well the values
for all three variables is different
from one another
see variable X is holding a value that
is 16 variable Y is holding a value
hello world which is a string so 16 is a
number hello world is a string and
variable flag is holding a value that
refers to a Boolean value in place of
true we can also write false here
so what's happening here here you can
see there is no data type if you are
coming from a C plus plus background or
a Java background this will be a little
bit weird for you guys because in C plus
plus and Java we used to do it like we
will define an integer let let me show
you
so how we will Define integer in C plus
plus or what will say we'll use int x
equals to 5 or something like that we
already had a data type for string as
well we have carrying C plus plus but
here in JavaScript we have no data type
we are only using the where keyword
that's what we call as Loosely typed
this line means that you don't have to
define the data type of the variable
what happens in JavaScript is whatever
the type of value you will pass to the
variable the data type will change
accordingly
so you don't need to worry about if you
are passing a number or if you are
passing in string
just relax just when you pass the value
to the variable it will be determined
automatically so these are the three
basic primitive data types present in
JavaScript which are number
Boolean value and string
so let's move on to the next one which
is undefined we'll Define a variable p
and we'll leave it as it is so this
variable P has an undefined data type it
means that any variable which is already
declared but has no value inside it it
has an undefined data type
I'll tell you a basic operator the type
of operator
we'll go through the operators in later
videos but just try to understand the
basic need and use it with me for now
this operator will help you know the
type of value a variable is holding see
let's use it here we have declared a
variable P we'll check the type of P so
to use this operator you have to use it
with document dot right now
so we will do document.write and we'll
use two brackets
and inside it will write
type of and whatever like we want to
know the type of variable X let's
suppose we'll write here x
semicolon save it and you can see here
it says number this means that this
variable has a value which is a number
similarly we will check for all the
variables present here we'll check for
every variable we'll check for y will
check for flag and we'll check for p as
well let's copy this and
paste it three time and let's change the
value here from X to Y in this line
and from X to flag here
and here we'll change it to p
so we have done it we'll save it and see
here it says number first variable y it
says it's a string because you know
hello world is a string it's a sequence
of character for variable flag it says
Boolean so it's defined as true or false
and for variable P it's written here
undefined with this we are left with
only one primitive data type the null
data type there's a difference between a
null value and an undefined value
undefined means lack of value whereas
null means the absence of any value
suppose you are using null as the value
for any variable the type of operator
will return this variable as an object
but if you are not giving any value to
this variable you are leaving it after
declaration the type of operator will
return undefined here's an example for
this C we'll declare one more variable
here we'll declare where num let's name
this variable num and we will give it
the value as null we will use
document.write type of and we will check
with the help of type of operator that
what type of value the variable num is
holding so let's give here num
we are good to go press Ctrl s and C
here it says it's an object
so a null value will always be shown as
an object type conversion as the name
suggests conversion of value from 1 to
another in the previous video we
declared a few variables we declared
numbers strengths and Boolean as well in
JavaScript you can change the data type
of any variable from one to another you
can change a number to a string or a
string to a number
let's see an example of type conversion
let's declare a variable here
let's suppose we are using a variable
let's say where num equals to and the
value will be 34 and will print it first
and we'll use type of operator to see
the data type of this variable
save it and see here it shows 34 and a
number I have already told you about the
use of console.log in this topic we'll
use console.log just for a change you
can use document.write as well there is
no problem with any method you are using
let's move ahead and we'll declare a few
more variables we'll declare a string
and a Boolean as well
let's suppose where Str equals to
hello
and we'll print it as well let's copy it
from here and paste it here
and we'll declare one more variable
let's say where Bool equals to
true
let's print these three variables first
see the output is pretty simple we can
see the value and data types as well see
34 is a number hello is a string and
true is a Boolean value
so let's convert this number to a string
first this number 34 this is a number
here right and we'll convert this number
to a string so how to do it that's
pretty simple all you have to do is
write a word here let's write here write
string with a capital s
and put 34 inside a bracket so here we
are done with it save it and see here
you can see 34 which was a number first
and now it's changed to a string
that's how you can change the data type
of any variable let's try to change a
Boolean value to a string now many of
you guys gets confused with Boolean so
Boolean is nothing
if something is true then set it to true
and if something is not true like if
it's false then set it to false see if
we talk about a real life example say if
you know how to drive create a variable
drive and set it to true and if you
don't know how to write set the variable
to false that's pretty simple that's
what Boolean is let's change a Boolean
variable to a string we have to follow
the same steps as we did for numbers
what we did we'll write here string and
put true inside brackets
we are done with it save it and check
the output here you can see the type
changed from Boolean to string like
string function we can also change a
string value to a number
so how to do it let's take a variable
let's say where
str1 will take let's say we are giving
it a numeric value let's say eight nine
six eight
and what we'll do we'll write a console
log and will print it basically
str1 and will right here as well
save it and here you can see 8968 is a
string so how to change this string to a
number that's also a simple task all you
have to do is write here number with
capital n and put this value inside
brackets save it and see here you can
see 8968 changed to a number it was a
Stringer layer and now it's a number so
if it's a number now let's update this
number and we will see if we are adding
something to 8968 the value will change
or not let's update str1 what we'll do
we'll write str1 equals to str1
plus let's add a number say
the output should be 8970 and the type
of operator will give the value as
number let's see what's the output now
save it and see here you can see the
output changed to 8970 but if you add an
alphabet or a character in the value
then the output will be different here
we'll copy this whole code
and we'll paste it here
we'll change the value of str1 equals to
str2 and we'll use an alphabet along
with this number let's suppose it's 8968
a so a is in alphabet and what we'll do
we'll comment this line and we'll go
here and change the value str1
here we are done with it save it here
you can see it says n a n it means that
it's not a number it won't treat this
string as a number because it consists
of both numeric value as well as
character
now let's try to convert a Boolean value
to a number in the case of a Boolean
variable the scenario is a bit different
let's try this
let's declare a variable let's say we
are using where
Bool 2. and the value will be true
what we'll do we'll print the value here
you can see true and the data type of
true is Boolean so let's try to change
this Boolean value to a number that's
pretty simple task write a number and
put true inside brackets
save it and here you can see it says one
in case of Boolean variable the value of
true is 1 and the value of false is 0.
remember this guys keep this thing in
mind if you are changing a Boolean
variable to a number then the value of
true will be changed to 1 and the value
of false will be changed to 0.
now let's have a look at percent and
parse float as well after which I'll
tell you one more interesting function
let's move on to past tense first here
I'll declare a variable let's suppose I
am declaring a variable let's say where
and we'll name this variable as number
the value will be a string let's suppose
it's 56.
we print it console.log
here you can see that the output is
showing 56 is a string so the data type
here is string because I have used here
single inverted comma so it will take 56
as a string
now let's suppose I want to parse this
as an integer or say I want to change it
to a number I can use percent as well
apart from number if you want to use
number that's fine but apart from number
if you want to use percent you can use
it
let's see what happens if you use
parsint use percent and put 56 inside a
bracket
save it and see here it changed the
string to a number 56 was a string
earlier right and now it's a number just
like percent we have parse float as well
parse float will do the same thing but
what if you are using a decimal number
here let's see if you are using 56.343
save it what percent will do it will
give you let's change 56 first let's
suppose we are using 65 now save it and
see percent will give you the value as
65 only it won't show you the value the
decimal value
but if you are using here number or pass
float it will give you the whole numeric
value let's see what happens if you use
number here
number and save it here you can see the
value is
65.343 like number if you are using here
pass float
let's use parse floatio
and we'll change the value here as well
let's suppose it's 72 point
five four three save it and see here it
will give you the whole numeric value of
the variable I hope this is clear for
you guys
now there is one more function you can
use in numbers which is dot 2 fixed so
this function has by default zero value
let's suppose I am using here we have to
use it here only let's see what happens
if I am using number Dot
to fixed
so inside bracket we are giving it a
value by default the value is 0 Let's
suppose we are giving it the value as 2.
now save it and what will happen it will
give you the value as 72.54 similarly if
you are using here some other number
let's suppose seven you can see we have
only three digits here after the decimal
we have three digits only that is five
four and three what happens if we run
this program now let's save it and see
it says five four three zero zero zero
zero so it will show you the value up to
seven decimal points it doesn't matter
if there are available numbers after
decimal point but it will show you the
value instead of 7 you can also give
here 30 let's save it and see it says
6366 and so on in any programming
language an operator is a symbol that
makes the computer understand that it
needs to do some specific tasks like if
we want to perform an addition between
two numbers let's say we want to perform
addition between four and five so guys
if you see the plus sign here this is
known as the operator and the two terms
which are four and five these two
numbers these are known as the operands
we have different operators for
different purposes like we have Plus for
addition we have minus for subtraction
we have star or asterisk we can say for
multiplication and many more other
operators as well so there are many more
operators present in almost every
programming language which is present
out there like it operators are present
in Java they are present in C plus plus
in C almost every programming language
out there has the concept of operators
it's essential for you to know how and
where to use any operator despite of the
language you are working on one needs to
understand which operators are available
right so in this particular video I'll
take you through the basic types of
operator present in JavaScript I'll let
you know the types and we'll learn about
how to use them and of course I'll take
you through the different categories of
operators present in JavaScript so in
JavaScript there are basically eight
categories into which operators are
divided which are we have arithmetic
operators we have assignment we have
string we have conditional we have
logical bitwise comparison and type of
operator we'll discuss the first three
types in this video that is we'll
discuss the arithmetic operators we will
discuss the assignment and the string
operators rest we'll talk about in the
following video
first up here is the arithmetic operator
hope you all are aware of the term
arithmetic right
so arithmetic operators perform
mathematical calculations like it
performs addition subtraction
multiplication and division as well
so here are the few operators you can
see on your screen the plus operator
minus asterisk division we have modulus
we have increment we have decrement so
these are the basic arithmetic operator
we'll see each of these operator with an
example so let's move on to the
programming part first so guys I want to
mention one more thing here I want all
of you to make a separate file for each
topic we'll be covering from now on like
for operators you will create a separate
file will create a separate one for
control statements and other topics
we'll cover in future from today so I
want you to create a separate file
because you know in future if you want
to access these topics it will be easy
for you to access those files instead if
you are using a single file for all the
topics it will be quite confusing so
let's start with the arithmetic
operators first let's take two variables
we are in the Javascript file let's take
two variables let's say where x equal
levels to 6
and we'll take another variable let's
say where y equals to
4.
now we'll perform some arithmetic
operations on these two variables we
have already seen the arithmetic
operators present like we have plus
minus we have increment decrement we
have multiplication division so we'll go
through all of these right so let's
start with it here we are done with our
basic three operators which is addition
subtraction and multiplication I have
commented the division because I have
something to tell you about the division
so let's check the output here first
let's save it and see the output is
addition 10 subtraction 2 and
multiplication 24. for addition it added
the two numbers it's six plus four
similarly for subtraction and
multiplication it is 6 minus 4 and it's
6 multiplied by 4.
for division I have left division
because I hope you guys know the
difference between Division and the
modulus operator let's try to use the
modulus operator along with the division
so what we'll do we'll comment these
three and let's remove it from here and
what we'll do we'll paste this here and
we'll use the modulus here so now let's
check the output what it says for
division and modulus C we have divided 6
by 4 division it says it's 1.5 6 divided
by 4 that is 1.5 it will show the
quotient here for modulus it's saying 2
because
in modulus it gives you the remainder
and in division it gives you the
quotient as the answer so keep this
thing in mind guys keep this in mind
always take a note of it so we are done
with division and modulus next up we
have the increment and The decrement
Operators let me show them to you real
quick so what we'll do we'll declare
another variable let's say where Z
equals to 5.
and we'll use the increment operator
here we'll use again document.write
and here we'll let's say we write
increment how to use increment operator
for increment operator you have to use
plus plus whatever variable you have
used so we'll use plus plus Z
and similarly we'll copy this
paste it here and here we'll use
minus minus 4 decrement
and change here as well
so let's see what happens let me give
some space in between them so that you
won't get confused
let's save it and check the output here
increment is it says 6 and decrement it
says five so you can see here the
functioning of decrement and increment
operator the increment operator will
increase the value of Z by 1 and the
decrement operator will do the opposite
of this it'll decrease the value by 1 so
we are done with the arithmetic
operators next up we have the assignment
operators
assignment operators are used to assign
values to different JavaScript variables
let's see the types first and then we'll
see how to use them so we have these
assignment operators here here we have
equals to plus equals to minus equals to
and we have multiplied equals 2 we have
divide equals to modulus equals to and a
few more so let's see each of them with
example maybe not each of them but we'll
try to cover almost every single
operator out there which is present in
your screen so let's move on and see
let's move on to the programming part so
here we are guys let's declare a few
variables let's say we are declaring a
variable a and we are giving it the
value as 10 suppose
and we'll declare another one let's say
where B and give it the value
5. so for assignment operators what
assignment operator mean we have used
here the equal to sign right we have
used a equals to 10. this means whatever
value present on the right side of the
operator like here it is 10 it will be
assigned to the variable a
I hope you guys are getting this keep
this in mind
so we have the value 10 and we are
assigning this value to the variable a
it says let's try to check the output of
a let's try to print a on the screen
okay
document
see here you can see that the value of a
it says 10. and similarly the value of B
is 5. so let's do one more thing we'll
assign the value of a to B how to do
this let's change the value here only
let's suppose we are using the value of
where a is 13. okay and the value of
where we will be providing as let's say
a
so now let's try to print the value of B
here we'll change
will print the value of B only let's
save it and see the output see it says
the value of B is 13. because we have
assigned B the value present at variable
a which is 13. that's why it is showing
the value of b as 13. this is what
assignment operator is
let's try other assignment operators as
well
let's take another variable
so let's say where even
equals to let's say 51.
so the next operator we will be using is
let's update the value of A1 first so
how to do this let's say A1 equals to no
it's a 1 plus equals to 9.
and we'll print the value
let's check the output now
see it says the value of A1 is 60 here
we have given that A1 plus equals to 9
see even plus equals to 9 is the same as
if you don't want to write here A1 plus
equals to 9 you can also write it as
even equals to A1
Plus 9. both of these lines are same
both these statements means the same
they are performing the same tasks so A1
equals to A1 Plus 9 is same as a 1 plus
equals to 9. that's what I want you to
understand with assignment operators
similarly if you want to perform a 1
minus equals to you can do it as well so
let's say A1 minus is equal to 5 and
we'll copy this line from here paste it
here again and save it now let's see the
output here what it says some of you
guys may get confused that here it shows
the value of 6 is 69 of A1 so in the
first statement when we try to print A1
here the initial value was 51 then this
statement was performed and the value
was updated to 60. then after that one
more statement this statement is also
performed and the value updated to 69
it's 51 plus 9 plus 9 and the value we
have here is 69. now what happens if we
are using the minus equals to operator
what it will do it will decrease the
value of A1 by 5. it means that A1
equals to A1 minus 5 the value of A1 is
69 and it will subtract 5 from 69 so
here it says the value of A1 is 64.
hope you guys are getting this so we
have so many operators we have so many
of them like let's try a few more
so we have multiply equals to we have
division equals to we have modulus
equals to so I'll write these and then
we'll see the output
so we are done with it let's check the
output here for A3 A4 and A5 you can see
for A3 we have used multiply equals to
for A4 we have used divide equals to and
for A5 we have used modulus equals to
let's check the output here
save it and see it says the value of
a350
it here we have taken a3s5 it's 10 into
5 because A3 equals to A3 into 5 so it's
10 into 5 it shows the value as 50.
similarly
here it says the value of A4 is 3.75
because we have used your food so
instead of 4 let's try to use 3 and save
it see here you can see it divides it
and gives you the quotient and the value
of A4 divided by 3 is 5.
so similarly for A5 it shows the value
of A5 is 6.
because we have used the modulus
operator here N20 divided by 7 we have
6s remainder
so I hope you guys are pretty clear with
assignment operators now next up we have
string operators the plus operator which
we used as the arithmetic operators
earlier right it also operates as a
string operator so we can use it to
concatenate two strings that mean we can
add two strings as well in JavaScript it
is possible with the help of string
operator similarly we have plus equals
to operator for Strings as well like we
have plus equal to for assignment it has
the same functioning for string as well
let's take the example for these two
operators let's move on to the
programming part so here you can see we
have two variables where str1 and where
str2 the value of where str1 is hello
and the value of where str2 is full so
what we'll do we will add str1 and str2
so let's check the output here save it
and see here you can see the output as
hello world but there is no space
between hello low end World keep this
point in mind guys so if you are adding
two strings just like this there will be
no space between the two strings so if
you want to add any space between these
two what you have to do you have to
mention it here separately
and this this is the syntax if you want
to add space between your strings so now
let's save it now and see here you can
see there is a space between hello and
world
so this is the use of plus operator in
strings so the next one we have plus
equals to let's take another string
let's take it as whereas tr3 and we'll
give it the value as
welcome
so what we'll do we'll use the plus
equal to operator here str3 plus equals
to
let's say
to
simply code
and
what we'll do we'll print the value of
str3 here
so save it now
so here you can see the value of str3 if
we remove this this line
let's see what happens now
and we'll give it a space here
save it now see here you can see it says
hello world for the first str1 plus str2
it says hello world for str3 it says
welcome to Simply code see here the
space is already given so it will show
this in the output but between welcome
and two if you want to add space you
have to do the same what you have done
for str1 and str2 so let's do it here as
well plus sign yes save it now and see
here you can see it says welcome to
Simply code with proper space now we are
left with conditional operators logical
operators we have bitwise operator and
we have comparison and finally we have
the type of operator
so these are the five operators we are
going to cover today
before we start with the operators let
us first discuss associativity
talking about associativity
it refers to the direction in which the
entire expression is evaluated for
example if you have any expression let's
say you have a plus b so the direction
in which this expression will be
evaluated either it will be from left to
right or from right to left so this is
known as associativity let's understand
it with the help of an example
so here you can see I have taken three
variables I have taken variable a and I
have assigned it value as 12. I have
taken variable B and the value assigned
to B is 8 and finally I have a variable
result which stores the value of a plus
b
lastly what I am doing is I'm printing
out the result variable inside the H1
tag here you can see I have used the H1
text
and I have used the plus operator to
concatenate the strings right I have
concatenated these two strings along
with the result along with the answer of
result so the plus operator here is
doing two different tasks right here you
can see it is performing the addition of
two numbers right and here you can see
it is used to concatenate two strings so
now let's talk about associativity
because I guess you guys are cleared
with string operator till now we have
discussed them in the previous video
right so let's talk about associativity
now so certain operators have right to
left associativity and certain operators
have left to right associativity
so when I say right to left
associativity in this case the value
present at the right side of the
operator see if you are using any
operator for example here you we have
used the assignment operator right we
have discussed the assignment operator
earlier so here you can see the value
present at the right hand side of the
operator will be assigned to the
variable which is present at the left
hand side of the operator so
it's going this way like first the
computer will check the for the value
present at the right it's going from
right towards the left this is what we
are known as right to left associativity
and assignment operators like equals to
this have right to left associativity
let's add here one more variable let's
say we are adding a variable variable C
and we are giving it the value as
5 and what we'll do we'll update result
as well let me first show you the output
of this particular program see the
output will be value of result is 20 and
high there high there is concatenated
with the string value of result is N20
is the actual answer the 20 is the value
of result so let's add one more variable
here let's say we are adding a variable
C and the value of C will be 5. but
we'll do now we will update result as
well here you can see I have done a plus
b plus c
so
save it and here you can see the value
updated to 25 the value of result is
updated right so the plus operator has
associativity from left to right till
now we have talked about right to left
as for assignment operators but for plus
operators the associativity is from left
to right it means it will first perform
a plus b
and then the value of C will be added to
that of a plus b first it will perform
12 plus 8 and then finally it will add 5
to that value so it will be 20 plus 5
and that's why the output here is 25.
know that JavaScript is a Loosely typed
programming language right which means
that we don't have to specify data types
every time like we are using if we are
using any data type we don't need to
specify it every time like let's do one
thing let's add a string here so what
we'll do we'll add a string light
suppose I'm adding hello
so practically the answer would be hello
Plus
25 or hello 25 it should be the answer
but let's check the output now save it
and here you can see the output is hello
one two eight five what happened here is
the sensitivity of the plus operator is
from left to right we know this so it
will start from the left and it will see
that okay the first thing to add is a
string so it will assume that everything
ahead of this will be a string that's
why we have the output as hello 12 8 and
5 so 12 8 and 5 all are acting as string
here
let me clear this one for you with a
little bit of modification now what
we'll do we'll remove this string from
here and we'll add it somewhere else
let's say we are adding it here
so
let's add one more variable to make it
more clear let's say we are using
variable D and the value will be 10.
and what we'll do we'll perform a plus b
before the string and then we'll perform
C plus d
right so here you can see when you save
it it says 20 hello 510 so when it
reached out the first variable it finds
out that the first variable is a number
so it added the first two numbers right
it added 12 and 8 the answer is 20 then
it came across this string hello and
then finally it assumed that everything
ahead of this will be a string so that's
the output 20 is the addition of a plus
b and then the string hello and finally
we have the value of c and d as string
so we have the value 5 and 10 not 15
right I hope you guys get this
so let's move on to conditional
operators the conditional operators
assign a value to a variable based on a
certain condition like it contains a
condition and you know for every
condition like there exists only two
possibilities either it can be true or
it can be false there is nothing else
you can do with a conditional operator
so it works the same as if else
statements which we'll cover in further
videos the only difference between if
else and conditional operators that it
takes less time or we can say its usage
is pretty easy
so here is the Syntax for conditional
operators so it seems pretty
straightforward right so here you can
see we have a variable name we have a
condition depending upon the condition
we have two values here's the example as
well see you can see we have a variable
voter next up we have a condition if age
is less than 18 so it will check for the
condition that if the value of age is
actually less than 18 let's suppose the
value of age is 15. so it will check if
15 is less than 18 it's true then it
will print 2m or if the value of H is
greater than 80 then it will print false
or you can say it will print old in a
few
so let's move on to the programming part
so here you can see I have taken a
variable X and the value assigned to X
is 30. what we'll do in variable y I
have given it a condition so it will
check for X which is 30 if 30 is greater
than or equals to 50.
so if it's true if 30 is actually
greater than 50 then it will print true
else it will print false so we'll check
the output once let's save it and see
here you can see the output as false so
if you update the value of axial let's
suppose we are updating the value of x
let's suppose it's
60 save it now and see the output has
changed to true because 60 is greater
than 50 right also if you want to write
a message here only you can do it write
it here as so we'll copy it from here
we'll copy document.write
and we'll paste it here
let's remove this document dot right and
we what we'll do we'll
use this bracket
you
and if any message you want to write
like you want to write value of
so
and now what we'll do we'll
save it
see it says value of true so or you can
write any other message here as well you
can write value of x is greater than or
you can write whatever
so if you want to update it like value
is and here we will update true
with
greater
and here we will use
smaller
save it now see here it says value is
greater value of x is greater than y
so that's all for conditional operators
also one more thing and conditional
operators has three different parts
right and that's why it is also known as
ternary operator three different parts
as in it has a condition like here it is
it's a it has a condition and it has two
values right it has true or false so
that's why it is also known as ternary
operator
next up we have the logical operators
so logical operators are used to
determine the logic between two
variables or values we can say we use
logical operators to check whether
multiple conditions are true or false
here on your screen you can see the
three different types of logical
operators present in JavaScript along
with the syntax and example
so the end or note are the three
operators present in JavaScript
the and operator here you can see it it
is holding two values right it it has X
less than 10 and y greater than one so
the end operator will return true only
if both the conditions are true like X
has to be less than 10 and Y has to be
greater than one so here you can see we
have taken x equals to 7 and Y equals to
4 so both the conditions are satisfying
here so that's why the output of the and
operator will be true for our operator
the case is a bit different so if any
one of these Square two conditions like
we have two conditions if any one of
these two is true then the output will
be true and if both are false then only
the output will be false
the not operator on the other hand will
check if x is equals to Y if the value X
is holding is equals to that of Y if the
value is not equal then it will return
true
I hope you are getting this that's a
little bit
confusing but if the value X and Y
holding if they are not equal then it
will return true if they are equal then
it will return false
right
we'll understand the programming concept
of logical operators in further videos
when we learn about control statements
we primarily use logical operators with
the if statement through which we'll
come across in the following video in
the next video we will go through the
control statements so we'll understand
the programming part of logical operator
there only
next up we have the comparison operators
so comparison operators are similar to
logical operators in some way
they are also used to check for true and
false as the name suggests we use
comparison operator to compare two
values or we can say to compare two
variables using different operators
so here you can see on your screen these
are the different types of comparison
operators present in JavaScript we have
equals to we have not equals to we have
equal value and data type we have
greater than less than and we have a few
more so I hope you guys must remember
from the previous video that a single
equals to operator is an assignment
operator so if we are using a single
equals to then it will be considered as
an assignment operator for comparison we
have to use double equal to keep this
thing in mind whenever you are using any
operator in JavaScript or especially the
equals to operator so if you want to
compare two values you have to use
double equals to because single equals 2
is used to assign values this is an
assignment operator so let's move on to
the programming part now
so guys here you can see I have taken a
variable X and the value assigned to X
is 10. this code seems a little bit
longer to you but that's a simple piece
of code like I have used almost every
comparison operator we came across in
the previous slide I have used each one
of them and I have used the document dot
right after every comparison operator to
put some spaces in between so that you
guys don't confuse between them
so let's check the output now see you as
you can see I have used the double
equals to the triple equals to I have
used X not equals to it so let's check
the output
save it and see here it says false false
true true false true false so for x
equals to equals to it it compared the
value 10 with 8. and 10 and 8 are not
equals to so the output will be false as
similar for 10 and we have used the
triple equals to operator which means
equal value and data type so both 10 and
8 have equal data type they both have
the same data type that is number but
the values are different so it will
print false
for X not equals to it it says 10 is not
equals to it yeah 10 is not equals to it
actually so it will print true similarly
for X not equals to equals to it it will
check that both the values are not equal
but the data types are equal right so it
will print true for this as well for X
greater than 8 yeah 10 is greater than 8
so it will print true similarly for it
will check for X smaller than 8 and it
will check for X greater than equals to
it and also for X less than equals to it
so by now you have understood how
comparison operators work so comparison
operators are the easiest to use in
programming
and that's all for comparison operators
let's move on to the next one we have
the next type of operator we have is the
type of operator you guys have an idea
about the type of operators right as we
have discussed it earlier in case you
haven't watched the previous videos let
me give you a brief introduction about
this type of operator
so the type of operator is used to
provide you with the type of whatever
value you put to the right of it like if
you are using any data type and you want
to know about the data type of a
particular variable let's say so you can
use the type of operator it will tell
you the actual data type of any variable
so in JavaScript as we have discussed
earlier in the video where we have
particularly discussed about the data
types so there are five different types
of primitive data types right we have
the numbers we have strings we have
Boolean we have null and undefined
so let's try to use type of operator
so here you can see I have used four
different variables which are I've used
variable X variable Y and variable flag
and variable P so the values are
different the x is holding 17 why is
holding header and flag has the value as
false and I have defined P but I have
not assigned it any value till now so
what I'll do I've used the type of
operator to find out the type of every
variable like here I have used it for X
for y for flag and for p
let's check the output now
save it and see it says number string
Boolean and undefined see here we have
given X the value as 17. so 17 is a
number then it says it is a number for
hey there it says it is a string for
false it says it is a Boolean value like
in Boolean value we have only two values
like false and true
so for variable P it says undefined
you know there is a difference between
undefined and null data types undefined
means lack of value whereas null means
this absence of value that there is no
value at all
so suppose you are using null as the
value for any variable right the type of
operator will return
object but if you are not giving any
value to any variable like you are using
the variable as it is like here we have
not given it any value so if you are
doing this the type of operator will
return undefined so let's take an
example of null as well let's declare
another variable let's say where ABC
and we'll give it the value as null
so and finally what we'll do we'll
use type of operator
save it and see here it says the type of
variable ABC is an object
so remember this thing guys
and now we are done with almost 7
operators we had and we are left with
one operator only
so let's move on to our last operator
which is the bitwise operator this
operator doesn't have that much of
practical usage in the real world they
are not definitely useless but this is
something like we are not going to use
on a daily basis so in computers if you
know the numbers are stored in binary
format bitwise operators work on 32-bit
numbers and we have decimal numbers like
we understand decimal numbers computer
works on binary numbers right so when
bitwise operators are used any operand
present in the operation
is first converted to a binary number
and then convert it back to a JavaScript
number
so
here you can see on your screen we have
four different bitwise operators we have
the and operator we have or we have node
and we have zor or we can say exclusive
or
the result and the answers are also here
it's pretty simple see we have used the
and operator before as well while we
were in logical operators but the syntax
was different and
here you can see we have a single
Ampersand sign to use bitwise and
operator
so here you can see
how the decimal number first changes to
a binary number suppose we have X as 5
here you can see access first changed to
a binary number this is the binary
equivalent of five and one is also
changed to a binary number and finally
the result whatever result we get it is
changed to a decimal number so that's
how bitwise operators work let's take an
example of bitwise operators
so here you can see I have taken two
variables I have taken variable X and
the value of variable X is 5 and another
variable is y and the value of y is 1
and then I have used all the four
bitwise operators like I have used X and
Y I have used X or Y I have used not X
and I have used the xor operator between
X and Y so let's check the output now
here you can see if we talk about the
output C here it says 1 5 minus 6 and 4
so for X and Y see
the value of x is 0 1 0 1 and for and
operators it will return 1 if both the
values are 1. if any one of the two
values are 0 then it will return 0. so
what it will return here it will return
0 for 0 0 for 1 0 it will also return 0.
similarly for 0 0 it will also return 0
and for 1 1 it will return one which is
the binary equivalent of one so the
answer here is 1.
for x or y it will return 1 if any one
of the two values are 1. see if both are
0 it will return 0. if any one of the
two values is 1 it will return 1.
it will return 0 again and finally it
has two ones so it will return one
and 0 1 0 1 is the binary equivalent of
five that's why the output here is 5.
for not operator it works a little bit
different it gives you the output which
is same as minus x minus 1 so minus x
minus 1 will be
see minus x minus 1 will be minus 5
minus 1 which is minus 6 so this is a
bit different here the not operator here
is a bit different
for xor operator or we can say exclusive
or it will return 4 why it will return 4
it will return 1 when any one of the two
values is one if both are one then also
it will return false it will return 1
only in one condition if any one of the
two values is 1 then only it will return
one that's why the output here
the output here will be 0 1 0 0 that's
why it's written as 4 which is the
binary equivalent of 0 1 0 0.
let's suppose we have a piece of code
that has n number of statements here
let's say we have this code and so the
conventional workflow will be it will
first execute the first statement then
second then third and so on till
statement n right
so this is the basic flow right from
statement one till statement n and it
will execute each statement in between
however in real world the scenario is
different like we don't write the code
in same menu every time
for example let's suppose you are in
line 5 and you want to print this line
10 times so what should you do you can
write this line 10 times or you can copy
paste it right okay let's forget about
10 times let's suppose you have to use
this code or we can say let's suppose
you have to print this statement 100
times doing this like copy pasting it
for 100 times or writing this statement
for 100 times that's useless and
unnecessary right so that's where
control statements comes into picture
we'll discuss them in a while let's
assume another situation this time you
want to make a choice based on certain
conditions you can use conditional
operators but then it has limitations
right to tackle this problem we have
control statements in JavaScript
so these are the very basic reasons why
we need control statements for
performing a certain activity like if we
want to perform a certain activity n
number of times or if you want to make a
certain decision making kind of
scenarios in your program that's where
we need control statements in JavaScript
in JavaScript we have two different
types of control statements depending
upon what action we are performing so we
have the conditional control statements
and we have the iterative or we can say
looping control statements
talking about conditional statements as
the name suggests we use conditional
statements when we have to make
decisions based on conditions when we
have two choices or when we can say when
we have two different conditions and we
want to make choices accordingly so
that's where we use conditional
statements we have two different types
of conditional statements the if else
statements and the switch case
talking about the iterative statements
as the name suggests if you want to
perform any action more than once or
maybe n number of times instead of
writing them again and again
we use Loops so Loops are basically
statements we use Loops to perform any
activity n number of times with specific
conditions
so in JavaScript we have four different
type of Loops we have for Loop while
loop do while loop and foreign Loop
so the for Loop while loop and do while
loop you might have heard about them
earlier because they are also present in
other programming languages but this
foreign Loop this is a new type of loop
present in JavaScript we use foreign
loop with objects we'll go through
objects in upcoming videos and of course
we'll be looking at each of these
control statements in detail
will have a particular video for each of
these topic
now let me introduce to you the break
and the continue statement
they are not the types of control
statements but they do assist in other
control statements the break is used to
exit a switch statement or Loop like
when used in a loop it breaks the loop
and continues executing the code after
it
and on the other hand the continue
statement breaks a single iteration when
used in a loop when we use continuous
statement in a loop it breaks a single
iteration and it breaks the iteration
only if the specified condition occurs
and then it will continue with the next
iteration in the loop
so the if else conditional statement is
used whenever we work with condition it
can be either a single condition or
maybe more than one condition or
multiple conditions we can work with
so let's try to write a basic program
with a single condition so then we'll
move on to multiple conditions using the
elsif statement so we'll create a new
file today so I hope you guys know the
importance of creating a separate file
for every topic you know it will be easy
for you to work to find out that
separate file later if you want to
revise that topic so here is the program
where we have taken a variable X and the
value of x is 10. so what we are doing
in this program is we are checking if
the value the variable X is holding that
is value 10. and if the value is less
than
10 or if the value is greater than 10 so
we have only two conditions either the
value can be less than 10 or the value
can be greater than 10 or equals to 10
is
so here in this program what we'll do
we'll first we'll update this value as 8
so the variable X is holding the value
8. so to check the output let's save it
and here you can see it says the value
of x is less than 10. of course the
value 8 is always less than 10 right so
for 8 that's fine it will say the value
is less than 10. and similarly if we do
the same for let's say 11 save it now
and see it says the value of x is
greater than 10. so that's quite simple
right but what if we are giving the
value as 10 we know 10 is equals to 10
so save it now and see here you can see
it says the value of x is greater than
10.
this is happening because what we did we
as we told The Interpreter to check the
value if the value of x is less than 10.
we didn't mention that if what to do if
the value is equals to 10 so it will
check for only X is less than 10 not for
equals to 10 or greater than 10 so here
what it is doing it is checking if the
value is less than 10 so that it says
okay let's print this statement if the
value is less than 10 or
if the value is not less than 10 or if
the value is equals 2 or greater than 10
it will print the value of x is greater
than 10. to avoid this type of
misunderstanding we use an elsif
statement so the concept of else if
statement is the same as if statement
but we are doing we are using multiple
conditions right we are giving it more
than one condition so how to use else if
it's quite easy
and the syntax is also similar to
the if statement the only difference is
that it contains an else before if so
it's an else if so what we are doing is
we are giving it a condition that else
if x equals to 10.
so now what it will do it will check for
two conditions that if the value X is
holding is less than 10 or equals to 10.
and what we will do will update it as
so let's check the output now
save and see here it says the value of x
is equals to time right so I hope you
guys are getting this the execution flow
for this program will be like it will
check for the first condition if x is
less than 10 if yes it will print the
value of x is less than 10 if no it will
move on the to the following condition
like under the else if statement it
finds a condition that if x is equals to
10 it will check for it if yes if x is
equals to 10 then it will print the
value of x is equals to 10.
or if not then otherwise it will move to
else statement and print the value of x
is greater than 10. we don't need to
specify any particular condition for
this you know because we have already
specified the two conditions that if x
is less than 10 or if x is equals to 10.
now we'll take a look at some basic
programs other than this one we'll take
a look at a few more basic programs
so here's the another program what we
are doing here is we are taking a
variable X and the value of x is 5. so
what we are doing is we are checking if
the number is an even number or an odd
number then you have to keep in mind is
the logic to find whether a number is
even or an odd number so to check uh
whether a number is even you what we do
we'll divide that number with two right
but basically we want is we want the
remainder as 0 when we use the modulus
operator so what we'll do here we have
written X mode 2 equals to equals to 0.
so if the reminder is 0
then the number will be an even number
because it is divisible by 2 else it
will be an odd number so that's quite
simple right let's save it and check the
output for 5 it says odd number yeah 5
is of course an odd number right so
that's for even and odd number
so here we have with another program
here it says we have a variable Y and
the value of y is
let's say
eight and
what we are doing here is we are
checking if a number is positive or
negative or zero so we have three
different conditions either number can
be positive or it can be a negative
number Any number greater than 0 is a
positive number right and any number
less than 0 is a negative number and the
third one is a number zero it's neither
positive non-negative so let's check for
the number eight save it and see here
you can see it is a positive number
let's see for
minus 2 save it now it says a negative
number for 0 it will say 0.
so these two programs are quite simple
guys right the conditions are pretty
simple we use modulus operator we used
greater than or less than sign and
that's quite easy to use right so let's
move on to the next program which is a
bit tricky than these two
so what we'll do in our next program is
we'll check if a number is positive or
negative and at the same time we'll
check for even an odd also if you are
giving any number as input like let's
suppose we are using 5 we'll check if
the number is positive or negative and
odd or even so we'll do this
simultaneously let's move on to this
program so there are two ways to check
whether the number is positive or
negative and odd or even
so the two methods we'll discuss them
one by one the first one here is to use
nested if and another one is when we use
logical operators along with the if else
if statement so this one here you can
see right in front of your screen is
the nested if method so here you can see
we have used the if statement we have
given one more condition inside another
if statement so first it will check
whether a number is positive or not for
X greater than 0 it will check if the
number X is greater than 0 then if yes
if it will find it that yes this number
is greater than 0 then it will move on
to the nested if and it will check for
odd or even
for odd number and even number it will
check if it finds that the number is
even it will print that the number is
positive and even
if the number is not even it will print
the number is positive and odd so here
you can see the difference but The
Interpreter is doing is it will check
for the number as positive and if the
number is positive then it will move on
to the nestative and check for the even
or odd so if it finds that the number is
even it will print positive and even
otherwise it will print positive and odd
then it will move on to the next
condition which is for negative number
if x is less than 0 then it will again
move to the nested if and it will check
for even and odd so if it finds that the
number is even it will print negative
and even otherwise it will print
negative and odd and the last condition
is for the number is 0. let's
try to find out the output of this and
what we'll do we'll update the value of
Xs 8. so save it now here it says the
positive and even so 8 is a positive
number and even as well let's update the
value of x is minus 5. save it now it
says negative and odd number minus 5 is
a negative odd number right so that's
how it will check for positive
or negative end odd or even so we are
doing both the things simultaneously in
a program we have an alternate method as
well here you can see on your screen we
have written a program and here we have
taken a variable X the functioning of
both the programs is same
both of these program will check for
positive or negative and odd or even
so here you can see I have taken a
variable X let's say the value of x is
7. it will check for X greater than 0
and x mod 2 is equals to equals to zero
so we have four different conditions
right a number is
greater than 0 that means a number is
positive and even a number is positive
and odd a number is negative and even a
number is negative and odd and the final
one is a number is zero okay we have
five conditions and we have to specify
these four conditions here so here we
you can see we are using the logical and
operator this means it will print this
statement let's suppose for this
statement it will print this only if
both the conditions are true right if
the number if the value X is holding is
both greater than 0 and an even number
so if you try to
find out the output now save it and see
here it says number is positive and out
so the number 7 is greater than zero
but the number 7 is not an even number
that's why this line is not there on the
browser it will print this line because
the number is positive and odd
the switch case is another conditional
control statement and just like the if
else control statement there is a
difference between the usage of if else
and switch case statement
now both if else and switch case works
with conditions and we have to choose
when to use which case over if else
switch case is generally preferred over
the if else when there is n number of
test cases present or we can say when we
are working with a lot of conditions
let's say we are working on a program
and you ask the user for an input
between 50 and 100 a numeric input
basically and in the output we have to
print the textual form of that number
suppose if the user enters 75 right the
output will be like this
so what we are doing we we are taking a
number from the user as an input and we
are printing the textual form of that
number right
so we can use the if else or we can say
else if control statement but the
program will be so lengthy and not so
clean
also switch case is much more efficient
than if else when it comes to execution
time like if we have n number of
conditions then using switch case is a
better option we'll get to know why in a
bit so let's move on to the programming
part and today
we'll write a program where we have to
find the month in a year by accepting
its number so we have 12 months in a
year for example if we enter 4 then the
output will be April and if we enter 8
then the output will be August because
August is the eighth month of the year
right so I hope you guys are clear with
the question of course we can do this
program with the help of if else
statement but we discussed earlier that
using IF else in such cases is not
efficient right we can use switch case
in this scenario so let's create a
variable first let's say we are creating
a variable where month and
you can give any value to this variable
from 1 to 12 you can provide it with any
initial value
so let's create a variable first let's
say we are creating a variable where
month and the value we are providing it
one as the hardcore initial value for
Simplicity again we are not taking the
input from the user or from the browser
to do so we have to first go through the
Dom manipulations and we'll go through
it in later videos so let's start with
the switch case now
the Syntax for switch case is quite
simple just write down
switch and
pass the variable month
so we have to check in this round
bracket for the variable month because
you know any value you are providing to
month the switch will check the program
accordingly so for now we have taken the
value as one for month we can take any
value like we can take 3 we can take 11
12 or any value other than 1 to 12 as
well so whatever value you are providing
to the variable you can provide the
variable to the switch statement right
so next up we have an open and curly
braces for the body of the switch case
we have to test for 12 different
conditions inside this
starting from 1 to 12 right so the
syntax goes like this you have to write
case
and then the value month variable might
hold like 1 2 3 and so on followed by a
colon right so we have to write the
value 1 and
a colon not a semicolon but a column
keep this thing in mind guys and below
that we are going to write what we want
when the value is 1 like what the output
we want when the value is 1 so we have
to write document
dot right
and
whatever you want as the output like for
one the first month is January so we are
writing here
January
and a semicolon
so if the value of the month is 1 you
will get the output as January save it
and here you can see the output is
January let me increase the font size
for this as well
so here you can see the output is
January right next we'll use a break
statement
if you guys remember we discussed the
break statement in the control
statements video right the break
statement is not actually a type of
control statement but it assists other
control statements or we can say it
helps us manage the control statements
right what this statement does is once
we are done with the output we get our
output right once we are done with case
1 we get our output as January this
break statement helps us to come out of
the switch keys so to understand this
much better let's write here one more
case so let's say we are writing a one
more case as
case 2
and the output will be document dot
right
the second month is February right
and February we can write so
we'll include one break here like we'll
come in the first case and include a
break statement so here's how you can
write a break statement how you can
include a break statement in your code
so let's check the output now so for now
it says January
so if we don't include this break
statement here when The Interpreter will
execute this code
and it will see that the case is 1 right
so it will print January
but it will print other statements as
well so for example if we remove this
break statement and save it now see you
can see here the output as January and
February January and February both are
getting printed on the output so we need
a break statement to break it here see
the value is 1 and if we include break
statement here the moment The
Interpreter finds the answer the correct
answer as January it will come out of
the switch keys
so I hope you guys are getting this
similarly we'll write all the cases for
all the months let me show you all the
cases
so here you can see on your screen that
we have 12 different cases from 1 to 12
one for each month depending on the
value the variable month is holding
right
the output will be June if the value is
6 and if we say 10 the output will be
October and so on and so forth
now the question here is what if we try
to write a random value for the variable
month
by random value we mean that if we try
to write any value other than these 12
values from 1 to 12 if if you leave
these values then if we try to write
another value like if we write here 13.
so what will be the output now let's
save it and see there is no output and
there might be no error for this as well
so if you try to check for an error go
to inspect and check out
see there's no error right so in that
case we have one more case like we have
default case
so let me show you how to include
default in your program what you have to
do is write here default
with a colon and right
document
dot right and let's suppose we are
writing here
wrong input
what is happening is let's try to run
this program first
press Ctrl s and now you can see it says
raw input for value 13.
so what is happening is the switch case
will first check these 12 cases and any
value other than 1 to 12 will get the
output as wrong input it works the same
as the else statement right analysis
statement we don't need to specify any
particular condition any condition other
than the if condition or else if
condition will fall inside the else
statement it's not necessary to add
default in your program it's just if you
want to give the user a prompt that he
has entered a wrong value
so you must include this default case in
your program every time while using
switch case because it's quite useful
you know okay so this is the complete
program to find out the month by
accepting its number
so if you try
six
and save it now it will say Zoom if you
try 10 save it it will say October if
we'll try 12 save it it will say
December so I hope this is clear to you
guys
next up let's discuss about switch case
in detail because the switch case in
JavaScript Works differently from other
languages like switch cases also present
in C plus plus and Java but in
JavaScript it is a bit different so in
JavaScript
switch case can accept numbers it can
accept strings and Boolean values as
well now let's have a look at how the
switch case works with string values
so here is an example of string values
you can see the value variable month is
holding is June right and you can see
use this string in case as well so here
you have to give the case as a string
value right because we are using switch
case statement with
strings so the first case here is when
the value will be June the output should
be sixth month and when the value is
July the output will be seventh month so
let's check it out if this is working or
not let's save this program and see for
June it says sixth month and similarly
we can check it for July as well let's
check for July
save it and see it says seventh month
you can include the default case as well
if you want to it will be similar like
there's no difference for default case
let me show you how
will write here wrong input
save it and now let's try to change the
value here let's say we are using May
save it and see it says wrong input what
if we use a numerical value here let's
try to use two save it now it says wrong
input for 2 as well it will give you the
output when the value is either June or
July
so any other value you try to use here
it will give the output as wrong input
in the same way it works for Boolean
values as well let me show you how it
works for Boolean values so what you
have to do instead of 2 you have to give
here a Boolean value let's suppose you
are writing here true and for true you
have to change the case as well for true
you have to change the output as let's
say for true it the output will be 1.
okay and similarly for false
the output should be 0.
and the output should be wrong input for
any other case right so save it now and
see here for true it says one the output
you can see here is one and if you try
to do the same for false like let's
write here false
and now try to check the output see here
it says 0.
you can see the output is correct right
now before jumping into the for Loop
let's first understand what exactly a
loop is right so a loop is basically a
programming construct that executes a
piece of code as long as a certain
condition is met
all right and there are two different
types of Loops we have entry control
loops and exit control groups now what
exactly are entry control loops now
these are the loops where the test
condition is checked before executing
the piece of code
for example you have the for Loop and
the while loop so in their case before
entering the loop the condition is
checked and only if the condition is met
it enters the loop and executes the code
all right when it comes to exit control
loops the test condition is checked
after the loop has been executed all
right so in this case the loop at least
gets executed I mean the code in the
loop gets executed at least once
so the example for this is a two while
loop all right with this basic knowledge
let's go ahead and learn about the
different loops
so the first Loop is the for Loop all
right
so what exactly is a for load this is
the basic logic and the flowchart in
front of you so what exactly happens is
that say for example you want to print
the word looping say 10 times right so
what you can do is you can start and you
can have a for Loop which goes from 0 to
9. and then you increase the number by
one every time you print the loop once
it's equal to 10 or even greater than 10
it ends the loop right so let me help
you understand this better with an
example so let's go to our editor that
is vs code
here I've created a folder called demo
underscore Loops within which I've
created a file called for Loops all
right
so now let's just write down our initial
code for HTML that is
HTML
and then I have a head tag
[Music]
within which I saved JavaScript
loops
all right
now I have a body tag
[Music]
within which I give a heading for
clearer understanding let me have a
heading say
JavaScript
[Music]
for loops
all right
let me just call it for Loop
now let's have the script tag
within which I'll have
a variable say X
and now we have the for Loops so we say
four
x equals
zero
X less than
5 X plus plus
in which I save console DOT log of x
so basically
what happens is
now you have the first variable which is
called the counter variable now this
keeps track of how many times the code
is being executed
right and next I lesson 5 is a condition
now the loop keeps executing as long as
the condition is met
and lastly the counter variable is
incremented and usually it's incremented
by one right so here we've done the same
thing
and inside the loop we print the value
of x
all right so let me save the file
and then execute it
all right it's printed JavaScript Loops
here let me just go back
okay my bad I missed out on the title
tag
so this has to be enclosed within the
title tag
so let me just
change it here
now let's save this
let's go back and just refresh the page
and that is it so whatever is in the
title tag basically appears here all
right so now since we're printing the
value of x on our console we'll have to
inspect our element so let's go here
and here let's check on console
and here you can see all the values have
been printed from 0 to 4. all right now
this is a simple for Loop
so next up is a while loop
now the logic is similar to that of a
for Loop first the condition is checked
and if the condition holds true then the
code is executed and if it is false it
terminates all right so moving on let's
understand the general syntax
so here first you have the variable
whose value keeps changing
and then you have the ending condition
which is basically the maximum value a
variable can reach all right so let's go
back to our vs code
and here for better understanding let me
just change this to JavaScript while
loop
all right let's just
delete this and here let's initialize
the value of x to 1.
and now I say while X
less than or equal to 5
within races I
say console.log
dot X
and then I increment the value of x
all right so let me save this
and let's execute the file
all right so it says JavaScript while
loop and let's inspect
and here in our console it displays the
values of x
all right so according to the logic
X is initially initialized to 1.
and the value gets executed once it
enters the while loop all right it's
incremented and then checked every time
until the value reaches
6 right and then it breaks from the loop
since the value does not hold true and
then it terminates
so this is a logic behind the while loop
next up is the two while loop
now here
as you can see first the code is
executed and then the condition is
checked if the condition is true then
the code execution continues and if it
falls it's terminated all right so this
is an exit control Loop also in an exit
control Loop the code is executed at
least once so let's go back to our vs
code
and here
let me just delete this
now let's initialize X to say
15 all right
and now I use the do keyword within
which I write the code
so first I'm going to print the value of
x
console DOT log of x
and then I increase my value
and here I mentioned my test condition
which is while X
less than say 10.
all right so according to the logic
initially the value is X and once it
enters the loop here
it should print the value of x which is
15. all right and then it increments the
value but once it comes out of the loop
it checks for the condition
here the condition says less than 10 but
since X is not less than 10 it prints
the value X that is 15 and then
terminates all right so let's save this
and execute it
so let me execute this
and here
let's check
the console
so there we go it prints 15. so what it
does is that it prints the value 15
first and then checks the condition
now
let's go ahead and change the value of x
to save
five
all right so now it enters the loop and
then it prints the value of x and then
increments it and when it comes out of
the loop and checks the condition
as long as the value of x remains less
than 10 it prints it okay
so let's save this
go back here
and let's refresh the page
and here you can see the values 5 to 9
are printed so this is how the do while
loop works
moving on to the next concept breaking
out of a loop now as the name suggests
break is the keyword that is used to
break out a pillow now here is a simple
code for you
so according to the logic it prints the
values between 1 to 10. and say at the
value 5 you want to break out of the
loop you can simply use the keyword
break so let's go back to our vs code
and here let me just
make it simple
and Save
for x equals 1.
X less than or equal to 10
let's increment it
and within the loop let's
display the value X
on the console and then we're going to
check for the condition if x equals 5.
all right
so if x equals 5 we break out of the
loop
so let's save the file and execute it
and there you go it's displayed the
values from 1 to 5.
so basically the code inside the for
Loop is executed and once the value of x
reaches 5 it breaks from the loop
simple right
all right so let's move on
next up we have skipping a loop cycle
all right so here what exactly we do is
we make use of a keyword continue to
skip a particular Loop cycle
say in this case we have a for Loop
which displays the values of I ranging
from 1 to 10. however we want to skip
the cycle when it reaches the value 3 so
what we do is we make use of the keyword
continue here so basically it displays
one and two and skips the third cycle
and then directly displays four all
right so let me show you in our vs core
editor here
let me just remove this and Save
if x equals
5
I'm going to continue
all right
after which
I'm going to say console
DOT log of x
so let me save this and then execute it
so here let me refresh the page
and there we go
as you can see it displays one two three
and four and the fifth cycle
is kept
all right and the rest of the digits are
displayed so that is how you can skip a
load I highly suggest you also practice
all of this and then play around with
loops to get a better understanding so
what exactly is an array
now an array object lets you store
multiple values in a single variable
it stores a fixed size sequential
collection of elements of the same type
now when array is used to store a
collection of data and it uses only
integers as element indices
however associative arrays can also use
string indices
moving on let's understand what array
operations are
now we can perform various operations on
an array in JavaScript
but let's start by creating an array
so for that let's go ahead and create a
folder first which will consist of the
file that we're creating right so for
that
let me just go ahead and create a folder
and I'll call it demo underscore array
so once you're done with that open your
Visual Studio code editor
and here say open folder
and click on demo array
okay is creating the workbench all right
and now here you can see the new file
icon so go ahead and create
demo.html file
all right here you go now let's start
typing the code
the first thing we do is type in our
HTML tag
and here I have the head tag
and let me say JavaScript
tutorial
all right and now let's create the body
tag
now within the body tag I create a
paragraph tag and create an ID
and let me call it demo
and then close the tag now I'll explain
to you why we're doing this a little
later
so first let's go ahead and create the
script tag
so say script
and within the script let's create our
array so let me use the keyword let
and say we give the name of the array
cars
equals in square base braces we say BMW
and Volvo
[Music]
and then say Honda
all right so now we create an array now
one more thing is that we use the
keyword let so that which indicates that
the array can be changed throughout the
program
all right so now we go ahead and display
it so I say document
[Music]
dot get element by ID
and here I say now the ID created was
demo so I say demo here
and I use the dot in our HTML property
which is equal to cars
okay let me change this to BMW first
all right so what exactly a naught HTML
does is that it is responsible for what
is being displayed on the web page okay
now since we've taken ID as demo any
changes made is reflected in this ID and
then displayed onto the web browser
all right so let's save this and now
execute the file
so here I go back to my folder and then
the file and go ahead and click on it
so there you go
The Heading is displayed and the entire
array is displayed here
all right so let's go back to our vs
code
okay so I hope this was easy to
understand
now let's go ahead
so the next operation is to access an
array element
so let's go back to our vs code
and here let's create another variable
say let BMW BMW is the name of variable
don't get confused with the array
element
so BMW equals cars of the index 0. so
basically cars of 0 is nothing but BMW
all right so that is being saved in the
variable BMW
and now let's just go ahead and display
this
so we let's just copy this
and paste it here and instead of cars
you use the variable name BMW that is
this one
all right
so now let's save this
and when we
execute it
you see BMW here
that's how you retrieve an element from
an array next up we have the array
length property which displays the
length of the array
so again let me show you how to do that
let's go back to our code
and here let's create a variable and
let's call it length variable so I say
let Len
equals cars.lab
now you can use the length property
which will retrieve the length of the
array for us it's as simple as that
and now after this again let's just
copy the same
code here and then
let's pass Len
okay
now let's save this
and when you execute it again
it says three
so we've successfully retrieved the
length of the array
all right so the next operation is to
access the last array element right so
let's go back to our vs code and now
let's create another variable and let's
call it last
and we'll just say last equals cars
and within Square braces cars.length
minus 1. right
so basically
the length of the array is 3 and 3 minus
1 is 2 so it should retrieve
cars of 2 which is Honda right
so let's just
execute this let me pass last here
save it and see if it displays Honda
operas
there you go
it's as simple as that
all right so moving on
the next array operation is Loop over an
array item
so for that let's go to our
code
and here
let's use the for Loop so I say cars dot
for each
for each
and within this we'll save
item
comma index
comma array
and now we use the arrow function
and display the content on the console
so I say console.log
of item
along with its index
so let's see this
and now let's go ahead and execute it
all right now as you can see nothing is
printed on your web page right because
whatever is being printed has to be
printed in your console so now click on
F12 which opens the developer options
and here you can see console so click on
that and now you can see the name of the
item in the array along with its index
so you see BMW 0 Volvo 1 and Honda two
all right
so moving on now that we've learned
about the array operations let's go
ahead and learn about the array methods
so the first method is to string now as
the name suggests it is used to convert
an array into a string
all right so let's go back to our vs
code
and now let's copy the same
code here
and here instead of last I just say
cars.2 string
now you can use this method
to convert the array into a string so
let's save this
and let's execute it
all right now here are the same output
as shown which means that the type has
only been changed to string type
All Right Moving On the next method is
pop now pop basically removes the last
element from the array so let me show
you how that works
let's go back to our vs code and here
we have to save the pop element into a
variable right so let's create a
variable say last
okay and oh since last already used let
me call it last one
last one of cars.pop and we can use the
pop method to pop the element
and now you can just copy the same code
to display this onto our web page
and here
I just say
last one
now
since we've popped the last element the
array has only two elements right that
is BMW and Volvo so if you want to
display the last element it should
display Volvo right so what we can do is
we can just create another variable say
last two
and just
use the same logic here
okay and now let's just
display it on your console and let's say
last two all right
so now let's save it
now the popped element has been saved in
last one which is displayed on the web
page and the last element of the array
after the pop function has to be
displayed on our console so let's go
ahead and execute the file
all right so Honda has been displayed
that is the element that has been
removed from the array and now once we
check our console
here you go here you can see Volvo which
means that is the last element in the
array
moving on
the next method is the push method now
as the name suggests it is used to add a
new element to the array and remember to
the end of the array so let's go back to
our vs code
and here let me say cars
dot push push is the method that we're
using
inside of which we'll say Audi all right
and now let's just display the same
things so let me copy this
and here let me say cars
okay so let me save it
and once I execute it
says BMW Volvo and Audi so we've
successfully added another element to
the end of the array if you want to kick
start your dream career and looking for
online boot camp training and
certifications from prestigious
universities then take up the full stack
Java developer Masters program by simply
learn
so the next method is the shift method
now basically shift is used to remove
the first element from the array now
this method shifts all the elements
reducing the indices for every element
by one all right let me show you how
this works
so let's go back to our vs code
and here let me just say cars dot shift
it's as simple as that and let's just
display this
let me copy the same thing
let's save it and when we execute it
here you can see it just displays Volvo
and audio so now cars has array elements
Volvo and Audi with array indices 0 and
1.
all right so moving on the next method
is on shift
all right so to add an element into the
beginning of an array we use the onshift
method therefore this method increases
the array index by 1. right so let's go
back to our vs code
and use the same function on shift
let's say cars.un shift
here we go let's
save it and here we have to specify what
we're adding right let me say Hyundai
okay
let's save this
and when we execute it you can see
Hyundai Volvo and Ori
it's as simple as that
all right moving on the next method is
the concat method now this is basically
used to merge two different areas right
so let's go back to our vs code
and sure
let's create another array first
and let's just call the array bikes okay
and let's create say Yamaha
and let's see Suzuki
and then we'll say Royal Enfield okay
and now
let's save this
and say let Vehicles this is another
array which is basically the after
concatenation
the entire array is saved into this
array all right so let's say cars Dot
concat
of bikes we just concat bikes and cars
together
okay and then let's just
display this over the web page so
let me change this to vehicles
all right let me save this
so let's go ahead and execute it
there you go now both the areas have
been merged together into a single array
so the next array method is the sort
method now basically sort is used to
sort the entire array into ascending
order all right so let's go back to our
editor
and here
let's just use the
sort method on the array Vehicles all
right
Vehicles dot sort
okay
and let's just
play this on our back page
so again
let's go back and
execute it and here you can see it has
been sorted
the next method
is the reverse method so the reverse
method is again used to reverse that
elements in an array so is logic right
so sort was used to sort it in ascending
order now when you reverse it it just
sorts it in the descending order
so let's go back here
you want to copy the same thing
all right and here instead of sort
let me just say divorce
so let's see this and execute it
there we go it has displayed the entire
array in the reverse order
all right
with that we finish the array methods
next up we have map reduce and filter
first up we have array.map now the map
method is used for creating a new array
from an existing one by applying a
function to each and every one of the
elements in the first array
and it does not change the original
array all right so to make you
understand this better let's go back to
our Visual Studio code
and now here let's first create another
area
okay so let me call this num1
and let's have
integers let's say 2 3 4 5.
6 and 7. okay
and now let's have another array
num2
so let's go ahead and say num1
dot map
of let me Define a function say multiply
okay
so multiply is the function that is that
I'm going to Define here
so let's say function
multiply
of value
okay and inside this let me say return
value
into 2.
okay
so what this basically does
is that it multiplies each and every
element of the array num1 by 2 and saves
the new elements into the array num2
okay now after this let's go ahead and
display the content so let me copy this
and let's display the content
in the array nump2
right so let me save it
let's go back here
execute it so there we go every element
has been multiplied by 2 and then
displayed again
I hope this was clear for you
now the next method is the filter method
so the filter method takes each element
in an array and applies a conditional
statement against it
and if this condition returns true the
element gets pushed onto the output
array but if it returns false the
element does not get pushed all right so
let me show it to you
now
let's
go ahead and create another
variable say num3
and here I say num1
dot filter
of say com now comp is a function
let me Define the function here
let me say function
comp
of value
takes a value as a parameter
within which I'm going to check if the
value is greater than 4.
now that only appends the element into
the array num3 if the value is greater
than 4. all right so now let me just
go ahead and change this to num3 all
right let's save this
and when we go back and execute
here we go
now the values so let's go back here let
me check
now num1 had the values 2 3 4 5 6 and 7
right so according to this it has to
only display it's 5 6 and 7. do not get
confused with num2 here we've passed
num1 here so it checks put this array
right so according to the logic it
should display 5 6 and 7 and it has done
so here
okay
moving on
the next method is a reduce method
now the reduced method reduces an array
of values down to just one single value
now to get the output value it runs a
reducer function to each element of that
array
okay now this method does not reduce the
original array again
so let's go back to our vs code
now let me create another
variables in num4
and say num1 dot reduce
and let me call it sum so what we're
basically doing is that we're adding all
the digits two three four five six and
seven in num1 to a single value right
that is the sum and then we're going to
be displaying that
so what we're going to do is let's
define the function here
function sum
basically is total comma value
right and then here let's say return
total Plus
the value
okay
and after this
I'm going to
display the content so let's say num 4.
okay let's save it go back and execute
here we go it displaces some of the
entire values in the array
this was pretty simple right so what is
a JavaScript object
JavaScript is an object-oriented
programming language so everything in
Java is an object
a JavaScript object is like a real world
entity having State and behavior for
example a car now we can take a car as
an object it will have its state like
color and model it will also have
behaviors like accelerate and break
JavaScript is template based and we can
create objects without having the need
to create a class
generally object is accompanied by a
class that defines an object's
blueprints but JavaScript doesn't
require any class to be defined for
objects
moving on to the next concept
to create a JavaScript object now
basically there are three different ways
of creating a JavaScript object all
right so we look at them one by one
the first one is to use a literal to
create and Define a JavaScript object
so let's go to our vs code editor
now if you have any doubts regarding the
initial setup then I suggest you go
through the previous video that is
Javascript arrays to get you started
with it so here I've created a folder
called demo objects and now I'm going to
create a file
called
create
underscore objects
dot HTML
all right
so we'll Begin by writing the initial
code
that is the head and the body so I say
HTML
within this is create the head tag
[Music]
and then I create a title tag
and let's say JavaScript
objects
then after the head tag I'm going to
create a body tag
and let's create a heading and say
creating JavaScript
objects
okay
and now we create
an ID
all of this is explained in the previous
video I really suggest you go through
the video before and that you get a
clear picture
and then I say ID equals
say demo
and then I'm gonna close it
now the first method that we're going to
use to create an object is by using
object literals right so what we can do
is say script
within which I declare a variable
say
where student
now within the object we're going to
create three different properties now
this is basically like a dictionary it
has a property a key and then a value
okay so I say name property and let's
say
Chris
and then another property say age and
say 21.
and another property say
studies
and say maybe computer science
okay
so this is the syntax used to create an
object using an object literally
now after this what we're going to do is
we're going to display this right now we
want to display the message saying Chris
of age 21 studies computer science so
what we can do is say document dot get
element by ID
and the ID that we're going to pass is
demo
we say
inner HTML
equals
student dot name
which is Chris
after which we display the message
of the age
and then the age that is student.h
studies
student Dot
studies
okay let's save this
and when we execute the file it says
Chris of the age 21 studies computer
science
all right this is one of the ways in
which you can define an object
all right so moving on to the next way
of creating a JavaScript object it is to
use the new keyword now this is the most
traditional way of creating an object
right so let's go back to our vs code
let's create another script
within which we say
where student equals new
object
I'm sure everybody has learned the same
way the same syntax
so this is one of the ways after which
we can say student dot name equals Chris
again student dot age
equals 21
[Music]
and then student Dot
studies
equals computer science
[Music]
all right
now after this we again
display the message so let me just copy
this
all right
so let's save this
and run our code again
and there we go it displays the message
Chris of the h21 studies computer
science
all right this was the second method
used to create an object
all right so then moving on to the third
method
it is to use an object Constructor to
create and Define a JavaScript object
so let's go back to our code editor
and here
we Define a function so we say function
says start
with three parameters that is name age
and say
studies
okay and now within the function we use
the keyword this so we say this dot name
equals name
all right we say this dot h
equals h
when I say this dot studies
equals studies
now what we do is that we can
create a variable and pass parameters to
the function so we say that
student
equals stud and within braces we say
comma 21
comma computer science
[Music]
all right so we've done passing the
parameters
after this
we're gonna copy the same
print message
[Music]
all right so let's save this and execute
our file
so let's refresh the web page
and there we go it still displays the
message place of the age 21 studies
computer science so this was the third
method that can be used to create
objects
moving on to the next topic
object properties
now a JavaScript object is basically a
collection of unordered properties right
values associated with the JavaScript
object are called its properties
and properties can usually be added
updated or deleted excluding read-only
properties so now let's have a look at
the demo to help you understand this
better
so let me go back to my
vs code so this was where we left off
and this was how we created objects
right so now let me create another file
and let me call it
[Music]
objects underscore properties
[Music]
ml
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy the first piece of code here
all right let me just copy this into my
new file
and here as you can see student is the
object that we've created and name agent
studies are the three properties now say
we want to update the age all right so
what we can do is here we can just say
student
dot h
equals
let me change it to 24 all right
and let me save this and when we execute
the file that is object underscore
properties
you can see Chris of the age 24 so 21 is
updated to 24. so this is one of the
ways you can do it
or there's another method
you can just assign the property to a
variable and then display the variable
instead so what we can do is we can just
assign student.h to a property say X
and here instead of displaying
student.age we can just say
all right so let's save this
and when we run it
it says 21 because we haven't updated
21 to 24 anywhere all right
so 21 Remains the Same
so another method we can use is we can
just say
x equals h
so we're directly assigning the property
to the variable
and here when I'm displaying it I say
student of x
all right
so let me save this
and when you look at the web page
it still displays the same thing these
are different ways of accessing the
properties you can update them delete
them unless they read only
all right so let's move on to the next
concept object methods now basically a
JavaScript method is an action that can
be performed on the objects
so you'll understand better with the
help of the demo
so let's go back to our vs code and here
I've created another HTML file called
objects underscore methods all right so
let's let me just copy the initial code
paste it here and let's have the
enclosing tags as well
and HTML all right now here I declare
another tag that is the button tag so
we're going to be making a button here
so I say button
ID equals click me so that is the action
that I'm going to
performing
and the message that is going to be
displayed on the button will be
okay
all right
so we're going to see the usage of it a
little later
now let's go ahead and create an object
so I say script
[Music]
within which I create
[Music]
the user object
[Music]
so we created using a object literal
here and I declare the property name
as it is again
and age
[Music]
24. okay
so let's close this
all right so the next thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a new function
that we will use as an object method
all right so I say function
and let's give the name say hi
okay
within the function we declare
we basically display a message so we're
going to say alert and hello
all right so this is going to be
displayed in a separate dialog box
so now once the Declaration is done
what we're going to do
is we're going to use
create another property basically say
user Dot
let's say message
and assign say hi to it
so basically what we're doing
is we're adding the previously created
method to a new property that is user
Dot message the message property all
right
so now I say
document dot get element by ID
say demo
[Music]
and the message that I want is just
hi
plus the username all right
[Music]
so what we're going to do is we're going
to display the message hello
all right when the user clicks on the
button
so for that let's say
let's just copy this
[Music]
and here
instead of demo
right we're going to be passing the ID
click me
as per this and the event is going to be
on click event
so here I say on click
after which I'm going to Simply pass
user Dot message
let me just delete this
all right so here I notice that I've
given an equal to sign I'm sorry it's a
colon
all right so let's save the file
and let's go ahead and execute it
all right so here you can see high crisp
being displayed and once we click on the
button
you can see an alert which says hello
all right
so now let's move on to the next concept
that is Java object accessors
now Getters and Setters allow defining
an object accessor all right to get the
value of a property in a JavaScript
object we use a getter and to set the
value of a property of a JavaScript
object we use a setup so let's go back
to our demo
and now let me create another file
and let's call it
object
accessors
and now again let me just
copy the first initial part
[Music]
all right so now let's go ahead and
create a new
object so let me say script
but then which I see where
and let's call it car all right
so let me define the properties say
model
and
the model is say BMW
320d
and
another property say color and let's say
it's navy blue
and the last property say fuel type
and let's see it's diesel
[Music]
now what we can do is we can you make
use of the keyword get
to access the properties so I say get
fuel
within which I return
this dot fuel type
all right it's as simple as that
so now let's display it document Dot
get element by ID
okay
demo dot inner HTML equals we say car
dot fuel
all right so now let's save it
and execute our file
here you go it retrieves diesel for us
now this is one of the ways of accessing
the properties
now to help you understand Setter let's
go ahead and create another
object
let's say where car again
now let's say the model
is
Audi A4
[Music]
color be bright
red
[Music]
and fuel type let's keep it blank
all right
now to set the value we use the set
keyword we say set fuel
the parameter is fuel
within which we say this dot you will
type
[Music]
equals fuel right
now let's set the value for the fuel
say car dot fuel
equals petrol
all right
now let's display the same
let me copy this
and what we want to display is the fuel
type right so here we say fuel type
so let's save this
and let's go ahead and execute the file
and there we go it retrieves petrol
so what it does is basically it assigns
the value petrol to the property fuel
type and then we display the same on our
web page
so this is how you make use of Getters
and setters
so basically a function is a group of
reusable code which can be called from
anywhere in your program right
when you have a piece of code that you
want to execute repeatedly in your
entire program it makes more sense to
Define it once and call it over and over
right it makes the code more efficient
and readable this also helps programmers
write modular goals
so this is the syntax you make use of
the function keyword followed by which
you mentioned the name of the function
the name of the function is completely
your choice next you mentioned the
parameter list and within curly braces
you can Define the function now the
function body is basically the code that
is executed every time the function is
called
so let's go to our vs code editor
and here I've created a folder called
demo functions within which I've created
an HTML file called functions.html
all right and now I've just typed in the
initial code
now let's create a function
so let me say script
within which I use the keyword that is
function keyword
and now I give the name for my function
I say my underscore function
and the function takes a parameter save
value now this function basically
Returns the square of the digit all
right so within which
I say
document dot get element by ID
the ID is demo
and now it just displays value into
value
all right so the function basically
displays the square of the number
now outside the function let me call the
function
because
my function let me pass the value 5.
all right now let's save this and
execute it
so let me go back to my file
and here we go it displays the value 25
so this was a simple function which took
a value
a digit as a parameter and then returned
the square
moving on to the next concept function
expression now what we learned
previously was function declaration but
a function can also be defined as an
expression now this is what the syntax
looks like now here the function is
created and assigned to the variable
explicitly like any other value the
meaning Remains the Same that is you
create the function and store the value
that it returns into a variable and in
our case it's X right so let's go to our
vs code and let me help you understand
this better
so now
I create another function
and here I say let
x equals let's use a simpler function so
I just mentioned function
and within curly braces I display an
alert message and I display a message
saying hello
all right
now
after that to display the message what
we can do is let me just copy this
for output
code
can you place it here
and here what we're going to be
displaying is the value X right now
since it consists of a function you'll
have to type the curly braces now this
is crucial for its execution all right
so let me save this and then execute
let me execute this
and here you go it says the site says
hello so we've successfully executed the
piece of code we can also assign this
variable X to another variable and then
call that variable instead
right we can say let
Y equals X
and instead of calling X here
we can simply call Y
let me save it and then let me refresh
the page
and there we go it's still displays a
message hello
all right so this is one of the ways of
defining a function that is as an
expression
moving on to our next concept function
Constructor
now JavaScript functions are defined
using the keyword function right now
functions can also be defined using a
JavaScript built-in function
now this is the basic syntax so here
we've created a function called my
function and we've used the keyword new
after which we've used the Constructor
function
and inside we provide the parameter list
after that the return value
next you can call the function here
right so let me just go back to my vs
code
and now let me just make changes to the
same piece of code here
create a function say my underscore
function
okay all right let me just change the
name
to my function all right
and then here I use the keyword new
and the function Constructor that is
function
foreign
within which I'm passing all the
parameters so I have
a b now I'm going to return the sum of
the digits
all right
and now while calling the function
let me just store the value in a
variable say X
and let's call the function that is my
function
with the parameters 2 and 3.
all right
and now let me display it so I'm just
gonna copy this
and I want to display the value of x
right
all right so let me save this and
execute it
if you refresh the page it displays the
sum that is 5.
to make it more readable let me just
display another message here
let me just say
the sum is
all right
let me save it and then refresh the page
it says the sum is 5.
all right now this is how you make use
of the function Constructor
next up we learn about self-invoking
functions
now as the name suggests these functions
are invoked automatically without being
called now previously when we learned
about function Expressions we saw that
parentheses were crucial
so you have to add parentheses around
the function to indicate that it is a
function expression so here is a Syntax
for you so what we've done is we've made
sure we've enclosed the entire function
within parentheses
so let me help you with that let's go
back to our vs code
and let me create another script
and here let me create the function
within the parentheses and say function
it's not taking any parameters
instead it is going to
alert a message so let me say
hello welcome
right
after which
we're going to call the function so
again we have to mention the parentheses
let's save this
and execute
so when we refresh the page it says
hello welcome
so we never call the function rather it
got invoked by itself so these are
self-invoking functions
now let's go ahead and look at functions
as values
now in JavaScript a function is
basically a value so we can deal with it
as a value now here is a simple syntax
now if you closely look at the syntax
you might think that this is same as
function Expressions well no in this
case what we do is we first Define the
function and then we assign it to a
particular variable but in the case of
Expressions the function definition was
defined during the initialization of the
variable right and also we have to
specify the parenthesis in order to call
the function so to help you understand
this better let me go back to our vs
code and here
let me just erase this
and let's define a function that Returns
the product of two digits so let me just
call it product
which takes two parameters let me say A
and B
within which we return the value
a into B
all right now after this let's create
another variable say y
equals function oh I'm sorry the name of
the function is product so product of 2
and 5.
right so this basically returns us
10 right so let me just copy this to
display this on our web page
and here I change the message to the
product
and here let me change it to y
so let's save this and execute it
so let me refresh the page and here you
go you can see the message the product
is done
now what we can do is we can make
alterations to this now say I want to
multiply the value
with 5 again
right so basically this returns 10 and
that value is multiplied by 5. so let me
save this
and refresh our page and there we go it
returns
and there we go it displays 50. so this
is how you can make use of functions as
values
moving on to the next topic functions as
objects
now JavaScript functions are a special
type of objects called function objects
now a function includes a string which
holds the actual code that is the
function body of the function the code
is literally just a string although not
recommended you can also create a
function with the help of the function
Constructor I will show that you a
little later on but for now let's look
at the syntax
now here we have a variable called body
which basically consists of the function
body its enclosed in double quotes and
that's a mistake please ignore it all
right so next we have variable function
name so here we create a function using
the keyword new and then we pass a
parameter list and the body basically
tells us what the function returns right
next we have an alert message to call
the function so let me just show how
this is executed
let me create another
function
and let's say the function Returns the
area of a circle right so let me just
create
a body variable
which returns
so the area of circle is pi R square so
we make use of math dot pi
into radius
into radius right
so it's basically Pi R square
after which
let's see where Circle
[Music]
and here let's create a function using
the new keyword
function
and then here we pass
the value that is the radius
and then the body
right so basically this is the
definition of our function
so let's use alert
to display the area so we say alert of
circle
or five
all right let me save this and execute
it
so when you refresh the page
it displays the area of the circle
so this is how you can use functions as
objects
moving on to our next concept Arrow
functions
now functions can be written more
compactly and more precisely with the
help of Arrow functions all right now
Arrow function expressions are
Illustrated as methods and they cannot
be used as Constructors
now also while using Arrow functions
using const is a safer option because a
function expression is always a constant
value
so this is the syntax now you can only
omit the return keyword within the curly
braces if the function is a single
statement
so this is the syntax first you provide
the name of the function
with an equal to sign followed by the
argument list and later you make use of
this Arrow icon and Define the
expression so this is basically nothing
but this
so let's go back to our vs code and
check for ourselves
so let's create another function
and here let me say
const
my funk
equals now say we want to display the
product of three digits so let me just
pass ABC as my parameters
and we make use of this icon which
indicates that this is an arrow function
within which I say return a into B into
C
all right
now let me just assign this to a
variable
okay let me say
product because we've used X here
and then let me call my function that is
my func and pass the value 2 3 and say
4.
all right so let's display the product
so let me just copy this
code
and here let me say the product
of the three
digits is
and let me say product here
because that is what is being used here
right all right so let me save this and
execute it
all right first it displays the area of
the circle all right and then we say
okay
and there we go it displays the message
the product of the three digits is 24.
so let me do one thing let me just
comment this out
okay
let me save it and then execute it again
it just displace this
all right so this is how we can make use
of Arrow functions
moving on let's look at the generator
function
now regular functions typically return
only one value right or a single value
or sometimes even nothing but a
generator function can return multiple
values and the specialty is that it can
do it so on demand all right now to
create a generator function we make use
of an asterisk
so an asterisk indicates that the
function is a generator function
so here you can see that we have a
function followed by asterisks and we've
created a function called generator
sequence
so here you can see we have the asterisk
after the keyword function followed by
the name of the function right
but the main method of a generator
function is the next method when this
method is called it basically runs the
execution until the nearest yield value
all right all the nearest yield
statement then the function execution
pauses and the yielded value is returned
to the outer code
all right so the result of the next
method is always an object with two
properties it has a value property which
is basically the yielded value
and then it has a done property which
displays true if the function code is
finished or false if it's otherwise so
let me show its execution for a clearer
understanding so let's go back to our vs
code
and here let's create the generator
function
let's say function asterisk
generate
function all right
now within which
I make use of the keyword yield
and I say yield one first
followed by yield
2
and finally I make use of return which
indicates the termination so I say
return 3.
all right
now we make use of
a variable say generator
[Music]
and assign it to the generator function
that is generate
funk
and now I create another variable say 1.
which will basically return the value
when I call the next function so here I
say generator
dot next
okay so whatever generator dot next
returns it's stored in one
so to display the message I say alert
and now I'm going to make use of a
method called Json Dot stringify
[Music]
all right so basically this method
converts a JavaScript object or a value
to a Json string alright so within which
I'm going to say one
that is this
all right
so now let me save this
and execute it
Let me refresh the page and there you go
here it returns
two properties that is value and done it
says value is 1 and done is false right
it is false because we haven't reached
the return statement yet
foreign
so what we can do is to display the rest
let me just copy these
and display it one by one
see there let's see this
and here let me say two
and this is three
let me copy this
okay here I see
two
and then I say three
all right so let me save this and then
execute it
so when I refresh the page
it says one and false
after which again it says 2 and false
and finally when it displays three it
returns true for the done property that
means we've reached the end of the
function definition
so this is how we make use of a
generator function
now let's move on to our last topic that
is predefined functions
now JavaScript has many built-in
functions all right now here are a few
of them we have eval parseint pass float
escape and unescape now let's go through
one by one
all right first up is eval now this
basically evaluates a string and returns
a value all right so to help you
understand this better let me go back to
our vs code
and now let me just create another file
and let me call it redefined
functions.htn all right
and I've just copied the initial code
all right so for eval the syntax is eval
within which
I see expression
all right now this is the general syntax
so what this eval does is that it
evaluates the expression
and if the result is not a string the
result is just returned and if the
result is a string it is taken to be a
JavaScript program and evaluated
so let me show you how it's done
so first let's create three variables
all right let's call them X
and initialize it to five
then y with six
and then let Z be 7 all right
now let's just displace the result on
the console so say console.log
eval
or let me say X Plus y
all right
after which I again say console.log
of event of set
here since the expression is a string
this gets evaluated and here since it's
not a string it just Returns the value Z
and here since it is not a string it
just Returns the value of Z so let me
save this and then execute it
all right so let me just
check our console
there you go it evaluated the expression
and added the two values that is X and Y
and returned 11. while Z is returned as
it is
all right this is what eval does
next up is parseint now as the name
suggests it passes a string argument and
returns an integer of the specified
Radix or base
and the syntax basically includes the
keyword parse and the string within
parenthesis
parse float on the other hand passes a
string argument and returns a floating
Point number again the syntax has the
keyword pass float along with the string
within parenthesis
next up is escape now this Returns the
hexadecimal encoding of an argument
and on the other hand an escape Returns
the ASCII string for the specified value
so let's move ahead and today we will
discuss a completely new topic which is
prototypes in JavaScript so for this
video we are going to use console for
printing that's because it will be easy
for you guys to understand the concept
of prototypes if we use the console
instead of using a normal document.write
method
so let me do one thing guys we'll print
a statement on the console
so
we'll write here
console.log
and will print
let's say
welcome to Simply code so let's save
this and if we open console here in our
browser
we have to go to inspect and then we
have to go to console and here you can
see we have welcome to Simply code
written over here
so in the last video we talked about
creating an object with the help of
object literal method right so let's
suppose we are creating an object here
with the help of same object literal
method so what we have to do we have to
create an empty object first so let's
say our object name is ABC
and we'll use the curly braces here so
what we have to do is we have to pass
the properties here so let's suppose our
properties are name and the value of
name let's say
kaushal followed by a comma and then we
have
let's say subject value of subject will
be
let's say JavaScript
and then finally we have the
address so let's say the value of
address is Bangalore right
this is a basic object we made right if
we write here console.log ABC so if you
want to print this object on the console
so what we'll do here we'll write
console.log and then we'll use ABC so
let's save this now and here you can see
on the console that we have our object
here so we have our object with all the
three properties we have address as
Bangalore we have name as causal and
subject as JavaScript
so if you guys look here carefully you
will notice that we have one more entity
here that is we have underscore
underscore Pro 2.
so what is this underscore underscore
Proto
so all right we mentioned all the other
three properties in our object but we
didn't do anything for this underscore
underscore Proto so let's discuss this
now let's take a scenario wherein
someone told us to create a website like
let's suppose we have to make a travel
website through which people can book
their travel destinations now do we have
to start creating the website from
scratch no that's because we have some
of the necessary conditions already
fulfilled like we have Chrome we already
have bootstrap for styling and all and
we can use bootstrap to design a website
right so we have certain things already
present and we have to work over them to
create our website similarly prototype
refers to the destination from where we
started to create an object like we have
methods for arrays we have objects and
strings as well so all these methods are
being inherited from somewhere so
whenever we create an object using the
object literal method then it will start
creating the object from the object dot
prototype so if we click here on the
underscore underscore Proto
we have access to a list of methods
already present within the object dot
prototype so and all of them are
predefined we can use any of them we
didn't Define them they are already
present we Define only these three
properties like we defined address name
and subject only
in simple words all JavaScript objects
inherits properties and methods from a
prototype date objects inherit from date
dot prototype and similarly when we use
array objects they inherit from
array.prototype so the object.prototype
is on the top of the Prototype
inheritance chain so date objects array
objects and person objects all these
objects inherit their properties from
object dot prototype so moving on now
let's create another object so we talked
about the object literal method so here
we don't have too much to do so let's
move ahead and we'll create another
object this time we'll create it with
the help of a Constructor function so
let's create a function here first let's
say we have a function named as function
XYZ
so then we have the parameters as name
and then we have we'll take all these
three properties we will take name
subject and let's say
address
so then we have the body of the function
inside which will use the this keyword
will write here this dot name equals to
name
similarly this Dot address equals to
address
and finally we have this Dot
subject equals to subject
so we'll create an instance now let's
say we are creating an object let's say
a object name is where
X1 and we'll write here new
and then we'll write XYZ and we'll pass
the values so let's say the name is
and we have
subject as let's change the subject
we'll write here Java and we have
finally have the address let's say the
address is Earth
okay so the values are different from
the previous example we took what we'll
do now we'll write here
console.log and will print
X1 now so we are done creating an object
and here we have a Constructor function
named XYZ and then we have few
properties which are the same as we used
in the previous example so then we have
an object named X1 which holds the
values for all three properties and
lastly we printed the object on the
console so let's save it now and we can
see here in console we have the object
with all the properties this almost no
difference here from the object literal
method right but when we click here on
the Pro 2 here we can encounter the
difference now you can see here we have
one more entity here named as the
Constructor so this Constructor here has
its own prototype
so this Constructor here has its own
prototype if you use a Constructor in a
program it always has its own prototype
this might seem a bit difficult to you
guys but don't worry it will be apparent
to you guys once we move on to the usage
and modifications of prototype so here
we are with the two examples in the
first one we created an object with the
help of object literal method there we
saw that it has only a single prototype
that is the object prototype later when
we moved on to the Constructor function
method we realized that there are two
different prototypes present one is the
Prototype which is available every time
that is the object dot prototype and the
other one is the constructor's OWN
prototype it might sound a little hard
to you guys but prototype is nothing but
it refers to the point from where it all
started from where we have inherited all
the properties
so we can make changes to the Prototype
of our own object like if we want to add
something to our prototype we can do it
we have a method for that in JavaScript
we'll do it later in this video we can't
make changes to the object prototype
remember this thing guys I'll suggest
you not to edit the object dot prototype
because it's not a good practice to make
changes in that if you want to edit any
prototype then we have to make sure that
we are making changes in our own
prototype that we made with the help of
Constructors the Prototype made by us is
also inherited from the object.prototype
if we want to make another prototype
here we can do it like if we are going
to add utility functions to our program
but at the same time we don't want to do
anything with the properties of a
Constructor function we can make another
prototype for that we can create a
prototype for separate method so if we
want to add a method in this Constructor
function we can do it we can add it
separately with the help of prototypes
so for that we have to follow a syntax a
particular syntax we can do it this way
like we have to write here x y z dot
prototype and then we have to write the
method name let's say we are writing
here
get name
fine we'll write a function
and then we have the body of the
function so let's suppose this method
Returns the name
so we'll write here
return
this
dot name so if we try to run this
program now we can see there is no
difference from the previous one but if
we check the prototypes now so here you
can see we have another prototype named
as get name
so this is how we can edit the Prototype
of our object now if we try to access
this get name method with the help of X1
object so we can do it so let's try to
do it on Console we'll write here X1 dot
get name
and
see here we have the output as caution
similarly let's create one more
prototype here to remove any sort of
confusion so what we'll do we'll create
another
prototype so let's say we are creating a
prototype for
address now so what we'll do we'll write
here x y z Dot
prototype
Dot
get
address
so it will be a method so we'll write
here function
we don't have to pass any parameters
here
so let's suppose it return
the value of address
so we'll write here this dot address and
we are good to go so let's save it now
and if we go to Pro underscore
underscore Pro 2 we can see we have one
more prototype here named as get address
so what we have to do now is we'll make
another object let's say we are copying
this from here
we'll paste it here
so let's change the values let's say we
write here Mars and then we have let's
change the subject basically because we
are
looking for the subject so let's change
this value as well let's say we have
here
simply code
and we'll change the name of the object
let's say we have X2 now save it and if
we write here
X2 Dot
let's say get name
so here you can see the output as Simply
Good similarly if we write here instead
of get name we write here get address
so here you can see the output as Mars
because the value we passed while
creating the object is Mars here so we
can access this value directly using the
Prototype method so if we use the object
Constructor function if you guys
remember we cannot add a new property to
an existing object for example if we try
to add a property here let's say if we
try to add a property to this existing
function what we can write here is
x y z Dot
grades
let's say the grid is
e
so if we save this now
here you can see there is nothing
changed here so we don't have any change
in the prototypes or we don't have any
changes in the properties as well so we
simply can't add a property to an
existing function like this but we have
a method for this also so to add a new
property to a Constructor we must add it
to the Constructor function or we can
use the Prototype property here as well
so the JavaScript prototype property
allows us to add new properties to a
object Constructor just like we added
the methods to a Constructor function
previously similarly we can add
properties as well so we have to write
here so we'll remove this line
we have to write here x y z Dot
prototype
and then we have to write the property
name here let's say we are writing here
grids and then we'll pass the value
let's say the grade is a
so if we save this now and if we go back
here and if we check the underscore
underscore Pro 2. so here you can see we
have a property here named as grades and
the value is a so if we try to print X1
dot grade in our console so the output
will be a so let's try to do it here
we'll write here
two Dot
grids
and here you can see the value is a here
so we can add a property to an existing
Constructor function with the help of
prototype methods so this is the basic
usage of prototypes in JavaScript we can
use prototypes to add a property or a
method to an already existing
Constructor function
class is nothing but a template used for
creating objects in JavaScript just like
the Constructor function we can also use
classes for creating object in
JavaScript we can include properties and
behaviors in our class creating a class
is a pretty easy job to do the syntax is
somewhat the same as that of a
Constructor function so let's move on to
the programming part if you guys are
coming from any other object oriented
programming language like we have C plus
plus Java PHP and many more object
oriented programming language right so
you may have an idea about classes the
Syntax for classes in JavaScript is also
not so different from other languages
don't worry if you are going through
classes for the first time will have a
look at classes so let's move on to the
syntax
and to declare a class we use the class
keyword followed by the name of the
class and the body of the class so we'll
write a class so this is the keyword we
use for the Declaration of a class then
we have the name of the class so let's
say we have the name as student here and
then we use curly braces for the body of
the class so this is an empty class
named as student we know that this
student has a name H roll number and
many more properties right so the next
thing we are going to do is we can
define the properties here only in fact
the Syntax for defining properties is
also the same as we had in the
Constructor function so let's define the
properties first so let's say we have
three properties here name agent roll
number so we'll write here this dot name
is equals to name
and then we have this dot h is equals to
H
and the last property is this Dot
roll number so let's say we are writing
your rule so equals to role
so we have all the three properties of
student we have name age and roll number
so we have to create a Constructor here
which will be executed while we create
an object or we can say an instance of
this class so the Syntax for creating a
Constructor will go like we have to
write here Constructor and we have to
pass all these three arguments here we
have to pass name
then we have H and then we have a roll
number so all these three arguments we
have to pass here and also these
properties will be kept inside
the body of this Constructor so this is
the basic syntax of how we are going to
create a class in JavaScript so we have
all the three properties here we have
name we have H and we have roll number
if you guys notice here the Syntax for
the Constructor function looks a bit
similar to the syntax of the Constructor
function method which we came across in
the previous few videos right
so what we are doing is we created a
class first with the name student then
we defined all the properties of this
class inside the Constructor so by now
things are going easy right that's
because the Syntax for classes is
relatively easy to use compared to other
methods
also we don't have to write code
manually for different things we will
understand it much better while working
on inheritance so let's move on and we
will add some methods to this class now
the Syntax for adding a method is super
simple guys we don't have to write here
a function name followed by a colon and
then we have the function keyword no
we'll just write here the function name
and parenthesis so to add a method here
we'll write here let's say we are adding
a method organization so let's say we
have a method org okay so we have to
write org and
pair of round brackets that's all this
is the Syntax for defining a method in
classes so let's say we want this
function to return a string along with
the name of the student so let's say we
are writing a return
and let's say we want it to return
I am dot name from
simply code okay
so let's say we are passing a value here
as causal and we want this function to
return I am causal from Simply code
so similarly We'll add another function
here
which is for the date of birth of
student
so let's see we'll write here DOB
and then we have the body of the
function so we want this function to
return the date of birth of a student
right so let's say we are in the year
2020 what we want to do is we have the
age of student let's say the age is 21
and what we are going to do next is we
are going to subtract the age from
current year so 2020 minus this dot h
will return the date of birth of student
right so we'll write here
return let's say we wanted to return a
string as well let's say the date of
birth
of
this dot name
Is 2020 minus this dot each
fine so here we are done with a string
so we want it to return the date of
birth of kaushal is
let's say 1999 if we are providing the
value as 21 then it will return 1999
right let's move ahead and create an
object first so let's say we have an
object named as
caution and what we are going to do is
we are going to write here new and we
are going to call the class so we'll
write here
student
and then we'll pass the values here so
let's say the name is kaushal the age is
21
and we have roll number is 45 so we have
all the three properties here right next
up we are going to print this on a
console so we'll write a console.log
and we'll print caution
so let's say if it's working or not save
it and here you can see on our console
we have a student class we have all the
three values we have ages 21 name as
kaushal and roll number as 45. if we go
inside this underscore underscore Pro 2
we can see here we have both the methods
here we have org and dub so let's try to
call these methods first so what we are
going to do is we are going to write on
our console
causal Dot dub
so here you can see we have the output
as the date of birth of kaushal is 1999.
similarly if we try to call function
kaushal Dot
org
so you can see here we have the output
as I am kaushal from Simply code right
so here you can see both the methods are
working fine we have both the outputs
here
the first one says the date of birth of
kaushal is 1999 and the next one gives
us the organization name so moving ahead
let me guys tell you about another
Concept in classes we'll now discuss
static functions in classes
we have to use the static keyword to
define a static method followed by the
method name so if we want to define a
static method what we have to do is we
have to use the
static keyword so the static keyword is
always followed by the name of the
method so let's say we are creating a
method here let's say for adding two
numbers so we'll write here the method
name is ADD
and then we have the body of this method
so what we want to do is we want to add
two numbers right so we have to pass
here two parameters as well we'll write
here a comma B
and then we want it to return the sum
right so we'll write a return
a
plus b
this looks fine right
notice here guys we don't have to use
anything from the class or the object
like in the previous two methods we used
the name and the H property right so
here we use this dot name and then we
used this dot age as well but here this
method is not related to object at any
cost the best part about the static
method is we can use static methods
without creating the instances of a
class so if we want to access this
particular method here we can do it with
the help of class name followed by the
dot operator and the method name so
let's try to access this method once
what we are going to do is we are going
to write console.log
and we are going to access this method
with the class name so we'll write here
student dot add and will pass the values
here so let's say we are passing 10 and
45 fine so let's see if it works or not
so save it and here you can see we have
the output as 55 so this is how we can
create or use static methods in classes
let's move on now and we will discuss
inheritance with the help of classes in
JavaScript by now we are clear with the
meaning of inheritance right guys we
discussed in the last video that
inheritance is the procedure through
which one class inherits the properties
and methods of another class so today we
are going to see how we can Implement
inheritance with classes in JavaScript
although the concept will remain the
same we will create another class here
and will inherit the properties of this
existing class with some more properties
of the derived class I hope you guys
know the difference between Base Class
and derived class so the class we are
going to create now will be the derived
class so let's move ahead and create a
class
let's say we are creating a class here
so let's save
for creating a class we have to write
class let's say the class name is
student
and if we want to inherit the properties
of the above class which is student one
we have to use a particular syntax so we
have to write the
extents keyword here so this is the
keyword extensor is a keyword which is
used for inheritance and then we will
write the name of the class which we
want to inherit so we'll write a student
and then we have the body of the class
here we have a class student one that
inherits the properties of class student
next up we'll create a Constructor
function here and we'll pass all the
properties we want to be there for the
class student one so we'll pass the
Constructor function similarly like we
did in the previous class so we'll write
here Constructor and we'll pass all the
properties we want to be there for class
student one so we have the first three
properties are name which we are going
to inherit from the above class then we
have H and then we have
rule number right so let's add two more
properties here let's say the true
properties are language and then we have
section as well fine
so then we have the body of the
Constructor
so you can see here we have five
properties three of these five are
inherited from class
student and the rest two are those
properties that we want to add for class
students one exclusively the Syntax for
inheritance in classes is not a tough
one though still we have to keep a few
things in mind mainly the next statement
we are going to write here is an
important one it goes like we use the
super keyword
and then we'll
pass all the properties which we want to
inherit from the class in this
particular case we want to inherit these
three properties here right so we'll
copy this from here and we'll paste it
here remember one thing guys we'll write
only those properties which we want to
inherit from other class
actually this super keyword we used here
refers to the parent class we use it to
call the parent classes Constructor or
we can also call particular properties
and methods with the help of super
keyword
next up we'll Define the two new
properties the language and the section
now
so the syntax will remain the same we'll
write here this dot language is equals
to language
and then we'll write this Dot
section
is equal to section
we are good to go now we'll create an
object for this class as well
which is student one so let's say we are
creating an object again
let's say the name of this object is
let's remove it first so let's say we
are creating an object for this class
now let's say the name of this object is
Arun and we are going to write a new
then we have the class name which is
student one and then we'll pass the
values here so let's say the name is
Arun then we have the age is 35 and then
we have roll number as three or two
and then we have the language so let's
say the language is Javascript and then
we finally have the section as well so
let's say the section is
a fine so we have all the five values
here we have around 35 to JavaScript and
a right so let's print this on our
console
we'll write a console.log and we'll
print Arun
let's save it now and here you can see
we have a student one with all the
properties and values we have age is 35
language JavaScript name is Arun roll
number S2 and section is e if we click
here on underscore underscore Proto you
can see here we have a Constructor
student when along with that we have all
the methods of the previous class of the
base class we have org we have dob as
well right so this is how inheritance
work in JavaScript the key benefit of
using inheritance with classes is that
if we remember from the previous video
if we want to access any Base Class
method then traditionally we had to
manually provide the Constructor right
but in classes we don't have to do any
such thing once we are done with
inheriting the properties and all we can
directly access the methods as well
let's try to do it here on a console so
we'll write here
Arun dot let's suppose we are using org
so we'll write a arun.org and here you
can see we have the output as I am Arun
from Simply code
next up let's use the other method as
well so we'll write here
Arun and then we'll use
dub
so here you can see we have the date of
birth of arunis 1985 because we have
provided the value as 35 so 2020 minus
35 is 1985.
here we have the output as expected now
let's see if we can access the static
method or Not by using the derived class
so we'll try to access the static method
with the help of student one so let's
try to do it will write here
console.log and then we'll write here
student
one dot add and will pass the values
let's say the values are
65 and 8. right
so we want the output as
73 now so let's see if it's working or
not so we'll save it and here you can
see we have the output as 73. so this is
a basic example of how inheritance works
with classes in JavaScript so guys
inheritance is an essential Concept in
any object-oriented programming language
inheritance refers to the procedure
through which one class or one
Constructor inherits the properties and
methods of another Constructor in simple
terms let's suppose we have a
Constructor named as vehicle and we know
we have different types of vehicles
present like we have cars and we have
bikes as well so all these types share a
few things in common right and now if we
want to create a Constructor let's say
we want to create a Constructor bike and
we want it to have a few of the same
properties and methods as of the
vehicles Constructor
so in that case we are left with two
options
either we can copy the properties from
vehicle Constructor and paste them
inside the bike Constructor or we can
simply use inheritance to inherit those
properties from the vehicle Constructor
to the bike Constructor in this case the
vehicle class will be known as a base
class and the bike Constructor or class
will be known as derived Constructor
because we derived a few properties from
the vehicle Constructor right
don't worry guys I know the concept of
classes might be new for you and the
concept of inheritance might seem a bit
different from other languages like if
you are coming from a C plus plus
background you may notice that there we
use classes for the concept of
inheritance but in JavaScript before the
introduction of es6 that is ecmascript 6
the concept of inheritance was based on
Constructors and prototypes so with the
introduction of ecmascript 6 the idea of
classes was also introduced in
JavaScript and the usage of inheritance
was also changed we will discuss classes
and inheritance in the next video today
we are going to discuss the traditional
way of using prototypes for inheritance
so don't be stressed guys if you are not
clear with the syntax of inheritance by
the end of this video in the next video
you will understand the concept and
syntax of inheritance without any
confusion
so we'll now talk about a few things so
let's start with the programming part so
guys whenever we create an object with a
method like we can create an object with
the help of object literal method or we
can do the same with the help of
Constructor function method as well
right then we have a prototype every
time you might have noticed it we have
been through it in the past few videos
so every time we create an object we
notice that it has a prototype now what
we will do here is we'll create a
prototype so the syntax will be like so
we'll write here const we are using
const in place of variable I hope you
guys are aware of cons to wear and let
keywords so today we are using here
const so let's say the prototype name is
employee
we'll write equals to and then we have
the body of the Prototype let's do one
thing now we'll use a method let's say
the method name is post post of the
employee
and we'll write here
function and then we have the body of
the function so let's say this function
returns a string so we'll write here
return and let's say the function
returns a
software developer and then we have
another function named as change name
and we'll write your function
will pass a parameter
and then we have the body of this method
so we'll write here this dot name
is equal to name and we are good to go
right
so what we did here is we created a
prototype of the name employee and it
has two functions one is the employees
post and the other one is to change the
name so let's save this program and
check it in the console if it has any
errors so let's save it now and we'll go
here and
check on the console
so here you can see everything is fine
so till now we created a prototype now
let's create an object as well so what
we'll do
we'll create an object here we'll write
here let's say where and let's say the
object name is even
so we'll create an object with the help
of
object Dot
create method
okay so we have to write here Dot
so we have two pass the prototype name
so we'll write here employee and then
what we'll do we'll print this on a
console so we'll write here console.log
and we'll write here even let's say so
we created an object even with the help
of object.create method let's save it
and check it on the console if we see
here we don't have anything else other
than a single prototype right we have a
single prototype here we have no method
mentioned so if we open it we have the
two methods of course we have post and
we have changed name but if we write
here let's say we are writing here even
dot name
and then value of name will be let's say
kaushal
and then we'll assign a rule as well
let's see these are the two new
properties
we'll write here even dot role and let's
say the
a role of causal is
writer
fine and if we save it and check it
again on the console
now what we did is we changed the name
and Rule right so these are the two
properties we have both name as kaushal
and Rule as writer now let's see if we
can use the methods here as well
so we'll write here let's say we are
using the method even Dot
change name what we'll do here is we'll
change the name from kaushal to
something else let's say we are going to
change the name as
Ram
so if we save this now
so here you can see the name is changed
to Ram initially the name was caution
and when we use the change name method
now you can see here the name is changed
to Ram so this means that the methods we
Define inside the Prototype are working
right now let's say we want to create
another object here we created an object
even till now we assign some properties
to it and we changed the name and
printed it on the console now let me
tell you guys an alternate way to do so
so what we'll do is we'll copy this line
from here because the syntax of that
method also looks a bit same so the
syntax will remain the same till here so
we'll paste it here what we'll do next
is
we'll pass a few arguments here
so let's pass the arguments first then
I'll explain it to you guys so what we
are going to do is we are going to use
curly braces for arguments
and we are going to write here
it's a name and the value of name will
be we are going to write here value
and we'll pass the value as let's say
causal 2 right
so we'll use a comma here then we'll use
roll and
will pass the value of rule as well so
let's say the value of rule is
programmer now
right put a comma here now I know the
syntax is a bit complicated but this is
the reason why classes were introduced
in es6 so this is the reason we will be
using classes in future but going
through this syntax will make the next
one easier for you guys so we have
created an object here with the
object.create method and we passed few
arguments here so we have name and the
value of name we want it to be causal 2
and the value of role we want it to be
programmed so if we copy this from here
or let's say if we copy these two lines
from here if we cut these two lines from
here and we'll paste it here so if you
see here we have two objects of the same
name we have where even and here also we
have vary now both these syntaxes are
doing the same thing that is creating an
object of the same name suppose if we
comment this first object let's say we
are commenting this one and we'll also
comment this line if we save this now
and if we see on our console so here you
can see we have the name as causal 2 and
Rule as programmer
so these two syntaxes are doing exactly
the same thing the only thing to notice
here is if we use this line with this
syntax if we use even dot change name
and if we save this now you can see it
is not working in this case right so if
we want to do it we have to write
some more code so what we have to do is
we have to write here
writeable
and we have to
pass the value as true
so what we are doing is we are allowing
this method to change the name from
causal 2 to Ram so if we save it now
here you can see the name is Ram now
earlier it was causal 2 and now this is
working totally fine right so both the
syntaxes are doing the same things as we
can see here the reason behind going
through this is we need the syntax of
creating objects later in this video so
I hope you guys understood it
now moving ahead let's take a look at
prototypal inheritance so what we are
going to do is we are going to comment
this code
so we are going to comment all this and
we are going to write a new one for
prototypal inheritance
let's say we have a Constructor function
so let's create a Constructor function
first so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here let's say we are
going to create the same function we'll
take the same example of employee right
so we'll write a function employee and
we'll pass the properties here let's say
we are writing a name and another one is
ID and the last properties
salary of the employer right so next up
we have the body of the Constructor so
we'll write inside here this dot name
is equal to name
then we have this dot ID equals to ID
and then we have this Dot
salary equals to salary
right
so we know this already right we'll now
add a method to the Prototype of the
employee so we'll write here we'll write
outside this Constructor will write here
employee
dot prototype Dot
post let's say the name of the method is
post so what we are going to do is we
are going to write your function
and then we have the body of the
function so let's say this Returns the
post of the employee what we'll do is
we'll write here return
and
it will return the name plus post of the
employee right so we'll write here this
dot name
Plus
bit of space and then again
will write here
is the content creator let's say right
so we are done with the method here
as you can see what we did here is we
created a Constructor employee and added
a function that returns this string upon
calling so we haven't done anything
extra till now let's create an object
now so we'll write here let's say we are
creating an object
where caution and what we'll do is we'll
write a new underscore employee
and we'll pass the values here so let's
say the values are causal and the ID is
food let's say this is the ID 3 4 3 2 or
whatever it is and the salary let's say
is 10 000 okay so the next thing is
we'll write here console.log
and we'll print the value of question on
a console so let's save it now and here
you can see we have all the properties
here we have IDs 3432 name as causal and
salary as 10 000. here if you see inside
Proto you can see here we have a method
here name is post and we have
Constructor as employee and then we have
object as well now if we call the
Prototype post with this object so what
we have to do is we have to write here
in console we'll write a causal Dot
post
and here you can see we have the output
as causal is a content creator till now
it's fine right we did small things
which we learned in the previous few
videos so let's suppose we have another
employee named Arun and let's assume he
is also a content creator but he's a
master in JavaScript as well so we want
to mention it here along with all these
properties we have Name ID and salary
which we will inherit from this employee
Constructor and apart from that we'll
add another property which is the
subject or which is the language
property
so we have to create a new Constructor
here for it so what we'll do is we'll
write here
function and then we'll write the name
of this Constructor so let's say
the name is function programmer
so we'll write here name
will pass all the properties we'll write
a Name ID salary
and finally we have the language right
then we have the body of the Constructor
the first three properties will remain
the same right only subject or language
we have added languages so only language
will be added now we'll inherit these
properties from employee before the
concept of class was introduced
inheritance was based on prototypes only
so we'll see the concept of classes in
the upcoming video so
here what we are going to do is we are
going to call this employee
Constructor so we'll write here
employee Dot
call and will pass the properties which
we want to inherit so we'll write here
first this and first we have to write
the this keyword and then we have to
write other properties so we'll write a
Name ID salary
what we did is we called the function
employee and asked it to provide all the
three mentioned properties to the
function program
we'll set the value of language by Ursel
we'll write here
this dot language
equals to
language now if we create an object for
the Constructor program what it will do
is it will take all the properties from
the employee and language will be added
to those properties let's do it first so
we'll
create an object here we'll write here
where let's say the object name is Arun
and we'll write a new
programmer
and will pass the values let's say the
name is Arun
ID is four three two one
and salary is let's say 12 000.
and finally we have to add the subject
here as well or we can say language so
let's say the language is
JavaScript
next thing we are going to do is we we
are going to print this on Console so
we'll write a console.log
and we'll print a rune
right let's save it and see here we have
all the properties available with the
provided values we have name as Arun we
have ids4321 salary is twelve thousand
and language is Javascript
so this is how we can inherit the
properties in the derived Constructor
from the base Constructor the base
Constructor is the employee and the
derived is a programmer so coming back
to the console we can see here we have
all the four properties right
three of them are inherited and the last
one was assigned by us but I don't know
if you guys noticed here that we have
the properties only of the Constructor
so we don't have any method here right
so if we see here we don't have any
method of Constructor employee because
here you can see we have a method as
post and if we see here we don't have
any method so
if we write here let's say if we write
here in a console we are writing here
let's say Arun dot post
and will
run it so here you can see it says
around dot post is not a function
right this is because the Prototype post
is not assigned to the Constructor
programmer for that we have to write
some extra code we have to write here
so we have to write here
programmer dot prototype calls to object
Dot
create and we have to mention the
employee prototype
so we'll write here employee Dot
prototype right so save it now and here
you can see now if we go to underscore
underscore Proto we have post as a
method here
so if we write here
Arun dot post now
so here you can see it says Arun is a
content creator so we have to provide
the prototypes manually as well
let me show you guys one more thing now
see here it is not showing the
Constructor if we click here on the
Proto we don't have any Constructor here
named as programmer
so we have to set the Constructor as
well we have to set it manually and to
set the Constructor manually we have to
write here after this line we have to
write here programmer dot prototype
Dot
Constructor
equals to programmer if we save this
program now and if we go back to our
console and if we check here here you
can see we have a Constructor named as
programmer now
so you guys might be thinking that we
have to work a lot for all this
inheritance right the fact is we
actually had to do it before es6 was
introduced now if you want to do the
same with the help of classes the syntax
will be so easy if you want to kick
start your dream career and looking for
online bootcamp training and
certifications from prestigious
universities then take up the full stack
Java developer Masters program by simply
learn as we know the document object
model is simply the same HTML document
with a different representation right
the reason behind this diverse
representation is that it's easy for
JavaScript to interpret this format
JavaScript can't understand tags in an
HTML document but it can understand
these objects therefore JavaScript can
easily manipulate these objects using
different functions which we'll discuss
in today's video so if you haven't
watched the previous video on what is
document object model I'll suggest you
to go through it before we move on to
the Dom manipulation
in this tutorial we will understand the
basics of how we can use JavaScript
while creating or working on a website
it's like a real world application of
JavaScript in this particular video we
are going to discuss the window object
present in JavaScript we'll also see how
we can take input from the user for some
special tasks so let's move ahead and
discuss window object in JavaScript
a window object is actually a global
object present in the client-side
JavaScript that can be seen in a Chrome
browser let's move on to the programming
part directly and it will be easy for
you guys to understand
so let's write something on a console
first to see if the JavaScript file is
working fine or not so we'll write on
the console
we'll write here
console.log let's say we are printing a
string we'll write your welcome
to Simply code
right so we have to write a console.log
and we are good to go so save it and
here you can see we have the string
inner console so this means the browser
is working fine so let's create a
variable now let's say we are creating a
variable a and we'll write here window
let's suppose because we are talking
about the window object today now we
have written here window let's print
this variable on a console first and
then we'll see further so let's say we
are writing a console.log and we are
printing a on our console save it and
here you can see in the console that we
have the window object here and if we
click on this object see we have a whole
list of methods present here inside the
window object this window object
actually works the same as the date
object or the math object present in
JavaScript it also contains methods that
are predefined in JavaScript to perform
some specific tasks
so here you can see we have an alert
method here and we have many more
methods right so we have alert we have
close we have cookie store and so many
other methods as well if we go down here
we can see we have the document method
here as well
so
this document method contains the URL of
that HTML file and one can access it if
we copy it from here and if we
paste it here in a new tab so let's say
we are pressing enter and here you can
see we have the same HTML document we
have window.html open over here so this
document contains the URL of the HTML
file and one can access it with the
document method
next up we have two different ways of
using the window object in JavaScript
suppose if we want to use the alert
method so if you want to use the alert
method let's say we are
writing here
window dot alert this is the first way
of using the alert method save it and
let's say we are providing a string here
let's say
hello everyone
fine
so save it and here you can see we have
a pop-up in the browser saying hello
everyone right so we have a pop-up here
if we remove the window keyword from
this statement like if we remove this
window keyword from here and if we say
okay and let's save this program again
and here you can see we have the same
output again
so this is how we can use methods
present within the window object in
JavaScript we can either write window
dot the method name or we can just write
the method name both will work fine
let's move ahead and talk about the
prompt method so guys you might have
noticed that we never took any input
from the user till now if we want to add
two numbers let's suppose and we want
the user to input those two numbers of
the user's choice we have to use the
prompt method here to do so so let's
create a simple program that will take
two inputs from the user and then it
will print the output on the console or
directly on the browser so we have to
create two variables to store the values
given by the user so let's say we are
commenting these lines
and we are creating two variables here
so let's say the first variable is where
X
and the next variable is where y so we
are not giving any values right now so
next up we'll use the prompt method in
both the variables so what we have to do
is we have to write here
prompt and we have to enter what we want
to print on that particular prompt so
we'll write here let's suppose enter the
value of
X and we'll do the same at y variable as
well so we'll copy it from here and
we'll paste it here and we'll write here
enter the value of y one thing to keep
in mind with prompt is whatever input
prompt takes from the user it takes the
input as a string suppose we try to run
this program okay if you are trying to
run this program let's say
we are writing here
console.log and we are printing X Plus y
so let's try to save it so here you can
see it says enter the value of x so
let's say we are entering 45 and then
again we are entering 50. so we want the
output as 95 the moment we will press OK
you can see here the output is four five
five zero because the input taken with
the help of prompt method will always be
a string so if we want this to be a
number what we have to do here is we
have to use the percent
right I hope you guys are aware of this
term percent it is used to change a
string value to a number value so we'll
write here percent
and we'll
put it inside a bracket so
similarly we will do the same for
variable y as well so now we can add two
numbers without any problem
so let's save this program again and
here we have the prompt which says enter
the value of x so let's say the value of
x is 50 again and we'll press enter then
let's say the value of y is again 45
fine
the moment the user presses enter after
inserting the desired value like the
moment we'll press enter it will print
the output as X Plus y so it will print
95 on the console so let's see if it
works press enter and here you can see
we have the output as 95.
so we can do one more thing here we can
print it on the browser as well for that
what we have to do is we have to write a
document Dot
right and we have to pass the values of
X Plus y
so
let's save it now
and let's enter the value as 45 and 50
again so here you can see we have the
output as 95 on our browser so this
method is working totally fine
we'll use these two methods again in
other videos while manipulating an
actual HTML document with JavaScript in
the next video most probably so we'll go
through events and we'll see how
interesting it is to use JavaScript
along with HTML and CSS so for now let's
move ahead and take a look at another
method that is the confirm method we use
this method when we want to provide the
user with the choice of yes or no it
actually assigns a Boolean variable
whose value can be either true or false
depending upon okay or cancel whichever
button the user is clicking so let's see
the confirm method as well so what we'll
do we'll comment this
and again say we have a variable a as
window right so let's use this variable
so we'll write a equals to confirm and
any string we want to print so let's say
we are writing a are you sure
or anything else you want to write so
let's
write a console.log and we are printing
the value of a
fine
we have used console.log to print the
value this confirm method returns to
make it easy to understand so let's save
it and see here in the browser we have a
pop-up with a message are you sure and
we have two options right we have okay
and cancel if we click here okay so
let's click here okay you can see in the
console we have the output as true so
and if we click cancel here so you can
see the output is false in the console I
hope you guys understood this so till
now we know about alert prompt and
confirm method the fun part is we don't
use these method too much in general
these days because we have bootstrap and
CSS for doing these operations more
efficiently these days so we are going
through these topics because these are
the basic topics one should know while
working on JavaScript we should have
knowledge about window object to
understand how JavaScript is embedded
with HTML to make beautiful and
responsive web pages
similarly the document is also a part of
this window object fine so if we write
here let's comment this as well
and let's say if we write here
we have
variable a let's copy it from here and
we'll paste it here so let's say we have
a variable a and we'll write here window
Dot
document fine
next up we'll print variable a on a
console so we'll write a console.log and
we'll print the variable a
if we save it now and here you can see
we have the whole document here in the
console so if we click here you can see
we have the whole document we have all
the tags here we have head tag we have
body tag and even we have the script tag
as well so whatever tag we had in our
HTML documents all these tags are
written over here basically the entire
document is here right so we'll go
through Dom manipulation as well we'll
make changes to a particular HTML
document for now one thing I want you
guys to focus on is the window object
next up let's talk about the windows
inner width and inner height so if we
write here in the window.js if we write
here
window let's say window dot in a height
so save it and here you can see we have
the height as 149 now if we try to make
changes in the size of chrome let's say
if we try to change this size here and
let's refresh it see here we have the
output as 100 let's change it again and
refresh it again we can see the output
as one one one
and let's do it once more so here you
can see we have the output as 144 now
similarly we can use in a width as well
so if we write here in a width and save
it here you can see we have the output
as three three five so if we change the
width of this particular document and
refresh it here you can see the output
is also changed to 564. so these are the
two methods the inner height and the
inner width we might use them in further
videos similarly we have many more
methods present within the window object
to perform specific tasks we have the
location we have scroll X method we have
scroll wire which works the same as
innovate and inner height you can go
through all these methods for that you
have to write here
variable a and window so save it now and
here you can see we have all the methods
present here
so these all are the methods we have
present within the
window object so there are more than 100
methods present here or maybe more than
200 or 300 methods see scroll down you
can see we have a number of methods
present here you can go through any of
these methods
so you guys can use them by yourself or
we'll discuss the important ones
whenever we need them
this was a brief intro to document
object model manipulation we are going
to add some functionality to our web
page this means that today we are
working on a little bit of HTML as well
so let's move on to the programming part
and we'll see how we can manipulate a
basic design of a web page and we'll try
to manipulate it with dom so adding
functionality to a web page refers to
doing tasks like we want to perform
validations or having few text boxes for
a phone number or account number
so let's say we want only numbers to be
there inside these boxes or we don't
want them blank or any other
functionality we want to add then we can
use JavaScript so talking about HTML
let's do one thing here we'll create a
button with the help of button tag and
we already have this heading which the
h2 tag here right so we have this
heading Dom manipulation part two so it
is printed on a browser as well now what
we'll do is we'll create a button so
let's create an empty button first so
what we have to do here is we have to
write in this HTML document we have to
use the button tag and let's say the
button name will be
click here fine
so here we are we have created a button
save it and here you can see we have a
button named click here now talking
about events we have many events present
in HTML like if we are clicking on this
button so this is an event so if we
click here for now we can see nothing is
happening over here similarly we have
many standard events present in HTML
like click events scrolling events so if
you want to change the focus from one
text box to another or we are dragging
some text or selecting something or
double clicking on it as well what if we
target these particular events to
perform specific actions with the help
of JavaScript so these events are
basically the methods present within the
window object just like the on click
method we have we have the on click
method in window object right so we can
use on click method to perform some
specific task here so we'll see how we
can use on click method here for example
let's say we want this button to perform
a specific task when we click on it
right now if we click on this button
we can see nothing is happening over
here so let's say we want to show an
alert message on clicking over this
button so the flow of this click will be
like if we click here on this button
then something in the JavaScript code
has to register this activity and
perform some specific tasks like a
pop-up alert message or some sort of
other messages
so we have been through the alert method
present within the window object in the
last video so let's suppose we want a
pop-up when the user clicks on this
button so what is going to happen is
when we click over here where we want a
pop-up on our screen with a message
written over there so let's say we want
an alert with the message welcome to
Simply code right we can do it in
JavaScript with the help of functions we
already know functions right
so functions are statements we use to
perform some specific tasks we can call
them anytime here in this case if we
want to embed JavaScript within an HTML
document then what we have to do is we
have to use a window object method or
event we can say to call a function on
clicking the button
so we have to use the on click event so
let's try to do it what we'll do is
we'll write here button and over here
we'll write on click so here you can see
we have
other methods or we can say other events
as well we have on can play we have on
double click we have on scroll so we can
use any of them so for now let's suppose
we are using on click and we want to map
it to the JavaScript document so we can
do it with the help of functions so
let's create a function first so what
we'll do we'll go to the dot JS file and
we'll create a function here so let's
say we are creating a function named
function
let's say
button and then we have the opening and
closing round brackets and the body of
the function so we want this function to
return a pop-up with the message welcome
to Simply code right
so we'll write here alert
so I hope you guys are aware of this
alert term because we have seen we have
been through it in the last video so we
will write here alert welcome
to Simply code
and we'll save it so if we call this
function over here only so what we have
to do is let's see if this function is
working fine or not so we'll write a
button and we'll call it so save it now
and if we refresh this so here you can
see we have a pop-up with the message
welcome to Simply code so this function
is working totally fine we can use this
function with the HTML document as well
all we have to do is we have to write
the function name after the on click
event so we'll comment this statement
here and we'll go back to our HTML file
and we'll write the name of a function
here so our function name was
button
and here we have a function so save it
and here on the browser if we click on
this button so we can see the output as
a pop-up with the message welcome to
Simply code what it will do is it will
automatically call the function when the
user presses the button
so this is how we can map events in
JavaScript
we'll do so many such things in upcoming
videos like changing the style of text
and the on Mouse over effect we have in
JavaScript will also go through it and
we'll see many more such events in
further videos so this is just an
example of what is yet to come so let's
move on and talk about the get element
by ID method so let's say we don't want
this pop-up on click what we want to do
is we want to change this heading here
so you can see here we have the heading
as Dom manipulation part two we want to
replace this text with something else on
the button click so the function will
remain the same what will changes will
change the body of this function so
instead of writing here alert what we'll
do is we'll use the ID now so what we'll
do first is we'll provide ID to this
heading text so let's say this heading
tag has the ID named as
heading so we have the ID heading for
this head h2 tag so what we'll do here
is we'll write here document
so as you guys know document is also a
method present within the window object
right so we'll write here
document.getelement by ID
and will
pass the ID we want to use so here in
this particular case we want to use this
ID heading so we'll pass
heading over here so we'll copy it from
here
and we'll paste it here
fine then we have the dot inner HTML
property
so here in this case we want to take a
reference to the object H2 so we know H2
acts as an object in the document object
model right so we can use it to take the
reference of this object and also all
the objects do have some properties
right so the dot in HTML here is the
property of object H2 and it will hold
the value written inside the h2 tag so
the dot in HTML property holds the value
Dom manipulation part 2. so what we want
to do next is we want to change this
text to something else right so if we
want to write here something else so
let's say we want to write here
subscribe
simply code
fine
so let's say this is the string we want
to print here on clicking the button
so we want to change this text to
subscribe to Simply code although if we
save it now we don't see any change now
that's because we want the text to
change on button click so if we click on
this button now here you can see the
text is changed so similarly we can do a
lot many things with this now for
example we can store this value inside
our own variable so what we have to do
here is we have to write here where
C is equal to and now this where c will
hold the value returned by this
statement next up what we'll do is we'll
use the
alert method
and we'll see right here
so what it will do is it will take the
value so where c will hold the value
Dom manipulation part 2 and next up this
value will be printed on the pop up here
so let's save it now and if we click
here we can see here we have the pop-up
with message Dom manipulation part 2. so
we can use this dot in HTML method to
get the string present inside the H2
object and we can also use the alert
method with this variable then so there
are many more ways to access the
elements the document.getelement by ID
method is just one of them so let's move
ahead and we are going to use the div
tag first we are going to make few
sections of a particular section and
then we are going to use CSS for styling
those div tags so let's use the div tags
first so what we are going to do is we
are going to create a particular section
for all the div tags in the HTML
document so we are going to write here
div
and then inside this div we are again
going to create some more sections so
we'll write here div and then we'll
write here this is section
one similarly we are going to create few
more sections inside this div tag then
we'll
copy paste it and
will change the
names for this section so we will save
it now and here you can see we have
three sections we have section one two
and three if we go to element and if we
try to check the area covered by these
div tags so we can go here and we can
see this is the area which is
highlighted right now this is the area
covered by a particular div tag so
we have a div tag then inside that div
tag we have three more div text present
right so we have section one two and
three now we are going to use the
concept of class and IDs as well so
we'll write here class is equals to and
let's say the class for this div tag is
left
then again for this div tag let's say
the class is right
and then lastly the class will be
let's say center right so we have three
different classes here as well now if we
save it we don't see any particular
change for now but if we try to use CSS
here so what we have to do is we have to
use the style tag
and inside this style tag we have to
define the properties for particular
classes so for class left let's say the
properties background color and let's
say the background color will be crimson
fine next up we have the classes right
and for write the background color will
be
let's say dark blue
and then we have another class here as
well which is Center so for class Center
the background color will be let's say
gold
fine save it now and now here you can
see we have all the three sections with
different background colors this this is
section one so this particular section
has the background as Crimson then we
have section two with background is blue
and then we have section 3 with
background as gold right I hope you guys
are clear with this concept of class
till now next up I hope you guys are
already aware of this difference between
class and ID but let's go through this
concept quickly so whenever we want to
make changes in multiple elements in our
program we use class for example if we
want to use the crimson color as the
background color for section 4 and let's
say we want to use the gold color as
background color for Section 5. so what
we are going to do is we are going to
create two more sections and the section
4 will inherit the properties of class
left and the section 5 will inherit it
from
class Center so let's do it we'll create
here two more div
so we'll copy it and we'll paste it here
and again we'll paste it here we'll
change the names as 4 and 5 and the
classes as well so
the class of section 4 will be in left
and the class of Section 5 will be
Center so let's save it you can see here
we have two more div or we can say we
have two more sections present over here
we have section 4 and we have section 5
over here right
now if we talk about section 4 we can
use two classes here right so you can
see for now we have only one class over
here we can use another class over here
so let's say we are using a class named
size so for now we don't have any class
with name size so this is the syntax of
how we can use two different classes
within a single element all we have to
do is we have to put space between these
two classes and we are good to go so
let's define this class here so we have
to define the class size here so we'll
write here dot size and let's say we
want the font size to be
smaller so let's save it here you can
see the font size of this particular div
tag is changed the font is a bit smaller
when compared to other fonts over here
and if you want to do something more
like if you want to make it Bolder you
can do it or any other thing you want to
do you can do it with the help of CSS so
on the other hand the ID attribute
specifies a unique property or a unique
section so using the ID attribute we can
identify a unique element so as you know
we can use ID with document.getelement
by ID basically that is the only reason
we say that ID has to be unique
otherwise there is no problem if you are
using ID for two different elements if
you are using the same ID for two
different elements let me show it to you
with the help of an example so here in
this particular section in this section
4 we are going to use the ID attribute
as well so we are going to name this ID
as 1. save it now and we have to define
the ID here as well so for that we have
to use hash and then we have to use the
ID name
so let's say this
will change the font weight fine so it
will make it Bolder so so let's save it
now and here you can see this is section
4 is a little bit thicker than other
sections so if we want to use this same
ID for any other element right we can do
it there's no problem with that let me
show you guys so if we write a ID as one
and if we save this program now here you
can see there's no error with that we
can use this ID for section one as well
so it's not necessary that the ID should
be unique for every element of the
website but it has to be unique because
we can use ID for manipulating a web
page right we can use it with
document.getelement by ID so that's why
we prefer to keep the ID unique for
every element inside HTML document so I
hope you guys are clear with the
difference between class and ID by now
major differences class is used for
multiple targets whereas we use ID
uniquely for each element we want the ID
to be unique so that's the difference
between class and ID
moving ahead let's talk about the
document object model so what we are
going to do now is we'll go to the
Javascript file and we are going to see
the document object model now
by now we are aware of the document
object model right we are aware of the
window object we are aware of the
document object we have already came
across these two objects in the previous
video so what we are going to do is we
are going to write here where X we are
declaring a variable X and we'll write
here document so we already did this in
the previous video
so what we are going to do is we are
going to write here console.log and we
are going to print x on a console so
save it and if we go to console here you
can see we have the document here or we
can say we have the document object
model for the whole document for the
whole HTML document we know that the Dom
is a structural representation of HTML
document so we have here HTML tag we
have head body and almost every tag we
have here right you can see we have
script here we have div here we have all
the div tags present here now we know
that the document is also an object like
any other object right we already
discussed it it also has its own
attributes and properties as well so
next up you guys can see we have here a
fundamental website right so this is a
website basically what we have here is
we have five different sections and we
have a heading here as well right so
what we are going to do is we are going
to work on it with the help of document
object model so we can use CSS to make
changes to the syntax like we used
previously while creating divisions of
our web page but for now let's focus
upon the JavaScript part more so in
JavaScript we can write code that will
help us in manipulating the document
object model so this document object
model has a tree like structure with
HTML tag at the top then we have head
and body Tech and then we have all the
tags present inside them in a branch
like structure we are aware of this
right if we see here in the console we
have a document and if we try to open it
we can see we have HTML head and many
more texts present within all these
significant texts
next up if we write here document dot
all instead of document so if we save it
now here you can see we have the HTML
collection of all the tags with numbers
in front of them so here you can see we
have HTML head and then body tag and
here you can see specially we have the
classes as well here not just classes we
have the IDS as well so here you can see
we have div one here as well so this is
the HTML collection of all the text we
have in a HTML document and we can check
it with the help of document.all
property
now suppose we want to access a
particular segment in this program or in
this document we want to access elements
present within the head tag let's say or
within the body tag in that case we have
to write a statement that goes like this
so instead of document.all we'll write
here document.head
save it and here you can see we have the
head segment of this particular document
with all the tags over here so here you
can see we have meta tags and title tags
only because till now we haven't added
any particular tag in the head section
of a HTML document so let's do one thing
let's try to access the body tag
we'll write a document.body and save it
so here you can see we have the body of
our HTML document here with all the text
so here you can see we have the CSS file
as well we have background color for
each class and then we have the ID as
well so this is how you can access a
particular segment of your HTML document
with the help of JavaScript
next up sometimes it may happens that we
may include forms in our website and
later we want to access them in a
console so in JavaScript we have a
method for that also so what we have to
do is we have to write here document dot
forms so we'll remove body from here and
we'll write here forms save it as you
can see we have an HTML collection of
forms but we have no form for now in a
HTML document so it's showing zero so
let's do one thing let's add a form over
here so we'll write here
form and so let's say our form will take
three values so it will take name each
and then we have a submit button right
so we'll write here name then we'll
write a input
type is equals to
text and then we have name is equals to
name
fine next up we have the H so we'll
write here H input
type is equals to number
and
name is equals to
h
right then finally we have the submit
button fine so we'll write here input
type is equals to
button
and then we have value s
submit let's say
save it and here you can see we have
name
H and submit so let's do one thing let's
add the Break Tag or BR tag here
we'll do it here as well
save it and now you can see we have name
agent submit so this is basically a form
if we go to elements and if we go to a
form you can see we have the form
highlighted over here it consists of
three different properties it has name
it has H and then it has a button a
submit button basically so obviously it
will not work fine for now because we
haven't added any functionality till now
so we'll discuss about it in later
videos so for now our main purpose is to
access this form with the help of
JavaScript we'll go back to our
Javascript file we'll save it again and
now if we click over here you can see we
have a form present over here we have 0
and then we have form written over here
right so we can see we have input and
then we have the properties of this
particular form and all of this stuff
so you can see we have a form present
over here or we can access a form with
the help of JavaScript so now let's say
we have a scenario where we have four
different forms and we want to access
form three
from them so what we have to do in that
case is we have to write here
document.forms and we have to provide
the form number so as you know as you
can see here the form number starts from
zero so for form number three the number
will be 2.
fine so if we save it now it will show
an error because obviously we don't have
any forms over here till now so we have
added only one form but it will work
fine if you try to do it with more than
one forms so this is how you can access
forms with the help of JavaScript next
up we'll try to access images as well so
if you have added any image in your HTML
document you can also access it with the
help of JavaScript
so what we are going to do is we are
going to add an image over here
so let's do it first we'll write here
IMG then we have the image source as
simply code.png and then we have the alt
so we'll write here
Sim
plicode
right so we have added an image here
save it and here you can see we have the
image but the image is quite large right
so what we are going to do is we are
going to use CSS in this case we'll
write a ID and we'll let's suppose the
IDS 2 right we have used one already so
we'll write here two
we'll go to our CSS file we'll write
here so the property we'll write here is
Max width and Max height so max height
let's say will be 50 percent
and then we have Max width as well so
let's say the width is also 50 save it
and here you can see the image is fine
now so we have added this image over
here the main motive is to access this
image with the help of JavaScript right
so we'll go to a Javascript file instead
of document.form so we'll write here
document dot images and we'll save it so
here you can see we have HTML collection
with image here if you notice here you
can see we have the image with the ID as
well so you can see here 2 is written
over here after the IMG so this is the
image and we can access it with the help
of JavaScript we can access as many
images as we want with the help of
JavaScript so for now we have added only
a single image you can do it with the
help of more than one images
next up just like we can access images
we can access forms we can access the
body segment the head segment everything
of an HTML document similarly we can
access the links as well we can access
scripts as well so for that we have to
make minor changes over here we have to
write instead of document dot images we
have to write either document.links or
document.scripts so the syntax will
remain same all we have to do is we have
to write here scripts or links or images
whatever we want to access with the help
of JavaScript we have to write it over
here
so I want you guys to check it with the
help of links and scripts today we are
going to take input from the user with
the help of a text box in JavaScript
what we'll do is we'll create a text box
and any value the user will write inside
the text box will be stored in a
variable and then we will print that
variable in a message using the alert
method or in the control so whatever we
want to do we can do it
so let's create a small login page with
no styling because we'll be focusing
more on the HTML and the JavaScript
parts so for that we have to go to our
HTML file so here is a HTML file and
we'll write here
input
and then we'll write a type is equals to
name and then we'll write here
placeholder is equals to let's say enter
name
this placeholder is an attribute that
gives a slight hint whatever value we
write here will be printed inside the
box so this enter name will be printed
inside this particular text box
so save it and here you can see on the
browser we have a text box here here you
can see how this value is written inside
the text box you can see here enter name
is written inside a text box indicating
the user to write the name here so let's
create another text block here for the
password we are creating a login page
right so we'll be needing name and
password so we'll use the BR tag here
and then we'll write here
input type is equals to
password
and then we'll
use a placeholder here and we'll write
here
enter
password this type attribute here plays
vital role on this input element because
we have different types of values we can
use inside a text box like we have
numbers strings week time email password
and many more so here we are using
password
so save it and you can see here we have
two text boxes over here in the browser
so we have a text box for name and we
have a text box for password
next up we need a button to perform a
task right so we'll use the on click
method along with this button we can
either use the button tag or we can use
the input tag along with type is equals
to button so we'll write here input
type is equals to button and the value
will be
say submit
or we can write here login as it save it
and here you can see we have a button
over here named as submit so we are done
with the login setup here we have a text
box for the name and one for the
password so we'll write any name here
you can see let's write here question
and then we'll write the password here
let's say any random password and
nothing will happen if we click on the
submit button so let's add some
functionality to this submit button here
so we'll go back to HTML file and we'll
write here
on click so we'll write here a function
name
print fine
we'll create this print function now so
we'll go to our JavaScript file and
we'll create a function here so let's
say function name is print and then we
have the body of the function now this
function will be called whenever we
click on this button so whenever we
click on the submit button this print
function will be called now we want this
button to do something right we want it
to perform a certain task what we want
to do is we want the user to write their
name and password and we will print this
name and password in the pop-up with the
help of alert method so we'll use the
document.getelement by ID method for
this task let's give those elements
their IDs so we'll give these two input
tags their IDs so we'll write here
ID is equals to let's say you name or
username and then we have the password
for password will give the ID as you
pass fine save it and then we'll go back
to our JavaScript file now both these
elements have their own IDs we'll use
them in the Javascript file so we want
to use the values given by the user
right for that we'll create two
variables here inside the function print
to hold the reference of original value
so for that we'll write here where X is
equals to
document dot get element by ID and then
we have the IDS you name for the
username and then we'll write here Dot
when next up we'll take another variable
let's say where Y and then we'll write
here
document dot get element by ID again
then we have the IDS
you pass
we'll write a DOT value now what we did
here is we use the IDS to get the
reference of those values which the user
will input you might have noticed here
that we have used the value property
here after the IDS so this value
property Returns the value attribute of
any text box
now we have the values here present
inside variables X and variable y the
next thing we want to do is we want to
print these values right so for that
we'll use the alert method so it's quite
easy to use we'll write here alert and
then we'll write here
the name is and then we'll print
X so because variable X is holding the
value of name then we will
use slash n and after that we'll write
here
the password is and then we'll print the
value of Awesome
so we are done with it we have printed
the values of X and Y here now save it
and now we'll enter the values here
let's say the name is
caution and the password is simply code
the moment we click on this submit
button there will be a pop-up with a
message you can see it here the name is
kaushal and the password is simply code
we printed these variables here along
with the alert method
so this is how we can take input from
the user in JavaScript so we already
discussed that we want to create a login
form here with a specific name or
password right let's say we want the
user to be allowed only if the password
is simply cool otherwise the user should
be restricted from entering the web page
so this is a simple task all we have to
do here is we have to use the if else
control statements so for that we'll
write here after this statement we'll
write here if and then we'll write here
let's say pass we are doing it for
password right so we'll write a y is
equals 2 is equals to
simply code then we have the body of if
we'll write here alert
login successful
and then we'll write here else this the
statement will be
alert
wrong password
so we'll keep this line here so what
will happen is the moment will press the
submit button it will go to the if else
statement and it will check if the
password entered by the user matches the
correct password or not so if the
password matches it will print login
successful otherwise it will print the
wrong password
and then finally it will print the name
entered by the user and the password as
well so let's save it and we'll write
here the name as let's say kaushal
and the password let's say the password
will be different this time we'll write
here simply learn
so this password does not matches the
original password right the original
password is simply code so what we are
expecting is it will return wrong
password here so let's save it the
moment we press the submit button you
can see here we have a pop-up with
message wrong password because the
password we entered is simply learn so
if we press OK here in the next message
you can see the name is kosher and the
password is simply fine so let's do it
again this time we'll enter the correct
password we'll write here simply code
and we'll change the name as well so
let's say the name is
Rahul
submit it and here you can see we have
the message as login successful
we'll press OK and here you can see the
name is Rahul and the password is simply
cool in this tutorial we will see how we
can use radio buttons to take input from
users now HTML radio buttons are created
with the help of input text and the type
for creating radio buttons is Radio we
can use radio buttons on multiple
occasions for example we can create a
quiz question using a radio button at
one time only a single radio button will
be selected and we can use it to find
the correct answer so today we will use
radio buttons along with the ID
attribute and then we will create a
JavaScript function to find the correct
answer for a quiz so without wasting any
time let's move on to the programming
part
so first we will see how to add radio
buttons to our HTML document
in the HTML file we will write here
input
type is equals to radio
and then we have
value is equals to let's say option one
because we are using multiple options
right we have multiple options for a
single question or we have multiple
options here so we'll write value as
option one and then we'll write here the
value we want to print so we'll write
your option
one
fine save it and we have a radio button
over here you can see we can check it
and it has no functionality till now
so let's add another button first so
what we'll do we'll copy this line from
here and
we'll paste it and then we'll change the
option as option 2 and the value also as
option 2.
right save it again and here you can see
we have two radio buttons now
let's add a submit button here first so
we'll
write here
input type is equals to
button and then we have value is equal
to submit save it and here you can see
we have a submit Button as well one
thing you might notice here is we can
check both the text boxes right we can
check option 1 and option 2 both at the
same time so if we want to select only
one checkbox at a time we have to group
them so we'll use the name attribute and
the same name for these two radio
buttons so the name will remain the same
for both of these
radio buttons so we'll write a name is
equals to let's say
G1 and then we'll write here as well
we'll write here name is equals to G1
now these two radio buttons belong to
the same group
save it and now if you try to check both
these boxes you can see we can't do it
now because we have grouped them and now
we can select only one radio button at a
time right
now the next thing we are going to do is
we'll move to a JavaScript file and
we'll create a function there so we'll
move to a Javascript file so here's our
Javascript file and we'll create a
function here so let's do it first so
we'll write here
function
let's say the function name is
fun one fine and then we have the body
of this function so inside this function
we'll write here we'll take two
variables again for both elements so
we'll write here where X and then we'll
write a document Dot
get element by ID then we'll write here
the ID
so let's provide the ID to those
elements as well so we'll write here
uh before name will provide the ID so
let's say the ID for the first radio
button is red one and the ID for the
second one will be
let's say Red Two Fine save
and we'll go back to our Javascript file
we'll write here red one
and then we'll take another variable
we'll write here where Y is equals to
document dot get element by ID method
and then we'll write here the ID so the
ID for the second radio button is
red 2. fine we don't need the value
property here next up we have to use the
if else statement to print something
right so we'll write here we'll use the
if else statement we'll write a if
and then we have
x dot checked
is equals to is equals to true
then it will return something right so
we have a condition here as if x dot
checked is equal to is equals to true
this particular statement will check if
the radio button whose reference is
available at variable X is selected or
not this dot checked is the property for
a HTML element if the radio button is
checked the output will be something so
let's add the output here as well so the
output will be if the radio button is
checked
will be like we'll write a alert then
we'll write here the
option
selected
is
then we will write here
x dot
value so it will print the value of x as
well
now we have another condition here
we'll write here if white or checked
is equals to is equals to true
then it will return the options
selected is we'll write here plus y dot
value we are doing this because we have
three different conditions here right if
we select option one or if we select
option two or if we are not selecting
any of these options right so we have a
else condition for that and then we'll
write here else so here we have to write
else if
and then we'll write here else
and else part will print
alert no option
selected save it and let's do one thing
first we'll call this function with the
help of on click method so we'll go back
to HTML file and we'll write here in
this element we'll write here on click
and we'll call this function on click
so we'll write your fun one and we have
this function here save it and here we
are good to go
so if we move back to our JavaScript
file you can see here we have three
conditions either X is checked or Y is
checked or none of these are checked so
let's
check the output now we'll select option
one first we'll submit it and here you
can see we have the output as the option
selected is option one fine press ok
then we'll refresh this page and we'll
select option 2 and now we'll press the
submit button so here you can see on
selecting option two we have the output
here as the option selected is option
two right so what if we are not
selecting any of these two radio buttons
so
click the submit button here and you can
see we have the output as no option
selected so I hope you guys got it now
the syntax will remain the same if we
want to create a quiz so next up what we
are going to do is we are going to
create a quiz
so here is the code if you want to
create a quiz on your own so we have a
question here we have a question as
JavaScript was developed in the year and
then we have two options for it we have
1998 as first option so if we go here
you can see we have the first option is
1998 and then we have another option is
1995. obviously we know the answer for
it as 1995 will change the function name
here as
fun one
and save it
the Javascript file for this code will
look like this so we have three
conditions here again if x is checked
then the output will be wrong answer and
the correct answer is why and then we
have another condition for y if Y is
checked or we can say if 1995 is check
will have the output as right answer and
then we have another condition if none
of these radio buttons are checked we
have the output as no option selected so
let's see if the code works fine so save
it and we'll go to the browser so we'll
select option one first so we'll select
this 1998 submit it and here you can see
we have the output as wrong answer the
correct answer is 1995 right we have the
value of y here the value variable Y is
holding is 1995 so we printed it over
here and we have the output is y dot
value which is 1990
so if we refresh it and if we select
1995 here then we'll press the submit
button and here you can see we have the
output as right answer fine press OK and
we are going to do it again so this time
we won't be selecting any of these
options we'll just click on the submit
button and we have the output as no
option selected fine I hope you guys
understood it in the last few videos we
discussed the same thing right we saw
how we could take input using text boxes
and then we saw how we can take input
using radio buttons today we are going
to grab user's input with the help of a
select box in JavaScript so without
wasting any time let's move on to the
programming part directly first we'll
see how to create a select box in HTML
and then we'll move on to the JavaScript
part so let's move on to HTML and we'll
create a select box here if you guys
remember we use the input tag in the
previous few videos for text boxes and
radio buttons but for the select box the
scenario is a bit different we have to
use the select element in HTML so we'll
write here
select
so we have the select element here we
have to use this for select box in
JavaScript or in HTML so this select box
is used to create drop-down list of some
elements so we can add as many elements
as we want to that list so we'll use the
option tag for each component we are
going to use so the code goes like this
will
start with the select tag and let's save
this and see if it makes any changes to
a browser so you can see it on the
browser that we have a button over here
now we'll add options to this drop down
list for that we'll use the option tag
we'll write here option
and let's say we have three options we
have three car manufacturers name so
let's say the first name is BMW then
we'll copy this
statement and
we'll paste it again and again and then
we'll change the name of Manufacturers
so let's say another manufacturer is
Audi and the last one is food fine we
have three manufacturers now save it and
you can see it over here we have a drop
down list of three different elements we
have BMW or dn4 here next up we'll add a
button so a submit Button as we did in
the previous few videos for that we will
write here input type is equals to
button and then we have value
is equals to
submit fine
save it and we'll use a br tag here
save it now and here you can see we have
a drop down list here we have a select
box here and then we have a submit
button over here
fine now we want to print the option we
selected by clicking this submit button
for that we have to add functionality to
our HTML document right so we'll follow
the same steps as we did in the last
video wherein we used the radio buttons
and the text boxes so we'll write here
inside this input tag we'll write here
on click so what we want to do is we
want to call a function on clicking a
submit button right so we will write
here a function name so let's say the
function name is
selected
and we have to use the ID attribute in
the select element right so we'll use
the ID attribute here we are not going
to use our ID attribute inside the
option tags but we are going to use the
ID attribute inside the select text we
will write here ID
is equals to let's say
1. fine
so we have an ID here now we have to use
the value property here as well so I
hope you guys remember the value
property which we discussed in previous
videos so the value property is used to
access these values right so we'll write
here
value is equals to BMW and then for Audi
the value will be
OD and then for Ford the value will be
food fine save it and here we are done
with the HTML document so next up we'll
create a function in the Javascript file
so let's move on to the Javascript file
and we'll create a function over here
so we'll write here
function and the function name is
selected
then we have the body of this function
right so we are going to repeat the same
steps we are going to take a variable X
which will hold the reference of Select
statement so we'll write here
document Dot
get element by ID and then we'll write
here the ID so the ID is 1
so now we have a variable X which holds
the reference value of Select element
right
now we have used the document.getelement
by ID method to get the reference of the
selected value next up we'll use some
properties for select element while
printing the value with alert method so
if you guys remember in the previous
video wherein we use the dot checked
property for radio buttons so similarly
we have some more properties here for
the select boxes as well so let's have a
look at them
so we'll write here
alert
and then we have a property which will
go like this we'll write here x dot
options
and then we have
this brackets and Dot value
so this options property here is a
collection of all the options we have in
a select tag
we have multiple options right this
property works on arrays so we have an
array of all the elements and we can
access any of them for that we will
write here the index value right so
let's say the index value is 0 we want
to print the element present at number
one so we'll save it and the moment we
press submit button you can see here we
have the output as BMW now one thing to
notice here is
it doesn't matter which option the user
chooses the output will remain BMW for
all those cases because we are using the
first element of the array so no matter
which option the user is selecting the
message will be there with the value
present at index 0.
so we can say now that we can't use
static values right we can't use 0 1 or
2 here because we want
to provide the value dynamically because
we have three different values here and
we want to print the value which the
user selected not the one present at
index 0 1 or 2. so for that we have
another property here we have to write a
x dot
select
Ed index
and one thing you have to remember is we
have to write here x dot selected index
or any variable we are using here so we
are good to go now save it and if we
press submit now while
clicking on BMW so our first option is
BMW let's press the submit button and
here you can see we have the output as
BMW
and next up we'll be selecting Audi and
we'll press submit so here you can see
we have the output as already now
and finally we have Ford as well so
let's check it as well so press the
submit button and here you can see we
have the output is food
so this is how we can take inputs in
JavaScript from drop down lists next up
we'll go through a simple program as we
did in the last video wherein we'll
Create a quiz question and we'll check
if the option selected by the user is
correct or not so this is the code for
that so we have the question here is
Javascript was developed by we are using
another question different from the one
we used in the last video so we know who
developed JavaScript right so we have a
question here JavaScript was developed
by and then we have two options for the
same question the first one is Brandon
Ike and the second one is guidoven
Rossum
so then we have the ideas one for the
select element and the values are also
the same then we have a button over here
which will call function1 on clicking
and if we move to a Javascript file we
can see here we have a function fun one
and then we have a variable X which
holds the reference of value
returned by
document.getelement by ID method and
then we use this value so we have used a
x dot option so what we are doing is we
are basically checking that if the
selected value is equals to Brendan Ike
or not if the value is equal to Brandon
I then the output will be the answer is
correct else the output will be the
answer is wrong so let's save it and
we'll move back to HTML file and we'll
save this file as well so now here you
can see we have a question over here and
we have a select box which has two
options Brendan I can guide you in
Rossum right
so let's select Brendan Ike first press
the submit button and here you can see
it says the answer is correct fine next
up we are going to use gaido and Rossum
and we are going to press submit button
so here you can see the answer is wrong
we have been using the
document.getelement by ID method for the
past few videos right we know it is used
to access an HTML element with the help
of an ID which is uniquely provided to
each element
so we use that method with text boxes
then with radio buttons and then with
select boxes as well so today we are
going to use a method that is somewhat
similar to document.getelement by ID
method
so we'll be using the
document.getelements by tag name method
in JavaScript
as the name suggests this method is used
to access a bunch of similar elements
with the same type so we have tag name
in our method right so we can access a
bunch of tags with similar name like if
we have a few div tags present in our
program and we want to change each div
tags style we can do it with the help of
this method
so we'll look at the syntax first and
then we'll move on to the difference
between ID and tag name method so let's
move on to the programming part directly
what we'll do is we'll create a few div
tags first and then we'll change this
style of these div tags with specific
styling properties we are not going to
use CSS for that but in JavaScript we
have other styling properties as well so
we'll be using those styling properties
so let's create the div text first
we'll write here div
and then let's say we are writing it
this is section
one so we'll copy this line
and we'll create four similar div tags
right
we have section one two three and
four
save it and you can see over here we
have four different sections present
now this is a very basic example and
here we have different sections present
right next up we'll try to access these
div tags with the help of tag name
method so let's add a button over here
and then we'll move on to the JavaScript
part
so we'll write here let's use the BR tag
and we'll write here input tag again
we'll write a input type is equals to
button and we'll use the on click method
as well so we'll write here on click and
let's say our function name is
fun2
and then we have the
value of this button as let's say submit
close the input tag and save it so here
you can see we have a button over here
submit button and you can see here
nothing is happening on clicking on the
submit button
so next up what we are going to do is we
are going to add functionality to this
submit button for that we have to move
to our Javascript file and we have to
create a function over there
so we'll write here in the Javascript
file we'll write here function
fund 2 and then we have the body of this
function right so the syntax is a bit
similar to that of the
document.getelement by ID method what
we'll do here is we'll take a variable X
and then we'll write here
document Dot
get Elements by tag name and then we'll
write inside the brackets the name of
tag we want to access right so here we
have added four different div tags so in
this case we'll write here div and we
can similarly access any of the tags
present in an HTML document we can
access paragraph tags we can access
anchor text and any tag we want to
basically
so save it and here now we have a
variable X that holds an HTML collection
of all the div text present inside the
HTML file this means that we have an
array of references of all the div tags
here inside this variable X
so if we try to make changes in a single
array element just like we did in the
select box example wherein we use the
array index to access a particular
element present at a particular array
Index right so we can do the same here
will write a x and then we'll write the
index number so this particular
statement will access the element
present at number one
or this particular syntax will access
the
first div tag of HTML document because
we know arrays start from 0. and at 0
the first element will be present so
this div tag will be present at number 0
and then we are going to use the style
property so we know that X here is not a
variable only actually X here acts as an
object and we know that different
objects have certain properties in
JavaScript so style is one of those
properties and next up we'll write here
let's say
font family so what we are doing is we
are doing the CSS part with properties
present in JavaScript so let's say we
are changing our font to
Courier new
fine so this is a font name and we can
use any font name over here so save it
what will happen now is on clicking the
submit button the font of this
particular section the font of div 1
will change to Courier so let's try if
it's happening or not on clicking the
submit button you can see over here the
change between this line and other three
div tags clearly the font has changed
the new font is Courier new and what we
did here is we changed the font family
of this particular div tag so similarly
we can make more styling changes to
other div tags as well so let's do it
here
and we'll
make changes to each of the div tags we
have in a HTML file so let's say
here we are using the color property and
we want to change the font color to
blue
fine then we'll do the same for element
present at number three for that we'll
write here x and the index number will
be 2 so then again we'll use the style
property and then
let's say we are writing here
font
type fine and the font style we want it
to be italic
and then finally we have one more
property
let's say for x
for the uh repeat so let's say for the
last div tag we are using the background
color
fine and we'll write here the color name
is
red
so we are good to go now save it and we
have four different properties over here
for section four we are changing the
background color so three will be the
index number of the last array variable
so save it and on pressing the submit
button you can see the change over here
so for section one the font is changed
to Courier new for section 2 the font
color is blue let me Zoom it out a bit
to show you guys you can see over here
the color is blue and then we have
italic text in section three and finally
for section 4 we have the background
color as four right
so you can see how we are accessing any
particular element of the array now why
we are using these properties separately
for each array element
so if we try to make changes on each
element of the array we simply can't do
it in JavaScript at once so if we try to
write here so let's comment this out
first what we'll do is we'll write a x
dot style dot font family so basically
what we want to do is we want to change
the font family for all the div tags
present right because we know the
variable X is holding an array of all
the div text present in a HTML file
right so we'll save it and you can see
over here if we are clicking on the
submit button you can see nothing is
happening so if we go to our console
and you can see it over here that we
have an error here so it says it cannot
set property font family of undefined so
this is the problem with this get
Elements by tag name method to overcome
this problem we have a solution as well
so the solution for this problem is we
have to use the for Loop View so how
this for Loop works so we'll write here
4
and then we'll take a local variable I
and the initial value will be 0. then
we'll write a i
less than x dot length because we want
to Traverse the whole array right and
then we'll write here the condition I
plus plus so we are going to go then we
have this body of for Loop and inside
here we'll write X and the index number
will be I because it will keep on
changing and we are in a loop so we'll
write here dot style and then let's say
the style we want to do is font
weight and what we want to do is we want
to make our font Boulder fine
so comment this line as well save it now
and you can see over here everything is
clean now what will happen is on
pressing the submit button the font will
change the font weight will change
basically so let me Zoom this and if we
click on this submit button you can see
the font is more bold right so if we are
using another property here let's say
the font
we are using here
background color and we want the
background color to be yellow
fine so save it and on clicking the
submit button you can see the background
color for all the div tags for all the
four section is changed to Yellow fine
so this is how we can access all the
elements of an array at once now what we
did is we started a loop and traversed
every element in the array and applied
the same property to each element
so this is how we can do it with the
help of tag name method in JavaScript
now what if we have hundreds of similar
elements like div tag present in our
website and all of them are present at
different locations so let's try to do
it and what we'll do is we'll insert
certain different elements in between
these div tags
fine so we'll include a form and then
we'll include some radio buttons and
anything we want to do we can do it so
we'll add some more elements in between
these div tags
so here you can see we have inserted two
three more elements and between these
div tags so save it and you can see
after each section we have something
else here we have a form with two
different text boxes we have name and
age and then we have a submit Button as
well
then after that we have section two so
this is our section two then after
section two we have radio button and the
value is a then we have another radio
button B and in between we have all the
dev text present so basically what we
want to do is we want to change the
style for each of the div tags right
so we will change the background color
here so let's say we'll write here red
and what will happen is on clicking the
submit button on clicking this submit
button what will happen is the
background color of each div tag so the
background color for section one two
three and four will change to red so
let's try to do it and let's see if it's
working or not we will click on the
submit button and you can see it over
here we have all the div tags with
background color is red so this is
working totally fine
one more thing we will discuss before
wrapping up this video is the uniqueness
of ID attribute for each element
so we are saying this for a long time
that the ID for each element should be
unique wise although we saw in the past
videos that we can use the same ID for
two different elements when we did the
same for accessing a CSS styling
property using the ID attribute but if
we try to do the same thing with
JavaScript we'll get an error for
example if we try to access the value of
any particular element with the ID
attribute but we have two elements in a
HTML file with the same ID so it will
throw an error in that case basically
and this is the reason why we use the
tag name method in JavaScript so that if
we want to access multiple elements of
the same name we can do it with this
method because it's not possible to use
the ID method separately for each
element present in the HTML document
right because we have certain same HTML
tags present within an HTML document
like we have the div tags here similarly
a website is long enough to have
multiple similar elements present within
it so that's why we use the
document.getelements by tag name method
in JavaScript so guys in the past few
videos we use two different methods of
accessing an element from an HTML file
using JavaScript properties so we know
the difference between the ID method and
the tag name method right today we will
use another method to access a
particular element in JavaScript that is
the class name method or we can say the
get Elements by class name method in
JavaScript so before discussing the
class name method in JavaScript let's
look at why accessing an element is
important in JavaScript
so we know that the document object
model is used to change add or delete
HTML elements we saw earlier that we
could change HTML elements or the CSS
style of any element in the document
with the help of JavaScript properties
so to make specific changes to those
elements we need to access them using
particular methods so we discussed two
such methods before the ID method and
the tag name method right so let's move
ahead and look at the class name method
of accessing an element in JavaScript as
the name suggests the main attribute in
this method will be the class name so we
know the difference between the class
and the ID attribute used in HTML we
know that ID has to be unique for each
element but we know that many elements
in an HTML document can have the same
class right so we used Class to access
specific CSS properties in the previous
videos and that is the only benefit of
using classes in JavaScript so we can
say that a single class can be used by
many elements within an HTML document so
let's dig a bit deeper into this concept
so let's say we have five elements
present on our website and we want to
make changes in three of these elements
right so let's write the code here and
it will be easier for you guys to
understand so will write here in the
HTML file will add five different
elements so let's say we are writing
here
div and
then inside this div we'll write
this is
section one we'll copy this
will paste it here
so we'll use two div elements and two
paragraph element right so here in this
P tag we'll write this is
section three
and then we'll copy this line paste it
again copy this one as well and paste it
here
so we have section 1 Section 2 3
4 in
5. so out of these five different
elements we have three div tags and we
have two paragraph text so we'll discuss
why we have taken two paragraph tags in
between the div tags
so we are done with it here you can see
we have five elements present in a HTML
document three of them are the div text
section one two and five are div text
and two text in between are the
paragraph text so now let's suppose we
want to change the style of three of
these elements let's say 1 4 and 5. so
we can do it in two ways right either we
can use the ID method or we can use the
class method however we can use the tag
name method as well but we have to use
two different variables for that right
that will be a lengthy process why two
different variables because we have two
different tags present here right we
have to create separate variable for the
div tag and separate one for the
paragraph tag so that will be a lengthy
process so we'll consider ID method and
the class name method for here so
considering the ID method the
document.getelement by ID method we have
to provide unique ID to each element so
we have to provide unique ID to this div
tag then we have to provide to each and
every element here right because we need
to access
three of these elements so at least we
have to provide the ID to those three
elements which we want to access right
so in such cases we can use the class
name method where we want to access more
than one element but not all the
elements in an HTML file so we'll use
the class attribute in each element we
want to access
so let's say we want to access section
one two and five so we'll write a class
let's say the class name is cls1
we'll copy this paste it here and we are
accessing one two and four because one
two and five are the div text so we can
access these with the help of tag name
method as well so we'll access one two
and four
fine so we have used the class attribute
here
next up we'll create a button and then
we'll add functionality to a HTML
document so let's create a button here
we'll again use input type is equals to
button and then we have
on click
and on clicking it will call
and then we have the value as
submit fine
so save it and here you can see in the
browser we have five sections over here
we have section one two three four and
five then we have a submit button which
will call the function on clicking so we
haven't added functionality till now so
let's move ahead to our Javascript file
and we'll add functionality to a
HTML document
so inside this JavaScript file we'll
write here
function and then we have the function
name is
then we have the body of this function
so the syntax remains a bit same
so we'll take a variable first and then
we'll use the document method to take
references of all the elements from a
HTML file
so we'll write here
where X is equals to
document Dot
get Elements by
class name right and then we'll write
the class name here so the class name is
cls1
till now what we did was we took the
references of all the required elements
and stored them inside a variable named
X in the form of an HTML collection so
now we can make changes to these
elements and what we'll do is we'll
again use the style property to make
styling changes in those three sections
so we have these three sections present
inside an array and we can access any
one or all the three elements right so
we'll write here x and then we'll
provide the index number so let's say we
want to access section one that is the
first div tag so we'll provide the index
number as 0 then we'll write Dot
tile
and this style is a property dot then
let's say we want
to change the font style so we'll write
here
font style
font style will be
italic save it so this piece of code
will change the font style of the
element present at index 0. save it and
on clicking the submit button here on
the browser we can see the change in
this section right so if it's not
visible so let me Zoom it a bit for you
here you can see guys the font at
Section 1 is changed to italic right so
in this case we have all the three
elements present in our array and we can
make changes to each of these elements
so let's try to do it and we'll use
element present at index 1 now
we'll copy this line and we'll paste it
here again two times because we want to
make changes to all the elements right
we'll write it two and we'll write here
1. and let's say
we want to change the font color for
this one and the font color will be blue
for this we'll change the font weight
let's say
and we want to make it
bold
so we'll write here Boulder
save it and on clicking the submit
button you can see we have all the three
sections with some minor changes the
first one is changed and we have italic
over here for the second one we have
blue color as font color and for the
third one which is section four we have
the font readers Bolder so you can see
the change over here so this is how we
can make change to each element
separately and we can also make changes
in all the elements at once as well so
for that we have to use the for Loop
just like we did for the tag name method
right so for that we'll write here so
let's comment these three statements
first
and then we'll write here
four and
it will take a local variable here we'll
write you where I is equals to 0 I will
start from index 0 and I will go till
x dot length
and then we have the condition is I plus
plus
so inside the body of for Loop we'll
write here X and
instead of index number we'll write here
I because we want to Traverse the whole
array then we'll write Here style Dot
and let's say the style we want is
background color
we want the background color to be let's
say
yellow
fine
so this is how we can use the for Loop
save it and we'll see on clicking the
submit button on our browser the
background color for all the three
sections that is 1 2 and 4 is changed to
Yellow
this is how we can use the
document.getelements by class name
method to access all the elements
present in an HTML file with a
particular class next up let's discuss
the difference between the ID method tag
name method and the class name method so
we'll discuss when to use which method
so let's start with the ID method so the
ID method is used when we want to access
a single element and we have to provide
a unique ID to that element in order to
access it so the ID method is quite
useful when we want to work on a single
element
apart from that if we want to work on
more than one element we have two other
methods we can either use the class name
method or the tag name method for more
than one element
so the tag name method is also quite
useful when we want to access elements
with the same tag name we can access all
the similar tags present within an HTML
document with the help of tag name
method the only problem is we can access
similar types of tags only at one time
we can't access two different types of
tags with this method so this is where
the class name method comes into play we
can access more than one element with
this method and the elements can be
different just like we did here we had
div tag and paragraph tag right so the
section 1 2 and 5 are from div text and
the section 4 and 3 are from the
paragraph text so we can access two
different tags with same class name with
the help of class name method in
JavaScript so with this we came to the
conclusion that more than one element in
the HTML file can have the same class
and can be accessed with the class name
method so by now I hope you guys
understood the concept of all the three
methods which we have discussed the ID
method the tag name method and the class
name method in JavaScript we can use any
of these methods according to our needs
functions in JavaScript are a block of
code that is used to perform a specific
task we use functions for different
purposes right whether it be a button
click or we want to zoom out our image
by taking the mouse cursor over it we
use functions for all these tasks in
JavaScript we can use functions as
objects at the same time we can pass
objects to functions as parameters right
so similarly we can also pass a function
inside another function if I take you
through the programming part of this
concept the syntax will be like we'll go
to a Javascript file and the syntax will
be like will
declare a function let's say the
function is function ABC then here we'll
pass a parameter let's say we are
passing call as parameter for this
function ABC next up what we'll do is
we'll call this function inside this
function ABC Now what we did here is
really simple we created a function ABC
right next up we pass the function call
as a parameter to this function and then
we also call this function inside the
function ABC so this syntax is valid in
JavaScript and also this particular code
Here is known as the Callback function
in JavaScript so if we talk about the
definition of callback function it
states that a callback function is a
function that is passed to another
function as an argument and that
particular function will get executed
later in the program
now you guys might have heard in the
previous videos that JavaScript is a
single threaded language or JavaScript
works over a single statement at a time
or we can say JavaScript Works in a
particular top to bottom order
so if we talk about the sequence in
which JavaScript actually works while
coding so let's take an example for this
and we'll see the sequence in which
JavaScript will work so what we'll do is
we'll comment this code and we'll start
writing our new code here so let's
suppose we have three functions in a
single program so let's say we have a
function as function1
and then we have two more functions so
let's say the second function is
function two
and then we have
function
3 as well
now if we write something inside these
functions so we will execute the program
and what will happen is all the three
functions will be executed sequentially
so let's try to do it first
so what we'll do is we'll
write here inside the body of function
one so let's say we are using console
DOT log and inside this will print
function 1 on calling this particular
function
so we'll do the same for other two
functions as well so we'll copy it from
here we'll paste it here and here as
well so for function 2 it will print
function
2
and for function 3 it will print
function 3.
so let's save it and before checking the
output so what we'll do is we'll call
these functions as well so let's say we
are calling function 1 then function two
and then finally function
3.
right everything we have done till now
is quite understandable and we have
three functions here and all the three
functions will get executed in the
sequence in which we call them so here
in this case we have called Function One
first followed by function 2 and
function three so let's check the output
save it and we'll open the console in
the browser so we'll right click here go
to inspect elements and here you can see
we have a console here so here you can
see we have the output as function 1
function 2 and function 3. so we have
the output in sequence we call Function
One first so we have the output as
function one but if we call function 3
before function 2. so we'll cut this
from here and we'll paste function 2
after function 3.
save it and here you can see we have the
output as function 1 then function 3 and
then function 2.
2 so JavaScript will execute these
functions in the order in which we call
them right now what if we use the set
timeout function with function one so
let's try to do it first
so instead of calling function 1 alone
here we'll write here set timeout
then we have to pass two parameters here
one is the function name so one is the
function name here
and we'll write here the time so time
here will be in milliseconds so 2000
milliseconds here represents two seconds
this means that the function will be
called after two seconds
right
so this set timeout function will call
function when after a specific period of
time that is in this case two seconds
what will happen is Javascript will
start executing all the functions and
the system will find out that there is a
timer with function one so in this case
the system will leave this particular
function on execution and will move
ahead and execute other function so
function 1 will be executed
automatically after two seconds so let's
check the output
save it and you can see here we have
function 3 and 2 over here and function
1 will be executed after some time so I
hope you guys got this and here we have
used the set timeout method and function
1 will be executed after two seconds
now let's consider a scenario where we
have only two functions let's say we
have function one and function 2. so
let's remove this function 3
and we are left with only two functions
so let's say we have function one and
function 2 now
now what we want is we want to execute
these two functions but we have certain
conditions so the first condition is
function 1 will use the set timeout
method and it will be executed after
three seconds
and the second condition is function 2
will get executed only after function 1
executes so till now what we have seen
is if we are using these two functions
and if we are using the set timeout
method with function1 what is happening
is Javascript will keep this function on
execution and it will execute this
function till then so what we want is we
want to execute function 2 only after
the execution of function 1. this is
where the concept of callback functions
comes into play so we have to ask the
computer to execute function 2 only
after function 1 is done
so let me write this same code in
another way we'll use the set timeout
method within function1 so what we have
to do is we have to change
it here to 1 will call function 1 from
here and inside this function 1 what
we'll do is we'll write here set timeout
then we'll pass the first argument as
function and then inside the body of
this function we'll write this console
log
fine and we have to pass two parameters
here right so the next parameter will be
in the time so time here will be
3000 seconds so here we are and we are
done with our set timeout function now
this is another way of using the set
timeout method in JavaScript so what we
did here is we have passed the function
here as an argument and then we have the
body of function 1 inside the set
timeout function
what we want to do next is we want to
execute function 2 once function 1 is
completed so before that let's do one
thing let's check if it is working fine
or not so we'll save it
and here you can see we have function 2
executed before function1 right so it's
working totally fine now what we want to
do is we want function 2 to execute only
after function 1 is done right so let me
tell you a shortcut for that guys it's
not callback functions but it's kind of
same thing it will do the same thing as
the Callback functions but it is a
different concept so what we have to do
is we have to cut this function 2 from
here and we have to call this function
inside here inside the set timeout
method so we'll paste it here and we
have to call function 2 inside the set
timeout method save it and now if we
wait for three seconds and here you can
see we have both the functions function
1 and 2 execute it on time so both the
functions are executed after three
seconds
and this is not callback functions but
this is a shortcut for that what
happened here is when function 1 is
being executed the system came to know
that the function 2 is called inside the
set timeout method so what will happen
is it will first execute the set timeout
method and then it will execute the
function 2. so what we did just now is
not callback functions but the
functioning of a callback function is
also the same this is the same thing
we'll do with callback functions but the
syntax will be different now by the
definition of the Callback function that
we came across earlier it states that a
callback function is a function that is
passed to another function as an
argument so keep your focus on this word
argument and that particular function
will be executed later that function
which we passed as argument will be
executed later
so here in this definition later means
once the system is done with the first
function or we can say the primary
function it is now free to perform
function 2 or the secondary function or
the Callback function we can say
so we have kept it on hold till now so
let's take an example of that as well
what we'll do is we'll create a function
and we'll pass an argument inside this
function
the value will be provided while calling
the function so let's do one thing first
let's comment this code
and we'll write a new code here so we'll
create a function let's say a function
is function person and we'll pass an
argument here so let's say the argument
is friend fine
next up will work on the body of this
function what we'll do is we'll again
use
console.log and will print something so
let's say We'll
write here
my
friend's name is
and then we'll use the plus operator
with the
value of friend
who will write your friend
and with this we are done with our
function person next up what we'll do is
we'll write here
function
person
2 and we don't have to pass any argument
here so inside the body of this function
we'll again use console.log and we'll
write here
my name is
caution
fine
so
next up what we have to do is we have to
call these functions right so we'll
write your person
and inside this we have to pass the
value so let's say the value here is
simply code that's fine next up we'll
call person two
and we'll save this program so on saving
this program you can see we have the
output as my friend's name is simply
code so if you want me to zoom it you
can see here now here it says my
friend's name is simply code and the
second function says my name is kaushal
right so this program is working totally
fine this is a basic program wherein we
created two function and now what we
want to do is we want the function
person to
will get executed after function person
so for that we have to pass function 2
as an argument in the function person
so we'll change the code
we'll pass this function person 2 as an
argument so we'll write here
person two we don't have to use brackets
here so because we are passing it as an
argument
now
we did it we passed this function as an
argument the next step is to tell the
function person about it right we have
to pass another argument in the function
so
we have to tell this first function that
we also have another function which will
get executed after this particular
function
so we will write here
we can use any name we can use another
name for that or we can use the same
name as of function person two so we'll
write here
person two
and then what we have to do is we have
to call this person to function after
this
right now we are done with this code now
we are done with a callback function
here in this case this function person 2
is known as the Callback function
so save it now
and
okay what we have to do is we have to
remove this line from here so save it
now here you can see we have the output
totally correct we have the output as my
friend's name is simply code and my name
is caution
now we are done with almost everything
we are done with the Callback functions
but you might not see any change in the
output right to witness the change what
we have to do is we have to use the set
timeout method again because we want
this function to execute only after
function person so what we have to do is
we have to write here
inside function person we'll write here
set timeout and
then we have to write a function
and then
inside the body will do the same we'll
cut these two brackets from here and
we'll paste them here and inside here we
have to write the time so let's say the
time is 3000 fine
now what we did is we use the set
timeout method with function person and
inside the body it will print my
friend's name is and the friend's name
is simply good and it will be executed
after three seconds right so let's save
it and we'll count for three one two and
three so here is the code you can see
here the output says my friend's name is
simply code and my name is kaushal so
this is working totally fine so this is
how the concept of callback functions in
JavaScript works the word promise seems
a bit familiar we make promises
regularly right if I say I promise you
that will cover everything on promises
in this video now this promise that I
made can only have two possible outcomes
either the promise will be fulfilled or
resolved or we can say the promise can
be failed or rejected the promise will
be resolved if we'll cover everything on
promises in this video but if I left out
some topic or there is any subtopic
within promises which we forgot to cover
in this video that will be a failed
promise or we can say a rejected one now
there is another term in between these
terms that is pending pending is the
time in which the system works on the
promise
so just remember these terms as you may
hear them during an interview
so let's move on talking about a proper
definition of promises we can say that A
promise is an object which will produce
value sometimes it either gives us a
value or an error with the proper reason
there is no specific definition for
promises in JavaScript you will
understand the topic much better while
working on the syntax
so let's move ahead and we'll go through
a simple example first to understand a
promise in JavaScript
as we mentioned earlier that A promise
is an object so what we have to do first
is to take a variable and declare an
object so for that we'll go to a
Javascript file and we'll write here
we'll take a variable let's say a
variable name is prom and we'll write a
new
promise so this statement here is a
promise we have an object named prom
Next Up This Promise will take a
callback function we have already
discussed the concept of callback
functions in the previous video so if
you haven't watched that video yet I
recommend you to watch it so a callback
function is a function pass to another
function as an argument remember so
we'll write here
inside this object we'll write here
function
and now this callback function here will
have two arguments one to resolve and
another for the reject that's because we
can have only two possibilities in a
promise right either it can be rejected
or it can be resolved so we'll write
here
results and then after a comma we'll
write here reject fine then we'll have
the body of this function
so this is how a promise will look like
you can change the name of these
arguments instead of resolve or reject
you can write here anything but we have
kept it simple for now so that it will
be easy to understand next up let's use
a simple condition here let's take the
example of driving a car fine
what we'll do is we'll take a variable
drive and we'll check if the user
learned how to drive a car if yes then
the promise is fulfilled otherwise the
promise is rejected
so let's do it here we will write here
where Drive
and let's set the value of this drive is
true for now let's say the user learned
how to drive a car
so next up what we'll do is we'll use
the if else conditional statement to
call any one of the two functions we can
either call resolve or reject right so
we'll write a if and the condition will
be drive so if we left it with drive
here it will check for if Drive is
equals to True right so we will call the
function resolve if the condition holds
true and then we'll use the else
statement for else we'll write a else
and then we'll write here
reject
fine
any value other than true will call the
reject function here so what we did here
was an easy task we know that the value
for the variable Drive is true so in
this case the resolve function will be
called if we set this value of variable
drive to false then the function reject
will be called
the next part of the program is to
execute this promise so this will be the
longer part as we have to use two
methods here so for that the syntax will
start with the promise name and then
we'll use the dot operator so let me do
it here we'll write here
prom and then we'll use the dot operator
next up we'll use the then keyword so
this then keyword or it is a method
actually
it is called when the method is resolved
or when the promise is resolved so we
have another method for the rejection of
promises that we'll discuss afterwards
so we'll write here from dot then
now this is a method so we will use
brackets here
when this method is called it means that
the promise is resolved we'll use a
callback function within this method so
we'll write here function and then we'll
use
the resolve function here so we'll write
here
resolve fine
and then we'll have the body for resolve
so this is how the execution will look
like for promises and on filling the
promise there will be a statement
printed on the console so it will be
like will write here
console.log
and we'll write here something so let's
say we are writing here
resolve
and let's say
the user
knows how to drive fine so we'll write
here this
now we are done with the part in which
the promise will be fulfilled one thing
I forgot to mention here is we have to
pass this resolve here so whatever value
we'll write here will be shown in
console so let's say we are writing here
for True Value we'll write here yes
fine now if we save this program and
check for the output we'll get the
output as yes the user knows how to
drive we can check it so let's save it
and here you can see in the console we
have the output as yes the user knows
how to drive let me put a space here so
let's save it now now it's clearly
visible so it says yes the user knows
how to drive
so this is working fine now the next
part will be for the condition if the
promise gets rejected so just like we
had the then method for resolving the
promise similarly we have one more
method for the rejection part so for the
rejection part we have the catch method
so we have to change this method here
only after the then method so we'll come
here and we'll write dot catch
and the rest of the syntax will remain
same so we'll write here function and
then we'll call reject
then we'll have the body of this reject
part and we'll write here inside this
console.log
and we'll write here reject
Plus
the user
does not know
how
to drive
fine the catch method uses the reject
function and the output will be no the
user does not know how to drag so before
that we'll have to pass an argument here
so we'll write here no
and save it now so for now it says yes
the user knows how to drive to check for
the reject method we have to set the
value of variable drive as false so
let's change the value here let's say we
are using
false here now save it and you can see
here the output says no the user does
not know how to drive fine so this is
working totally fine now you guys might
be thinking that this program we just
did is so easy we could have done it
with if else conditional statements then
why are we using promises for this the
syntax is extended and we have to
remember a lot of terms and methods for
a promise right the good part is this
was just an example to make you
understand the syntax of promises in
JavaScript
next up we'll go through an example
wherein we'll discuss the dependency of
promises as well so let's move ahead and
in this example what we'll do is we'll
create three separate functions let's
suppose we want to learn promises in
JavaScript
but for that we must know about the
concept of functions and callback
functions in JavaScript then only we can
go through promises so what we'll do is
we'll create three functions in which
the current function will depend upon
the previous function if the user knows
about functions he can go through
callback functions and if the user knows
both functions and callback functions he
is good to go for promises so let me
take you through the code guys
so here's the code we have three
functions the first one is for functions
topic so this functions is the topic
similarly we have callback and Promises
as well so the first function is for the
functions topic and if the user is done
with functions in JavaScript then he can
move on to callback functions and then
to promises so we have three different
promises for each function right so each
function here like the first function
returns a promise right similarly all
the three functions are returning a
promise here we are directly resolving
it we don't need to wait for the user to
learn functions completely otherwise we
can use here the reject function as well
for now we are just resolving it which
means that the user learned functions in
JavaScript already the same goes for
callback functions and Promises as well
next up what we have to do is we have to
execute the promise that once the user
is done with functions he can move on to
callback functions and then to promises
so for that we have to execute promise
like this only but the syntax will be
different so let me show you guys
so here is the code for that as well
what we did here is we use the first
function here so functions is our first
function and on resolving we call the
function callback with the result and we
did the same thing again for a callback
on resolving the Callback function it
will call the promises function and
finally it will print this good to go
message on the console with the previous
messages written by the resolve method
so we are basically working on the
dependency of promises in JavaScript now
let's save this program and we'll check
the output on the console so
save it and here you can see it on the
console it says good to go and then it
says learned functions learned callback
functions good to go for promises in
JavaScript
now this same program can be done with
the help of callback functions as well
but the code will be so confusing
because we have to Nest all these
functions inside a single function and
then it will be a mess right the code
with promises is clean you can see here
the code is clean all we had to do here
was to create functions then return
promises on call and then we can execute
those promises with their dependency
so this is how promises in JavaScript
actually works now we have been using
functions in almost every video since we
came across this topic whether it be Dom
manipulation or using an event in
JavaScript functions are everywhere
right
so this concept of Arrow functions is
just a change in the syntax of declaring
and defining a function
so let's go through the concept of
functions in JavaScript quickly so that
it will be easy to change the syntax
later what we'll do is we'll create a
function with multiple parameters and
then we'll create another function with
no parameter at all so we know these
Concepts already so let's write the code
here so we'll go to a Javascript file
and we'll write code here so we'll write
a function let's say the function name
is
Funk one
and then this function have two
parameters A and B
now this function will return something
so we'll write here return
let's say this returns a plus b
fine now the code we wrote here is to
find the sum of two numbers right we'll
pass the two numbers as arguments while
calling the function so let's check on
the console once if the code is working
fine or not so we'll save it go back to
the browser go to inspect and then we'll
go to a console and we'll write here
function name and then we'll pass
certain parameters right so let's say
the parameters we are passing are 15 and
25 so the output we are expecting is 40
and the output is correct we have the
output test 40 you can see here we have
the output as 40. and so this function
is working totally fine next up we'll
create another function first and then
we'll move to the arrow function syntax
so for the second function we'll write
here
function let's say the function name is
function
and this function will have no
parameters at all right so let's say
this function prints something on the
console right so we'll write a
console.log and then let's say this
function prints
welcome
to Simply code
we are done with it so let's do one
thing we'll call this function here
we'll write a function calling the
function is pretty easy we can do the
same thing here as well so let's save it
and check the output here you can see we
have the output as welcome to Simply
code in our console
so this is how we were using functions
till now the simple Syntax for functions
right so let's move on to the concept of
Arrow functions now this function over
here has two parameters right this
function has parameters A and B
and what we'll do is we'll change the
syntax of this function and the new
syntax will be more simple once you get
used to it so let's write the newer
syntax just below the previous one we
don't need the function keyword with
arrow functions so all we have to do is
we have to take a variable so let's do
it first so let's say we have a variable
where
fine so this is our variable
this statement is simple we have a
variable named errone and this will be
the function name so Arrow 1 will be the
function name as well right when we use
the function keyword in traditional
syntax of functions it automatically
creates a variable with the function
name here we have to declare the
variable by herself next up we have two
parameters here A and B as you can see
here we have a and b
we'll write the parameters within
parenthesis now so what we have to do is
we have to write parameters so let's say
the parameters are A and B for this
function as well so these are the
parameters we have to write them within
parenthesis
now we will use an arrow that actually
makes this variable a function now this
is the main concept to create an arrow
what we have to do is we have to write
equals to and then we have to write this
so This Is The Arrow Mark which makes
this whole statement a function
and then we'll write the body of the
function so the body of function will
remain same so we'll copy the body from
here
and we'll paste it here so this function
here this function Arrow one here is the
same as function function and the output
will be the same
this Arrow function here has only one
line here so the advantage provided by
Arrow functions in this case is quite
help
what we can do is we can make this
function up one line if we remove this
return keyword and the curly braces here
so we can remove these curly braces as
well what we have to do is we have to
make this function of one line right so
there will be no difference now so this
is how the arrow function for this
traditional function looks like now both
the functions will return the sum of two
numbers the only difference is in syntax
let's check the output for the arrow
function as well so what we'll do here
is we'll save this program and will
go to a console so let's do one thing
we'll call func one first and the
parameters let's say are 5 and 15. and
then we'll call the arrow function with
the same parameters so we'll write a
arrow 5 comma 50.
now we have the output s20 in both the
cases right so these two functions are
working similarly these two functions
are same the only difference is in the
syntax
next up we have another simple function
here and what we want to do here is to
convert this traditional function into
an arrow function right now we are
talking about function function so let
me comment this first function here what
we'll do is we'll comment this and now
we are good to
so we have function func2 here now what
we'll do is we'll create an arrow
function for this function
so we'll write here
so we are writing here where
Arrow 2
and then we have no parameters so empty
parenthesis and then we have the arrow
operator so the body will remain the
same we'll copy the body from this
function
and we'll paste it here
now we have used empty parenthesis here
because we don't have any arguments here
let's try to run this code we'll call
the function here only so
for this we have to write here
Arrow 2 and we are good to save it and
the output we are expecting is
welcome to Simply code twice because we
are calling func 2 as well right so save
it
and here you can see the output is
welcome to Simply code let's change
something here so what we'll do is for
Arrow function we'll write here
simply learn
fine
so save it now and here you can see we
have the output as welcome to simplicode
and welcome to Simply learn let me Zoom
it for you if it's not visible so here
you can see the first output for Funk 2
it says welcome to Simply code and for
Arrow 2 it says welcome to Simply learn
that's working fine now before we wrap
up this video let me tell you another
benefit of using Arrow functions so we
already discussed that we don't need to
use the return keyword if we are writing
a one line of function similarly if we
have a single parameter we don't need
any parenthesis we'll create another
function here so let's say we are
writing here where
Arrow 3
and let's say it has only a single
parameter as new name fine then we'll
use the arrow operator and then inside
the body of this we'll write here
console DOT log
and then we'll write here hey there
plus the name provided by us in the
argument so
now we are good to go this function here
will give us the output as hey there and
then whatever name will pass while
calling the function so let's check it
let's call this function as well so
let's say we are writing here Arrow 3
and the name let's say will be
caution
save it and here you can see it says hey
there question for Arrow function three
so this is also working fine
and I hope you guys are now clear with
the arrow functions in JavaScript it's
not essential to use Arrow functions
everywhere but now that we are clear
with promises and callback functions it
will be good to write minimum code and
the arrow function will help you with
that async await works with promises in
JavaScript
if you are not clear with Promises by
now I recommend you to watch the
previous video on promises in this
playlist and it will be easier for you
guys to understand async await in
JavaScript now async of it is just a
syntactical sugar wrapped around
promises in JavaScript basically it
makes it easier to work with promises in
JavaScript
we already know that using promises
might be a bit tricky or we can say more
prolonged sometimes because we have to
create so many functions and Promises in
JavaScript
so before we move on to async await let
me take you guys through this code which
has promises in it and then we'll see
how to use async await in JavaScript so
here is a code for promises in
JavaScript here in this code we have two
functions make order and process order
the make order function returns a
promise and it will resolve it if the
user enters black coffee otherwise it
will reject it on any other type of
coffee
then we have another function here for
processing the order and it will always
resolve so this function is quite simple
and it will add some extra information
to the order so here is the code for
extra information it will print this on
Console so let's move ahead and we'll
look at how we call these functions
using promises and then we'll change the
same code using a sync await let me do
it guys first and then I'll explain it
to you so here's the code now what we
did here is we call the make order
function
and will pass here black coffee as an
argument to make it successful then we
have used the dot then because we are
using promises here and then we have the
order that will be returned by a promise
so which in this case is a string that
says here is your coffee this is the
string if I show you so this is the
string it will return and then we have
written here console.log order has been
received it will be printed on the
console
and then we have called the process
order function and we are going to
process the order that we received and
the reason we are returning this is
because so you can see here we are
returning this process order function
the reason behind it is because we are
using promises here then we have changed
the event here so we have used the dot
then operator again we are going to
receive the response from the process
order above in this case we have taken
it as processed order and we have logged
whatever response we will get you the
next thing we did here is to use the
catch block to catch any type of error
we get for example if the user says he
wants a latte not black coffee then it
will give an error and it will say that
we serve black coffee only so this is
the code for error so that's all and we
are calling these functions so if we
save this program
let's say we are saving it and if we go
back to our console
so here you can see the output says
making request for a black coffee and
then it says order has been processed
then it says processing order and then
at last it says extra information plus
here is your coffee have a nice day
that's how we wanted it to be right now
if the user says he wants a latte in
place of black coffee so let's check it
out and what we'll do is we'll pass the
argument here as latte instead of black
coffee
so save it now here you can see it says
making request for latte so firstly it
made a request for latte and then it
returned the error there it says sorry
we serve black coffee only so it's
working totally fine and this is how
promises actually work in JavaScript all
the different codes here are executed
and it is waiting for the previous code
to execute before moving on to the next
one so that's what we exactly wanted
here now if you look at all this code
here which is obviously not too much
confusing but we have to use more dot
than here right we have to go through a
lot of nesting here and it could be done
easily with a sink of weight in
JavaScript and one more issue with
promises is if we want to use the
parameter inside this first dot then so
if you want to use a parameter here what
we have to do is we have to first create
a variable and we have to assign
something to that variable which is not
an easy task right but with async and of
it we can do it more efficiently and we
don't have to worry about all the dot
thens and all so now we'll do the same
program with async end of it and we'll
do it here only below this program
we'll write this piece of code with the
help of async of it and we'll see how
easy it is to use async and await in
JavaScript so let me comment this first
guys now the first thing we need to keep
in mind with async and a weight is we
need a function to use these terms for
example let's create a simple function
here host so we'll write your function
let's say the function name is function
and then we have the body of this
function so this is the basic function
here and we'll put all our asynchronous
code inside here in this function but we
need to tell JavaScript that this
function will work asynchronously for
that we have to write a keyword here
before function so what we'll do is
we'll write here
async and this is the syntax now
JavaScript will know that this function
is an asynchronous function and it will
handle this function accordingly now
inside of this function what we'll do is
we'll call a different methods here
so we'll call the make order method here
and then we'll call the process order
method as well so let's do it first
let's call the make order method first
so we'll write here
make order and we'll pass the argument
here so the argument will be let's say
black coffee
fine
now we have called the function make
order here all we have to do is we have
to write a weight in front of this
function which will make the code wait
until this make order function executes
then only the next part will be executed
so we'll write here of it and this make
order function now will return the
resolve section of the first promise we
made so we'll store this inside a
variable so we'll write here let's
create a variable here we'll write where
order
fine
because we have all this code inside of
an asynchronous function what will
happen is as soon as JavaScript finds
that a weight keyword so as soon as
JavaScript find this await keyword
it will leave this function and start
doing other works inside of this program
remember it will leave this whole
function it's not something like the set
timeout method it is different from that
as soon as the make order function is
done executing it will come back to this
function and Returns the result into
this order variable
next up what we'll do is we'll write
here
console
Dot Lock
and what we want to log here is order as
be received now
if we look at the promises example
previously and compare these two codes
so if you can see here we are done with
this part so this is what it looks like
while working with a sink of weight in
JavaScript
now we'll see that we have received the
order with pretty easy syntax right next
up what we have to do is we have to
process this order this means that we
have to write the code for the second
then we used in the promises example
right the syntax will remain the same
for that we'll write here where
processed order
is equals to
a weight we'll use the await keyword
again
and then we'll write here
process order
fine
and then we'll pass the argument as
order so we are passing this variable as
an argument to this process order
function
in the next line we'll write here
console Dot Lock
and we'll copy this this line is the
same so we'll copy it from here we will
paste it
fine now we have used the variable
processed order to process the order and
then we know that as soon as the
processing is done we want it to log it
in here so we are done with this and all
we need to do now is called a
synchronous function and we are good to
go so let's call this function first for
that we'll write here
Funk one
and now save this program
so here you can see it says process
order is not defined
so okay we have to remove this e here
now save this and here you can see we
have the exact same output as we had in
the promises example and with this we
can say the sync a weight are working
totally fine now the question arising in
your mind may be that we didn't do
anything for the catch block here right
what if the user enters latte in place
of black coffee so let's try to do it
once so what we'll do is we'll write
here
latte and save it so you can see the
first function is working fine it says
making request for a latte and then it
says
sorry we serve black coffee only so this
is a error and chord error in promises
so we have to do something about this
error right now the async and await in
JavaScript actually has two blocks one
for resolving and the other one for
error or reject so we can say like the
then and catch in promises we have try
and catch in a sink of it so what we
have to do here is we have to put all
this piece of code inside the try block
so let's do it first what we'll do here
is we'll write here
try so what we are doing is we are
asking the computer to try this piece of
code if this is fine or not
and then we have another block catch
fine
so we'll write the code for rejection
here inside the sketch block what we'll
do is we'll write here catch and we'll
pass a argument here
so we'll write a error
and then we'll log this error on a
console so we'll write a console.log
error
so we have passed the parameter here and
the moment it will find any error it
will leave the try block and moves on to
the catch block and the output will be
an error so save it and you can see it
here
on the console it says sorry Vsauce
black coffee only so this is how we can
use a sync await in JavaScript it's not
necessary to use with over promises but
the syntax is relatively clean and easy
to understand right as you can see
all we have to keep in mind while using
async await is we have to use a function
and wrap up all the data inside it so
keep this thing in mind that we have to
use a function always and we have to
wrap up all this data inside a single
function with the help of try and catch
block try and catch block are pretty
easy to use right we'll go through try
and catch Block in the next video as
well and we'll go through error only
another important thing I want to
mention here before we end up this video
is guys it may happen that you might
don't use these topics quite frequently
while working on the front end of a
website but if you get to answer these
questions during an interview and these
topics are pretty crucial if you are
learning JavaScript
so whether it be a sync await or
promises or callback functions you need
all of them in JavaScript so please go
through these topics carefully now
errors are something that we get at
times while working on a program
generally there are different types of
Errors present in almost every
programming language errors like syntax
error runtime errors and logical errors
so syntax errors are those errors a user
can't control we have to correct the
syntax for that that's the only option
with syntax errors for example let's say
we have a function that will print
something on the console on calling so
let's create a function here
we'll go to a Javascript file and we'll
create a function here so let's say the
function name is f
fine
and this function will
print something
on the console so let's say it prints
this is
Function One Fine
now this is a function that will print
this string on the console but let's say
we forgot to put the closing bracket of
this function by mistake or let's say
the closing part was deleted and we are
not aware of it so this part was deleted
or we forgot to put it there
and what we'll do is we'll call this
function we try to call this function
let's call it first
we'll call function1 save it and
go to the console so
here in console you can see that it
returns an error here it says syntax
error unexpected end of input and the
best part is we can't do anything for it
except for we can put that closing
bracket in its place again so if we put
this closing bracket here again
now it will work fine save it and here
you can see we have the output as this
is Function One
so these type of Errors can occur in a
program are known as syntax errors
another type of error that occurs in a
program is runtime error runtime errors
are those errors through which the
system comes across during the execution
of a program for example let's say if we
have another function here so let's add
another function here we'll write here
function F2
and the body
will print something on the console
again so we'll copy this from here and
instead of function one we'll write a
function to
save it and we haven't called this
function yet so let's imagine a scenario
that you created a function F2 and later
somewhere in the program you realize
that you created a function and you need
to call that function but you are not
sure of the name of that function so
let's say you called another function
but the function name was wrong so let's
say instead of function 2 we called
another function F4 let's call this
let's try to do it save it and here you
can see a first function is working fine
but when the system reaches function F2
it encountered an error here although
there is nothing wrong with the syntax
we are trying to call a function that
does not exist so these type of errors
are known as reference error in a
program we can fix these type of error
with the help of try catch and through
block we'll see it later these are the
different types of errors that might
occur in a program but sometimes there
are situations in which we want to print
an error to the user it might be for the
data entered by the user or for the data
we are getting from the server basically
we are talking about custom errors that
we create ourselves to make the flow of
program more smooth
we came across the try and catch Block
in the previous video wherein we used
these keywords with the async await in
JavaScript
so there we saw how these blocks were
working to print an error when the user
asks for something other than black
coffee if you haven't watched that video
yet please go through it you can find it
in this playlist
so let's do one thing here and we'll
create a small prototype of the same
program wherein we will have a function
that will print a string on the console
so let me comment this out guys now
we'll create another function here so
let's say we are writing here
function
make order
fine so this is the function we created
in the last video as well so let's say
inside the body of this function we'll
write something on the control
we will write a console.log and
right here here is your black coffee
enjoy your
day
fine now we will go through the syntax
of try and catch block first
and we'll see why we use these try and
catch blocks in a program so before we
move on to the try and catch block Let
Me Clear one thing guys it's not only
the try and catch blocks we use for
these purposes we have another Block in
JavaScript that is always independent of
these two blocks and doesn't need any
condition to run so the inclusion of the
finally Block in error handling depends
upon the user you can either add it or
leave it there will be no effect on the
program
so now let's move ahead and we'll go
through the syntax of try and catch
first and then we'll move on to the
finally block because finally block is
different from try and catch so let's go
through the try and catch first so we'll
write here
try and press
so we'll write here
try and you can see this is the syntax
of try and catch block the catch
contains an argument with it and it will
catch the error returned by the try
block so let's write the code here and
then we'll go through it we want to run
this function inside the try block and
if the function exists
the try block will execute it otherwise
the customized error will be thrown to
the user so we'll call this function
inside the try block
so we'll write here make
order
and we have called this function
now if the function exists the try block
will execute it there will be no problem
in that we are asking the computer to
try executing this line and if this line
does not exist show the user the error
we want to show not the one set by
default so the customized error will
write inside the catch block
and inside the catch block we'll write
here
console.log
and let's say it says
sorry
so this is the error we want to show the
error says sorry an error occurred in
your program
now let's execute this once and then
we'll see it again thoroughly so
this code will not show an error save it
and it will execute the function make
order and the output will be here's your
black coffee enjoy your day
right
but if we execute here another function
that does not even exist like we did for
the runtime errors so if we write here
let's say another function so let's say
the other function name is
process order fine so this function does
not exist in the entire program now the
system will go inside the try block and
it will execute the make order function
first the make order function will be
executed without any problem but the
moment it will come across the function
process order it will find it out that
no such function exists in the program
that's when it will move to the next
block and it will throw an error to the
user so save this program and you can
see here it says here is your black
coffee enjoy your day first and then it
says sorry an error occurred in your
program so this is how you can show an
error to the user a customized error we
can say if we call this process order
function outside of the try block the
scenario will change and the error will
be different so let me show you guys
what we'll do is we'll cut this process
order from here and we'll call this
process order function outside of the
try and catch block
now we have called this process order
function here and we know this function
does not exist in the program so let's
save it and here you can see it says
unquote reference error process order is
not defined so this is a runtime error
here now this is the default error you
get in JavaScript this is the default
way in which you can get an error in
Java
so there are certain things we can do
with errors in JavaScript which are
let's say if you want to print the error
as well in the console so we just have
to write here console.log
error
and one more thing we have to do is we
have to move this process order function
from here
back again to its original position
so save it now and here you can see we
have a reference error now this
statement will print the whole error in
the form of text and the user will know
the type of error as well
apart from that we can also print only
the message or the name of them so for
that we have to write here
console.log
error Dot name for the name of error and
console.lock error Dot
message for the error message so save it
and here you can see
we have reference error and as the name
of error and the message is process
order is not defined so this part of the
error is the message and this part is
the name now we are left with the
finally block only we have already
discussed that the finally block is
independent of the two blocks and it
will be executed anyway if present in a
program
so the Syntax for finally block goes
like this
what we'll do is we'll remove
these three statements from our program
and we'll write here
finally
and inside the finally let's say we want
to print something
on the
console so let's say we'll write here
this block
will
execute
no matter what now this finally block
will be executed anyhow so save it and
here you can see we have the output as
this block will execute no matter what
let's do one thing let's take this
process order function from here and
we'll paste it here save it now and here
you can see now none of the three blocks
is executing right so what we have to do
is we have to put it back in its place
one more thing we will discuss before
wrapping up this video is the throw
keyword in JavaScript with this keyword
we can throw an error anywhere in the
program the message will be customizable
and the type will be uncaught error fine
let's see an example of this type of
error handling with the help of basic if
else statement
so let's say we have a condition here in
which we have a variable so let me
comment this piece of code as well first
now let's say we have a condition here
in which we have a variable a and the
value of a is let's say 9. the condition
we have to check here is if a is less
than 10 then an error should be thrown
otherwise the system should print
something right so let's move on to the
programming part and you will understand
it so what we'll do is we'll declare a
variable e and the value of variable a
will be 9. now the if statement will
have a condition that if a is less than
10
throw an error so what we have to do is
we have to write here through Nu
error
fine
and the message will be let's say this
is a
customizable error fine
this is the message and we have to
mention the else statement here as well
so inside the SLC statement we'll write
here
control Dot Lock
working fine let's say
so
the if else block does not matter that
much in this case the only thing I want
you guys to see here is the throw
keyword save this program here and we
have the value as 9.
and what we wanted to throw an error if
the value is less than 10 save it and
here you can see
we have a familiar representation of
this error different from the try catch
block the message is customizable and it
says this is a customizable error
so this is how we can throw an error in
the program wherever we want to have you
guys ever heard about validation or
pattern matching in JavaScript we come
across these terms when we hear about
passwords mostly right
so we say that we can use the if else
statement to match if the user's
password matches with the one we already
have for that we write if password is
equal to is equals to some sort of
string or characters
and then we see if the password matches
will let the user enter otherwise the
entry will be denied so we are
discussing all that because regular
expressions are objects used to perform
pattern matching or if you want to
search for something in a string or even
if we want to replace something from a
string we can do it all with regular
expressions
so we'll go through the Syntax for
regular expressions and some more
important things about regular
expressions in JavaScript so regular
expressions are present in almost every
programming language it's not limited to
JavaScript only and the concept Remains
the Same everywhere the syntax May
differ a bit between different languages
but the logic behind them will always be
the same the name might be a little bit
confusing but the reality is entirely
different they are pretty easy to use
and if you understand the basics clearly
you will face no problem while working
on Advanced topics so let's go through
the regular Expressions before we move
on to validations using regular
expressions in JavaScript so let's
understand the concept entirely so that
it will be easy for you guys in further
videos so consider a scenario where we
have a string and we want to find a
particular word in that string or we can
say we are in a static website I hope
you guys are aware of the term static
where we have the search option to find
some word in the entire HTML document we
have to write the word in the search box
and it will return as the location of
that word in the HTML file or in the
website right what we'll do now is we'll
use a word and we'll find that word in a
string we'll make some changes to that
word with the help of several functions
used along with regular expressions in
JavaScript so the Syntax for regular
Expressions goes like this will move to
a Javascript file and we'll take a
variable here so let's say the variable
is where Rejects
and we use two forward slashes for it
generally we use the double slash for
comments but it will be recognized as a
regular expression in JavaScript if we
write something inside these double
slashes so let's say we are writing
something here let's say we write here
hello now this word hello is present
inside the variable regex and this word
needs to be searched in a string so
let's use a string as well so for that
we'll write here where let's say the
string name is str1 let's say we are
writing here welcome
to a
YouTube channel
full stop
say hello
if
you are new here
fine so let's say this is the string we
have
now this string contains the word hello
in it all we have to keep in mind is to
add the main keyword in the string for
now
moving ahead what we want to do is we
want to find this word in the string
right we want to find this hello world
industry
so next up we'll go through certain
essential functions which we use with
regular expressions and we'll see the
functioning of these essential functions
the first function is the exact function
so let me write here guys this is the
first function exec function
now this function returns an array if
the word is present in this tree
otherwise it will return null if the
word is not present in the string the
syntax is pretty straightforward all we
have to do is to use the exact function
with the variable that contains the
regular expression now in this case the
word regex contains the regular
expression we have to use it with the
function and the string name will be
passed as a parameter to this function
so let's write the syntax here and it
will be easy for you guys so let's
comment it out
and we'll write here let's say we are
taking another variable where output
we'll write here the variable name
dot function name we'll write a exec and
the string will be passed as a parameter
fine
so this is the syntax now this output
variable over here will have an array
and the array will return the index
number of the word hello industry
fine so let's print this array on the
console and we'll write here
console.log
output fine
save it and open the console so we will
move to a browser and will open console
here
see here we have an array and if we
click on this array we can see that we
have the word hello at index 36 so if we
count from here and the counting should
start from 0 because error index always
starts from zero so at index 36 we can
find that hello is over here and so it
will return the index of this particular
word
now if we write here something else
other than hello let's say we are
writing here 2 save it now and you can
see here we have two present at index
eight so if we count from here we can
see that 2 is present at index eight so
this is working totally fine now another
scenario is if we write here 2 with a
capital T save it now and you can see
here the output is null
because regular expressions in
JavaScript are case sensitive case
sensitive means it differentiates
between the capital letters and small
letters fine
but the good part is we can make them in
case sensitive as well so all we have to
do is we have to use a modifier a
modifier is actually used to make
modifications in the search so what we
have to do is we have to write here in
the beginning we have to write a single
letter and in this case we'll write here
I because this modifier will tell the
system that there will be no problem
with the case sensitivity of the word
now it will work fine and if we save
this program
we can see we have the output as index
8. now if we change this string and
we'll write here something other than
this so we'll write here h e l l o but
the three letters of this word are
capital letters
so save it now and you can see we have
the output as index 36 so this is
working fine now one last situation is
if we write here more than one hello in
a single string so if we write here
hello and welcome to our YouTube channel
now there are two hello words present in
a single string save it and you can see
we have the word hello at index 0. so it
will return the first hello word in the
string now if we want to get access of
the second hello and for if we write
here this piece of code again what we
are expecting is we are expecting it to
give us the index of second hello as
well but it will not happen save it and
you can see it will give the index of
first hello twice you can see here we
have index as 0 in both the Aries right
so it will not work
now the solution to this problem is
modifiers again what we have to do is we
have to use another modifier here now we
have to write here the letter G and save
it now this is returning null because we
have
the string wrong here so we have to
write here hello because we have removed
the in case sensitive modifier save it
now and you can see we have both the
hello words with indexes as 0 and 46
respectively So This Global modifier
tells the system that the word is now
global and if you find the word once and
the user tries the exact function again
then the second time you should return
the index value of the second word
so this is how it actually works now the
following function we are going to
discuss is a pretty simple one the test
function
now this function returns either true or
false nothing else this function checks
for a particular word that if the word
exists in a string then it will return
true otherwise false
it will not return the index value or
some sort of other things
it deals with the Boolean value only
that is true or false so that's it for
the function let's see how this function
work actually so what we'll do is we'll
mention here this test function
and will
comment this piece of code
so that there will be no confusion will
comment it out
now we'll go through the syntax of this
test function the syntax is pretty easy
we'll use the output variable again and
we'll write here
variable name dot function name and the
string name will be passed as a
parameter
now the next thing we'll do is we'll
write a console.log
and will print this on a
console fine so this is the Syntax for
test function save it and here you can
see in the console that for the word
hello it returns true if we change this
word here to something else like if it
write here hi instead of hello save it
and you can see the output is changed to
false because high is not there inside
of a string right because high does not
exist according to this history
so this is how the test function
actually work now one more thing I want
to mention here about the test function
is if we write here some part of a word
not the whole word but some part so
let's say if we write here e l l now
this is the part of hello world now what
if we save this you can see the output
here is true that's because the test
function checks for every letter and if
it finds these three letters in any word
it will return true in that case as well
fine next up we have another function to
use with the regular expressions in
JavaScript now the next function's name
is match function
I'll write it here
first I'll comment these two statements
and then I'll write here the name of
this function so the name is match
now this match function returns an array
of results otherwise null the Syntax for
this function is exactly opposite from
the previous functions because we'll
pass the regular expression as a
parameter to this function now and the
function will be used along with this
tree so it is completely opposite to the
syntax we used for the previous two
functions so we'll write here for this
we'll use the output variable again
we'll write here where output
and instead of regex we'll use it with
the string so we'll write here str1 dot
match and the variable name will be
passed as a parameter fine
so this is how the Syntax for match
function looks like it's exactly
opposite to the syntax we used for
previous two functions the next line
will remain the same we'll write a
console.log and will print
output on a screen fine now we have to
do one more thing here what's that is we
have to remove this modifier from here
and we have to write here hello so save
it and you can see we have an array over
here now what if we want to find both
the words in a string if we have if we
want to check if there's more than one
word with the similar name so what we
have to do is we have to write here G
and if you save it now you can see the
output is completely changed and now we
have an array with two similar words
what if we add another hello here so
let's say we have another hello here
save it and you can see here the array
size is increased to 3 now now we are
left with one more method and the method
we are going to discuss now is pretty
important because we'll use this method
in future as well so the last method is
the replace method which is used to
replace something from a string we can
either replace the first matching word
or all the matching words from a string
if we are using the global modifier then
all the words will be replaced otherwise
the first matching word will be replaced
so the Syntax for this method goes like
this what we have to do is so let's
comment it out first and we'll go
through the syntax of final method so
the final method is
replace method
fine
so the syntax goes like this we'll use
the output variable again
and we'll write here
str1 dot replace because we want to
replace something in that particular
string the first parameter will be the
variable name we'll write here regex
comma and then we'll pass the word we
want to change so hello will be changed
with let's say in this case hi
fine now check over here that if we are
using any modifiers so we are using
Global modifier here now if we print
this on a console if we write a
console.log and we are writing here
output
if we save it now we'll get to know that
all the Hello words in the string are
replaced with the word hi save it and
you can see over here that hi and
welcome to a YouTube channel say hi if
you are new here and then we have a hi
you can see that all the Hello words are
replaced with the word hi
now if we remove This Global modifier
from here and if we save it now you can
see only the first hello world is
replaced the other hello words are here
and there will be no change in them
because we are not using the global
modifier now in the previous video where
we came across regular expressions in
JavaScript we saw different predefined
functions that we use for finding a
particular expression present inside a
string right like the predefined
functions we also have some JavaScript
characters that make the searching part
easy
so these characters are used within the
expressions and help us in different
ways for example let's consider a
scenario where we have a regular
expression and we want to find a
particular word within the string
but we don't remember the whole world
let's say we forgot the word with time
and now we remember only a part of that
word so let's do the same side by side
and what we'll do is we'll go to our
Javascript file and we'll take three
variables we'll write here let regex is
equals to
then we'll write here let str1 is equals
to
and then finally we'll write
where output is equals to
fine now here we have three variables
the variable regex will store a regular
expression within it we haven't returned
the word yet next up we have a variable
str1 to store the string and the
variable output to store the output
returned by a function the function
we'll use will be any one of the ones we
used in the previous video so let's do
it here the word let's say the word will
be
welcome fine
you can take any word you want now
moving on to the string let's write the
string as well we'll write here Welcome
to our YouTube channel and then we'll
write another welcome here
fine
we'll discuss the reason why we wrote
welcome twice now if you guys remember
from the previous video where we have
used the test function to check the
availability of a word present in a
string or not we'll use the same
function again so we'll write here
variable name Dot
function name so the function name is
test and then we'll pass the string name
as a parameter so we'll write here str1
that's fine
and finally what we'll do is we'll
print this on our console so we'll write
a console.log
output fine now we already know the
output for this piece of code right the
output will be true that's obvious
because we have the word welcome present
in our string not once but twice the
output will remain true if we remove the
first welcome from this string let's do
it here let's save the program first and
then we'll move to the console
and you can see here the output says
true for the word welcome present in the
string str1 that's true right and now if
we remove this welcome word from here
and if we save it you can see the output
Still Remains true because we have
another welcome word present in the
string right
so this is how the test function
actually works we will put the welcome
word here again we already know the
functioning of this test function the
main point of discussion here is the
meta characters
So Meta characters are characters with
special meanings
like the dot character if we write this
regular expression like we can remove
any one character from this word and put
a dot in its place let's do it we'll
remove a random character and write dot
here so let's say we are removing
L fine and instead of L we are putting a
DOT here
now the dot character here will replace
this character and the system will not
through any error it will still find the
word we can also use exact function here
to check the index number of the word so
what we'll do is we'll take another
variable and we'll do the same we'll
write here regex Dot
exec
and then we'll pass the string name as
parameters
fine
we'll copy this console.log from here
and we'll paste it here
the variable name is op
save it and here you can see we have the
output as true for the test function and
for the exact function it Returns the
index number 0 of the word in the string
now the system automatically puts a l in
place of the dot character similarly if
you want to do the same thing for more
than one character we have another meta
character for that it's not that we
can't use this dot operator but we can
use it for a limited time like we can
use it for a single character but if we
want to put more than one character and
we don't know the number of the
characters so then we have another meta
character for that the meta character is
asterisk now this asterisk allows us to
put multiple characters within a
particular expression for example if we
write here
let's remove all this and we'll put star
or asterisk in place of all the
characters in between so save it and you
can see the output returns true for
test function and for the exact function
the index is 0. now if we write here
something like that
and we don't know what it is but let's
assume it so if we save it now you can
still see the output returns true for
this as well because now we can put any
number of characters in between W and E
the only thing that matters is the first
and the last character of the word
welcome
now the next character will be looking
at does not work the same way as these
characters the carrot character works
upon a whole string let's go through the
syntax and what we'll do is
we'll remove this unwanted piece of code
and then we'll come here we'll write
here
welcome again
and now we'll put this carrot character
now the carrot character is this
character so what this character returns
is this character returns true only if
the whole string starts with the word
welcome the second welcome word does not
even exist for this meta character if we
save this program now it will return
true because welcome is present at the
start of this string right so save it
and you can see the output is true now
if we remove this welcome from here
and if we save this program now we know
that we have another welcome present in
the string but this character does not
work that way and it will return false
because the string starts with 2 now
right
save it and here you can see the output
is false for test function and for exact
function the output is null it will not
return any index number of the second
welcome or some sort of thing so this is
how the carrot character works in
JavaScript
the next meta character does the same
thing but for the end of the string the
symbol is dollar and it checks for the
end part of this string this meta
character is placed at the end of a
regular expression and it checks if the
string ends with characters present in
the expression the syntax goes like this
what we'll do is we'll remove this
carrot character and we'll put a dollar
sign you now this statement now will
check if the string ends with the word
welcome or not in this case the last
word of the string is back right not
welcome so the output will be false save
it
save it and you can see here the output
is false and null suppose we write here
back in place of welcome now what we'll
do is we'll write here
back in place of welcome and if we save
this program now the output will change
to true because back is the last word
present in a string right so this
character checks for the end of the
string save it and you can see the
output is changed to true and the index
number is 32. find the exact function
will return the index number of the word
back the last meta character we will
discuss in this video is the optional
meta character the question mark symbol
represents this meta character and the
functioning be like any character before
this symbol is treated as optional this
means that it doesn't matter if the
character is present in the string or
not for example if we write here let's
say
we'll write here welcome again because
welcome has more characters than back
and we'll write here welcome as well
fine
now let's make some changes in this
particular regex expression so what
we'll do is we'll put a question mark
here
and let's say we'll put another question
mark here fine now if we remove c and e
from the string or any one of them then
also the function will work fine and the
output will be true let's do it and what
we'll do is we'll make some changes in
this particular string and we are going
to remove some characters from this
string so we have two welcome words here
and what we'll do is we'll remove C from
this one and we have two optional
characters right both c and e are
optional but for now we are removing C
only so the string looks like this we
have the word Vellum it doesn't mean
anything but for understanding purposes
we have done it so save it and you can
see the output remains true for vellum
now what if we put any other word in
place of this character
let's say we are writing here B fine
the output will change we have to put an
OS because o is not an optional
character now the output
will change
as we were discussing if we save this
program you can see it says true for now
but it is saying true because of this
welcome now if we remove this welcome
from here and if we save it now you can
see the output is changed to null
yes these characters are optional but we
can't put any character in place of them
we have two options only either we can
put C in its place or we can leave it so
there's no other option with the
optional characters so these are the few
meta characters present in regular
Expressions which helps in validation a
lot we came across meta characters in
regex in the previous video where we saw
how to check the availability of a
particular word or expression within a
string we know about functions as well
so today we will combine all these
things to some extent and we'll see how
basic validation actually works in
JavaScript
we'll see an example wherein we'll go
through the character sets and ranges
and check for some specific type of
validation in this video
now the topic character sets and ranges
itself is a pretty explanatory topic and
we can get an idea of what's coming just
by going through the words characters in
layman term refers to alphabets and
numbers right we see a character on a
daily basis and we know a lot about them
now if I write here a we can say that
this is a character in JavaScript now we
can use one single character or a group
of characters at a time with regular
expressions in JavaScript we have a
particular Syntax for it we'll go
through the syntax first and the syntax
is like we have to use square brackets
and we have to write characters in
between these brackets or inside these
brackets
here we have three characters a b and c
what we can do is we can give
instructions to the system to use any
one of them in a regular expression so
let's take a small example of how this
actually works with regular expressions
and what we'll do is we'll do the same
thing we have been doing till now we'll
search a word within a string we'll
check that if a word exists within a
string or not so we'll do it like we'll
take a variable regex that will contain
the regular expression so this is the
Syntax for regular expression and this
is a regular expression which says d e f
so in actual this is not a word but
assume it as a word for now and what we
have to do is we have to include
character sets with this regular
expression right so we'll write here
inside square brackets ABC
now the next thing is we will Define the
string let's say the string name is tr1
and the string says
this
string contains adef so d e f or we can
say adef is what matters the most for
now so anything else you can write on
the string the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to use the test
function to check if this particular
regular expression is available in the
string or not so we'll write here regex
DOT test and inside this will pass the
string as a parameter
now the last thing we'll do is we'll
write here console.log and we'll print
this on our console fine
we are done with it so what we are doing
here is we want to search the string for
a word which contains the letter d e f
compulsory but before def we can have a
character that character can either be a
b or c no other character will be taken
in front of Def because we have defined
a character set as well right and that
character set contains only three
characters a b and c so
here you can see we have adef present in
the string and we have a along with def
so what we are expecting is this test
function should return true right so
save it and check for the output in the
console so we will go to a console
and here you can see the output says
true because we have a def only
now if we write here anything else like
if we replace this a with the character
R save it and you can see the output is
false because R is not present inside
this character set now what if we write
here something like
let's say we are writing here
kaushal def now this will check for this
letter only for this L only other
letters don't actually matters in this
case in the case of character sets the
only character that matters is the
character right before the regular
expression so if we save it you can see
the output is changed to false and if we
write here let's say
kaushal adef save it and you can see the
output is true because it checks for
this character only fine
talking about ranges let's say we want
to add any character in the string
between a to z now we have two options
to do so first one is we can write a b c
till z here like we'll write here d e f
g h i and so on and so forth till z but
this task is a little bit lengthy right
and we have to spend a lot of time in
that process so the alternate to this
process is to define a range of
characters to define a range of
characters it's quite an easy task all
you have to do is write a hyphen Z so
this is how you can define a range of
characters now this range will consist
every character from a till z a and z
will also be included keep this thing in
mind if we write here causal DF again so
we have seen in in the previous example
that it returned false for this right
save it now and you can see the output
is still true that's because now we have
a range from a till z if we write here 5
now now it will return false because 5
does not lies in between this range in
between A to Z so it will return true
for any character between a till z fine
now let's say we want to exclude some
particular characters from this range
like we don't want the user to include
def again no character from d e or F so
the Syntax for that is also pretty easy
we have to use the carrot operator and
we have to write here but we don't want
to include so let's say in this case we
don't want to include def fine so if we
write here d d e f now and save it you
can see
it will return false because we have
included ddef and if we write a adef
save it and you can see the output is
true now we can't include characters d e
and f in front of this regular
expression because we have defined this
character set to not include these
characters in the regular expression
so these are characters and ranges in
regular Expressions so the next thing
we'll be doing is we'll be going through
a basic validation example and we'll see
how actually basic validation Works in
JavaScript what we'll do is we'll create
a small HTML form that will take the
employee ID from the user and it will
check if the employee belongs to the
organization or not
so let's say the employee ID of the
organization has some unique characters
present in it and the character remains
there in each employee ID
the idea is simple we'll take the ID
from the user and we'll use if else
control statement to check if it belongs
to the organization or not so let's move
on to the HTML file and we'll create a
placeholder and a button so let's do it
we'll write here
form and inside this form tag let input
ID is equals to
Eid
and
placeholder is equals to
employee ID
and type is equals to
text fine
the next thing we are going to do is we
are going to include a button as well
button and we are going to call a
function on clicking so we'll use the on
click event so we'll write your own
click and let's say the function name is
employee
and the button name is let's say submit
save it and you can see over the browser
that we have a placeholder along with
the button so let me give a space here
save it now and you can see we have a
placeholder and a button so that's all
what we have to do in HTML part now the
rest of the thing we'll be doing in the
Javascript file so let's move to a
Javascript file
and comment this piece of code first
now what we want is we want to call a
function employee on clicking the submit
button fine so what we'll do is we'll
Define a function employee
and inside the body of this function the
first thing we will be doing is we'll be
taking
the user's ID right so we need a
variable for that so let's say the
variable is
mpid and we'll write here
document Dot
get element by ID the ID is
Eid
Dot
value fine now this amp ID variable will
hold the value entered by the user right
so like if we write here something like
d two three eight six so let's say this
is the ID this will be stored the value
for this ID will be stored inside this
mpid variable fine
now we'll use the regular expression to
check for some special characters so we
will write here
inside the function we'll write here
where
check is equals to
inside the regular expression we'll
write something so let's say we want to
start the employee ID for the
development team with the alphabets D
and D
and each ID will have a similar numeric
code like 253 which represents the code
for a particular team fine so we'll
write here inside the character sets we
want d e to be there before a similar
numeric code right so
253 is the numeric code and we want to
include either D or e
before that right
and after 253 let's say we have a range
of numbers that each employee ID has a
unique two digit number the ID should
look like
either d
2 5 3
1 1 or either
e
253
6 1
something like that right
now so for that what we have to do is we
have to include here another range and
this range will be from 11 oh sorry this
range will be from 10 till 99. fine
this looks a bit complex now but if you
try to do it by yourself believe me guys
you will find it out that this is an
easy task but a little lengthy we can
see now the next part is we have to
validate the ID entered for that we have
to use the if else control statement
along with the test function
so we have to write here
if check DOT test and inside this will
write
amp ID because amp ID is the variable
which is holding the value entered by
the user right so if it's true then it
will return
an alert box with the message that says
valid
employee ID fine else
it will
return a message in the pop-up which
will say
invalid
ID fine
so this if else statement will check the
value returned by the test function if
the value returned is true it will
return a message valid employee ID
otherwise the else statement will run
and the user will get a pop-up with the
message invalid email ID fine
let's check the output and in the
browser here we'll write the employee ID
in the
given placeholder so let's say the
employee ID is d
253
19
submit it and you can see it says valid
employee ID we can do it for some mode
like if we write here e
253
98
submit it and you can see it still says
valid employee ID now what if we want to
include any character between this range
and the unique number right so let's try
to do it we'll write it D 253
k89 fine so let's say this is the ID we
want to enter submit it and you can see
it says invalid employee ID fine now one
more thing we want to do here is like if
we write here
d 2 5 3
okay 8 9 in this case it will return
false or invalid employee ID why because
we haven't included any modifier here
and it will differentiate between
uppercase and lowercase character so to
overcome this problem what we can do is
we can include the in case sensitive
modifier and we are clearly good to now
if we write here d25398
and save it if we write here now d
25398
submit it and you can see here the
output says valid employee ID
so this is how we can use validation
along with regular expressions in the
last video we came across character sets
and ranges we saw how we could use them
with regular expressions and we also saw
how to validate a user's input with the
help of character sets and ranges along
with regular Expressions now in this
video we'll look at the shorthand
character classes present within regular
expressions and we'll see how they are
helpful in JavaScript
if you guys remember the regular
expression we used became a bit
confusing and lengthy because we have
used so many ranges and character sets
all in one right a character class can
be used to overcome this particular
problem and we have several character
classes present in JavaScript so today
we will go through them in this
particular video now the syntax is not
too much complicated all we have to do
is to write a single character with the
backslash and we are good too for
example if we go to a Javascript file
and if we write here
backslash D now if we write this
character before any regular expression
in JavaScript it means that we have
added a character class to a regular
expression this backslash D is a
character class used for finding a digit
within a string let's go through an
example for this character class
and we'll do the same thing we'll take a
string and try to find a regular
expression within that string so what
we'll do is
will write here
where
regex is equals to and here we'll write
a regular expression first we'll take up
a string and use some functions to check
the output so let's do it here what
we'll do is we'll take another variable
let's say the variable name is str1 and
the strings is users
phone number is
nine eight seven six five four three two
one zero now let's say this is the
string we are using for today's program
the next thing we'll do is we'll use the
exact function to find the regular
expression within the string so we have
already gone through this exact function
in JavaScript today we'll use that
function only now we'll write here where
output is equals to
regex dot exec and inside this will pass
a string as a parameter the next thing
we'll do is we'll write here console Dot
Lock
and we'll print this output on a console
now we are good to go so we are done
with it and the next thing we want to do
is to find a particular pattern along
with the number present before that
pattern in the string so let's suppose
if we write here inside these slashes if
we write here let's say three to one now
this statement here asks the computer to
find a pattern three to one in this
string
save it
and go to the console so we'll move to
our browser and we'll press Ctrl shift
plus I and here you can see we have a
console here and here we have an array
as well so here you can see it says
let me Zoom it out a bit here you can
see it says
three to one is present at index 28. now
the system finds out that this
particular string or this particular
regular expression is present here in
the string add index number 28 obviously
the indexes will start from 0 and the
moment it will find this three to one
regular expression it will show the
index number in an array in a console
now if we add
backslash D here let's say we are adding
here backslash D in front of this
expression and check the output here
save it you will notice that we have a
number present here right before that
expression right we have 4 3 2 1 here
instead of just three two one the output
here gives us the number four this means
that this backslash D represents this
number 4 in this string now what if we
put an alphabet before this expression
now let's do it what we'll do is we'll
write here a and let us say we are
adding only a single alphabet here let's
say we are adding a before 3 to 1. now
the expected output is A3 to 1 but the
moment we'll save it you can see it says
null that's because this particular
character class works for digits only if
it finds anything other than a numeric
digit it will return an error or it will
return null in that case now if you want
to find all the numbers before this
pattern then we have to add a plus
operator in the regular expression all
we have to do is we have to write here
plus and we are good to go now it will
return everything
until it finds a space or any character
other than a digit now let's suppose if
you are writing here a after 987
now this particular statement will
return all the numbers till 6. the
moment it will encounter a here it will
return all the numbers after a it will
stop at a and it will not go further now
save it and you can see it says 654321
that's because this backslash D works
for digits only now if we write here
nothing like we have a number
9876543210 save it and it will return
the whole number nine eight seven six
five four three two one not zero because
we haven't included any number here
now if we write here again backslash D
after this as well save it and here you
can see we have the output as 0 as well
we have the whole number here fine
so this is how this backslash D actually
works in JavaScript so this is a
character class
now the next thing is what if we want to
find a non-digit character before a
particular pattern
if we write here
before three to one let's say we are
writing here a and we want the system to
return the non-digit character before 3
to 1. in that case we use capital D
instead of small D always remember guys
every shorthand character class in regex
have an inverse that does precisely the
opposite of that particular class like
if we have small D here that works for
digits only we also have an inverse
which is denoted by backslash capital D
and it is exactly opposite of this small
D here now if we write here
capital D in place of small D what will
happen is it will return the character
here it will return true for everything
other than a digit now if we remove this
small D from here and save it
here you can see it says null because we
haven't included the backslash sign here
save it
and here you can see it says a321 it
will return true for anything except for
a digit even if we put a symbol over
here then also it will return the output
s true for example if we write here
let's say we are including dollar sign
here let's say we are including two
dollar sign here save it and it will
return two dollar signs that's because
we are using the plus operator here
obviously let's include as many signs as
we can
save it and here you can see we have all
the symbols present over here on our
output so this is how capital D
character class works or we can say
inverse character class of small D this
is how it works
now the next class we'll be going
through is the worldly character denoted
by the letter W small W and is used in
place of any character that can be an
alphabet a number or an unders cosine we
can use this character over D if we are
unsure about the character present
before the pattern for example if we
write here
let's say backslash w
ER
now here we have used the ber pattern
which is present at the end of number
right here ber is present at the end of
number now this statement will return M
only because we are not using any plus
operator here if we use any plus
operator then it will return the whole
number because it will return everything
until it encounters a space or something
like that so for now we are not using
any plus operators who will be writing
here this only now here it will return M
because it can take up a number an
alphabet or an underscore sign it will
return false if it finds any space or
something other than these three these
three means a number an alphabet or an
underscore sign fine
now save it and you can see on the
console that the output says mber let me
Zoom it a bit so here you can see the
output says mber right present at index
14.
it will return null if we put a space
before the pattern like if we write here
num space ber save it you can see it
says null for this now we can use the
plus operator as well here for this
particular character class now what will
happen is we'll return every character
present before the pattern until it
encounters a space or something like a
symbol or any sort of thing so let's try
it what we'll do is we'll write here w
and we'll remove this space from here
save it and here you can see it says
number what if we remove this space from
here remove it save it and here you can
see it says phone number it will return
every character before the pattern until
it finds any space or any other let's
say symbol so let's say we are including
here dollar percent a and carrot sign
save it and here you can see it says an
e number so it's returning it from here
because it will not return true for any
of the symbols here save it and here you
can see we have the output as phone
number again so that's working totally
fine
like the inverse character class for
digits we have the inverse character
class for this also and it returns true
for everything other than an alphabet
number or any underscore sign now if we
write here
instead of small W let's say we are
writing here capital w
and let's do something with this string
as well so let's put a space here again
and we are good to go we are not doing
anything more than that so it will
return null because before ber we have M
here right if we remove this m with a
sign let's say if you are removing this
with a dollar sign or with an empty one
like we are writing here space nothing
then it will return the index number and
the pattern
so let's do it save it and here you can
see it says dollar then it says ber and
index number is 14. you can count the
index number so 0 for U and then
similarly one for S two for E3 for r
four for S up to 14 for dollar so dollar
is present at index 14. it will return
the index number here now the plus
operator also works for this inverse
character class as well right here plus
ber and we can insert as many characters
or as many symbols as we want so like
here we have inserted so many symbols
this doesn't mean anything but we are
inserting them for example purposes or
for practical purpose so save it and
here you can see we have all the symbols
present over here in a array and the
index number is still 14 if we remove
these n and U from here now save it the
index number will change to 11. that's
quite easy
now
the next class we have is the simplest
of all this class works for white spaces
only it means that it will return true
or give us the index number of the
expression from the string only if a
white space exists before the pattern
it is denoted by smallest and works for
spaces only now if we write here
let's say
backslash s
okay we have made a mistake we'll write
a backslashes
and we'll write you phone so this is the
pattern and this is the character class
backslash s is the character class now
what we'll do is we'll remove it from
here and we'll
write the string as this again we'll
write a user's phone number is this and
this
now for this regular expression it will
return the index number of this space
the space is present at index 5. 0 for U
1 for S 2 for e 3 4 R 4 4s and this
space is present at index number five so
it will return index as 5 for this
particular space now don't get confused
guys for this index number S5 the index
number is for the space present in the
screen before the pattern phone
right now if we try to do the same for
users as well let's suppose if we write
here
users it will return null in this case
because there's no space present before
users in the string right save it and
here you can see the output says null in
this case
fine
now we can also use the plus operator
here for more than one spaces present in
the string it will return all the spaces
until it finds a character or something
other than the spaces like if it finds
any symbol or any character then only it
will return false otherwise for spaces
it will return true so if we write here
too many spaces if we put too many
spaces before the word phone or let's
say we are changing this word to
phone
save it and here you can see we have all
the spaces here it's denoted by a single
space but the index numbers is changed
to 19. now we have so many spaces
present here before the
pattern phone or before the word phone
so this is how we can use
space character class in JavaScript
now we have also the inverse class for
this character class as well it returns
true for everything other than empty
spaces if we write here
let's say we are removing this and let's
say we are right okay and let's say we
are
writing here users
and we are
giving so many spaces here before the
word uses now it will return null in
this case because there are spaces
present in front of the word users
if we include a character or something
in front of this word then only the
output will change and return the index
number along with the string so save it
first and here you can see
okay we have used this small s in place
of small s we'll write here capital S
save it and you can see here the output
says null for capital S because this
capital S will return true for
everything other than spaces only now if
we put here any symbol let's say we have
these symbols here
save it and here you can see now we have
a hash symbol present before the word
users that's because we have used
capital S only now if we use a plus
operator save it and here you can see we
have all the symbols present in a array
we have the index number as 11 we have
dollar percentage carrot and hash
present over here right so this is how
the inverse of character spaces in
JavaScript actually work so these are
the character classes we have in
JavaScript if you want to kick start
your dream career and looking for online
bootcamp training and certifications
from prestigious universities then take
up the full stack Java developer Masters
program by simply learn before we move
on to the programming part let's discuss
what a Wordle game is the Wordle is a
popular five letter word guessing game
that has become popular in the last
couple of months the game was actually
designed by a software engineer as a
gift for its partner but with time the
game gained popularity and now everyone
on social media is talking about this
game only
the rules for this game are simple the
game tells you if the letters you picked
are in the word and if they are in the
right place as well if the letter is in
the right spot it shows up green and the
correct letter in the wrong spot shows
up yellow a letter that isn't present in
the word at all shows up green color so
let's go through the game once and you
guys will understand it much better
here we are in the browser you can see
we have blocks over here and the
keyboard present beneath them we have
six rows over here and each row contains
five columns for each letter of the word
that ask is simple we have only one
correct word if we write something on
the first row the system will check for
all the letters if a letter is present
at the correct place then the color of
that particular letter will change to
Green for example if we write here River
and press enter key you can see all the
words or all the letters of this word
change to Green this means that none of
these letters are present in the word so
let's try another word we'll write here
Apple
press the enter key and you can see a is
correct but present at the wrong spot
let's try some more now
we'll write here let's say
Tokyo fine click on enter and you can
see o is also correct and the last word
is O now we have two letters of the we
have a and o is present at the last and
a is present in the world so let's
think of any word which is like this
the word coming in my mind right now is
let's try mango so we'll write here
mango
click on enter and you can see mango is
the correct word for this worldly fine
we can get any random word from the word
list we have in a JavaScript part so
we'll discuss about it later on so I
hope you guys got what this game is
so let's move again to the programming
partner so here we are in the HTML part
now the task is to create this whole
game again from scratch so here we are
in the vs code and we'll start writing
the code for the scene
now we'll create the layout of this
webpage using HTML first so let's say
what we are doing here is we are writing
here inside the body
we are writing here H1
let's say the ID is
ID is H1 title fine title is the ID for
this and now what we'll do is we'll
use an underline tag so we'll write
something over here we'll write here
verdel
using
JavaScript fine save the program and
this is our actual program
save it now open it with live server
once again
and you can see we have this heading
over here which says Wordle using
JavaScript which is underlined as well
now let's write the code again so what
we are going to do here is we are going
to use a break text now the next thing
we are going to do is we are going to
take a div
so this div is going to be for the board
so we are going to create the board of
this game later on in the CSS part we'll
keep this div empty here
now the next thing we have to do here is
we have to use another brake tag and
then we have to print the answer as well
right so we'll write here br
now we'll write here H1 so inside H1 the
ID is going to be let's say answer
and then inside this H1 we'll keep this
empty fine we are done with the HTML
part we'll manage the rest in the CSS in
the JavaScript Parts as well so let's
move on to the CSS part now but before
that let's save this program and you can
see nothing is changing over here in the
browser so let's move on to the CSS part
now here we are in the CSS file what
we'll do is we'll write here
body now we'll first style the body tag
of a whole web page so we'll write your
font family
so font family is going to be
Gill sense and then we'll write here
will sends msmp sorry and then we'll
write here
calibri and then we have
this over here so we'll write here
trebuchet MS
and then we have sensory over here so
here we are done with this
and it's showing some error over here so
what we have to do is we have to put
this inside single inverted commas as
well now let's zoom out the vs code and
here you can see something is wrong over
here
so the wrong thing is we have to put
this 10 set of inside single inverted
commas and calibri like this so we are
done with the font family next thing we
are going to do here is we are going to
write a text align at the center
then we have background color so what we
are going to do is we are going to use
the linear gradient over here so we'll
write here linear gradient now inside
this we have to pass the degree or the
angle we can say so we'll write here
degree as 120 then we have specific
colors so we'll write here double 3 B
7 c e fine so this is one of those
colors then we'll write here
50 and then we have another color so
we'll write here hash
218 EDC so we'll write here 218 ed6 and
this is our second color we'll write
here 50 again
now save the program move back to the
browser and we'll see if this is working
fine so this is working fine as of now
we'll check back at it later
now the next thing we have to do here is
we have
to style the HR tag as well so we'll
write here width as
500 pixels for this HR type save the
program move back to the browser
and you can see nothing has changed over
here
so the next thing we have to mention
over here is the title tag so we have
the IDS title for our title so we'll
write a title now inside this we'll
write the font size font size is going
to be 36 pixel for the title then we
have found weight so we'll write your
font to it as
bold then we have letter spacing so
we'll write here let us spacing as two
pixels for this save the program move
back to the browser and you can see
we have this heading over here which
says Wordle using JavaScript and
that's it so the next thing we are going
to do here is we are going to write the
code for board so we'll write here hash
board
and we'll write here
width of this board is going to be 350
pixels so we'll write here 350 then we
have the height as so we'll write here
the height as 420 pixels
and then we have merge so we'll write
here margin margin is going to be
0 and auto then we have margin top so
we'll write here margin top
okay
so we have to write a margin top and
margin top is going to be 3 pixels so
we'll write here three pixels then we
have the display as Flex
and then lastly we have the flex
strength so we'll write your Flex wrap
as wrap
now save the program and
here you can see some things are changed
over here now let's style other things
as well so the next thing we have to
change here is the type so tile is a
class over here
we'll go back to HTML and you can see we
have no class named tile over here so
we'll Define this class later on in the
JavaScript part
so we'll write here tile now inside here
what we'll do is we'll style the Box
first
so we'll put a comment over here as box
then we'll write here border border is
going to be 2 pixels solid
and the RGB value of the Border color is
19
then for green we have 18 and for blue
we have
80 fine so this is the Border color then
we have width so width is going to be 60
pixels and then we have height as well
so we'll write here height height is
going to be 60 pixels again
then we have margin so we'll write a
margin margin is going to be 2.5 pixels
let's say
now we'll style the text as well so
we'll
mention it over here will comment text
over here now we'll
Define the color so the color for text
is going to be black then we have the
font size font size is going to be 36
pixels
and after font size we have the font
width so we'll write here font weight
font weight is going to be
bold then we have display so we'll write
here display as Flex
and then we have justify content at the
center and finally we have align items
at the center
so we'll write here align items at
Center
so here we are done with the styling of
the body title and board now we are left
with the keyboard the colors were
correct absent and present letters so
we'll write the code for it later on for
now let's move ahead to the JavaScript
part but before that let's save this
program once and we'll check
so here you can see nothing is changed
as of now so
let's refresh it once and we'll see if
something is wrong or not so here you
can see nothing is wrong everything is
working totally fine let's go back to
the JavaScript part and we'll go through
the logic behind this whole game now
so here we are in the JavaScript part
we'll start writing the code over here
so here you can see we have the keyboard
already with us so this is going to be
our keyboard
now the next thing we are going to do
here is we are going to take a variable
as
height so the value of height is going
to be 6 initially so this is basically
the number of guesses we have in our
program so basically we have six number
of guesses that's why we are taking the
variable height S6 then we have the
variable width so width of each word is
going to be five letters so the width is
going to be 5 then we have variable as
row and the initial value of row is
going to be 0 that's because of the
current gases or we can say the current
attempt
then we have a variable call so we'll
use 0 for this variable as well so this
is the current letter for that attempt
now we'll take another variable over
here we'll take a variable
game over and the initial value of this
variable is going to be false fine
the game over variable is for game over
if the game is over then the value will
change to true
here we have taken the height variable
as 6 and the words width is 5 letters
the current row will be 0 and the call
variable is also set to 0. the game over
variable is initially set to false
that's it right so let's move ahead and
we'll create two lists now the first one
is going to be a list of words and the
second one will be a list of guest words
so if the user enters a word then the
guest word list will be checked if the
word is present in the list or not if
the entered word is not present in the
list then the system will return that
the word is not present so what we'll do
is we'll write here
where word list so we'll write your word
list is equals to we are going to take a
list of words so let's say we have some
words over here we'll write here Apple
and then we have
mango so
there are basically a lot of words
present inside this list may be more
than thousand two thousand or three
thousand words so for now it's just a
prototype of this whole vertical game so
we are going to take four or five
different types of words that's it the
next word we have is River
then we have hyped so we'll write here
hyped
and then we have
2q so we'll write here Tokyo let's say
we'll take another word over here so
let's say we have title over here
and we have
Ouija fine
so we have to write a height with a
small H and that's it this is our word
list now we are going to create another
list this time we are going to create
the guest list which will contain all
the words that can be guessed by the
user
so inside the guest list we'll write
here Apple
and then mango
and then we have
River hyped so we are basically going to
take all these words and we are going to
paste them over here now let's use some
more words so let's say we are
using here
carbo then we have let's say another
word over here
proxy fine so we have these words in the
guest list as well now the next thing we
have to do is the guest list will also
contain the words from the word list
right so what we'll do here is we'll
write here
yes list and guest list is going to be
guestlist dot concat so what we are
doing here is we are basically
performing concatenation so we'll write
here word list inside this and that's it
now it's time to pick up a random word
from the word list we have for that
we'll use traditional math dot random
method so for that what we'll do is
we'll write here
where word
and we are going to take this variable
and we'll write here word list
then inside this what we are going to do
is we are going to write here math dot
floor
then we have
math Dot
random so this is a method basically
method.random so we have to put
parenthesis over here then we'll write
here asterisk word list Dot
length so we'll write your word list dot
length
and finally what we are going to do is
we are going to change the word to
uppercase so that's why we are writing
here two uppercase over here so this is
also a method
now that's it let's print this word and
what we'll do is we'll write a
console.log
we are going to print this word on a
console fine
so here we are done with the task of
picking up a random word from the list
of words now the next thing we have to
do is to work upon the body of this game
and then on the screen keyboard
now the next thing we have to do is to
work upon the body of this game and on
screen keyboard we have on our web page
but before that let's save this program
once move back to the browser open
console and here you can see
again on refreshing the web page the
word is changing over here it's taking a
random word from the word list you can
see on refreshing we have River as of
now I'm not sure if you guys are able to
switch so let me Zoom it out a bit now
refresh this page and you can see the
word is changing over here we have a
list of words and a random word will be
picked at once so here you can see
now it's working totally fine so let's
move on and now we'll write the code for
the body and the on-screen keyboard so
we'll write here window
dot on loot so we'll write your window
Dot onload
and downloading we are going to create a
function fine so we are going to
initialize so we are going to write here
initialize
and we are going to call this initialize
function fine
now the next thing we have to do is we
have to create this function so we'll
write here
function
initialize
now what we have to do is we have to
create the game board now so for that we
are going to use the for Loop we are
going to write here for let
R is equals to 0 so the initial value of
R is going to be 0 R is
less than height so this is the
condition and we are going to
write a r plus plus fine
now inside the body of this for Loop we
have to take another for Loop we have to
take the for Loop for column as well so
we are going to write here for let's say
we have variable C and the initial value
is set to 0 and the condition is going
to be C less than the width so we'll
write here C less than width
and then we'll write here C plus plus
fine
now we have to write here again this
curly braces because we are going to
write inside this for Loop now so we'll
write here let
tile so tile is a class
we have in a CSS file so we have new
style over here we'll write here
document
Dot
create element so we are going to use
document.createelement over here and
then we are going to write here span
fine
now the next thing we have to write here
is the tile ID so we'll write a tile dot
ID is equals to r dot to string
fine so we have to write here r dot to
string is a method so then we have to
write here plus now inside double
inverted commas we have to put a dash
over here then we have to write here
plus and we have to
add the C value so first we'll convert
the value of C to string and then we'll
add it over here so we'll write a plus c
dot to string
so we'll write here C dot to string we
are going to call this method again and
that's fine the next thing we have here
is tile Dot
plus list then what we'll do is we'll
write over here add and we are going to
add the tile class over here so we are
going to write it time
and the next thing we have to do is tile
Dot
in a text so we have to write here in a
text
and we have to give the value as null
over here fine the next thing we have to
do is we have to write here document dot
get element by ID then we have to get
the element of
basically we have to get the value of
board so what we are going to do is we
are going to pass a board and we are
going to pass a pen child over here so
we'll write a pen child and we are going
to append the values of board and time
so we'll write in time fine
that's it save the program move back to
the browser and you can see we have this
board over here so you can see the board
over here we are able to
seat so we have five columns you can see
one two three four five and six rows
away fine so it is working totally fine
till now
now let's create the keyboard as well so
we have to write here after this for
Loop so what we are going to do is we
are going to create a keyboard so let's
write a comment over here we'll write
here keyboard
and we'll start writing the code over
here so we are going to take a
variable over here so let's say the
variable name is keyboard and now what
we have to do is we have to write
the values present inside the keyboard
we already have those values over here
so
we'll copy these from here
and we are going to paste them over here
here fine
so let's do one thing let's write it
this way so we have the keyboard over
here we have all the keyboard
keys of the keyboard you can see we have
q w e r t by uiop then we have the next
line and finally we have the enter key
zxcvbn MN backspace fine
so this is a symbol for backspace
basically you can download it from
Google as well now the next thing we
have to do is we have to Define here a
for Loop we'll write your part we are
going to take a keyword let I is equals
to 0
then we have I less than
keyboard Dot
length and
then we have I plus plus over here fine
so now inside this for Loop what we are
going to do is we are going to take a
variable so we'll write here where
current row so we'll write your where
current row is equals to
keyboard and what we are going to do is
we are going to pass here I inside this
then we have let
keyboard row
is equals
to then we'll write your document
dot create element so we'll write a
document dot create element and we are
going to create a div tag over here fine
so we will write here div then we'll
write here keyboard
row
Dot
classlist dot add we are going to add
the keyboard row class over here so
we'll Define this class later in the CSS
file keep this thing in mind we'll write
here keyboard
row so we will write a keyboard and then
we'll write a hyphen fine so this is
going to be a class we are going to
Define it later in the CSS part I keep
mentioning it again and again so that
you guys will remember what we have to
do later on so we'll take another for
Loop over here let's say we have a
variable named as J
will right here let's J is equals to 0
J less than
current row
dot length
and will pass G plus plus y fine
now we'll write inside the body of this
for loop again so we'll write here let
key tile so we'll write here let ketile
is another variable we have taken over
here so we are going to write a document
Dot
create element and then we'll create a
div tag over here so we'll write here
div
and then we'll write here let
key so key is another variable over here
so we'll write here current row and
we'll pass J inside it
so we'll write here key tile
dot inner text so we'll write a key tile
dot inner text
is equals to and we are going to pass
the value of key away fine then after
this we'll use the if else statement so
we'll write here if key
is equals to is equals
to enter so what will happen is
the ketile ID will change to enter so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here inside this
key tile dot ID is equals
to enter
and we have to use the else if statement
as well for other keys so we'll write
here as if
key is equals to is equals
to backspace so we have a symbol for
backspace here
so we'll copy it from here we'll paste
the symbol over here
and now inside the body of this else
statement we'll write key tile
dot ID is equals to
backspace fine so that is going to be
backspace then we have another else if
soil right here else if
a and we'll put less than equals to sine
and we'll write here key
will pass another condition so we'll
write here key is
less than equals to
Z
and what will happen is
the key tile ID
is going to be
key
Plus
key
hey
and that's it we are going to add an
event listen over here to process the
key
so after this what will happen is we'll
put a semicolon over here first and
after the body of this lsf tag what we
have to do is we have to write here key
tile Dot
add event listener so we have to add an
event over here we'll
write a click
comma
process key fine so this is going to be
the event
and
now we have to write some more core over
here so we'll write here if
and we'll write here key is equals to is
equals to enter again
then what will happen is
key
tile the key tile Dot
class list so we are going to add a
class over here so we'll write here add
and we are going to rename the class as
let's say
and key
type fine so we'll create this class
later on in the CSS part again then
we'll write here else
and we are going to write here
key tile dot classlist dot add and let's
say we have the class name is
key type fine
that's it then after this we have to
write here
keyboard row dot append child
so we have to write a keyboard row dot a
pen child now we are going to append the
key tile class over here so we'll write
a key tile
and after this we have to write here
document
dot body Dot
append child and we have to write here
keyboard fine
so that's it
now we'll do this let us entering tasks
from the system keyboard as well that's
basically the keyboard we have in our
system so for that what we are going to
do is we are going to write here
document dot add event listener so we
are going to add an event then we'll
write here
key up
key up is going to be the event then
we'll write here e inside this and
will create an arrow function over here
so this is going to be an anonymous
Arrow function
now inside the body of this function
what we'll do is we'll write here
process
input and we are going to pass e over
here fine
so this is basically the keyboard part
we have save the program move back to
the browser and we'll see you can see
the process key is not defined over here
is the error so we'll Define the process
key later
now what we'll do is we'll write the CSS
part for the keyboard and for that we'll
move back to the CSS file so here we are
in the CSS file and what we'll do is
we'll Define the classes over here so
the first class we have is
the keyboard row class so we'll write
here dot keyboard row now we'll write
over here width of the keyboard width is
going to be 400 pixels then we have
margin so we'll write here margin margin
is going to be 0 and Auto for this
keyboard then we have the display as
flex and finally we have the flag strap
Flex wrap is going to be wrap and that's
it for the keyboard row class then we
have the key tile class so we'll write
here key
tile
and now inside this what we are going to
do is we are going to mention the width
again width of the key tile is going to
be 36 pixel then the height we have of
this key time so
will write here height height is going
to be 40 pixels let's say then we have
margin so margin is going to be 1 pixel
again for the key tile
then we have the border border is going
to be 1 pixel solid in nature and the
RGB value is
12 comma 12 comma 12 which is black so
then we have the Border radius border
radius is going to be 5 pixels again
and then we have to mention the font
family for the text so the font family
is going to be
this one and then we have Cambria
coaching giorgia times Times New Roman
and serif away fine
now the next thing we have to mention
for the text is the font size so we are
going to write your font size as 20
pixels then we have
font weight font weight is going to be
bold then we have the display display is
going to be Flex
and finally we have to justify content
at the Center fine
then we have to align these items at the
center as well
and that's it now we have to write the
code for the enter key type so we'll
write here dot enter
key tile and inside here we have to
mention the width width is going to be
76 pixels for the enter key
is bigger in size than other keys so we
have to mention the height height is
going to be the same as 40 pixels
then we have margin margin is going to
be one pixel again for this Enter key
and we have the
border as well border is going to be one
pixel
solid so we have to write your one pixel
solid and the RGB value is
going to be 0 comma
0 comma zero
so we'll
remove this blue and green from here and
that's it the RGB value is black
basically then we'll write you about a
radius border radius is again going to
be 5 pixel for the enter key as well now
we have to mention
for the text as well so the font size is
going to be 20 pixels then we have
font weight so font weight is going to
be
bold and then we have display as Flex
finally we have
justify content at the center and
we have to align items at the center is
fine
so we are done with the enter key tile
as well now what we'll do next is we'll
move back to the JavaScript part but
before that let's save this program
and we'll move back to the browser once
again you can see it says process key is
not defined will Define it later on
so for now let's move back to the
JavaScript part again
now what we have to do is we have to
create a function over here so we are
going to create the function process
input
before we move on to the process input
function what we'll do is we'll create
the process key function because we are
getting the error for this again and
again so we'll write here
function then we'll write your process
key
now inside the body of this function
what we have to do is we have to write a
e is equals to
code and then we'll write here
this Dot
ID fine so I guess it will work fine
then what we have to do is we have to
write a process input and we have to
pass e away fine we have to call the
process input function for me so save
this program move back to the browser
and you can see now we have the keyboard
over here
so you can see on clicking any key over
here it says process input is not
defined so let's define it as well first
and then we'll see if the keyboard is
working totally fine or not
so for the process input function we
have to write here
function
then we'll write your process input we
have to pass e as a parameter over here
and we'll write inside the function if
game over is true then return from here
fine
now we have
to write the e dot code over here so
we'll write here if
a
is less than equals to e dot code
and then
e dot code is
less than equals to
KZ
then what will happen well right here
inside the if block we'll write if
column is less than width
so we'll write here let
current type so we'll write here let
current tile is equals to
document dot get element by ID so we'll
write a get element by ID and ID is
going to be
row Dot
to string
plus then we'll put Dash over here or we
can say a hyphen We'll add what will add
is We'll add
call Dot to string fine so we'll write
your call.2 string this is again a
method
so we have to write here this and we
have to write here row dot two string
fine so I guess this will work totally
fine now
now after this what we'll do is we'll
write here again if
so we'll write here
current tile
dot inner text
is equals 2 is equals to nothing
and inside the body of this is if
statement we'll write
current time
dot inner code
or we can say in a text over here so we
have to write here current tile dot
inner text equals to e Dot
code so we have to write here 3
then we have to change the value to
column plus is equals to 1. fine
so we have to mention the elsif
statement as well so we'll write here
after this
if statement we'll write here else if
e dot code
is equals to is equals to backspace now
we'll delete
the letter so we'll write your backspace
and inside the body of this else if
we'll write if
0 is less than call so we'll write here
0 less than call
and
call is less than equals to width
then what will happen is call minus is
equals to 1 so basically what we are
doing is we are deleting the letter so
we'll write here this
and after this else if what we have to
do is we have to write here
inside the lcif only will write let
current time so we have to write a
current tile is equals
to document Dot
get element by ID then we'll write here
row dot to string so we'll write here
row dot two string this is a method then
we'll write here the same thing again
and we have to write here
call Dot
two string fine
so this is a method again we are good
with it and the next thing we are going
to do is we are going to write a
currentile DOT inner text
is equals to null over here fine
now the next thing we have to do is we
have to write the code for Enter key as
well so we'll write here
after this we'll write here else if
e
dot code
is equals 2 is equals
to enter
and what we have to do is we have to
call the update function fine
so this is going to be a function we are
going to create the update function
after this function so don't worry about
it now what we'll do is we'll write here
if
game is not over so we'll write here not
game over
and then
row is equals 2 is equals to height
and what will happen inside the body of
this if tag we have to write here game
over is equals to true
and we have to write here document
dot get element by ID and we have to get
the ID of the answer so we'll write a
answer
dot in a text
is equals to word so we are going to
print the word fine if the row is equals
to height and the gain is not over so
basically if we have all the blocks
filled we have all the rows filled and
if the last row is also filled then what
will happen is it will print the answer
in word so it will print the word as the
answer fine
so save it now move back to the browser
and we'll see
you can see as of now this thing is not
working but we have no error away so
let's refresh it once and you can see
there's no error still
so I guess it will work fine after we'll
do the update function as well so let's
right over here what we are going to do
is we are going to create the update
function for rest of the things we'll
check the input given by the user here
only so what we'll do is we'll write
your function
update
and what we have to do is we have to
write here a variable so let's say that
guess is equals to
null for now we are going to take a
variable guess and then what we'll do is
we'll write here
document dot get element by ID now what
we are going to do is we are going to
use the answer so we are going to write
a answer Dot
inner text
is equals to null for now now what we
have to do is we have to spring up the
gases into our so basically we what we
have to do is we have to take all the
letters from a particular row and we
have to pile them up in a world so what
we'll do here is we'll write here for
let's take a variable C is equals to 0
we'll write here C is less than
width so let's write here C is less than
width and C plus plus fine now what
we'll do is we'll write here let
current tile
is equals
to document dot get element by ID
and we have to write here again row Dot
so string
Plus
then we have to put a hyphen over here
then we have to put a plus and we'll
write here call Dot
two string fine
now the next thing we have to do here is
we have to take another variable so
we'll write here let letter
is equals to
current time Dot
in the text
so we'll write a currentile dot in a
text
and then what we have to do is we have
to add
this value to a gas variable so we'll
write a gas plus is equals to
letter fine
so we are done with this for Loop now
the next thing we have to do is we have
to update the value of guess
and we have to change the gas to lower
case now so we'll write here guess
Dot
two Lower Keys fine so we have to write
here two lowercase
this is again a method so we have to put
parenthesis over here this is case
sensitive basically
then we'll put it on the console so
we'll write a console.log
and we'll write you guess
fine
now what we are going to do is we are
going to check if the gas is present in
the gas list or not fine
so for that what we are going to do is
we are going to write here
so let's put some space over here well
right here if not
gas list
dot includes
what guess if the guest list does not
include the guess so what will happen is
we'll write here
document Dot
get element by ID and we are going to
write here answer so instead of answer
what will be there is Dot
in a text
is equals to
not in the
word list or not in word list basically
over here we'll write not in word list
and that's it
fine
now what we have to do is we have to
write here return
we have to return this thing so that's
it we are done with
this guess part now the next thing we
are going to do is we are going to start
processing the guess we have so for that
what we'll do is we'll take a variable
correct the initial value of correct is
going to be 0.
and let's say we have another variable
letter
count fine
so we are going to take
so basically what we are going to do is
we are going to keep a track of letter
frequency so that's why we are doing it
now what we have to do here is we have
to write here
for we are going to use another for Loop
so let's say we have a variable I with
initial value as 0
and then we have I is less than
word dot length
and we have I plus plus over here fine
so basically we are done with
the for Loop let's write inside the body
of this for Loop what we'll do is we'll
write letter
is equals to what
and then we have to check the world so
we'll write here I then we'll use if
let account
of
letter
and we'll write here inside the body of
this if statement
letter count
ER
plus is equals to 1. fine
now what we'll do is we'll write after
this else
now inside the body of else what we'll
do is we'll put the let account to one
so we'll write here letter count
now inside this we'll write letter
is equals to 1. fine
so basically what we have to do is we
have to write here
after this
console Dot
lock and we have to put the print the
let account fine
so
till now we are done with this now what
we'll do is we'll check for the first
iteration we'll check for all the
correct ones first
so what we'll do is we'll write here
after this
for we are going to use another for Loop
for this so let's say we have variable C
the initial value of C is set to 0
will check the width of C so we'll write
here C is less than width then what will
happen is
c will increase so we'll write here C
plus plus now inside the body will write
let
current tile is equals to document Dot
get element by ID now we are going to
write here the same thing again row dot
to string
we have a method as row dot two string
now we have to put a hyphen over here
then we have to put
call Dot
to string over here fine
now we have to take the letter variable
so we'll write a letter is equals to
current time dot inner text so basically
it has the value of the current type
so we'll write a currentile dot in a
text
so is it in the correct position now we
are going to check it fine so we'll
write here if
word so what is the word c
is equals to is equals
to letter
then what will happen is
the current tile value so I will write
here current time Dot
class list dot add so basically we are
going to create a class for correct
which will change the background color
of that particular key end of that
particular
box or tie fine so we'll write here
correct so we are going to create this
class in the CSS part
now after this what we have to do is we
have to write here let key type key tile
is equals to document dot get element by
ID so we have to write here
key
Plus
letter fine
then we have
Dot
class list
Dot remove so we have
to write here the present class
and then we have to write here key type
Dot
classlist dot add the correct clause so
we'll write here
correct fine so we are going to Define
these two classes in the CSS part
now the next thing we have to do is we
have to increase the value of correct by
1 so we'll write here correct plus is
equals to 1 fine then we have let
account and we are going to decrease the
value of let account Pi 1 so we'll write
here
minus is equals to 1. let's put some
space over here as well
so that it will look good to you guys
now we are done with the let account as
well so what we'll do next is
we are going to
right here after this particular if
statement so
right here we are going to write if
correct is equals to is equals to width
then what will happen is
game over will change to
true fine
this is another condition we have now
what we have to do next is we have to
write here
so basically what we are going to do is
we are going to print the console
or we can say we are going to print the
let account on the console so we'll
write here let account and site
console.log
and now what we'll do is we'll go again
and Mark which ones are present but in
the wrong position that means the yellow
color ones right so we'll write here
after this
console.log will write for we are going
to use another for Loop so we will write
here let
C is equals to 0 again
C is less than the width so we'll write
here C less than width then we'll
increase the value of C by 1 so we'll
write a C plus plus then we'll write
here let
current tile
is equals
to document dot get element by ID
so we are going to write here row Dot
to string
and then we have this hyphen over here
and we'll write here Plus
all Dot
two string fine
so we are going to take the values of
these and then after this what we are
going to do is we are going to set the
value of letter variable so we'll write
here let letter is equals to
what's present inside the current type
so we'll write here current tile Dot
in a text
and the next thing we are going to do is
we are going to skip the letter if it
has been marked correct so for that what
we have to do is we have to use the if
statement so we will write here if
not current I Dot class list
Dot
contains what it contains is the correct
class so we'll write here correct if it
contains correct what will happen is
we'll check if it is present in the word
we have to make sure that we don't
double count right so what we'll do is
we'll write here again inside this if
statement we'll take another if
statement and we'll write your word Dot
includes
now we have to write here
letter
and we have to mention it over here
after this we have to write here letter
count now what we have to do is we have
to write a letter
and we have to write here greater than 0
fine
now what will happen is we'll write here
current time current tile Dot
classlist
dot add we have to add it to
present class so we'll write your
present fine
now what we have to do is we have to
write here let
petile is equals to
document dot get element by ID what we
have to do is we have to write here key
Plus
fine
okay so we have to write here after this
what we have to do is we have to take
another if
fine so we'll write here if not
key type
Dot
class list
dot contains which class the correct
class so we'll write here correct
and we'll write here inside this
key type
Dot class list dot add
but we have to add over here is the
present class fine
now what we'll do is we'll
deduct the value of let account by 1 so
we'll write here let account
and we have to pass letter inside here
and we'll write here minus is equals to
1. fine
now what we have to do is we have to
write the code for else as well so we'll
write here else
now what we'll write inside else is
current tile Dot plus list dot add which
class we have to add now is the absent
class fine so we'll write here absent we
are going to describe this class or we
are going to Define this task in the CSS
part later on
so for now we have to write here absent
and we have to change the value of key
type so we'll write here key tile is
equals to
document dot get element by ID we have
to write here again key Plus
letter fine let's put a space over here
and that's it
what we have to do is we have to change
the ketile class as well so we'll write
here
Dot
plus list dot add which class we have to
add again is the absent class fine
we are almost done with the JavaScript
part as well what we have to do is we
have to start a new row for a new one so
we'll increase the value of row as
row plus plus equals to 1 start a new
row and we have to change the column
value to
0 again fine so basically we are done
with it so before we move on to the
final outcome let's do one thing let's
go through the CSS part once again and
we'll Define these three classes the
correct present and absent Clause fine
save the JavaScript part here save it
now and let's move back over here and
what we'll do is
well right after this tile class what
we'll do is we'll write over here
dot correct we are going to define the
correct class first so the correct class
the background color is going to be this
one hash
3 f c
and the value is 0 3 1 so the green
color basically the font color will
change to White so we'll write here
color as white and then we have border
color so border color will also change
to White fine
then we have the present class as well
so we'll write your present and inside
the present class the background color
will change and the value of background
color is Hash f
5 c e 2 3 fine so this is basically
yellow color so
the color and the background color will
remain the same so
okay so we have to write here border
color not background color so we'll
write your border color
and again we are going to define the
Border color here fine so we'll write
border color
so border color is going to be white in
this case as well now we have to define
the absent class as well so we'll write
here absent
for the absent class the background
color will change to gray fine so we'll
write here
hash
787
C7
e fine
so this is the gray color we have the
color is going to be white
and then we have the border color fine
so the Border color is again going to be
white
that's it we are done with everything
now save the program save the JavaScript
part and the HTML part once again move
back to the browser and here you can see
we have a program
so if we click on the keyboard so it's
not working as of now
maybe we have some error over here so
let's check it out once again
we'll move to the JavaScript part
and if we can see here
Kita is fine so we have to write here
key tile like this
and let's check the other key tile as
well so everything else is fine
save the program now save the CSS part
and the HTML part as well move back to
the browser and I hope this will work
now
so you can see it's working as of now
now we have written over quote you can
see it says not in word list we have
quote over here so the word we have is
title let's write
title over here and you can see the
second line is not working
so we have to get back to this and we
have
it now move back to the browser
okay it's working now
and you can see
so the word we have here is hyped so
let's try to write okay we have to
remove this first that's why it was not
working so we have to write here another
word let's say we have a word mango
click on enter and you can see now it's
working fine now the word we have here
is hyped so we'll write here
hyped click enter and you can see we
have all greens over here you can see
the word count as well we have h y p e d
s one one one one one one one
and we have all the words here in the
console
so you have seen here the program is
working totally fine the task is done so
get ready for some exciting stuff coming
your way let's start this session by
taking an overview of our website
so let me Zoom it so this is the website
we are going to create in today's video
here you can see we have an HTML web
page with a navigation bar to take the
user to different sections of a website
I hope you already know that we have to
create several web pages for a single
website to make it a fully functional
website we have to create these Pages
separately in different HTML documents
and then we have to provide the links to
this particular home page for directing
the user to various locations of a
website
if you see here in the navigation bar
we have several options starting with
our company's logo so Comfort learning
is the company's logo here we have an
icon of the book to let the user know
that this website is for learning
so we'll see further in this video how
we can use these logos and all then we
have links for several other web pages
of our website that are not working
because we haven't added these web pages
till now the reason for this is we don't
want to make this project a long one we
want to finish it quickly and we want to
give you guys a basic idea of how to use
JavaScript and other Technologies to
create a fully functional website
next up we have a card button over here
on clicking it opens the cart with items
present inside it and the user can
either clear the whole cart or proceed
further to buy all the things they need
right following this card button we have
a background image over here with a card
present over the image
the card says find your favorite course
here now you guys might have guessed
that this website is for buying courses
and the user can buy some courses here
which they want to study
this shop now button is completely
working and if we click on it it will
take us to the courses catalog where we
have several courses present to choose
from we have eight different courses
present here you can add as many courses
as you want or as many products as you
want
so we can add any of them to the cart on
taking the mouse cursor over any image
you can see it gives us an option to add
that particular product to the cart
right
if you click on this add to cart button
you can see it says in cart it means
that we can't add any specific course to
the cart more than once
we can later change the number of items
in the card but we can add a course only
once from you let's add some courses to
the card and then we'll see if it's
working or not
so we'll add few courses we'll add this
one so it says this course is already
present in cart similarly this course is
also present and we can add this course
now we'll move to the cart we will click
on this card button and you can see we
have all the courses present over here
now if you notice here we have these
small arrows present right we can click
on these arrows to change the number of
items we can either increase the number
of items or we can decrease the number
of items as well then we have a remove
button over here and if we click on this
remove button you can see the course is
removed now we can remove any number of
courses we want and we can also increase
the number of products in our card
following it we have two options over
here either we can clear the whole cart
or we can proceed if we click on this
clear card button there will be no
course present in the card and the total
price will change to 0 in that case fine
so I hope you guys must have known the
task by now it's clear and seems
effortless right but these small things
take a lot of precise coding and
attention to work smoothly
so let me show you guys one more thing
before we move on to the coding part if
we reduce the size of a web page or we
can say if we remove the size of a
browser you can see the size of website
also changes if we make the browser
similar to a phone you can see we have
got a menu type of thing over here and
if we click on this we are getting the
options here we have home categories
pricing and about us right so these were
the options present in the navigation
bar we can get them inside a particular
menu using CSS we'll see how it actually
works
so a website is responsive right we'll
do it with the help of CSS so let's move
on to the programming part now
so here we are in the vs code we have
all the images already present inside
the images folder in our system so if
you want to see you can see here we have
all the images present over here and we
have four different files we have app.js
we have
index.html products.json to add products
and we have style.css to style all the
elements fine here we are in the HTML
file some of you guys may think that
HTML CSS and JavaScript were fine but
what's up with the Json thing we haven't
heard of it in the previous videos so
let me tell you guys Json stands for
JavaScript object notation just like we
create objects in JavaScript Json is
also used to create objects like name
value Pairs and later we can use these
objects to retrieve that data in a HTML
file in simple words to add an item to a
cart we need to store it somewhere to
get that data related to the object and
then we can add those items to our cart
so Json is used to transmit the data
between a server and a web application
we need to store our products somewhere
so that we can use them when added to
cart so you'll get to know more about it
while working on it basically so for now
if you know enough about JavaScript
objects then Json will be easy for you
guys because the syntax remains almost
similar in both the cases that is in
JavaScript and in Json
so let's start writing the code now here
we are in a HTML file and we have
already linked all the files over here
you can see here we have used font
awesome library for icons we'll use on
our website you have seen that book icon
we have used in our logo part and
several other icons like the cart icon
Etc so we'll include those predefined
icons in a HTML file using this
particular library to include this
specific Library you don't have to do
much of a task go to Google Search
cdnjs.com slash libraries
slash font awesome
go to Google and search for this and
then select version
4.7.0 under the version option copy the
third URL with min.css as extension and
paste it into your HTML file as simple
as that I'll let you know about the
classes we'll use while working on the
website now let's start with the
programming part
the first thing we have on our website
is the navigation bar right let me show
it to you again so here you can see we
have a navigation bar we'll first work
on this one only
so let's start writing the code so this
is the output of a current website so
what we'll do is
will minimize the browser and we'll
start writing the code here only
so what we'll do is we'll write here
nav
class is equals to nav bar
then inside this we'll write div
class is equals 2.
Burger
and inside this we'll write three div
tags fine we'll write here div class is
equals to layer 1
we'll close this div we'll copy it from
here and we'll paste it again three
times
fine
we'll write here layer 2 and layer 3 is
class then after this particular div tag
We'll add another div tag with
class is
logo
then inside this we'll use the span tag
we'll write here span class
is equals to logo
logo text and then we'll
write here
I will use the itech to make it a little
bit italic so we'll use the class as
far
book fine
we'll write here
tile
is equals to margin
margin right we'll write here margin
right as
0.1 M then we'll write here
similarly we could close this fine
now we have added the book icon to our
website
then what we'll do is we'll write here
again
span will use the span tag within this
span tag we'll write here
tile is equals to
color and the color code is
hash
F 0 9 5 D1
so these are the color codes for this
particular website
will use them we have written here F 0 9
d51
fine
then what we'll do is we'll write here
font size as
1.1 M and what we'll do next is we'll
write here
before the span tag closes we'll write
here
learning fine so what we did wrong here
is we forgot to mention Comfort here
now we are done with the logo part next
up what we'll do is we'll write here div
class is equals to
menu bar we are working on the menu bar
for the hamburger menu so what we'll do
is we'll write here
UL so UL stand for unordered list we'll
write here class is
list
and inside this we'll use
litec so we'll write here
class is let's say list items
will
right here
a href is equals to hash
and here what we'll do is we'll write
here who fine we'll copy this piece of
code
we'll paste it again
three or four times we have four
different options we have home we have
courses and then we have pricings
and finally we have about us fine so we
are done with menu as well next up what
we'll do is we'll write the code for
card now so we'll write here div
class is equals to cart
and inside this will write
I
class is equals to
far far shopping cart for 1X so here we
have used this special class to include
the card icon to a web page now next up
what we'll do is we'll write here
div
class is equals
two number of
items
and then we'll write here
pen
class is equals to let's say Nui
now what we'll do is we'll write here 0
inside this fine
I hope you guys understood what we did
till now we are working on the
navigation bar only we have created the
navigation bar so this is the code
firstly we have used a class navbar for
this particular navigation bar then we
have used the div tag for Burger menu we
have three different layers layer 1
layer 2 and layer 3. so this is actually
the icon of burger menu you can see here
if we reduce the size of our website so
we have defined this burger menu and
inside this we have four other options
which we defined later here inside the
menu bar
and we have four options right we have
home courses pricings and about us
so we are doing totally right
so till now we did some basic tasks here
right we have added all the navigation
bar elements and the next thing we have
to do is to style our navigation bar
according to the final website it's
pretty simple let's do one thing let's
save it once and check the output now
let's see if it's working so it's
totally working we have a book icon over
here we have comfort learning written
over here we have cart icon over here
and we have zero written over here fine
now we have to style those elements
accordingly to make it look like this so
we are making this navigation bar so
what we'll do is we'll move to our CSS
file and we'll start styling by doing
some default style changes to the entire
HTML document we'll write here
star
margin will be 0 the default margin will
be zero
padding will be zero
then we have
box sizing we'll write here border box
and font size will be
20 pixels for default fine
next up we'll write here
HTML will now style the HTML document
we'll write here
scroll behavior is smooth
and will
right here anchor tag will right here
text decoration and we'll write a text
decoration as none
and then we'll style the unordered list
we'll write a UL
will write here
list style as
none fine
basic styling is done let's do some more
for the navigation bar as well what
we'll do is we'll write here
dot navbar this is the first class we
have used in a HTML page we'll write
here display is
Flex
then we'll write here
justify content as
space between
align items as
Center
height as 10 VH so 10 VH refers to the
viewport height it will take 10 percent
of the total height of the screen
then we have
background color is hash
e c e c e c so a little bit of gray
grayish white we can say
then next thing we'll do is we'll style
our logo we'll write here logo and
inside this will write
padding so we will write here padding
left and the padding left will be 2m
next up we'll write here logo
text so this is the next class will
write here
font size is 1.5
m
now the next class we have to use is
the menu bar class so we'll write here
width is 45 percent
and
margin left is
8.5 M fine
I'll let you know what this m means in a
moment so first we'll do this styling
and all next up we'll write here dot
list
we'll access the list and we'll write
here inside this display is
Flex
and
justify content as space between
fine next up we have the list items so
we'll write here list items
and we'll of course write here a as well
we'll write a color and the color will
be let's say black
next up what we'll do is we'll write
here
font family is
sensory font size is
0.9 m
so you must have noticed earlier that
the default font size was 20 pixels so
keep that in mind I'll let you know the
use of M in a moment next up we'll write
here
transition
0.4 seconds
and we are good to go with it next up
we'll
write here list items
and we'll write here
fine
then we'll write here
color is
black
on hovering the color of the list items
will change to Black
now the next thing we'll do is we'll
write here cart
ing right will be
2m and Position will be relative fine
we are done with the cart next up we'll
write here
cart
number
of items fine
we'll write here
display is
Flex
cursor is
pointer we are using repeat we are
styling two different classes here we
are styling the element with classes cut
and the element with classes number of
items fine we'll write here justify
contents
to Center
align items to Center
we'll write here color is
White
Position will be absolute
and then we'll write here left
as 18 pixels and
write as okay sorry we'll write here
left as 18 pixels and top as
minus 7 pixels
next up we'll write
background
so the background color will be hash f
0 9
D 5 1. so this will be a the background
color we'll Define the height and width
as well so height will be
20 pixels and the width will also be
20 pixels fine
the last thing we have to write here is
the Border radius
so keep one thing in mind guys while you
are styling all these elements do check
the website after every styling event
because this will let you know what this
particular event does or what this
particular styling property does to that
particular element so do it when you are
writing this code next up we'll write
here
Dot number of items space dot knowing so
now it was the class we have already
declared we'll write here font size is
0.7 m
the next class will be styling is the
shopping cart so we'll style this icon
as well we'll write here
font size as 1.5 mm
the font size will be equal to around 30
pixels
then we'll write here
cursor is
pointer
then we'll write here
Burger will tell the menu as well right
here
height height will be 28 pixels
width
will be
32 pixels
and then we'll write here
display is none then we'll
style the layers as well we'll write
here dot layer 1 dot layer 2.
n dot layer
3.
now inside this we'll write
background as
black
High test 4 pixel
margin top is
4 pixel
width as
100 percent and we'll write here border
radius is 10 pixels
fine you have seen that hamburger menu
you have seen that icon we were styling
that till now now you might have noticed
here that we have used M here in this
CSS file so I'm talking about this
particular m
or we can say em as well
until now we were using rem or pixel to
define the size of anything while
studying but today we are using M
because M uses the font size for example
if the font size is 30 for the parent
class in this case the font size is 20
the default font size is 20. and the
padding is defined as 2m then the
padding will be 40 in that case it uses
the font size to determine the size of
the property that's why we are using M
and if you try it yourself you will get
to know better so just try using M and
you can also use rem or pixel in this
case but for now we'll use M so this
might be a little bit new for you guys
but try it and you will understand it
much better
now save the CSS file
move back to the browser and you can see
here that we have a navigation bar ready
right it's looking fine although the
icons are not visible the book icon and
the cart icon is not visible so let's go
back and see what's wrong in this
CSS file what we'll do is
will move to HTML file and we'll see if
something is wrong here or not so
nothing is wrong in this case the error
is because we are not connected to
Internet so if this error continues just
try to connect your laptop or your PC to
the internet and the icons thing will
work fine so you can see here we have
icons over here we have the book icon we
have the cart icon and what we have to
do is we have to increase the size of
this logo and text a little bit right so
here you can see the Comfort learning is
a little bit small when compared to this
particular website so what we'll do is
we'll move to a CSS file and we'll write
here instead of 1.5 Ram we'll write here
2m fine save it
and here you can see it's looking fine
now
actually it's equal
the difference is because of this scroll
bar we don't have this scroll bar in our
website until now so this is why it
looks a little bit different to you guys
it's working totally fine other than
that
so let's move on to the next part and
the next part of our website is the
background image with the card present
on it right so let's write the code for
this section as well
what we'll do is we'll move to a HTML
file
and
right here will write
section
class is equals to section one
so we are using the section tag to
define a particular section in the web
page now we'll write here div
class is equals to Banner
and here we'll write inside H1 tag
find your
favorite
courses
or course here
then inside this what we'll do is we'll
write here
a
href is equals
to products so the products file will be
using Json for this so leave it for now
we'll write here shop now so shop now is
actually not a button what we'll do is
we'll use a link and we'll Define it
later so let's
save it
and move to the browser
open this website and you can see here
it says find your favorite course here
and it says shop now it's not inside the
banner because we need to style this
particular section to make it look like
a website so let's do the styling part
as well
and then we'll talk about it
so we'll move to the CSS file now
and here what we'll do
will write here Dot
section one
height
we'll use the calc function and we'll
write here
100
which minus
10 VH so what we are doing is we are
reducing the
navigation bars height we are reducing
10 viewport height from 100 viewport
height it means that from the whole
screen area it will reduce 10 VH and
give it to that particular image fine so
next up we'll write here
width as hundred percent we wanted to
cover the whole home page so that's why
we are using width as hundred percent
background
so we'll add the background image we'll
write a URL
and inside this will give the path of
our image
will write his images
back one dot PNG
and we'll write here
Center
cover fine
let's do some more things we'll write
here top
0
left is zero
Z index
as minus one fine
save it now move to the browser and see
if it's working so here we are we have
our image over here but this Banner is
not here till now we'll style it so you
can see the images over here and one
more thing guys we have two three images
over here inside a images folder I'll
let you see all of them so here are the
images
and this is the third one
okay so this is the third one so I was
not sure which one to use but if you
guys liked any of these images do let us
know in the comments below and we'll use
that particular image for now
we'll use my personal favorite image
we'll use back one dot PNG save it now
and this is the image we are going to
use in this particular video so let me
know if you have any other preference or
if you know any other image we'll use
that as well then we'll write here
section
one
and we'll style the banner as well for
that we'll write here Banner
height
is going to be 170 pixels
width
is going to be
600 pixels
background
is going to be a little bit Krish
so we'll write here rgba
255 comma two double five comma two
double five comma
0.7 so this is the particular rgba value
and next up we'll write here
position as relative top is
50 percent
left as 50 percent of the image
we want the banner to be present at the
center of the image right so next up
we'll write here
transform
Translate
and inside it will write
minus 50 percent
to minus 50 percent
next up we'll write here display is
Flex
justify content as
space around
and
Flex direction is
column
text align
is
Center
and then we have align items is
Center
font family is going to be
sensitive again
and we'll Define the Z index as well so
this index is going to be
8 in this case fine
next up we'll inside the H1 tag inside
the banner
so we'll write here Banner
H1 and inside this
we'll Define the font size is
2m
now
we need to define the
link for shop now so for that we'll
write here display is
Flex
justify content is
Center
padding is going to be
1M
page 2 point
5 m
next up we'll write here
font size is
0.8 m
so this is the font size for the shop
now button which looks like a button but
it is actually a link
so
what we'll do is we'll Define the color
of this button is white
and here the background color is going
to be
h
F 9 0 d51
let's use this color
and we'll write here transition all at
zero point
three second
now save it once move to the browser
and you can see it looks fine though the
only thing that is different here in
this website is the color of this link
right or is the color of the shop now
button so we can change the color here
the color is
sky blue so
let's try to do it so here you can see
the color seems a little bit different
now I don't know the actual value of
this color that's why I'm not sure about
it so what we'll do is
will make it a little
more bright
with
save it now
and you can see it looks same now so
this was the color we found that now we
have to change the color of this button
on hovering over it so what we'll do is
we'll write here
dot Banner a
over
so
the background we are going to change
we'll write here hash D4
76e
1.
okay
one e
the color codes are pretty hard to
remember so we are not using this
particular color so we'll change
it to a little bit blue
save it now move to the browser and you
can see it looks nice right
and the actual website it's a little bit
dull but in our website it looks nice
right it's a little bit dark than the
original color
so that's fine you can change the color
according to you
so you have seen that this part is also
done it looks nice right till now
the task we did was quite easy the next
thing we have to do is to add products
to our website which are the courses
We'll add those images to our website
using Json only so let's do the HTML
part first let's finish up the HTML part
and then we'll move on to the Json part
so will
move to the HTML file again and inside
this
now what we'll do is we'll Define the
section for
products so we'll write here
section
class is equals to
section 2
and ID is equals to
products fine we'll use both the class
and the ID attribute for this particular
section
we'll write here div
class is equals
to title
and here what we'll do is we'll write
here H1
and inside this we'll write courses we
offer
here we'll again add another div
and inside this will write class is
product
close this div tag
save it and there will be no difference
on the web page you can see here we have
some text present at the bottom which
says courses we offer nothing else let's
add those images now what we'll do is
we'll move to the Json file and we'll
add those images with some properties
and pictures so let's move on to the
Json file
so here is a Json file products dot Json
what we'll do is we'll create an object
here so we'll write here
items
and then we'll use square brackets now
one thing to notice while working on any
Json file is that Json doesn't let us
use single inverted commas or we have to
use double inverted commas for Json file
so if we write here items like this
foreign
so in Json file we have to use double
inverted comma or double quotes not
single quotes So now inside the items
what we'll do is we'll create the object
for first image so we'll write here says
and then we'll write a ID
so ID will be
1.
we have to use commas to separate the
properties so now we'll write here
fields
colon and inside this we have to use
title so the title for first course will
be
Python programming
Master course fine
now next thing we'll do is we'll write
here
the price
the price will be let's say 1 to 3.99
dollars
and then we'll write here
image
so inside this we will Define
several properties for the particular
image we'll write
fields
and we'll use colon then again we'll use
curly braces we'll write here
file
colon then again we'll use curly braces
we'll write here
URL
so you can see it just says there's an
error so we have to remove this curly
braces from here and we have to put it
here now inside URL what we'll do is
will give
the name of a file so a file is stored
in images folder and the file name is
and the picture name is python dot PNG
fine
so it is working fine now what we have
to do is we have to put a comma here to
again insert one more
image property so we'll copy it from
here
we'll paste it
for 8 times
then what we are going to do here now is
we are going to change the ID
the title of the course
so the second course is C plus plus
Master course
and the price for this is let's say
110.99 we have to change the path as
well this image is stored as
C plus plus dot PNG
for the third one we'll write here ID is
three
the title is going to be web development
for beginners
the price is let's say
99 because this is a course for
beginners and the file name is
instead of python we'll write here
web1.png
will do the same for all the elements
so next up we'll use ids4
and title is
Java programming
Master course fine
the price for this course is going to be
149.99 and the file name is
java.png
fine next up we'll write here ID is five
the title is going to be digital
marketing
full course
the price is going to be
109.99 dollars
and the name of image is
digital.png
then we have IDs 6 for another course
this course is going to be
advance
web development and the price is going
to be comparatively High because this is
an advanced course so instead of python
we'll write here
web 2 because this is the name of our
image then we have ID S7
and the file name is going to be data
structures and algorithms
full course
prices you can decide by yourself so
instead of 123 will use 99.99 here and
inside
this will write data.png this is a file
name
then we have the ID as 8 for the last
course
the course name is
data science full course
the price is going to be 149.
and image name is
data 2.
fine
so here you can see it says there is an
error remove this comma because we don't
have any other image remaining so we are
done with the Json file all of this may
sound a little bit tricky to you guys
but it is what it is and we have to keep
certain things in mind for that we can't
see these products in the browser until
we are done with the JavaScript part as
well so let's do the rest of the HTML
part first and then we'll see how this
works in JavaScript save it once go to
the browser
and here you can see we are not able to
see those products till now
so what we are going to do next is we
are going to move to a HTML file and
inside this we are going to do the
remaining of a HTML part so what we'll
do is we'll write here div
class is equal to cart
sidebar
now we are creating the structure for
our card sidebar it means that when we
use the hamburger menu or when we
decrease the size of a web page or web
browser the card will open at the site
so we are doing the coding for that
we'll write inside this div
class is equals to cart
and inside here we'll write
pen
class is equals to
close cut
now inside this we'll add an icon we'll
write here I
class is equals for four times
and we are done with it now next up what
we are going to do is we are going to
write the code inside of our cart we are
going to write here H2 it will say
your card
and inside this we'll write div
class is equals to
card content next up we'll write here
div
class is equals
to
Tal
sum
and we are going to use dollars right so
we'll write here
H1
we'll write here
your total and
we'll use the dollar sign here
after this we'll write span class is
equals
to total
amount let's say we are going to change
the class name it will be total amount
we'll close this here and inside this
we'll write 0 because at this start
there will be no element or no product
present in the cart so the total price
will be 0 at the initial point so that's
why we have written 0 here
now we are going to write here div
class is equals
to clear cart
and inside this we are going to create a
button
so the button class will be
BTN
clear card BTN so this is going to be a
class and here what we'll do is we'll
write here
clear card fine
we are going to do the same for proceed
button as well so we'll write here div
class is equals to
clear card we are going to use the same
class for both the buttons because I'll
let you know what why we are doing this
at the end of this project now we'll
write here
button
class is equals
to button
clear card
button
fine we'll write here
proceed
we are done with the card function now
what we are going to do is we are going
to write some code for the menu bar side
menu bar so we'll write here
div
class is equals to let's say
menu sidebar inside this will write div
class is equals to close menu
and we'll write here I
class is equals
to Far Far times
and we'll
close this eye tag over here
next up we'll write here after this
class we'll write div
class is equals to menu let's say this
name is menu menu bar
and inside this will write here
an ordered list class will be
menu list
foreign
right here
Li class is equals to
menu list items and we'll write here a
href
is equals to Hash we'll write your home
and we are good to fine we'll do the
same for categories pricings and about
us so
we'll copy this
statement
will paste it for four times here we'll
write instead of Home categories
pricings and about us fine so we are
done with the whole HTML part now and we
are left with CSS and JavaScript only
let's do that as well let's move on to
the CSS part first and do the rest of
the styling except for the products
we'll do it for products at the last so
let's move on to the CSS file first and
what we'll do is
so that it will not create any confusion
we'll write here menu bar because we
have to write the code here between this
Banner style property and this menu bar
for the products section so that's why I
will start writing the code from here
and later we'll add our code here in
between
so we'll write here dot menu
sidebar display will be none
and then we'll write here Dot
card
sidebar
background is going to be
hash
e-c-e-c-e-c so a little bit grayish
white we can say
we'll write here position as
fixed
right as 0
and top is zero
so these are the properties we are
defining in a CSS part then we'll write
your width as 450 pixels and
height is
100 viewport height find
we'll Define the Z index as well we'll
write here Z index
is 10
transition
is all at 0.3 seconds and the transition
will be linear fine
next up we'll write here
transform
and inside transform will write here
translate X fine so inside here we'll
write
100 percent
it will go along with the x-axis that's
why we have written it over here we'll
write here overflow
crawl
we are done with it next up we'll write
here dot cart
sidebar and we'll write here dot cart as
well so we will Define padding here
we'll write here padding 0 in both
the cases
next up we have
dot cart and
close card right so we'll write here for
both of them we'll write here Dot card
space close card the font size is going
to be 1.3 m
padding is going to be 1M
and cursor is going to be pointer fine
we'll write here Dot
for times
inside this we'll write
margin top
as 0.5 m
and we'll write here cart H2
text
align will be center for the heading of
a cart which is your cut so we'll write
your width is
100 percent
margin bottom is going to be 1 m
and
what else we have to do we have to
include the font size as well so we'll
write here font
size is 1.1 in slightly bigger than the
default font size
then we'll write here
font family let's use only one fine
let's use vardana only
so we'll write your vardana and next up
we'll write here Dot
card product
space dot product
image
space IMG now we are going to write here
something now we are going to write the
code for all the images present inside
the cart so that's why we are writing
here width
is 130 pixels
of that particular image the width is
going to be 130 pixels and the height is
going to be
90 pixel let's say
fine
we are done with this as well
next up we'll write here
dot cart
content fine
now we'll write here display is flex
Flex direction is
column
and we have
justify content as space around
and align items at the center
we'll write a margin
left is 1 m
and
height is
80 pixels fine
we are done with this as well we'll
write here dot plus Dash minus
this is for increasing or decreasing the
product number in our cards those arrows
you must have remember which we have
seen in the website let me show you
again
so these are the arrows I'm talking
about let me add a product
now go to cart and these are the arrows
I'm talking about right now
so we are going to style those arrows as
well
so we'll write here
display is flex
and
transform
we are going to rotate them so we are
going to write here rotate
it
90 degree
that will look cool so we'll write here
color is
again
hash
f09d51 so this is the color code for a
particular color we'll write here font
size is 1.5 m
and we'll write here
cursor as pointer
next up we are going to do the styling
for total sum so we'll write here
total sum
text align at the center
and margin is
going to be 1M
0
point
5m and
0 again
so it's for top bottom left and right
everyone
so we'll write here next
clear card
text align at the center
and we'll write here clear card
button
now for the clear card button we'll
write here
background
so background color is going to be
again that same one
orange we can say or little bit of
orange as well and don't know the exact
name for that color but it doesn't
matter right we can
do anything we can use any color so the
font color is going to be white
the border is going to be one pixel
solid
and
white in color for the button right if
we go back to our website and you can
see here this is our button
so we are styling this particular button
now
let's go back here
and we'll write here
padding is
0.5 m
and
1.7 fine
cursor will be pointer
and
of course transition is going to be at
0.3 seconds and
linear fine
next up we'll write here
clear card
dot button
on hovering over it what we want is
we'll write here over
and we'll Define the property now so
we'll write here
border
okay
we'll write your border murder is going
to be one
pixel thick solid in nature
end of
this color so we'll write here D4
761e
fine
honoring the color will change
obviously so we'll write here this and
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write here background is
transparent
and
color is black
fine
done with this as well next up we'll
write here overlay for overlay the
height is going to be
100 viewport height
the position is going to be
fixed
the top is going to be 0 similarly the
left
will also be zero
we'll Define the Z index as well we'll
write as Z index as nine
and width has
100 percent
the background color
is going to be
hash
F 3 8 5
1f
fine
so this is for overlay
will write here
opacity
as zero point three
and
transition
it's all
0.3 seconds and
linear fine so what we are doing is we
are writing the code for this if we open
our cart you can see this particular
area or this particular field is a
little bit different from what it was it
is a little bit different in color and
opacity is also different the opacity is
0.3 here we can make it fully opaque as
well so for now we'll use 0.3 only
next up what we are going to do is we
are going to write the property
foreign
now what we are going to do is we are
going to write the CSS part for tablets
and for Mobile screen so if you remember
that if we reduce the size of this
Chrome browser the size of our website
also reduces and it becomes like this so
to achieve this we have to write
particular CSS code for tablet and for
phone we have to define the max width
and we have to do some more things in
there so what we'll do is we'll write
here
at the rate
media
screen and
Max width is going to be
768 pixels fine
now inside this we'll write dot logo
will change the logo
as well
right here padding left is
zero
and after this we are going to write
here dot cart heading right is 2m
after card will write here dot menu bar
so we are going to change all the
properties here almost all the
properties which we'll require so we'll
write a display as none the menu bar
will disappear we'll write here dot
Burger
and inside this we'll write
margin left the burger sign will come
into existence now
we'll write here 2m for the margin left
for display
will write your block
next up we have to do something for
Section 1 and for product section as
well so we'll write here Dot
Section 1 and we'll write here Dot
Banner H1
so we'll write here font size is 1.5 m
and we'll write here Dot
Banner a we are going to change the size
of our
shop now button so we'll write here
font size is 0.6 m
and padding is 1 M and
2m
fine
we are done with this as well next up
we'll write here
dot section
2
. title
and we'll write here H1
inside this we'll write font
size is
1.5 m
so we haven't defined the section 2 and
title styling part here we'll Define it
later but we'll write the code for that
as well now next up we'll write here
menu sidebar
display is going to be block
position is going to be
fixed
left is going to be zero top is going to
be 0 so we'll write here left is going
to be zero
and top will also be zero
then we have
width is
100 percent
height is
100 report height
and
Z index is
11
background is going to be
gray again so we'll write a ecec
then we'll write here
overflow is hidden
and
transform
is
translate so we'll write here minus
hundred
percent
and
transition is again same will write here
0.3 s and
linear fine
next up we'll write here menu is menu
bar
and inside here we'll write
display is flex height is 80 percent
justify content at the center
and we are done so next up we'll write
here menu
list we'll change the style of menu list
as well
so we'll write here
height height is going to be
100 percent
then we'll write here display is flex we
are rewriting the code again and again
but each time we are doing it for
different class we are doing it for
different element
so keep these things in mind
and we'll write here Flex
Direction
is column
align items at the center
and just Define content
justify content as space around now it's
time to do it for menu sidebar for menu
sidebar
and for close menu both will use the
same styling properties
we will write here position
as absolute
right is going to be
30 pixels
font size is going to be
1.4 m
and after this we'll write
Dot
menu list
items
and we'll write here
color
is Hash
f09d51 the default color we are using
till now
and lastly we'll write here
dot menu Dash list
items space a on
hover will write here
color is
h f57b09
[Music]
fine so here's a mistake we have
placed colon here twice
we'll remove it
and now we are done with the tablet part
so we have to change the style of almost
all the elements we are done with the
tablet part next up we have to write the
same code for mobile part as well
and we'll write here at the rate media
green
so we'll write here and Max width
is going to be
480 pixels
now what we'll do is we'll write here
asterisk font size
is going to be 16 pixel here we have
changed the font size for the whole
entire HTML document we have done it
because we have used m in place of Ram
or pixels in this case or in this video
so that's why we have changed the size
here because we want the screen to be
smaller in size right if we go back here
you can see
the font size is 16 by default and if we
do it you can see the font size changes
for each and every element right to
achieve this we have to use m in place
of pixel or Ram we can say now the next
thing we are going to do is we are going
to write here Dot
section
1
not
Banner
and we'll write here
width as
280 pixels for both
and we'll write here height
as 100 pixels fine
you can see here the height of this
image is 100 pixel or we can say the
height of this Banner is 100 pixel and
the width is 280 pixels so this is why
we are changing the style of all these
elements because we want all these
elements to fit inside a smaller screen
that's why we have to change the height
or we have to change the width as well
now what we'll do is we'll write here
section
1 Dot
Banner
we'll write here H1
inside this we'll write font size
as
1.2 M display is going to be we don't
have to use display here I guess let's
leave it
so we are done with this next up we'll
write the code for Burger we'll write a
burger margin left is going to be 1M
for mobile
for mobile the display is going to be
block
and the width is going to be
30 pixel fine
we'll do the same for card sidebar
will write here
width
as hundred percent of the screen the
cart will take whole screen and will
write here at the last for product
so for product we'll write here
margin is zero display is flex
justify content at the center
a line items at the center
and flex direction is going to be column
so we have covered almost every HTML
element in the CSS file we are done with
the styling for everything except
products we'll style them later let's
move on to the JavaScript part now and
see how we can fetch those products so
we cannot witness every style change
right now but we'll witness them while
covering the JavaScript part so let's
move on to the JavaScript part first and
we'll start with the card section and
the hamburger menu thing
so save it and if you want to witness
the changes we made you can go here and
you can see the cart is not opening
because we need to write the JavaScript
part for that and everything else
Remains the Same if we reduce the size
of our browser you can see we have a
menu over here we can increase the size
and we have
a image adjusting itself accordingly so
we can use it and it's quite responsive
as well
let's move on to the JavaScript part now
we'll open the JavaScript file and
first of all we'll access all HTML
elements with the query selector method
so we have several HTML elements right
here you can see we have several
elements present in our HTML file we are
going to access few of these elements so
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here
const
cart is equals to document
dot query selector
we are going to write here
navs space dot cart
then we are going to do the same for a
long
time so what we are going to do is we
are going to copy paste this piece of
code again and again
for several times we are going to change
the name of variables so we'll write
here
card sidebar and instead of this will
write here
Dot cards sidebar
the next one will write here
Dot
close card and here the variable name
will change to
close card
fine next up we'll take another variable
as
Burger
and here we'll change
the query
from nav Dot card to dot Burger fine
next up we have menu sidebar so we'll
write here menu sidebar and here what
we'll do is we'll write here
Dot menu
sidebar
fine next up we have
close menu
and here we'll
write
close menu again after close menu we
have cart items total
so we'll write here cart
items
total and
we will use
noise
then we have total amount as well so
we'll write here total amount
and here we'll write card price total
we have to access a lot of elements so
then we'll write here cart
UI and
for this we'll access
card sidebar and cart so we will write
here dot cart
sidebar space card
fine
then we have the total sum so we'll
write here total sum
we'll put a dot over here
and here we'll write
total diff
then we have the clear button so we'll
write here clear
button and here we'll write
clear card button
then finally we have
a variable name card content
to access everything present in the cart
so we'll write here dot cart
content
here we'll write
card content
so these are 12 variables and we have
accessed almost every element present in
a HTML file which we are going to need
further so I hope you guys understood
this we have used the query selector
method to access all the HTML elements
here in the JavaScript part now next up
we'll take two empty arrays
so we'll write here let
cart
is equals to an array
and we'll write here let buttons Dom
and it's again going to be an array
fine now we'll first create some events
to open and close the card for that
we'll write here
cart Dot
add event listener
will add a click event here
and we'll write here function
now inside this we'll write cart Dot
we'll write cart sidebar
dots tile
Dot
transform is equals
to
translate zero percent fine so this is
we are changing the style of card
sidebar
next up we'll write here
const body overlay will take a variable
of named const body overlay we'll write
here document
Dot
create element
and we'll write here
div inside this fine
next up what we'll do is
we'll write here
body overlay
Dot
classlist dot add
and we'll write here
only
fine
we'll use the set timeout method so
we'll write here
set timeout
okay we have written here SST so we'll
write a set timeout
then we'll create an anonymous function
and inside here what we'll do is we'll
write
document dot query selector
and inside here we'll write body then
we'll write here append and we'll append
body overlay here so we'll write here
body overlay
fine and the time will pass here is
going to be 300 milliseconds
we are done with this function We'll add
another event so what we'll do is we'll
write here close
cart dot add event listener
now we are closing the card so we'll
write here
click then we'll
create a function
and we'll write here
card sidebar Dot
tile Dot
transform and again we'll translate it
to 100 percent
previously we did for zero percent and
now we'll translate it to 100 again so
we'll write here translate and we'll
pass 100 inside the brackets here
next up we'll again use the body overlay
variable so we'll copy this from here
and we'll paste it here we'll of course
change the create element value so
instead of create element we'll write
here
document
dot query selector
and we'll write here
Dot
overlay fine
next up we'll write here document
Dot query selector
and we'll write here body
Dot
remove child will remove body overly
from here so we'll write here
body will fine
we are good to go save it now
and go to the browser
so here you can see on clicking the cart
a cart is working totally fine now we
are in this particular program so we are
in a website which we are creating right
now this is the original website this is
the final product so leave it and we are
going to work on our website only so
here you can see a cart is working
totally fine now we can open or close
our cart and we have two options over
here one is for clearing the entire card
and the other one is for proceeding
further next up we'll add some more
events for the hamburger menu now how to
open or close that menu and all so for
that we'll move to a Javascript file
again and we'll write here
Burger Dot
add event listener
and we'll add a click event we'll write
here click we'll write here
function
and then we'll write here
menu sidebar Dot
tile Dot transform and what we are going
to do is we are going to translate
again we are going to translate it to
zero percent
now the same thing we have to do for
this as well we'll write here Burger
dot add event listener
inside here Will
right click and then we'll write a
function
which will again do the same task it
will translate to minus hundred percent
we'll write here menu sidebar Dot
tile Dot
transform and we are again going to
translate it to
minus hundred percent now
fine
save it
and go to the browser
now
if we decrease the size of a web page or
if we decrease the size of a browser you
can see
okay let me decrease it first so you can
see the hamburger menu over here and on
clicking it's not working right now so
let's inspect those elements once
and there's no error but
let me check if there's any mistake okay
so we have to write here
close menu
and now I guess it will work fine
we'll save it again and we'll move to
the browser
reduce the size click on this hamburger
menu and you can say it's working
totally fine now
right
so this part is also done now what we
have to do next is we have to create a
class to get those products from the
Json file so keep your eyes open now
guys we'll see how it actually works so
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a class named
product
so this is a class
we'll write here a sink I hope you are
already aware of async and a weight
so we'll write here get product
and this is a function
we'll write here const
response is equals to await and while
awaiting it will fetch
products Dot
Json fine
then we'll create a variable we'll write
here const
data is equals to await
response dot Json
fine
next up we'll write
products is equals to
data dot items
and we'll write
products is equals
to
products
dot map function we are going to use so
we'll write here again item
then we'll use Arrow function we'll
write the body of this function here
we'll write here
const inside this will pass
title and price of the product
and we'll write here item Dot
Fields fine
similarly we'll do the same for ID as
well inside curly braces we'll write ID
and we'll write here
item dot sys
then we'll write here
const
image now we are fetching the image so
we'll write here
item Dot
Fields dot image Dot
fields
we are actually giving the path right if
you see here in the Json file you can
see inside items we have says Fields
then inside Fields we have title price
image and then inside image we have
Fields file and URL so we'll access each
of them now we'll write here after
Fields dot file
dot URL
and
lastly we'll write here return
title
price
ID and
image fine
foreign
[Music]
products
cool
now what we are doing here is we are
getting the details of all the products
and storing them inside separate objects
so we have all the objects present over
here all those images were actually
stored inside the local storage
and now we can fetch them from that
particular storage now we'll create
another class for the user interface of
the product so if you save it now and go
to the browser
you will see no difference over here
because it's not working as of now if
you go to inspect elements and console
you can see it says
length mismatch
it's because of the live server so
there's no error over here
now we'll create another class for the
user interface of the products we'll add
those products to the cart and we can
delete them from the cart we'll do
everything inside one single class so
let's do it
what we are going to do is we are going
to write here
class let's say the class name is UI
and we'll write here
display products and we'll write here
products
then we'll
add here inside this let result be a
variable
and
will leave it empty over here
next line will use the for each Loop so
we will write here products
Dot
for each
and inside this we'll
create an arrow function
so we'll write here
const
product div let's say is a variable and
then we'll write here
document Dot
create element again we are going to
create an element so we'll write here
div
and
after this what we are going to do is we
are going to write here product
div Dot
inner HTML
is equals to
now the main part starts so inside these
we'll write
div
class is equals
product card
and then we'll write
IMG
will add the image so here we'll write
mgsrc is equals to
dollar
product
Dot image we are going to fetch it and
instead of Alt
in place of alt we'll write
alt as
product
in the next line we'll use this pen tag
again we'll write here span class
is equals to
add to cart
and we'll then right here
data ID is equals to
product dot ID
will close this tag will close this
spend tag we can say in the next line
we'll use the I tag we'll write a i
class is equals to
far far
card
Plus
for One X
now what we are doing is we are going to
show the number of items present in our
cart over the cart icon that's why we
are doing all this so here what we'll do
is we'll write style is equals to margin
Dash right
margin right is going to be 0.1 m
and
font size is going to be
1M
fine
close this as well close the eye tag as
well
and in the next line
right here
at to cart
so the spend tag is finally we are going
to close it now this is a single tag
I have written it in such a way because
I don't want it to create any sort of
confusion for you guys so the spend tag
starts from here and go still here now
we are remaining with some more part of
it so in the next line what we are going
to do is we are going to write here div
class is equals
product name and here we'll write dollar
foreign
title
and we are going to close this div tag
in the next line we are going to write
div again
class is going to be product pricing
and inside here we'll write
product Dot
price
and we are going to close this div tag
here
close
the first div tag as well
and
Omega 2. in the next slide what we are
going to do is we are going to write
here
const p is equals to
document Dot
query selector and inside this we'll
write
Dot
product we are going to access the
element with product s class or we are
going to access the product query then
we'll write here P dot append
equal to
product div what we are doing is any
item we are adding to cart is we are
going to append that item inside the
cart so that's what we are doing till
now now the next thing we are going to
do is we are going to write here a
function
get buttons
basically a Constructor we can say we'll
write here const
buttons
will write your accounts buttons is
equal to
document Dot
query selector
we have to write a query selector all
and then we are going to write here
inside this dot add to
card fine we have been through all these
query selector methods previously so I
don't think that this is going to create
any sort of problem for you guys
so let's move ahead and
we'll write here array Dot
from
will write here buttons
then we'll write here buttons
Dom is equals to buttons we are going
to pass the value of buttons to buttons
Norm then we'll write buttons Dot
for each
and inside here we'll write
button and we are going to create an
arrow function over here
here what we'll do is we'll write here
let ID is equals to
button
Dot
data set dot ID in the next line we'll
write let
in cart
is equals
cart Dot
find and we are going to pass item
to this function
so we are going to
write inside here
item and again an arrow function we'll
write here item dot ID
triple is equals
ID
fine
we're going to check the condition here
if we write here if
and cut
then we'll write here
BTN Dot
inner HTML
is equals
to in cart so what we are doing is if we
have added the
product to cart already then the button
will change as we have seen earlier that
on adding the product once to the card
the button will change to incart from
add to cart so this is what we are doing
here
next up we'll write here
button
dot disabled
is equals to true we are going to
disable that button once the product is
added to cart fine
next up we'll write here
button dot add event listener
and we are going to create an event
we'll write here click
and
let e here then we'll use the arrow
function
foreign
Target Dot
inner HTML is equals to
in card
then we'll write a e Dot
current Target dot nihtml okay we'll
write here e dot current Target Dot
tile Dot
color
is equals
to White
e Dot
current Target Dot
style Dot
pointer events equals to none
and we are done with it next up we are
going to store the products in the cart
so for that what we are going to do is
we are going to write here let
cart item is equals to so we are going
to use a little bit of Json now
I'll write here
Dot
storage
Dot
get storage products
we'll write a ID
comma
amount
and the amount is going to be one
I will write here
cart dot push
we are going to push the cart item to
the cart
so we will write here cart item
and then we'll write yes
storage we are going to store it inside
the cart so we'll write here storage dot
safeguard
and will pass cart over here
fine now we have to calculate the total
and we have to set the total items as
well so for that we'll write here
this Dot
set card values
we'll write here cart
and to display those cart item we have
to write here this dot add card item and
we have to add that card data so we'll
write here
this Dot
add card items
item
and we'll
pause
cart item over here
fine
we are done with the working of cart as
well next up what we are going to do is
we are going to change the total value
of cart we are going to change the value
of carton increasing or decreasing the
card products so first of all we have to
write here
set card values and we have to pass cart
over here we have to write here
let's say we have a variable
temp total so this is going to be a
temporary valuable we'll write here time
total is equals to 0 and we'll take
another variable
for that we'll write here
item total
so item total is also going to be 0
now we'll map this card so for that
we'll write a card dot map
we'll write your item
use Arrow function so for that we'll
write here
temp total
plus is equals to
item Dot price
into
item Dot
amount
so this is how we are going to get the
total amount and then we'll write here
item basically we are swapping all of
that so we'll write here item totals
is equal to
item Dot
amount we have to add these two values
so we'll write here item total plus is
equals to item dot amount fine
now we'll write here
parse float
and we are going to change these values
just like percent we have parse float as
well so inside pass float we'll write
time total
Dot
to fixed
and we are going to fixed it until two
decimal units
fine next up we'll write here cart items
total Dot
inner HTML
is equals to
items total
and we'll write here cart
price total
dot inner HTML is equals to
pass float
we'll write here temp
total
Dot
to fixed and we'll fix it up to two
decimal units fine
next up we'll write here add
card item
now we'll write here cart item
foreign
let
cart item
UI
is equals
to document Dot
create element
we'll write here div
we'll write here cart item
UI
Dot inner HTML
is equals to we are again going to do
the same task
so we are going to use the backtick for
that so here we'll write
div
class
is equals to
card product
and we'll write here div
class is equals to product image we'll
write here IMG SRC
is equals we are going to fetch the
image again so we'll write a dollar and
inside this will write
cart item Dot
image
and ALT will be
product in this case as well
next up we are going to close this div
tag
and we are going to start another div
tag here so we'll write here div
class is equals
card
product item
sorry card product content we can say
then
we'll write here
in the next line
div
class
is equals
two
card product name
will write here inside H3 tag
so inside H3 tag we'll write
dollar
cart item Dot title
and we are going to close this H1 tag
over here H3 tag sorry H3 tag over here
then we'll close this div tag as well we
are again going to create another div
tag this time we are going to write the
class
is
card product
price we are going to fetch the price
now
we'll write here
again
H3
so a price is in dollars so we'll use
dollars for now we can use rupees here
as well so we can write here
cart item Dot
price the price is going to be in
dollars then we'll
close this tag
and we are also going to close the div
tag here fine
in the next line
we are going to create the product
remove card
so we are going to create a div tag for
that and the class is going to be card
product remove data
ID is going to be cart ID so we'll write
here cart
item dot ID
and then we'll write here
href is equals
to hash
and style is going to be
color is going to be
red
and then we'll write here remove
I'm going to close the
anchor tag and then the
div tag fine
so we are done with this till now then
we are going to again close this
particular div tag we used previously
now what we are going to do is we are
going to change the number of products
so we are going to use here class
is equals to
plus minus
and here we'll write
inside the itac
class is equals to
for for angle
left
add amount
fine
this is going to be the class and
the data ID is going to be
cart Item ID so we are going to write
here data ID is equals to
dollar
and inside this will write
cart Item ID
dot ID
and then we are going to
close this stack and we are going to
close the itag here fine
next up we are going to use this span
tag again we are going to write here
spend
class is equals to
number of items
and we'll close this tag here we'll
write dollar
cart item Dot
amount
we are going to close this pen tag here
so we'll write here slash span
in the next line we are again going to
use
data ID
and here what we'll do is we'll write
here
dollar and we'll write here
cart item dot ID
we are going to close the itag again
and in the next line we are going to
close the div tag
and one more detail fine
now we are done with it
let me close this first and
next up we'll append this card content
to the cart item UI so we will write
here
card
content Dot
append and inside this will pass
cart item
UI
fine
so here you can see we are going to
close
close this so this is the closed one
and inside here we'll write
setup app
again a
Constructor we are going to write here
cart
is equals
to storage Dot
get card
we will write this
Dot
set card values
card here
and then we'll write card dot map
inside this will write item
and inside the body we'll write
this Dot
add cart item
item
fine I hope you guys are getting this
next up we'll write the cart logic here
we'll write here cart logic
foreign
[Music]
dot add event listener
we are going to create an event again
we'll write here click
comma a function
inside this will write this Dot
clear cut we are going to call this
function over here
now we have
to write the logic for
remove button so we'll do it here
we'll write here
card content dot add event listener
click comma event
and we'll write here
inside this if
event Dot
Target
Dot
class list
dot contains
card
product remove
then we'll again create a variable let's
say the variable is let
okay we have made a mistake over here
we have to close this bracket here
and then we have to write here
let ID is equals
to event Dot
Target Dot
dataset Dot ID
in the next line we'll write
this Dot
remove item and will pass ID here fine
in the next line we'll write here let
div is equals
to event
dot Target Dot
parent element
and we are going to use parent element
for quite some time now so we are going
to write here Dot
parent element again
for four times so we'll write here
parent element Dot
parent element so we have written it
four times here
in the next line we'll write here div
Dot
remove
child
and we'll write here event Dot
Target
Dot
will copy it from here
and we'll paste it here fine
now in the next line
we are going to close this bracket
and we are going to start writing here
else if
event Dot
Target
dot classlist dot
contains
add amount
then
what we are going to do is we are going
to use the ID variable again we are
going to write here let ID is equal to
event dot Target
Dot
dataset dot ID
let item is equals to
cart dot find
will pass item here and
we'll use the arrow function so we'll
write here item Dot
ID triple equals to ID
fine then we'll write here
item Dot
amount
plus plus so we are going to increase
the amount
of items then what we are going to do is
we are going to write a storage Dot
Safeguard and we are going to pass cart
here
we'll write here this Dot
set card values
card
we'll write a event Dot
Target
Dot
next element sibling dot inner HTML
is equals to item Dot
amount fine
now we are going to
use another else if here so we'll write
here else if
event Dot
Target Dot
classlist dot contents
reduce amount
so we are going to change the number of
products in our cart so for that what
we'll do is we'll write here
foreign
let ID is equals to
event dot data set
even Dot
Target dot data set
dot ID fine
and item will be
let item is equals to
card dot find
item
item dot ID
triple equals to ID
if we are again going to use an if
statement so we'll write here item Dot
amount
is greater than 1 if the number of items
is greater than 1
then
item Dot
amount
minus minus
and store it
inside the cart so we are going to write
here storage dot safeguard
and will pass cart here
then we'll write here this Dot
set card values
and will again pass cart here
in the next line we'll write here
event Dot
Target
Dot
previous element sibling
dot inner HTML
is equals to item Dot
amount
and finally we'll write here else
and inside the else what we'll do is
we'll write here
this Dot
remove item
and we'll pass the ID you will write
here let
div is equals
to event dot Target we are basically
targeting the events we are creating
conditions for certain different events
like when the user increases the number
of products and the user decreases the
number of products and if the user
removes the product from the card so we
are writing the code for that so we'll
write a event dot Target Dot
parent element
and we'll write here parent element
again for
four times
fine
we'll write here div Dot
remove child
and inside this we'll write even Dot
Target Dot
parent element for four times again
it will check each parent element
so
here we are done with it next up
we have to create two functions for add
amount and for reduce amount so what we
are going to do is we are going to
write here
add amount
and we'll write here
const
add button is equals to
document dot query selector
all
inside this will pass DOT
add amount fine
we'll write here add button
Dot
for each
and we'll write here inside this
button dot add event listener
and we'll add an event over here we'll
write a click
comma event
will pass event here
and then we'll write here
like this
let ID
is equals to
event Dot
current Target Dot
data set
dot ID fine we'll write here
cart Dot
map
and we'll pass item over here we'll
write here again Arrow function and
inside this what we are going to do is
we are going to write here item Dot
amount plus plus
storage Dot
Safeguard we are going to pass cart here
we'll write here this Dot
set card values
we are again going to set the cart
values and
will again use
amount UI a new variable and will
write here event Dot
current Target
Dot
parent element
dot children
fine so we are targeting the parent
element along with the children
so we'll write here
amount UI
dot in HTML is equals to item Dot amount
so we have forgot to mention here
if
item dot ID
is equals to ID
then do it fine
now we are going
to do the same thing for reduce amount
as well so we'll write here
reduce amount
and inside this we'll write
const
reduce button
is equals to document
Dot
query selector all
and we are going to pass here Dot
reduce amount
fine
we'll write here reduce
button Dot
for each
then we'll pass button over here and
we'll use the arrow function again
finally we'll write here button dot add
event listener
click
event
let ID
is equals to
event dot current
Target
dot data set
dot ID
fine
we'll write here card dot map will map
it to cart
and we'll write here item
then again we'll write here if
item dot ID
triple equals to ID
then we'll
write here item amount minus minus so
we'll write here item Dot
amount minus minus and if
item Dot
amount is greater than zero
then what it will do
it will
store it inside the
local storage so we'll write a storage
dot safeguard
and we'll write here cart
then we'll write this
Dot
set card values
card
const
UI
is equals
to event
Dot
current Target Dot parent element
dot children
amount UI dot inner HTML is equals to
item Dot
amount
fine
again we'll write here else
what will happen will write here event
Dot
current Target Dot
parent element so here instead of parent
element we'll write
remove child and will write here
event
dot current Target
Dot
parent element Dot parent element fine
in the next line we'll write
this Dot
remove item and we'll pass ID here
we are done with this part as well next
up we have to clear the card so for that
we'll write here
clear card
will again do something for that we'll
write here let cart item is equals cart
dot map inside this will write item
implies item dot ID
card item dot we'll again use the for
each Loop here
we will write here this then we'll
provide ID here
and we'll write here
this Dot
remove item will pass the ID over here
then we'll write your const
card product will create a new variable
here we'll write here
document Dot
query selector all and we'll write here
Dot
card product
right here card product
Dot
for each
for each item what we are going to do is
we are going to create
an arrow function here and we are going
to write a if item is true if item is
there
then item dot parent element
Dot
remove child
will remove the item now we have to
remove the item so for that we'll write
here remove
item and will pass ID to that item
will write here card will update the
value of cart escort dot filter
we'll write here item
and then we'll write here item dot ID
note equals
to ID this
Dot
set card values
and we'll update the card pin
similarly we'll again write here storage
Dot
safeguard
and we'll pass card here
then we'll write here let
button is equals to this
Dot
get single button
will write here ID
and we'll change the button style will
write here button dot style Dot
pointer events is equals to
unset
then we'll write here button Dot inner
HTML
is equals to
backtick
I class will be Far Far Card Plus
we are going to close the itag here
and we'll write here
add to
cart
fine next up we'll write here
get single button will pass ID over here
and we'll write the code for here we'll
write here let
BTN
then we'll write here
buttons Dome Dot
for each
for each button
what it will do is
we'll check if
button Dot
dataset dot ID
is equals to ID
then
BTN equals to
button
fine
here we will return
button
now save it
save this program go to browser
and this is a website go to browser and
you can see nothing is visible till now
we have to write a little more code to
make everything visible here now we have
to store the data in local storage so
that on refreshing the web page we don't
lose the data so what we'll do is we'll
go back to a Javascript file and we'll
write here
Plus
storage
equals to
static save products will pass products
here
then we'll open curly braces and we'll
write here local storage
Dot
set item
and inside this will write
products Dot
comma
Json Dot
stringify
products
when we are parsing the product from our
Json file now next up we'll write here
static
get storage products
will pass the ID here
and we'll write here let
products is equals to
Json
dot parts
local storage Dot
get item
and will pass
products here
and in the next line we'll write
return
products Dot
find
we'll write a item
item dot ID is equals to ID
fine
next up we'll again write a static
safeguard
now we are saving the products in our
cart so we'll write here
local storage dot set item
inside here will pass
cart and here we'll write
Json
Dot
stringify and will pass
cart over here
stop will write here static
get cut we are getting the items from
the cart we'll write here return
local storage Dot
get item
cart
you will write question mark will pass
the Json file here we'll write here Json
Dot
pause
local storage Dot
get item
from the
card fine
here we have two
put a square bracket a pair of square
brackets
and lastly we have to write a few lines
of code so we'll write here document dot
add event listener
and we'll write here
Dom
content
loaded so we are adding
one more event to our JavaScript file
which is the Dom content loaded so we
have to write here Dom content loaded
and here we have to write
inside the function
const
products
is equals
to new product
and we'll write here
const UI is equals to
new UI
now we have to show card from local
storage so we'll write here UI Dot
setup app
and we'll write here
products Dot
get product
dot then
and inside this we'll write
products
equal
employees
UI Dot display
products we'll write here
products
storage Dot
save products and will pass
products here as well fine we'll write
here dot then
we are using promises so
here we'll write
UI Dot
get buttons
and UI Dot
cart logic fine
now the JavaScript part is done we have
used Json here to make a web page more
responsive towards several aspects apart
from that we have used Json for adding
products to our website as well now we
are left with one more task only
let's do it and then we'll see the final
outcome of this extended code
so we'll move to the CSS file and we'll
start starting the products part let's
try if it's working or not let's save
this piece of code and go to browser
click on shop now
and it's not working we can see
okay
it says it's failed to load the resource
refresh it and you can see now it's
working totally fine we have all our
product images over here we have all of
our products we can add them to cart and
we can use the cart as well so the last
thing we have to do is to use products
now
now we have to style those products so
for that we'll move to our CSS file so
here's a CSS file
and inside this we have
to write here
so we have put a comment over there
when we were not here so we have to
style the products over here so for that
we'll write here
dot section 2 Dot
title
and
text align at the center
then we'll write here section 2
Dot
title
H1
the font size is going to be
1.8 m
the margin is going to be
1.3 M then we have to write the code for
products here so we'll write your dot
product
and inside this we'll write
margin as
0.5 m
we have to write here margin
we'll write a 0.5 M and Auto
Max width
is going to be 1300 pixels
display is going to be grid
column
is going to be so his is going to be
grid column Gap and it is going to be
2m
then we'll write here
grid row Gap
and grid row Gap is going to be 2m as
well
then we'll write here
grid
template
columns and we'll write here repeat we
are going to create a grid for our
products right so we'll write a Auto
fit
comma min max
we'll write here 350 pixels
and
one draw
fine next up we'll write here Dot
product
card
and now we are going to write here text
align as Center
position as relative
Max width
of the grid is going to be 350 pixels
and the Overflow is going to be
hidden
next up we'll write here
product card image
we'll write here height
is
300 pixels
width
as 300 pixels
and
transition is
0.3 seconds linear
fine
surely we'll do the same for product
name and product pricing so we'll write
here
product
name
comma
product
pricing
margin for them is going to be 0.3 m
will write here Dot
product
pricing and the color of the product
pricing is going to be
the one we have been using till now so
we'll write here F 0
9 d51
then we have
to write the code for add to cart button
so we'll write here add to cart
right here align items to the center
justify the content to the center
and color is going to be white
padding is going to be 0.2 M and
1M
fine height is going to be
30 pixels
background
is going to be
the same
F9
d51
position is going to be
absolute
right is going to be 0 transform it's
going to be
Translate
along the x-axis too
100 percent
bottom is
going to be 80
pixels
we have to put a comma here
bottom is going to be 80 pixels
transition is going to be 0.3 seconds
again and linear
cursor is going to be pointer fine
then we have to write few more lines so
we'll write a product card
will write here Hoover
and we'll add add to cart here
so we'll write here transform
translate X
zero percent
we'll write here
product card
on hovering over the image so we'll
write here Hoover
IMG
opacity will change to zero point
seven
let's try it and finally we'll write
here
dot add to cart
over
and here we'll write
color as
black
fine we are done with it we have styled
the products as well we are now done
with the website
save it
move on to the browser and let's face
the truth now
so you can see it's not working as of
now refresh the web page and the
products looks really big now
what we have to do is we have to move
over here and we have two
see what's wrong over here
this was a mistake and it's done let me
see what's wrong
something is not right here everything
seems fine but we have to search for the
error
so if we see here Max width is fine the
max width for product is fine
let's try to do this thing we'll write
here this save it now and I know that
this is the error we did so such small
errors sometime causes way more
go to the browser and you can see a
website is fine now try adding the
products to the cart
you can see the products are in the cart
we can increase the number of products
the total is increasing with that
and it's working totally fine click on
the clear card button and it's not
working
click on the proceed button and it
clears the card
a simple solution for this go to the
HTML file
write clear card over here and
proceed over here save it
move to the browser
try adding products to the cart go to
the cart
increase the numbers everything is fine
proceed it's not working clear card and
the cart is clear
now that we have done so many things on
the website here is a task for you guys
we have left the proceed button inside
the card with no functionality we did it
with purpose I want you guys to do
something creative with it you can take
the user further to the login or sign up
page and you can use regular Expressions
to validate the form upon successful
validation you can further take the user
to the payment page I want you guys to
do that part and let us know in the
