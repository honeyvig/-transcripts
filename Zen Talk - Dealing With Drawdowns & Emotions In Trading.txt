hey traders just thought I'd get out of
the house for a minute and just reflect
on my trading I've come down to the
beach I thought now is a good time to
discuss some thoughts I've been having
you see at the moment I'm going through
a pretty nice to draw down I'm down
about 13% on my account maybe 15% since
last night I had a losing trade I've had
around seven losing trades in a row
which is it's not rare but it's
certainly uncommon for my strategy and
[Music]
you know it's okay I'm not bothered by
it any more than I need to be in order
to stay focused what do I mean by that
well no one likes to lose trades we're
in this business to make money to win
trades but in order to win we have to be
good losers we have to accept that
losses are going to occur we need to
keep them as small as possible so that
our winners can make up for them in the
long run always remember you have no
control over the markets all you can
control is your reactions to the markets
and the emotional stimulus that it
invokes but that's all the power you
need see even though I'm down 15%
roughly speaking on my account I've made
far more than that in the past during
the good times and so I know that if I
just stay patient stay focused stay
disciplined I'll recover my drawdown and
go on to new equity highs just like the
dozen times before this this is just
the same as night is today you can't
have good times all the time
sometimes you gotta experience setbacks
and trading is a two steps forward one
step backwards game and that's okay it's
how you handle that the the determines
the outcome and how successful you are
in life not just in trading and so I
just wanted to have a quick little talk
about the importance of being unstuck
now called my youtube channel and my
blog is n in the art of trading for a
reason
Zen is a philosophy of not being stuck
on your thoughts it's similar to Taoism
in that it encourages you to get with
the flow of life and not allow your
thoughts and reflections on life to be
mistaken for the reality and I believe
the same is true of trading it's
important not to get stuck on your
losing trades you need to let them come
and let them go just like your breath
even profitable traders
encounter challenges losing streaks draw
downs that affect their self-esteem
their confidence the difference between
a profitable trader and an unprofitable
trader is that a profitable trader
accepts this reality this uncertainty
and Trust their system that they've
tested over historical data and no is
profitable so last night when I had my
seventh or eighth losing trade in a row
it's done a little bit I was a little
bit pissed off but I felt discouraged
did I put in all this work I've been
trading all year and now I've
encountered a losing streak that's put
me underwater in terms of my equity
curve and that's okay that's normal it's
okay to be frustrated it's okay to be
disappointed with your trading in fact
if you're not disappointed at times with
your trading then I'd question your
sanity but it's important to let that
feeling go focus on the next trade each
trade is just one of a thousand for the
next thousand to come and it's equally
important to not get hung up on your
losing trades as it is to not get
overexcited about your winning trades
good times are always ahead but so are
bad times and sooner you accept that
reality and move on with your trading
with a zen-like approach the sooner you
will attain consistency both in your
trading and your thinking and emotional
reactions to your trading and the easier
it will become over time
to take the blows take the hits and roll
on with them anyway continue focusing on
the next trade improving your system and
not becoming undisciplined unstuck and
confused misguided
and fall victim to self-sabotage
that's all I had to say today just
wanted to point out that even traders
who have gotten over the hump of blowing
accounts
losing lots and lots of trades losing
lots of money just because you stopped
losing lots of money doesn't mean that
you suddenly you're suddenly free of
frustration and discouragement in your
trading the key is to let those feelings
come and go and then focus on what's
next the next trade the next improvement
you can make to your strategy and yeah
if it gets too much if you get too
frustrated and you need a break it's
nothing wrong with getting out of the
house coming down to the beach or to a
park or whatever and just being still
with your thoughts and just accepting
the reality of the situation accepting
that there's nothing wrong with it it's
normal it's normal to not feel great all
the time and that things will get better
if you just stayed disciplined you stay
consistent to strategy you trust
yourself to do the right thing
good luck with self isolation obviously
it's gonna be a little bit hard for some
of you to get out of the house if you're
struggling with your training at the
moment but for those of you who are
stuck inside this too will pass
and soon you'll be back to your normal
routine in life don't take this time for
granted it's a good time for meditation
to go inside think about what you're
doing and remember why we why we do what
we do it's not just to make money it's
also to challenge ourselves become
better people better traders develop
more self-control more self-awareness
it's good luck with your training
everyone I'll see in the next video

Krishnamurti says to people now look
there is nothing you can do to be
liberated because all your efforts in
the direction of liberation are phony
they are based on your desire to boost
and continue your ego and that will
never lead to liberation all you can do
he says is to be aware of yourself as
you are without judgment see what is but
then if you can do that you have no
further problem
