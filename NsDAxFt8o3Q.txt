00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:08,559
[Music]

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,559
so hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,040
tutorial my name is Henry Baki and this

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,639
time we're going to be going over how to

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,920
use a lam of fire in Swift so let's

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
begin now first of all uh what is LAM of

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,519
fire basically uh Lam of fire is a

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,519
simple networking uh Library uh for

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,039
Swift uh it works with iOS watch OS TV

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,480
and Mac OS effect uh and so you know

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,040
what that's really going to be all it

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
for this little whiteboard part uh but

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,600
just before I go I just like to say that

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,120
this is a part two to the earlier alop

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
fire video that I had created uh and so

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,399
essentially this time I'm going to be

17
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,280
showing to you how exactly uh you can

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,320
use aop fire uh the real way uh and of

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,960
course I'm going to be showing you uh

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,559
exactly how you can incorporate

21
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,239
synchronous lamma fire uh and into this

22
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,359
as well all right so uh just before we

23
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,039
go though uh one last thing I'm just

24
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,719
like to show you asynchronous versus

25
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,879
synchronous uh now usually when you make

26
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,960
a URL request with something like NS

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,960
data what you're doing is basically

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,880
let's just say that um this is your

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,240
application over

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,720
time and this is the

31
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,960
execution okay so let's just say this

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,799
and so your application is going forward

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,640
right the UI and

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,479
everything UI stuff like that is getting

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,360
updated over time while it's being

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,640
executed uh now basically let's say you

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
were to call a request with NS data what

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,280
would happen is NS data would come into

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,960
play here and so basically this would uh

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,159
NS data would run on this little block

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,360
here uh and so essentially what would

42
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,399
happen is the UI would get blocked and

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
everything else would and only NS data

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,000
would run on this thread and so the

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,280
problem with this uh is that the fact

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,600
that I mean you can't really update the

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,880
UI or do anything here so now what a

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,920
lamif fire does for for you by default

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,240
uh is that it actually creates an

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,520
entirely I mean if I um erase this what

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,560
happens is a lop fire what it

52
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,239
does is it creates an entirely new

53
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,560
block right and so this is called

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,280
asynchronous programming because now the

55
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,440
UI and all the other sort of main

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,879
program uh stuff is running on this

57
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,800
block here uh and the NSL or the Lop

58
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,640
fire request is running in this block

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,800
here all right so now again this is

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,959
called asynchronous programming versus

61
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,519
synchronous programming uh of course

62
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:39,760
though if you just like to create some

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,519
sort of like little test application uh

64
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:43,879
and you just want to you know use

65
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,879
synchronous programming uh to just you

66
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,159
know quickly retrieve something from a

67
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,080
URL uh then I'm going to be showing you

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,879
another library that thead has made uh

69
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,239
and so basically what that allows you to

70
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,200
do is send this a lamif fire re Quest

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
back to the main thread here or main

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,519
block uh that'll continue that'll do it

73
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,959
stuff and then the UI can

74
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,319
continue and that's sort of how this is

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,319
going to work so now let's get straight

76
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,879
over to the Mac part where I'm going to

77
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,200
be showing you how exactly you can use a

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,319
lamif fire and a lamif fire synchronous

79
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,480
in Swift let's get to it so welcome back

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,360
to the Mac part and now I'm going to be

81
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,200
showing you exactly how you can

82
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,040
Implement a lamb fire and a lamb fire

83
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,480
synchronous into your xode projects

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,720
let's begin so now first of all uh let's

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,680
just open up xcode over here and as you

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,760
can see basically uh there is I mean of

87
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,840
course the launch screen I'm going to

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,159
create a new

89
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,040
project um I'm going to call

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,599
this Alo

91
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,319
fire

92
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,720
example YouTube uh I'm going to make

93
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,640
this in Swift uh and the device is going

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,239
to be for iPhone I'm going to click on

95
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,200
next put this in the iOS directory on my

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,319
desktop here uh and let's begin so now

97
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,200
first of all uh let's install the alif

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
fire framework into the xcode project

99
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,920
itself so now first of all what you need

100
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,439
to do is go over to your

101
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,439
terminal uh

102
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,079
okay then go over to your favorite

103
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,400
browser and type in uh Coco

104
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,479
pods now inside of cocoa pods uh inside

105
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,080
of the website uh you're going to see

106
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,000
this little command over here pseudo Jam

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,120
install cocoa pods you want to run this

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
to install cocoa pods and once you're

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,440
done uh you need to run the command in

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
your terminal uh I'm going to make this

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,720
bigger for you I'm going to you're going

112
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,360
to need to run something called pod

113
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,360
setup uh once that's done though uh just

114
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,520
navigate to

115
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,039
your uh your application

116
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,759
directory all right so here what you

117
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,320
need to do is say nanopod file and then

118
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,080
it was a directory you could use Vim if

119
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,199
you wanted to uh so essentially I'm

120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,520
creating a uh file called pod file uh

121
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,919
and so the Pod file contains the pods uh

122
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,560
that we need to install and so basically

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
what we're going to do uh is I'm going

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,039
to tell it to install something called

125
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,600
aop fire uh and in order to do that I'm

126
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,960
going to go to the alop fire GitHub

127
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,919
repository which there will be a link to

128
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,080
in the

129
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,720
description all if we go down here as

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
you can see there's a way to install

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,520
this with cocoa pod so just in uh copy

132
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,720
this pod file script and paste it into

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,600
your terminal all right right and then

134
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,080
whatever you name the application in

135
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,759
this case I've named it a lmop fire

136
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,440
example YT so I'm going to copy

137
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,400
that okay and then I'm going to go back

138
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,319
here and where it says Target your

139
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,840
target name I going to delete uh your

140
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,759
target name uh and I'm going to paste in

141
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,160
the actual Target name uh then the Pod

142
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,639
for a l of fire is great the platform

143
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,639
iOS 9 uh sounds great there uh and

144
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,240
that's going to be it for the Pod file

145
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
so now if you to take contrl X now this

146
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,800
is for just for Nano control X to exit

147
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,280
say yes to save enter to actually save

148
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,639
uh all right then you just need to run

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
something called pod install now I'm

150
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,520
sure that most of you know these steps

151
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
I'm just going over them pod install

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,560
will install the Pod uh installing a l

153
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,680
fire into our

154
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,440
project as you can see it's going to

155
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,000
install and then as youer uh navigate

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
into the project

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,960
directory over here

158
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,440
here uh and then open up the workspace

159
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,759
not the X code project the

160
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,120
workspace or so open the workspace and

161
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,840
in just a second you should see that we

162
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,199
have a workspace now uh again you want

163
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
to use the Alam fire example YT X code

164
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,000
project in order to develop your

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,960
application and now you can incorporate

166
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,720
a Lambo fire into your code let's uh

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
begin with a simple example shall we uh

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,840
essentially what we're going to do is

169
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,160
first of all let's import a l

170
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,000
fire uh and then let's say we wanted to

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,240
sort of um download uh some let's say

172
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,840
Json all right or not Json let's just

173
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,000
say we wanted to download the contents

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
uh of

175
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,360
google.com essentially what i' do is I'd

176
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,039
say first all function download Google

177
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,000
okay I now I'm going to actually send in

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,360
an a fire request so if I build first

179
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,000
all as you can see there's the second

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,319
mat

181
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,280
as you can see the a

182
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,919
is and just a second it says build

183
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,879
exceeded so now what I can do is now a

184
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,199
very simple way to get something for

185
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,039
fire or download something let to say

186
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,479
alif

187
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,000
fire do request uh and then there are a

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,960
few methods either you can go with the

189
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,599
full uh sort of customizable method uh

190
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,400
or the function where you can specify

191
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,319
the method that URL string the

192
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,199
parameters the encoding the headers and

193
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,479
stuff like that or just the URL request

194
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,240
like the URL the NS URL requ or the

195
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,960
method and the URL string in this case

196
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,639
I'm going to go for the simplest one the

197
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,240
method and URL string so I'm going to go

198
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,360
getet as the method I'm not going to

199
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,560
post to Google I just want to get Google

200
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,639
and the URL string is going to be

201
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,240
httpswww

202
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,520
google.com and then I'm going to cck tab

203
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,800
that will finish this up and now let's

204
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,000
say we wanted to get a response as a

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
string okay so I just say response

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
string uh enter it'll give me a

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,159
completion Handler enter it'll fill that

208
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
up and then I can set the response to

209
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,320
you let say um allow fire

210
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,519
response uh and then the code inside of

211
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,040
this completion Handler uh I can say for

212
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,200
example a l fire

213
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,839
response do response or result sorry do

214
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,279
result dot

215
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,360
value okay so now this is the actual

216
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
value I'm going to forcefully unwrap

217
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,480
this and print it

218
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
out and as you can see uh in theory if I

219
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,720
add this function to viewed load in

220
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,640
download Google Now if I run this

221
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,959
application on the

222
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,279
simulator as you can see in just a

223
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,079
second it should work

224
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,839
Let's test this

225
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,079
out as you can see over here it prints

226
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,720
out exactly what it sees on

227
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,880
google.com now let's say we wanted to

228
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,920
use a bit more of a real example here uh

229
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,480
now let's say I want to go over

230
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,519
to you know what me one second what I'm

231
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,079
going to do is I'm going to set up a

232
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,360
simple Json file actually uh using a LMA

233
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,800
fire so if I go into my GoDaddy server

234
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,399
here I go to my web hting manage

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,279
it as you can see sc one second let move

236
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,880
the FP all right now file

237
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,480
[Music]

238
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,079
manager plus file I'm going to call this

239
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,440
um

240
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,959
Alo

241
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,000
fire

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,560
test.

243
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,760
Json create a new

244
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,240
file let's open it

245
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,639
up the code

246
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,360
editor and as you can see I'm going to

247
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,760
give it some simple Json

248
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,120
like

249
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,040
name taner backi um

250
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,079
age 12 all right or I can actually give

251
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,680
it uh 12 all right I'm going to close

252
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,680
this bracket and if I save it that

253
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,360
should save to my website now all I need

254
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,760
to do is change the link over here to

255
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,120
just HTTP

256
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,120
www.x.com

257
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,360
test.js let's see here and as you can

258
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,480
see yes this is called fire test. Json

259
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
and now now we need to do is go into the

260
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,399
info. pist open this up as source

261
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,800
code all right and then add in the NS

262
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,079
app Transport Security

263
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,200
workaround essentially what I'm doing

264
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,639
right now uh is I have actually uh sort

265
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,399
of uh given it the URL as you can see in

266
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,440
this um view controller. Swift as an

267
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,959
HTTP but uh Swift would require an https

268
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,680
meaning a secure protocol uh and so the

269
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,240
problem is that I don't have one of

270
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,160
those secure protocol uh sort of

271
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,000
certificates and so switch is going to

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,639
say you know what I cannot connect to

273
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,480
this URL however if I go into my info.

274
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,160
pist uh and there's going to be some

275
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,000
code down in the description and if I

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,560
paste it in here all right if I run this

277
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,120
application

278
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,720
now it should

279
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,040
theoretically allow me to uh skip that

280
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,600
security check uh and immediately as you

281
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,240
can see here the response in

282
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,839
Json that's going to be it for the alop

283
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,120
portion of this tutorial LMO fire sorry

284
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,279
uh but now let's say you wanted to do uh

285
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,639
a synchronous request uh essentially

286
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
what you could do is use this other

287
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,639
cocoa pod that uh as I said the L has

288
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,800
made uh it's called a l Fire Plus

289
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,680
synchronous and it allows you to create

290
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,360
synchronous requests for Lile so let say

291
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,920
I copied this pod command here pod file

292
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,279
as you can see over here here what I'm

293
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,560
going to do is I'm going to paste it in

294
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,839
with the other

295
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,320
po if I do p control X save right and if

296
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,880
I run pod install once

297
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,560
more as you can see It'll install the

298
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,480
new

299
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,560
pod and then what I can do is inside of

300
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,760
my xco project I can also

301
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,480
import AO

302
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,480
fire

303
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,519
synchronous see if that's a okay as you

304
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,959
can see no errors and then I oh never

305
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,480
mind uh if I clean

306
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,360
build all right no errors now all I need

307
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,279
to do is in order to make a synchronous

308
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,240
request is run a LOF

309
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,920
fire. request and as you can see I'm

310
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,199
going to do the same for doget uh and of

311
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,759
course the

312
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,920
URL copy it paste it here ask for

313
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,000
response

314
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,440
string all right and now this time you

315
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,320
don't want to include any parameters in

316
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,920
this function just response string and

317
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,560
then you want to go you can immediately

318
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,920
just go do result. value and then you

319
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,000
can of course print this out all right

320
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,600
so now in

321
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,240
theory as you can see there are no fion

322
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,040
handls uh and so now this will call uh

323
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,639
with a lam of fire you know it's simple

324
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,040
to use uh syntax of lam of fire uh

325
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,839
except it should uh theoretically uh

326
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,000
work in a synchronous Manner and as you

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
can see it did work and that's going to

328
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,759
be it for this tutorial I hope you

329
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,440
enjoyed again thank you very much uh and

330
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,079
