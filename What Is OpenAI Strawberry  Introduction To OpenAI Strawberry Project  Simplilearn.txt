imagine this you are using a calculator
app on your phone and it gives you an
answer to be a complex math problem
faster than you can blink pretty
standard right but what if instead of
just crunching numbers that app could
actually think through the problem
breaking it down like a human would
considering the best approach and even
explaining why it made certain decisions
sound futuristic doesn't it well we are
not too far from that reality today we
are diving into open ai's latest project
code named Strawberry a new AI model
that pushing the boundaries of reasoning
and problem solving so in this video we
will break down what makes strawberry
special how it works and why it could
change the game for AI systems moving
forward so first off what exactly is
strawberry according to recent report
open AI is preparing to release this new
AI model in the next two weeks or in the
couple of weeks and it's set to improve
on things like reasoning and problem
solving previously known as Q or qar
this model is designed to be much better
at thinking through problems compared to
what we have seen from previous
versions craving a career upgrade

whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back but before we start here is a quick
info for you if you want to learn AI
anml from the industry experts try
simply learn postgraduate program in Ai
and machine learning from P University
in collaboration with IBM this C
teachers and demand skills such as
machine learning deep learning NLP
computer vision reinforcement learning
generative AI prompt engineering chat GT
and many more so don't forget to check
out the course link from the description
box below and the pin comment so but
what makes a strawberry different from
what we have used before so now let's
take a look one of the coolest things
about strawberry is that it uses
something called system to thinking this
idea came from the famous psychologist
Daniel kman and it refers to a more
careful and slow way of thinking like
when you really focus on solving a
tricky problem instead of answering
question instantly strawberry takes
about 10 to 20 seconds to process its
thought this extra time helps it to
avoid mistakes and gives more accurate
answers but the model doesn't just think
slowly it's got some really cool
abilities that makes it stand out let's
talk about those strawberry is buil to
handle Advanced reasoning and solve
mathematical problems these are areas
where AI system struggles but strawberry
is designed to be a lot better at
breaking down complex problem step by
step and here is something interesting
it might even be added to Future
versions of CH GPT possibly as a model
name called Oran or GPT 5 if if that
happen it could mean chat gbt will
become more smarter and more reliable in
solving tough problems now here is where
it gets really fascinating there is some
research that might help us understand
how strawberry improv its thinking let's
check it out you might have heard about
something called star which stand for
selftaught Reasoner this is a method
where an AI can actually teach itself to
think better here is how it works star
starts with a few examples where the AI
is shown how to solve problem step by
step then the AI tries solving their
problem on its own getting better as it
goes it keeps improving by looking as
its mistakes and learning from them this
could be what's happening with
strawberry it's using similar method to
teach itself how to reason better and
solve complex problem but the AI doesn't
just think better it's also learning how
to break down the problems in a very
humanlike way so now let's explore that
next strawberry uses something called
Chain of Thought reasoning basically
when faced with a complex problem it
breaks it down into smaller manageable
steps kind of like how we do when we are
solving a puzzle instead of just jumping
on to an answer it takes a time to go
through each step making the solution
more understandable and accurate so this
is especially useful in math where
strawberry is expected to be a real
strong with all its potential what does
the future hold for AI models like
strawberry so now let's R this thing
with a look at what's next so now what's
next for open AI well strawberry is just
the beginning there is talk about a
future model called Oran which could be
the next big version after gp4 or gp4 R
it may even use that strawbery Learners
to get better at solving problems but
here is the thing training these
Advanced model is expensive training GPT
4 for example cost over 100 million even
though open AI coo Sam Alman said the of
just making bigger models is coming to
an end it's clear that the models like
strawberry are focused on becoming
smarter and more efficient so what does
all of this mean for the future of AI
and how we use it strawberry could
represent a huge leap in ai's ability to
reason and solve complex problem so with
its focus on slower more deliberate
thinking and its potential connection to
the star method it's Paving the way for
smarter more reliable AI system and this
is just the St as we move forward mod
like Oran the possibilities are endless
and that's a r on open AI exciting new
model strawberry it's clear that this AI
could bring major advancement in
reasoning and problem solving and we
can't to see how it all unfolds what are
