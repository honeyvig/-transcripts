this has been
ben started a store that sells
automobile parts like brakes exhausts
tires lubricants and car interiors
he made a good start with his business
and achieved profits
however as days passed by along with his
growing business he faced some business
challenges he received orders from a
variety of customers with different
needs and requirements
for example
the northern states had higher demand
for performance parts than others and
the eastern states demanded farm truck
parts and lubricants more and apart from
this a few products weren't performing
well in the market and remained unsold
with the unbalanced requirements and
economy variations ben had a tough time
helping his customers with products on
demand
he slowly realized he needed something
new that can help him tackle the store's
problems
what if ben had a tool that could keep
track of his store's inventory in sales
a geographical map that can recognize
the demand for various types of products
from different regions
a forecast feature that could predict
the economic fluctuations in the market
and help then visualize every single
detail visually on one single dashboard
this software could practically solve
many business problems and also could
identify new opportunities to improvise
and grow the business
such types of software tools are called
business intelligence tools and one such
tool is tableau
tableau was capable of learning the
store's business patterns and running
queries against the data to help
visualize the flaws and resolve them
quickly
now let us understand how ben used
tableau and solved the issues related to
his business
ben collected his store's entire sales
data from the previous quarter and
ingested it into tableau
now using tableau ben was able to
categorize the data based on monthly
cells
it took the daily cells and considered
it as the x-axis
and then tableau computed the sales in
the store
now then clearly understood the products
that outperform the sales charts and the
products that did not have much demand
let us elaborate a little
ben found that the performance parts
like sports exhaust turbochargers and
engine management systems were selling
well
with the tableau forecast feature ben
identified the demand for performance
products in the next quarter
so he raised the prices on a few
products that had the peak demand and
earned higher profits
in the second forecast report bin found
no significant elevation nor a drop in
the demand for the tractor parts and
lubricants
apart from this bin saw the sales graphs
of electronics encountered a drop in the
current quarter compared to the previous
quarter in the sales of electronics like
the music and infotainment systems were
low to improvise and stabilize the
fluctuating sales of electronics ben
came up with some exciting and sell
offers on electronic products
using tablet's geographic map feature
ben understood the product demand at a
regional level he found the northern
regions were interested in performance
kits for their imported sports cars the
eastern regions had good demand for
truck parts and lubricants
using tableau ben could generate various
visualizations based on his data and
come up with business oriented decisions
last but not least ben could also
monitor his decisions and was able to
make some necessary modifications to his
business model on the go
ben is now delighted as working with
tableau is a smooth and efficient
process
today tableau is being recognized as one
of the best in class business
intelligence tools because of its
powerful and dependable features
tableau can support and connect to a
wide variety of data sources like the
cloud dbms excel sheets and even get
connected to real-time data from
websites and bin keeps his customers
happy using tableau to solve his
business problems
