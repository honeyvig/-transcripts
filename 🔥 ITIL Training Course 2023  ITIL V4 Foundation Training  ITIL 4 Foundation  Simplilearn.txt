in this ever-changing age businesses
rely heavily on Technologies to deliver
their products and services but what
happens when things go wrong
how do businesses ensure their I.T
services are running smoothly and
meeting the needs of their customers and
that's where itl comes in ITIL or the
information technology infrastructure
library is a framework that helps
businesses manage their I.T services and
improve their overall efficiency ITIL
can help you in your job aspirations to
become an IT manager or an its
specialist did you know the national
average salary of an information
technology specialist is 55 000 in
United States well then why wait in this
video we will be taking a closer look at
ITIL and exploring the key Concepts and
principles that makes it a valuable tool
for businesses worldwide but before we
begin let me take you through simply
learns itil4 Foundation certifications
training course this ITIL certification
introduces learner to ITI L4 V4
certification the newest version of ITIL

below ITIL or information technology
infrastructure library is a framework
for it service management itsm that
aligns IT services with the businesses
needs ITIL service management provides a
set of best practices and techniques for
selecting planning delivering and
maintaining IT services within a
business that aligns the it Department's
actions and expenses with changing
business demands
some of the benefits of ITIL include
lower costs high quality of IT services
increased business productivity improved
return on investment Roi greater
customer satisfaction and improved
resource utilization the ITIL service
lifecycle can be divided into five
stages service strategy service design
service transition service operations
and continual service improvement all in
all ITIL provides a holistic approach to
service management and enables
businesses to collaborate with the IT
team to deliver it services to
stakeholders so now let's answer the
question why is IDL so important so now
let's understand this better by taking
into consideration a conversation here
we have two friends John and Jim talking
to each other about itin so Jim asks how
we can opt for a holistic approach in
the IT industry by this he means that
instead of taking each of the components
in the IIT industry separately how can
he take them as a whole or how can we
see it as a whole that's when John says
that earlier it was difficult but now it
isn't all of that was possible with the
help of ITIL with it businesses could
collaborate with the IT team so that
they could deliver it services to the
stakeholders Jim is really interested
and wants to know more about the
benefits of ITIL so some of the benefits
of ITIL are reduced I.T costs enhanced
ID Services improved productivity
improved return on investment improved
customer satisfaction better management
of business risk and service disruption
and improved resource utilization now
we're going to talk about what exactly
ITIL is ITIL stands for information
technology infrastructure Library it
helps all organizations to deliver it
services using the most efficient
methods it helps businesses to improve
service levels and reduce the cost of it
operations now here service levels has a
different meaning it basically focuses
on how an organization maintains IT
services for customers as well as it
controls various activities involved in
a process activities like planning
designing delivering deploying and
managing Services now the main goal of
ITIL is to improve efficiency and
Achieve predictable Service delivery at
the same time a major requirement is to
achieve High service quality now let's
talk about the history of ITIL itil's
first version was introduced in 1989 to
standardize I.T service management to
provide for a uniform structure for
Service delivery itil's second version
was introduced in 2001. in 2007 itil's
third version was introduced now this
aimed to improve ITIL service life cycle
by introducing a new feature of feedback
looping aiming to clarify the processes
of itl's third version a new version of
ITI V3 was upgraded and released in
2011. in 2019 itl's fourth version was
introduced it provided a flexible as
well as integrated system for the
effective management of it enabled
Services why has itl become so popular
these days large medium and small
organizations across the world use ITI
file in order to improve the value of
their services but how can ITIL improve
an organization's performance with ITIL
and organization doesn't just save money
but also works more effectively it also
have more benefits that are reduced I.T
cost enhanced I.T Services improved
productivity better management of
business risk and service disruption
improved customer satisfaction by
delivering efficient services and
provides guidance to address service
management challenges that's great which
is the latest itl framework and what's
new about it itl4 is the latest update
itl has evolved from many years and itl4
is the latest version and this was
released in February 2019. it focuses on
practical approach on how to manage the
core principles of quality services how
to implement ITR from large to small
organizations and how itl can be
utilized with Frameworks such as agile
lean and devops now what is in it for us
to learn and understand from itl4
tutorial so as part of this tutorial we
are going to now look at what is itil4
elements of the itl4 framework that is
four dimensions and itl service value
chain and its components then details
about itl for certifications and
companies using ITIL so what is ITIL
ITIL is set off framework of IT service
management that helps in aligning IT
services with the requirements of the
business so it helps organizations to
deliver it services using the most
efficient method so itl goal is to
improve efficiency and Achieve
predictable Service delivery so finally
what it means for us when we say it
service management information
technology service management so itsm
stands for information technology
service management where it focuses on
how an organization maintains IT
services for customers also it controls
various activities involved in the
process activities like planning
designing delivering deploying and
managing Services itf4 emphasizes the
importance of value creation rather than
just delivering services this involves
value always as lean mentioned
repeatedly value should be always in
customer perspective so there should be
an outcome generally we use the term
called output for the products or
Services which are created but by using
that product or Services one has to have
realization of the value created by it
so that request to have certain outcomes
we are not speaking about just the
features and function of a specific
product or Services we're speaking about
how the customer is benefited from that
features and functionality which helps
customer or consumers to realize the
value then creation of a value should be
always with collaboration and
cooperation so itl4 more emphasizes on
co-creation of value so this also
involves managing specific cost and risk
when we say managing specific cost and
risk it's about service provider to own
the cost and risk and this cost and risk
is not for the consumer or customer so
value must be clearly defined as the
purpose of an organization it is to
create value for its stakeholders
whereas outcome is a result of service
they're specific and help you know
whether you have reached your goal so
now to understand the outcome of an
output let us understand this example an
output of wedding photography is the
photo album but the outcome is the
satisfaction that is experienced by the
client when looking at the album if
album is an output in the first case you
can see the photos are not clear means
poor customer experience that would be
the outcome similarly the album output
where it is very clear the experience of
the customer will be very good so that
is an outcome so finally co-creation of
value in order to deliver the high
quality output the service provider
should maintain an interactive
relationship with its stakeholders and
customers it's very essential to
interact understand the respective view
of the stakeholders and create the value
accordingly for example co-creation is a
business strategy which helps consumer
receives the results based on their
requirements if you take up this
scenario of a restaurant where service
products provides certain Dish versus
service provider provides certain
facilities to the consumers of the food
in the restaurant so that they will have
better experience and feedback can be
provided then and there itself so this
helps the restaurant Personnel to work
on those feedbacks and improve the
service experience to the customers the
amount of money spent on specific
activity or resources should be managed
wisely and as I mentioned earlier cost
and risk of any Services provided by a
service provider is with service
provider consumer of a service just pays
for a service and then as the service
consumption is complete they will just
off-board themselves like you go and
book a taxi you get onboarded to taxi
and then you get off the taxi as you
reach your destination you will not own
the vehicle you are not owning that car
you're not owning that any mobile app if
you have used to book the taxi all the
cost and risk associated with these
service components would be for service
provider another example can be
Starbucks has offered internet access to
its customers which means all the
associated components with the Starbucks
internet services the cost and risk
associated with that is owned by
Starbucks now what is itil4 so itl4 how
to identify whether a service is
delivering value to customer and meeting
their requirements solution this can be
identified by evaluating the utility and
warranty now it is very essential to
understand what is utility and warranty
for us so utility refers to the
functionality offered by product in
order to meet a specific requirement for
example utility of a training service is
about the timings of the service the
content delivered during the services
the profile of the trainer Etc whereas
email Services if you take an example
utility is all those parameters features
functionalities associated associated
with the email services like mailbox
capacity or the way the speed of emails
sending or receiving Etc now similarly
warranty refers to the customer with
certain Assurance of the products like
service availability information
security service capacity and service
continuity so these four service
availability information security or
service capacity and service continuity
has to ensure the specific provided
Services is having those Solutions which
will safeguard these requirements of the
services and service will become fit for
use if I take a similar example of email
Services which we discussed just now so
warranty is about availability of email
Services how safe is my message when I
send and receive the messages means
information security capacity do you
have a sufficient capacity so that all
the emails can be stored and then
continuity what happens if something
goes wrong drastically some failure
happens minimum Services should be up
and running so that my messaging
services is on for at least minimum need
of the messaging requirements that is
about warranty so utility refers to fit
for purpose basically referring to
Features functionality of the service
whereas warranty refers to these four
things availability security capacity
and continuity making a specific
Services fit for use so elements of itl4
so here we are going to look at
understanding two main elements defined
in itl4 that is four dimensions and ITIL
service value system so let us look at
four dimensions of services so the four
dimensions of services involves
organizations and people informations
and Technology partners and suppliers
and value streams and processes always
it is required to look at a service
having in holistic picture so having
this holistic picture requires correct
understanding about these four
dimensions of services so when I say
organizations and people when is
information and Technology partners and
suppliers values and value streams and
processes so all these four dimensions
will be definitely involved and required
to look at for every services so let us
understand these one by one now
organization people refers to the
organization structure the culture the
people the principles the values around
revolving around the people and
organization structure which makes for
providing better outcomes for creating
better outcomes for the services
similarly information and Technology
involves information and knowledge which
is required along with the technology to
provide a required services and service
management the partners and suppliers
focuses on those stakeholders who Supply
certain services for a service provider
so that service provider can provide the
better services to their consumers of
the services value streams and processes
refers to the series of steps
organization takes to create deliver the
products throughout the service life
cycle of a Services now to take an
example if I assume a services like taxi
services which I defined earlier we
discussed earlier who is organizational
people the people sitting in the
customer care the people like drivers
the people sitting in the business
people sitting in a finance people
sitting in the technology so all these
forms at an organization structure
having people in it so that fulfills
organization people dimension of
services whereas information and
Technology like car itself is a
technology device information about the
schedule or information about the driver
similarly the technology platform the
mobile app what you use can be the one
which you can visualize for information
and technology for partners and
suppliers now generally if you look at
the examples like olar uber Services
taxi services they are not employed by
The olar Uber they are the partners and
suppliers for providing the taxi
services to Ola on Uber on behalf of Ola
and Uber so similarly internet services
will be provided to all and Uber by A
supplier supported and suppliers
involvement is essential in any Services
now value streams and processes now when
you act actually open a mobile app and
book a taxi you need a process which has
to be established and defined and this
process would connect to the trigger or
to check what vehicles are available and
book a vehicle for you allocate a
vehicle for the specific consumer
similarly that process triggering the
Billing System likewise many processes
are connected with each other forming a
value stream to achieve a specific
objective of a consumer and this
involves many processes so considering
these four Dimensions every Services has
these four dimensions and consideration
of these four dimensions are essential
while strategizing the services
designing a Services transitioning a
Services delivering a Services
supporting a Services throughout the
life cycle of the services so all these
four dimensions are impacted by and
external factors six external factors so
these six external factors can also be
called as pastel factors which is
basically political Factor economic
factors social factors technological
factors legal factors and environmental
factors so further each Dimension as I
mentioned is affected by multiple
factors and we saw that and next let us
look at itl service value system so this
forms the core part of itl framework so
this shows an end to end view about what
is involved in service value system so
it starts with opportunity demand which
is shown in the left side and every
Services creating the value and
continually improve to align and create
the value so when I say opportunities
and demand switch becomes a reason for
triggering an actions and activities and
move from left to right similarly as it
moves from left to right the value is
created opportunity the term opportunity
refers to the needs and requirements of
customers or consumers which is realized
by service provider to fulfill whereas
demand represents a requirement for
products and services from the customers
so either opportunity realized by
service provider which is unfulfilled
need of consumers or customers whereas
demand where customer or Zoomer is
asking and booking those products or
services from you would create certain
actions with the service providing
organizations so ultimately it should
result in creation of those product or
services with the specific features and
functions so those would enable the
creation of value and also that value
represents a valuable outcome now the
components of service value system as we
saw guiding principles is one of that
which help in providing a comprehensive
vision of how an organization should
manage a service so there are seven
principles so that is focus on value
start where you are think and work
holistically progress height relatively
with feedback keep it simple and
practical collaborate and promote
visibility and optimize and automate so
when we say focus on value which means
everything we do as part of services so
every task an organization does should
create value for stakeholders especially
it should encourage to focus on user
experience and give better consumers
experience so that they will be we can
be continually continually the value is
realized by the consumer or customers
next principle start where you are
refers to ensuring that organization
assist and analyze the scenarios to
identify and improve things on a
continual basis for example organization
assessing and analyzing the existing
processes to identify and improve so
progress iterative and feedback this
opts for a feedback during every
iterations of the work always ensures to
organize work into small and manageable
sections which can lead to Quick results
collaborate and promote visibility it is
very essential to collaborate with
customers users suppliers and all the
stakeholders who are involved in
services and service actions as it helps
in creating much better value think and
work holistically so this creates a
process that adds value to the customers
or consumers and business and always
helps in identification of different
ways to enhance the performance of the
processes because this provides the end
to end view of a service cases keep it
simple and practical it is always
important to opt for minimum steps that
are correct and do not add processes
that create value to the stakeholders
optimize and automate so optimize and
automate refers to consideration of the
services which needs to be optimized and
automated which helps in improving the
efficiency and Effectiveness and also
optimize the resources and costs next
component of service value system is
governance so when we say governance
governance basically is responsible for
evaluating directing and monitoring the
IT service management by adopting The
Guiding principles defined in ital4
framework it may also does demonstrate
these principles considering the
currently available or the principles
which are defined in the organization so
this involves three main activities that
is evaluate direct and monitor so
evaluate refers to the performance of
reviews of the services on a continual
basis based on the stakeholder
requirement so that how the services are
performing how the new opportunities
coming up would be understood and that
can made visible the directions whatever
is provided based on the evaluation done
for the itsm organization so that
accordingly the required directions can
be accomplished when I say direction for
example organization can have directions
to enhance the business opportunities
Minister business opportunities increase
the sales by 25 percent in coming
quarter when organization says this now
in what way it service management can
contribute to that in what way the
Readiness of IT service management
should be when organization enhances it
business to 25 should we optimize
something with us or should we increase
certain set of resources and
capabilities so that increase of the
business to 25 percent is actually
supported or complemented by it service
management then as you implement that as
this direction is set whether itsm is
contributing to that has to be checked
monitored so it has to monitor the
performance of the organize position and
has to check whether the practices the
products the services are there aligned
are they aligned are they in line with
the direction given by the governing
body it is very essential to understand
this and have this in practice so that
Services always continue to be aligned
with the service organizations business
requirements and also the organizations
or consumers who are using the services
of a service provider so it aligns to
that as well so evaluate direct and
monitor as happens continually regularly
so that continued alignment of direction
to the set Direction by the governing
body is ensured so next component is
service value chain which is basically a
component which is which is in the
middle of a service value system so this
will have a set of interconnected
activities that an organization performs
to deliver a valuable product or
services to its consumers so this will
have many activities like engage plan
improve design and transition obtain and
and build a Deliverance support product
and services now as you see in the left
side you have a demand right side you
have a value now the demand which is
represented in the left side you don't
see opportunities as it was mentioned in
the service value system framework in
the left side we had demand and
opportunity in that picture but here we
don't see that the simple reason here in
a service value chain being part of
service value system it is always demand
when we refer to opportunities in
service value system the moment it is
realized there is a opportunity the
discussion happens based on that and
decision happens as the decisions happen
now it is required to fulfill the demand
by a service boarding organization that
is the reason we don't see the word
opportunity here so as the demand is
seen now the engagement happens now how
the engagement happens so here it
involves first planning so planning
refers to the activities involving
creating plans portfolios architectures
policies Etc which provides an
organization a direction a Clarity in
terms of what to do
to learn more about this course you can
click the link in the description box
below
if you refer to previous version of itl
like itl V3 you can think about a
service strategy part of the actions
which used to take like understanding
the perspective of services planning for
the services understanding service
requirements service level requirements
right so it will enable to get the
clarity in terms of the detail about the
services and what are those results
which are required to be established so
now people would contribute to this
active activities and must have great
analytical and management skills they
should be clear visualization about the
services end-to-end like the principle
we said having a holistic approach so
unless I have a holistic picture a
bird's eye view I cannot understand what
services is being delivered and what is
that value it is going to be created so
this full picture of services N2 and has
to be visualized that is the reason plan
is on the top like an umbrella so one
has to understand that very clearly so
as you get the Insight towards that
particular service service requirement
service level requirements once the plan
is ready then you will move forward with
engage so in engage with the right set
of stakeholders now why should we engage
with the stakeholders engaging with
stakeholders requires clear focus on
understanding the requirements as needed
by the consumers we may require to
document this we may require to
understand what is that people need
skills and competency right in terms of
engaging and we need to know and
demonstrate that so while you understand
and get a good understanding about the
needs of the stakeholder stakeholders
may be like end user who are using the
services customers who are discussing
straight or give the requirements
whereas the suppliers who is also asking
about a requirements in terms of
provisioning their services to the
service provider so the engagement
should go on with all those stakeholders
to understand clearly and also set the
expectation clearly to those
stakeholders so you may require to set
an expectation to Consumers you may
require to certain expectation suppliers
you are required to set an expectation
to users and this has to continue
throughout so continually engaging with
all the stakeholders throughout the
service values and it's very rigorous as
part of service value chain so next
activity would be design and transition
so design and transition focus on
creating and releasing new and change
services now when we say designing a new
Services if you recall the points with
what we had in ital V3 like four Ps we
used to discuss which we just saw like
four dimensions so people process
products and partners which weighs
aligned to four dimensions sort which
you just saw in the previous slides so
that is very essential to visualize and
defining service solution defining
technology architectures defining
processes defining metrics defining
measurement methods and tools to measure
that particular service and service
performance so this requires
understanding and having those
individuals who have comprehensive
understanding about service management
and they should contribute to this
entire exercise of design and
transitioning so unless you have that
holistic picture what we are mentioning
while planning and also engaging to get
the clarity so designing would not
provide you that blueprint request it
service design package we call it s
which we use this term initially with
reprospective but however the
terminology would not change the
blueprint the service design package
what you have for a service it is very
necessary to have that in place with a
detailed considerations of all the four
dimensions of the services and also
considering the impact of the pastel
factors so further obtain and build so
obtain and build focuses on development
and management of the infrastructure and
applications so you obtain means you
acquire resources you acquire components
infrastructure components like servers
storage database or application
platforms testing platforms you acquire
you test those you make it ready you set
up that environment required for
creation of a Services transition of a
Services you obtain and build then
further you deliver and support this
requires to ensure that services are
delivered and supported in a way that
meets stakeholders expectations so as
you engage on a continual basis there is
a collaborations which is going on
throughout and also like progress
iterated with feedback you need to take
that approach so that you will have a
feedback so by doing this you are
demonstrating all the seven principles
right so Services provisioning is on
part of it new services provisioning or
modifying the existing services to
enhance the performance of the existing
services with added features and
functionality is one thought similarly
while there is an incident while there
is a disruption while there is a failure
it is required to resolve those even in
that scenario one has to understand what
are the impacts to the services what are
the impacts to the business and handle
accordingly and this is true for while
introducing a new services and while
resolving the incidents or issues
associated with the specific Services
which are up and running so when it is
happening with the better collaboration
with the customers consumers suppliers
every stakeholders obviously will
involve actively and they contribute as
well as realize the value it is very
important that people contributing to
this activity and need to be very good
at prioritizing and managing complex
workloads so services such as resolving
incidents monitoring applications and
infrastructure generating reports all
these are the actions which happens as
part of deliver and support now improve
every Services every service components
every processes every individuals has to
be improved so the focus on software
development and management of cloud
infrastructure and third party Services
which happens as part of service value
chain this we can term it as an example
where you your improvement can be
focused on now when I say improve
Improvement at all levels you can think
of improvement at a component level
Improvement under integration level
Improvement at a service level
Improvement at contribution to the
business level so as you go on each of
these levels it is quite obvious that
you need to measure the performances at
each of these levels so as you measure
the perform performance is at each of
these level it provides you certain
Insight is the performance is according
to what is required what is planned or
is the services is there a deviation
from the required performance in either
of these scenarios it is very essential
to check and see if there is any
opportunity for improvement if things
are if things are going as planned then
it's okay so you need to identify the
opportunities to improve further from
that level that would become Baseline if
things are not happening the way it is
planned obviously that Corrections are
required again the Improvement thought
comes in so every services at any given
point in time one has to keep seeking
the opportunities for improvement and
keep improving that comes through
feedback what you get on a continual
basis from the consumers and users next
component is practices so there are
around 34 practices management practices
which are designed to accomplish the
specific objectives of a Services now
when I say 34 practices earlier we used
to have called processes which we used
to say process and functions in itl V3
framework so itl V3 had defined 26
processes and then five life cycle
stages and also four functions now here
in itl4 realizing that not a specific
process is dedicated or associated with
only one life cycle stage each of those
processes has so much of complexity it
cannot just call as a process and it has
to be called as a practice because of
the complexity and transactions involved
for example if I take Incident
Management we used to call it as a
process and we need to use to look at
that as a process as part of service
operation now Incident Management
process as part of service operation
fine but what are the amount of
activities it involves what is the
complexity of it it is it goes across
the various different functions so
looking at this scenario where this
process goes across various functions to
get a result now you think of a scenario
where I need to resolve incident by
doing certain changes now I trigger a
change management now if you look at the
entire framework of title V3 change
management is actually defined in
service transition lifecycle stage now
but in operations you have Incident
Management whereas change management is
in transition so is that service moving
back to the previous life cycle stage
that was the confusion so instead of
that if you say there is an incident
management practice which is applicable
irrespective of the stage of that
particular service change control which
is applicable across the life cycle
irrespective of the scenario the service
Services is into so then you are not
bound to any specific life cycle stage
so while incident occurs right away go
and take the help of Change Control and
then implement the required changes and
then close the incidents so this does
not have any specific attachment or
tying between a specific stage of the
service life cycle so if you can able to
recall and visualize itel V3 defined
about five life cycle stages first stage
was service strategy having five
processes service design Having Eight
processes service transition having
seven processes service operation having
five processors and continual service
improvement having around one process
aligned with CSA model continual service
improvement model each of these process
like SLA service level agreement which
you which is there in service design
stage so this is discussed in strategy
as well and this service levels has to
be monitored and managed during the
service operations and services has to
be created and transitioned aligning
with the service levels defined in
design so this is what the thought was
but the existence of that service level
SLA service a process what we used to
call was there universally across the
life cycle initially to Define next to
transition next to Monitor and manage so
it was there so sir the process gets
triggered some point in time but it is
there throughout now in ital 4 this
particular practice is not bound to a
specific life cycle stage so whenever it
is required it is triggered and each of
these practices are interconnected
certain way if I take another example
like Information Security Management so
this is also important throughout the
life cycle and very interesting part
here is information security management
practice is the one which is not just
for a service provided by service
product alone the practice of
information security should be practiced
across the organization service produce
organization so that better information
security can be provided to all the
services provided by a service provider
so keeping this in mind the 34 practices
are grouped into three major categories
General management practice service
management practice and technical
management practices when I say General
management practice so these General
management practices which are around 14
practices are applicable across the
organization right the general
management practices are applicable
across the organization and this is not
bound to any specific services for
example change transformation right so
if you have a major change which used to
call in ital V3 so that requires certain
amount of time to more organization
thought the culture everything towards
certain level so that the change can
become successful across the
organization similarly Information
Security Management which I just
mentioned so many practices which are
not just associated with one service can
be generally applicable across the
organization so 14 General management
practices are defined so similarly that
14 General management practices includes
Information Security Management
relationship management Strategic
Management portfolio management when I
say portfolio it is a portfolio of the
organization not just about one service
so architecture management and
Enterprise architecture what we're
speaking about and service financial
management overall for all the services
Workforce and talent management
continual Improvement continual
Improvement of all the services to suit
the business requirement to align and
complement to the business measurement
and Reporting has a whole risk
management Knowledge Management
organizational change management which I
just mentioned and explained in in terms
of having organization transformation
project management supplier management
so when I say Information Security
Management to reiterate on so this has
to focus on ensuring the safeguarding
confidentiality integrity and
availability of information and
information a set of organization so
only then all that activities I do as
part of this organization will be under
the umbrella of information security
Focus so all that I do in this
organization so I need to ensure the
information security is taken care
people moving from entry gate to my data
center so can I define that as part of
data center Services no I have a data
center facility but someone entering the
premises everyone who comes into my
premises need not go to data center but
they move around the data center it's
quite obvious I need to safeguard
someone should not tailgate without
anybody's knowledge I need to set the
controls at organization level so people
who are not authorized will not move
towards data center so the next level of
security enablement can happen
exclusively for data center so that is
again that is aligned with the framework
of information security for the
organization so it is very essential to
consider this practice at the
organization level rather than just at a
service level the moment I focus at
organization level so all the applicable
services will also get initiated and
implemented implementation of that
particular practice so that's
application of that particular service
as well similarly if you look at
relationship management so when I say
relationship at the broader perspective
relationship happens with two entities
two organizations two individuals to two
organization two Enterprises so it is of
that size it's not about one individual
have a relationship with another
individual a service manager has a
relationship with another manager it is
not that it's about two entities service
broader organization and customer
organization consumers organization
there should be relationship and this
relationship management also you can
look at in terms of having across the
organization within the various
different departments and function
within organization similarly
relationship between the manager and
subordinate relationship between
colleagues relation between Supply
buyers and service provider relationship
between service Builder and customers so
it's across so the main purpose of this
is to ensure a good relationship with
maintain between organizations and its
stakeholders only then that required
collaboration and transactions can
happen to make the business successful
so keeping in this mind rest all the
practices as I mentioned strategic
management or portfolio management
architecture Management Service
financial management Workforce and
talent management continual Improvement
measurement and Reporting risk
management Knowledge Management
organizational change management project
management supplier management all these
has to consider across the organization
perspective organization as a whole they
should look at right so only then the
required practice of making people to
understand about the Dynamics of the
services dynamics of the business can be
enabled I'll take one vague example like
you have a we took the example of
restaurant earlier now if I speak about
relationship management relating to that
rest restaurant now who has to maintain
the relationship now the waiter who goes
and speaks to the customer consumers who
are comes to the restaurant there should
be a relationship established if not a
relationship which lasts for long on
one-on-one basis it's about creation of
that experience because that is one of
the touch points now that is one
experience what that consumer will have
the moment the consumer enters the
restaurant the ambience of the
restaurant the people who take care of
the ambience of the restaurant if they
get the right feedback in time what kind
of Ambience would help what is the
feedback about this from the customer
there is a transaction and relationship
which is happening similar the billing
team the people working in the kitchen
versus the waiter the time they manage
the information flow from them to the
waiter and then to the consumers so all
and taste of the food is that customers
enjoying the food feedback going back to
the kitchen and making Necessary
Corrections there and fitting the need
of the customers and consumers on a
regular basis so understanding this
relationship across so that it's quite
obvious the consumer of a service will
have a better experience and this is a
it's not a one time job it should be
there always and should continue
throughout it is very essential to
demonstrate this only then customer will
have a better experience so likewise all
these General practices General
practices should be applicable across
the organization and demonstrate it so
that you can create a better service
experience to the consumers so next is
service management practices so service
management practices are the one which
is applicable to specific Services which
are used for development diploma and
delivery and support in the
organization's environment when it's
organization it may be organization of
service provider organization of
consumer organization of supplier so
this involves around 17 practices that
is it Asset Management Monitor and event
management means monitoring each of the
service components and the service
performance business analysis service
catalog management of all the
operational Services service design
service level management for the
specific service availability management
capacity and Performance Management
Service continue management service desk
now remember service desk was called as
function when we were studying itel V3
but realizing service desk itself is a
practice where all the four dimensions
is applicable so service desk is also
termed as practice and there is no word
called function used in itune4 so
Incident Management service request
management so request fulfillment was
the terminology user here it is a
service request management problem
management release Management Service
validation and testing service
configuration management change control
the seven service management practices
now looking at one of these practice
like it Asset Management so we need to
understand what is it asset so all those
assets like server a database an
application an individual so each of
these forms Services we cannot we can
also call it as configuration items so
one has to manage those so so that they
are valuable asset are realized managed
properly and they are performing and
delivering a the level which is required
to accomplish the required performance
for creating a better service value to
the consumers of the services so it
assets are managed throughout the life
cycle of that particular idea set and it
is very essential to keep those its
performance at that level so that no it
assets which are not considered are not
kept without the visibility of those
asset in the IT service management so
that they are performing at certain
level ensuring the services will be
performing better and that better
service performance would result in
better complement or contribution to the
business similarly if I look at
monitoring and event management now I am
monitoring the services a performance of
a service components and then Behavior
behaviors the capacity utilized the
availability of those so I'm monitoring
those and learning the behavior of those
service components sea ice so
emphasizing on generating and detecting
the status of IT services its CIS
throughout the life cycle of this
service so that this will keep me clear
providing that better picture so that I
will have a Clarity in terms of what
needs to be addressed at what point in
time so today's monitoring and event
management tools if I speak about is so
capable compared with the way it was
there like 15 20 years back it's so
capable today we're speaking about
bringing automation to it already a lot
of tools are automated that way which
provides predictive analysis which would
provide the required action to improve
the experience of the services so that
is the capability what we are speaking
today so focusing on this monitoring and
event management need of a specific
service what needs to be looked at
something which is non-acceptable
behavior what is that we can term it as
something which is okay this is how the
behavior should be that needs to be
understood correctly and then whenever
the deviation occurs monitoring and
event management would throw an alert at
the same time it will also keep
analyzing the trend of it and providing
nicer Insight towards what actions needs
to be taken so likewise each of these
practices specific to each of the
services has to be looked at carefully
and demonstrated so while doing this one
should not ignore the fact that
alignment to those seven principles
defined it is very essential so next is
technical management practices so when
we say technical management practices it
refers to the management of Technology
domains for the service management
purposes by expanding or shifting their
focus from Technology Solutions to IT
services so if I'm just looking at a
server for example an application for
example as an individual component so I
am not seeing entire Service as a whole
but however my focus being on the
individual I.T component is also
essential I cannot ignore that part so
the technology technical management
practices are of three types which
includes deployment management software
development and management
infrastructure and platform management
so overall General management practices
14 service management practices 17 and
technical management practices 3 so
totally 34 management practices defined
in itl4 so when I say deployment
management now as you design and
transition obtain and build to deliver
you need to deploy now while deploying
that deployment has to be scheduled like
release scheduling we do so once that is
scheduled the deployment would happen at
certain point in time so deployment
practice would help in terms of
Designing and managing and controlling
the build test and deployment of
releases in order to deliver new
functionality required by the business
and this is for a specific service or
something which needs to be transitioned
or implemented as part of the service
life cycle where you need a specific
technical or technological actions right
that are defined very clearly and those
needs to be complied with similarly if
you speak about software development and
management it would focus on enhancing
the quality of software development and
ensures to provide the required
functionality for IT services so
specific practice depending on the kind
of platforms which are used similarly
for infrastructure and platform
management a question may arise here we
are speaking about the practices which
are general which are service specific
which are technically but what about the
people now people is also a resource as
the overall practice is what we have all
these are done by people so one has to
look at having enhancing the
capabilities of the individuals which
are required to demonstrate all of these
activities that is definitely one
important Focus which specifically it
may not mention but it is very essential
to have those individuals so various
roles of it can comes across like
service manager process owner service
owner which we used to see as a
designation and also roles of service
management those individuals those roles
needs to have a specific required
competencies and capabilities only then
they can perform here as part of these
practices so next component for service
value system is continual Improvement so
as we say continual Improvement it's for
entire service value system which
ensures that it Services continuously
align to stakeholders expect rotations
so we just don't speak about fulfilling
the expectation of stakeholders going
beyond that expectation it's very
important so meaning giving better
service experience so the support
continually Improvement at all levels
itl service value system includes
continual Improvement model which has
continual Improvement practice and the
improve service value chain activity
right so when I say the itl can
continual Improvement model this would
provide a structured approach to the
organization in order to bring the
required improvements on regular basis
and the word used is continual not
continuous so continue in the sense we
take that approach of pdcab plan do
check and act on that continuous PDC
then improve service valuation
activities that is to establish
continual Improvement into service value
chain right so we saw that improve and
service value chain as well if the down
one in the service value chain picture
then continually Improvement practice
which supports organization in their
day-to-day Improvement efforts so they
this happens aligning to the CSI model
which is redefined compared with the
model what was defined in the previous
version of itl so that is having seven
steps like what is the vision being the
first question where are we now at what
stage are we now where are we now then
where do we want it to be how do we
achieve our goal how do we get there
then once you have a plan to get there
take action to get there then did we
achieve our goal did we get there then
keep keep the momentum going by having
that feedback so this particular CSA
model for continual Improvement is
aligned and followed for example if I
say what is the vision of organization
to become a bus to service provider in
the region where we are doing the
business if this is the vision then are
we the best service product at this
point in time you're answering that
questions where are we now at what stage
are we now where are we now so you're
answering no we are not the best we are
in the third position so then next
immediate action what will you take
where do you want it to be so mostly to
take an action in terms of
identification of those gaps which needs
to be addressed identification of those
opportunities which needs to be taken
care of so that you can move ahead in
terms of reaching that position so next
Position will be at least reaching near
to second one or becoming second one
would be the target then how do we
achieve that how do we achieve that goal
how do we move forward you set up a plan
for it you draft a clear plan and then
take action do it then you check did we
achieve our goal did we get there so if
you are there excellent if you are not
there work on it again based on that
feedback again work based on the vision
if you achieved set up a next Target if
you are not achieved check out what is
that we did not do let us continue to do
that so that we will achieve that goal
so this CSA model was depicted and
followed in ital 4 framework this is the
one which is uh actually mentioned in
title 4. okay so next we will look at
understanding the certification various
different certifications level defined
in itl4 so now itl 4 Foundation
certification is enter level
certification which offers basic
knowledge of ITIL key elements Core
Concepts and terminologies used in ital
4. the various levels of certifications
as defined in itl4 certification scheme
is like itl Foundation is the basic
level of certification there are three
types of modules in itl specialist
certification and two modules in itl
strategies modules so create delivered
Support Drive stakeholder value High
Velocity are the three itl specialist
modules whereas direct plan and improve
digital and I.T strategy are the two
strategies modules so to accomplish itl
managing professional one has to
complete these four modules so each of
these modules create Deliverance Support
Drive stakeholder value High Velocity
direct plan and improve or a separate
examination similar to accomplish the
certification of itl strategic leader
one has to complete sorry direct plan
and improve and digital and it strategy
certifications so one once this is
complete the next level is itl Master
certification so itl 4 Foundation
examination format would look like this
the duration of the examination is one
hour so totally there are 40 multiple
choice questions so each right answers
would carry one marks and the duration
of examination is like 60 minutes so one
has to score 26 that is 65 percent for
40 questions given and there is no
negative marking for wrong answers so
once you complete the foundation
certification one can move forward
towards accomplishing the next level of
certification I will redo this slide
from this Slide the companies using ITR
practices let us look at few of the
examples so first example for us would
be the case of Disney so why Disney is
using itl so it is one of the famous
companies that has adopted ITI so some
of the reasons why Disney is using and
what are those issues it had earlier so
Disney had was facing the issues to
maintain up to date and accurate
information on their applications
similarly the company's management
system had difficulty in identifying the
right costumes for their cast members
and schedules Maps when necessary it was
a challenge to maintain the availability
of assets for the customers so adoption
of ITIL and Disney has improved Service
delivery and performance 100
availability of assets improved
reliability maintainability and
scalability of IT services then increase
in customer engagement so similarly
there are many organizations similar to
Disney has adopted ITIL and has seen
that value realization happening to them
so some more organizations similar to
Disney's example what we saw would be
Datacom Systems Inc Muller metzo IRS and
list goes on you name the big names in
the industry they have itl practiced
actively in their organization so final
summary as part of this tutorial we
looked at understanding the definitions
some of the definitions of service
management we also discussed about value
co-creation of value outcome risk and
cost associated with the services then
we spoke about utility and warranty we
understood why itl is a best practice
framework for IT service management and
also we looked at itl4 framework and its
components like service value system and
components of service value system like
principal governance service value chain
practices continual Improvement
opportunity demand and value and also we
looked at the components of service
value chain like starting with the
demand and having plan engage improve
obtain and build design transition
Deliverance support and that creates
products or Services enabling value then
also we looked at four dimensions that
is pastel factors influencing four
dimensions so political economical
social technological legal and
environmental factors and this was all
