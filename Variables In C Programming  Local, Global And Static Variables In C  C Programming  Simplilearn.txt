hey everyone i am harsanya from simply
learnstream and i welcome you all to
this interesting session on variable c c
programming
but before we begin if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and
press the bell icon so you'll never miss
any update from simply learn
without further ado let's get started
with the agenda for today's session
first we will understand what are
variables in c programming
next we will learn how to declare a
variable in c and its initialization
procedure and finally the types of
variables in c
i hope i made myself clear with the
agenda
now let's get started with the first
part of today's session
what are variables in c
a variable is a user defined or a user
readable custom name assigned to a
memory location
it is used to hold a value that can be
modified and reused many times during
the program execution
a variable name can be an alphabet or
digits and can also start with an
underscore but a variable name cannot be
a keyword this might be ambiguous and
need a little attention to detail so
basically we can declare a cast name a
person's name or any object's name as a
variable
but a variable name cannot be a keyword
they are set of words reserved for
specific functionalities in c these
words cannot be used for any other user
related or custom functionalities a few
such keywords are int
float for
why etc
now let's look at an example
so in this particular example the user
defined variable a will store value at
the address 2000 upon the variable
declaration the memory allocation
happens depending on the type of
variable and its size for example if the
data type is in it creates the memory
for the variable type end the storage
size of int is 2 bytes and 4 bytes for
float
let us now understand variable
declaration in c with the help of syntax
and examples
syntax of variable declaration is data
type variable list and semicolon at the
end
values assigned to variables can be of
any data type like int float care etc so
in this example int is a data type a b
and sum are the variable list
and they are specific rules for naming a
variable
here are the valued variable names in
sum float underscore a b
into b20
with these examples we understood that a
variable can have alpha bits start with
an underscore character and have digits
now let's look at some invalid variable
links for example
int 38 a variable name cannot start with
digits
in the next example we cannot have white
space within a variable name
and variable name cannot be a keyword
now let's try to declare invalid
variable names and run the program
int 30
float
x space y
and in go to
so after declaring invalid variable
names we got an error for all the
variable declaration stating that
invalid suffix a on integer constant
expected comma semicolon before y
and expected identifier
now that we know how to declare a c
variable let's move ahead and understand
see variable initialization with the
help of syntax and examples
syntax of variable initialization is
data type variable 1 is equal to value 1
comma variable 2 is equal to value 2 and
semicolon
so this is how we initialize the
variable for example in t is equal to 10
comma b is equal to 20 comma sum
10 is assigned to a variable year of
type integer value 20 is assigned to a
variable b of the same type and we have
declared a variable sum
okay so let me now move on to the types
of variables in c there are five types
of c variables let us understand one by
one
variables that are declared inside the
functions are called local variables
in this example we have declared
variable e inside the function sum that
holds the value 5.
let's try to execute a simple program
using local variables in vs code editor
inside the function let's declare and
initialize the local variable
int
a is equal to 5
and then the printf function to print
the value
printf
percentage d
comma e
here the value is printed successfully
using local variable
all right
let's move on to the next type of
variable
variables declared outside the functions
are called global variables here is the
example where float pi is equal to 3.14
a global variable defined outside the
functions
let's try to execute the program using
global variables
here let's add the function circle and
try to access the global variable in the
function
float
pi is equal to 3.14
which is a global variable
int circle
which is a function
and inside function let's declare
variable r and area
int r
is equal to 5
double area
formula for area of the circle area is
equal to
pi into
r into r
written area
inside void main let's call the function
circle
print f
percentage d
comma circle
as you can see the circle's value for
the area is printed successfully using
global variable
next variables declared with a keyword
static or static variables whose
lifetime is throughout the program
runtime as you can see in this example
static is a keyword used to declare a
variable sum
let's execute simple program using
static keyword
inside the function calculate let's
declare the variable sum with static
keyword and initialize the value to 0.
static
int sum is equal to zero
sum plus plus
to increment the value of sum by one
return sum
inside the main function let's call the
function two times
printf
percentage d
comma calculated
for every function call the value of the
static variable will increment and print
new value
that means the sum value was initially 0
and then incremented by 1 and printed
value 1.
now the sum value is 1.
the sum value will increment by 1 for
the next function call and print the new
value 2. let's remove this keyword
static and now run the program
as you can see the previous output with
static keyword for every function call
the value of the sum is incremented
without starting keyword the value will
be same for every function call i hope
you got the idea of using a static
keyword right
next variables declared with auto
keywords are known as automatic
variables the variables decline inside
the block of functions are automatic
variables by default in this example
into e is equal to 10 is an automatic
variable by default
now let's execute a program using the
auto keyword
int a is equal to
10
by default this is an automatic variable
let us also declare a variable with auto
keyword
auto int
p is equal to
20
printf
percentage t
comma a
and let's print the value for b
and here you get the output
next
external variables share the variables
among the multiple c files to declare
external variables we use the keyword
extern let's see how the extent keyword
works
first create a file with a dot head
extension a header file and define a
variable with an extern keyword
extern
int x is equal to 10
comma y is equal to 20
in the file demo.c let's try to access
the external variables so for that let's
include the header file demo.head
hash include
demo.h
now inside the main function let's
declare the variable add
int
add
and now let's print the value for x and
y using printf function
printf
percentage d
comma x
and let's print the value for y
and let's perform addition operation for
that add is equal to
x plus y
printf
percentage d
comma add
as you can see the output is printed
successfully by using external variables
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the variables in c
programming i hope this session was
