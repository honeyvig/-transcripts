2
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,599
so hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,560
tutorial my name is timy bakshi and this

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,080
time we're going to be going over

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
another math video and today we're going

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,039
to be talking about Transformations more

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
specifically rotations so today I'm

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,039
going to be covering a lot of different

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,519
types of Transformations four different

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,040
types to be specific uh but the main one

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,520
that I'm really going to be going in

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,280
depth about are going is going to be

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,200
rotations so just before I begin today

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,920
uh let's start off with transformations

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,960
in general now there are four main types

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,840
of

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
Transformations uh these are now I'll

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239
get into each one in just a second and

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,120
what they mean but let me actually just

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,320
begin with uh Transformations there are

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,559
four main types uh there are

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,160
translations

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,640
stretches and compresses uh or stretch

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,799
and compression uh we also have uh

25
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,000
reflection and of course rotation now

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,119
the main reason that I'm talking uh

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,000
really about TR oh sorry rotations today

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,040
is going to be because well I find that

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,840
a lot of people have quite some

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,079
difficulty with rotations and I really

31
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,280
want to help as many people as I can uh

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,799
so I'm going to be covering the most

33
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,960
complicated topic out of them all which

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,759
would be rotations so let's actually get

35
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,759
right into this today uh as you can see

36
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,399
I have a few coordinate spaces uh drawn

37
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,200
out here uh and so today before I begin

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
the notations though I'm going to be

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,159
talking about lots of other types of

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,360
transformations in general so let's

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,520
actually begin with one of the simplest

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,640
types of Transformations translations

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,000
now translations are very simple so if I

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,680
just say so first of all we're going to

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,440
be talking about

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,600
[Music]

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,200
translations okay uh so let's actually

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,399
begin now quite simply let's say we have

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,079
a shape

50
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,560
okay we've got a shape over here on our

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,239
coordinate space and let's just say we

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,400
wanted to translate it well quite simply

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,440
all we do is move the shape we're not

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,879
going to manipulate the shape whatsoever

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,280
but we can move it left we can move it

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,879
right we can move it up and we can also

57
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,680
move it

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,360
down now again we're not manipulating

59
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,959
the shape or anything we are just moving

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,720
it around this coordinate space and that

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,080
would be a translation and this can go

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,800
left right uh up or down uh and remember

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
you can even move it diagonally uh

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,920
indirectly by going let's say you wanted

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,840
to move in this direction over here

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,879
you'd go left and then up uh or you

67
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,519
could go right and then down or really

68
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,239
however else you would like to move

69
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,080
essentially we're just moving the shape

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,480
which allows us to translate it

71
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,200
okay so that's what translations are

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,879
quite simply so I'm not going to be

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,799
covering that in too much detail in this

74
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:09,120
video but then again if I do get enough

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,599
response that you know people want to

76
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,599
learn much more about rotations that'll

77
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,680
be coming in another video but now let's

78
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,599
talk about stretch and compression so of

79
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,599
course our next topic is

80
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,640
stretch oh sorry uh so we're going to be

81
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,920
talking about stretch and compression in

82
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,599
this case both vertical and horizontal

83
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,680
stretch

84
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,040
and sorry and

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280
come

86
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,200
compression Okay so we've got stretch

87
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,159
and compression

88
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,760
here and so let's just say you know what

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,120
the best way to explain this would be

90
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,640
let's say we have a

91
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
curve okay I'm going to draw nice big

92
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,879
curve over

93
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,000
here okay so we've got this nice black

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,159
curve and I'm going to say this is our o

95
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,840
curve meaning original curve let's take

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,879
a different color maybe blue I guess so

97
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,560
we've got our blue marker and let's just

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,239
say uh that we want to stretch this

99
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,440
curve vertically how would we do that

100
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,000
well seems a little weird at first but

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
think about

102
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,560
this

103
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,600
this would be our stretched curve

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
this is what would happen if we were to

105
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,240
stretch a curve vertically okay so this

106
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,880
is our S curve now you must be wondering

107
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,759
though how does this work this is

108
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,039
obviously compression well no imagine

109
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,240
this we've got a

110
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,720
curve and let's say we were to take this

111
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,360
curve grab it from the top and the

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,080
bottom vertically we were to grab it

113
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,840
vertically and stretch it out vertically

114
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
the top goes even higher and the bottom

115
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,840
goes down then of course from the sides

116
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,000
get thinner and thinner and thinner the

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,479
more I were to stretch stretch stretch

118
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,240
it vertically that means horizontally we

119
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,479
would be compressing it but vertically

120
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,400
we would be stretching it and so that's

121
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,560
what we're doing in this case we're

122
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,280
taking our curve and we're taking it and

123
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,360
we're stretching it from the from

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,160
vertically and we end up with this nice

125
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,039
horizontally compressed vertically

126
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:22,440
stretched blue

127
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,199
curve now the exact same concept applies

128
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,120
to compressing vertically so if I were

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
to take uh something of this sort so if

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,319
I were to just take like this red marker

131
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,440
and just this isn't exact unfortunately

132
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,360
uh because uh I mean of course I'm not a

133
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,000
computer I can't uh get perfect uh

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
however this is uh a quite close uh

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,000
imagination of how this curve would look

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,440
compressed so again the way we're doing

137
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
this is imagine we have our curve again

138
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
and we take it from both the top and the

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,479
bottom vertically and we compress it

140
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,120
vertically of course the sides will get

141
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,520
stretched out and so this is a

142
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,560
horizontal stretch but vertically we are

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,080
compressing this red curve we're

144
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,880
compressing this black curve this o

145
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,720
curve uh in order to get the red final

146
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,280
compressed

147
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,080
curve all right so now uh let's actually

148
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,639
try something else so before I get uh

149
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,840
into sorry uh before I get into rotation

150
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,720
now we're going to be talking about

151
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,080
rotations in a second but let's take

152
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,360
talk a little bit about

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,880
well

154
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Reflections

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,919
so all right so Reflections what are

156
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,840
they uh well you know what this is best

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
explained with an example so let's take

158
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
an example uh let's say I were to draw a

159
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
little triangle here okay if I would

160
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
just uh finish this up so now we got

161
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,720
ourselves a nice little triangle uh and

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,120
so it's uh more towards the right than

163
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,400
it is up so it has more of an x value

164
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
than it does a y value and so let's say

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,840
we wanted to reflect this on the X AIS

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
of our coordinate space all we do is

167
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,319
negate the Y value sounds weird because

168
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,919
this is our x value right over here this

169
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,879
is our horizontal x value uh and so what

170
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,960
we have to do is negate the Y value in

171
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,400
order to get our reflected uh shape or

172
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Point uh and so in this case let's just

173
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,199
say uh I were to roughly calculate here

174
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,560
uh we would end up with something around

175
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,960
here uh and then here and then like this

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,319
this is what would happen if we were to

177
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,599
reflect and technically if I had a piece

178
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,240
of paper and if I were to do it on a

179
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
piece of paper and if I were to fold the

180
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,599
paper in half along this x AIS then the

181
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,840
these two should be perfect perfectly

182
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
symmetrical this should be able to

183
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,199
overlap right on this perfectly if I've

184
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,520
reflected it nicely uh however if it's

185
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,840
even a bit off should but technically a

186
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,919
reflection would be completely

187
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,919
symmetrical on that axis uh and then

188
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,560
again the same concept applies to this y

189
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,840
vertical axis we've got here so what we

190
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,319
would do is let's say we wanted to

191
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,120
reflect this on our y vertical axis

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,639
quite simply all we need to do uh is of

193
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,039
course take this axis uh and uh of

194
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,240
course with the X axxis in order to

195
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,519
reflect on that we negate the Y value so

196
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,200
in order to reflect on the y axis we

197
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,240
negate the x value and so of course all

198
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,320
we need to do uh negate the x value and

199
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
say just um approximate this here uh it

200
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
would end up around somewhere uh here

201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,040
is so again not perfect uh but this is

202
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,120
around where it would end up if I were

203
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,200
reflect on the Y AIS and again if this

204
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,120
was paper not AA solid whiteboard uh

205
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
then I could just you know fold this in

206
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,440
half and I should be able to see this

207
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,279
overlap perfectly onto this uh our

208
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,839
original shape or our original Point uh

209
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,560
and it should be perfectly symmetrical

210
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
uh of course though I'm not a machine so

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,079
I wouldn't be able to do that but now

212
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:21,959
I'd like to get into the main reason of

213
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,839
why I'm creating this video today

214
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,440
rotations and so without any further Ado

215
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,160
let's get right into rotations so let's

216
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,360
begin now again another thing I'm going

217
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,440
to be doing today uh is actually going

218
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,880
to be able to show you uh not just how

219
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,519
you can you know use those classic old

220
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,760
methods of rotating your notebook around

221
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,839
and doing all that sort of stuff instead

222
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm going to be introducing you to a

223
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,120
generic algorithm that'll be that'll

224
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,200
allow you to calculate the coordinates

225
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,720
uh of how you could rotate a shape

226
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,959
counterclockwise or clockwise not just

227
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,320
about the origin but another point which

228
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,519
I will get to in just a second so now

229
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,920
before we begin uh I have to uh show you

230
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,040
something so of course we know what the

231
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,480
origin of our coordinate spaces the

232
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,880
origin would be right over here okay uh

233
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,839
and the origin is our zero zero point

234
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,880
okay now our this this is our origin

235
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,240
okay we agree this is the very center of

236
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,800
our coordinate space and let's just say

237
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,560
uh I were to draw a rectangle

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,000
or Square really any shape or even a

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,880
point on this coordinate space now let's

240
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
just say and you know actually in order

241
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,000
to help me do this I'm going to use my

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,480
uh trusty string so this is going to

243
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,560
help me rotate and so again this is one

244
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,200
of those classic methods right using one

245
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,320
of these strings or a compass or

246
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,399
rotating a notebook or the wax paper but

247
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,959
today I'm going to be showing you how

248
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,480
you can actually calculate those

249
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
coordinates but uh what I'm going to be

250
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,920
showing you on the Whiteboard here today

251
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,360
uh is just generally that this is a

252
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,120
rotation if I were to take my marker uh

253
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,839
say okay let's say this point we want to

254
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,519
rotate now let's say we want to go

255
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,079
counterclockwise about the origin quite

256
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,240
simply that's all we need to do and now

257
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,160
this is how we can go

258
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,360
counterclockwise uh over in this

259
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
direction uh that's how we can rotate

260
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,360
counterclockwise about our origin uh

261
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,000
however if I wanted to rotate clockwise

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,600
almost the same drill we just take that

263
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,120
little origin again uh I'm just going to

264
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,320
put that on the origin and then that

265
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
would be how we rotate clockwise about

266
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,720
the origin now that's quite simple but

267
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,519
it's not fun right and so of course I'm

268
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,800
going to be showing you how you can just

269
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,959
take those coordinates and calculate how

270
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,639
to rotate at 90° clockwise or

271
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,279
counterclockwise however something else

272
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,760
very very interesting that I'm going to

273
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,800
be getting into in just a second is

274
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,360
let's say we were to have another point

275
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,440
over here and and we were to label this

276
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,839
point B okay now this is a point in our

277
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
coordinate space what if we wanted to

278
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
rotate this same shape or point or

279
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,800
anything um about point B but not the

280
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
origin and so if we wanted to rotate

281
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,600
clockwise what would we do well I'm

282
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,839
probably going to have to covered this

283
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,480
just give me a second well I'm just

284
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,360
going to again use my string and this is

285
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,480
one of those old classic methods I'm

286
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,760
just going to do this and so this is how

287
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,000
we would go clockwise uh if we wanted to

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,800
rotate about point B right and we're not

289
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,360
rotating about the origin and if I

290
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,040
wanted to go

291
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,240
counterclockwise then it's again almost

292
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
the exact same thing uh all I do is put

293
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
the marker there uh take my string over

294
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,399
to point B uh and

295
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,560
then go over here okay so we have to

296
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,680
keep going in that direction uh and so

297
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,120
of course today I'm going to showing you

298
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,199
how you can rotate both clockwise and

299
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,720
counterclockwise about the origin and a

300
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,839
point about another point for in this

301
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,639
case point B uh on your coordinate space

302
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,279
and you'll be able to rotate anything a

303
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,519
shape a point anything and so of course

304
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,519
I'm very excited to get into a more

305
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,839
detailed explanation of rotations

306
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,800
themselves anyway though thank you for

307
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,760
the watching this whiteboard part let's

308
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,639
get right back into an actual in-depth

309
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,399
explanation of rotation themselves let's

310
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,199
get to it shall

311
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,480
we all right so welcome back to this

312
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,680
explanation part now and again we're

313
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,279
talking about Transformations and again

314
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,560
in this video specifically I'm talking

315
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,360
about rotations but if this video gets a

316
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,920
lot of you know support and people like

317
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,839
it and people want to know more about it

318
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
of course I will create more tutorials

319
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,920
uh on many different topics in

320
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,399
Transformations uh you know the

321
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,160
translations the stretching and

322
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,839
compression compression uh our

323
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,199
Reflections that type of stuff I'll be

324
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,079
I'll be creating videos about all that

325
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,880
sort of stuff uh if this video gets uh

326
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,600
you know a lot of uh support uh and

327
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,639
people actually want uh to know more

328
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,519
about this topic but anyway let's begin

329
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,480
so now as you can see in front of you

330
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,560
I've drawn a grid now in order to show

331
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,079
you what a rotation would be on a

332
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,279
coordinate uh you on a coordinate uh

333
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,160
space or coordinate um uh one of those

334
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,360
coordinate spaces we need to draw that

335
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
out so let's actually draw out one of

336
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,320
these coordinate spaces all right so as

337
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,160
you can see we've got four quadrants uh

338
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,600
and we've got our positive y our

339
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,240
negative y our Negative X and our

340
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,560
positive X and each one has their own

341
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,040
quadrants uh and so let's actually label

342
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,000
uh the origin of this uh coordinate

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,800
space uh which is0 0 in the middle you

344
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,560
know just uh in between everything uh

345
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,360
very middle everything uh and let's draw

346
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,160
Let's uh Mark a point on this coordinate

347
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,240
space uh which is 62 all right so this

348
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,920
is a 62 position 6x2 y so we are

349
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,600
essentially moving six in as X six

350
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,680
towards the right and two up as positive

351
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,000
2 y okay uh now let's say we wanted to

352
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,279
rotate this 90° clockwise how would we

353
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,199
do that well I'm going to give you a

354
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:29,120
quick uh sneak peek into the future and

355
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm just going to give you the answer

356
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,079
right now the answer is 2 -6 okay we

357
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,759
rotate 6 2 90° clockwise we're getting

358
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,040
to

359
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,880
26 but how how is that possible well let

360
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,800
me show you let's draw a line with zero

361
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,680
y uh sorry with zero y but 6X so we're

362
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,720
drawing a 60 Line This is a blue line

363
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,560
and as you can see uh if uh we have uh

364
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,120
now as you can see all of these uh all

365
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,160
of these quadrants that we have here

366
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,920
these four quadrants are at right angles

367
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,079
and so if we were to rotate this blue

368
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,720
line 90° clockwise quite easily we could

369
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
say that it would end up here but this

370
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,759
still doesn't really prove how we could

371
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,040
have uh 62 trans you know rotated 90°

372
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,319
clockwise to 2 -6 how does that work

373
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,000
well let's put the this line back and

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,560
let's draw a latch from 62 to this line

375
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,240
another blue

376
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,120
line and now let's rotate this line 90°

377
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,199
clockwise and as you can see it ends up

378
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,480
at 2

379
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,759
-6 in fact in order to prove that this

380
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,639
is 90° we can actually draw lines

381
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,560
between them and as you can see the

382
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,440
angle here is 90° so it has been proven

383
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,279
that we have actually rotated this 90°

384
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,600
but actually Let's uh continue this

385
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,120
right let's say let's say we were to

386
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,839
again draw this line and put a latch to

387
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,199
2 -6 let's rotate this another 90°

388
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,839
clockwise all right we get to -6

389
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,199
-2 now again we can draw this line and

390
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,760
we can see that we have a 90° rotation

391
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,839
and we can do this once more and we get

392
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,880
to

393
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,199
-26 again we can draw this line and we

394
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,720
see that's another 90° but this is 270°

395
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,840
of course we went from 62 that's 190°

396
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,880
then we've got 180° then we rotated

397
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,000
270° from 62 to -26

398
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,919
clockwise and so after 3 after sorry 270

399
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,600
in order to get to 360 so a 360°

400
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,960
rotation is a full circle we know that

401
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,799
so if we were to have 62 and we were to

402
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,760
have a 360 degree rotation uh from 62

403
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,240
clockwise or even counterclockwise we

404
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,039
would reach back back at

405
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,280
62 and after 270 we get immediately if

406
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,320
we had another 90

407
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,679
360 and so in theory if this blue line

408
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
hits 62 again that means that we have

409
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,840
actually rotated

410
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,440
360° and that we have actually rotated

411
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,440
90° every single time and so as you can

412
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,240
see it does and if we draw this line you

413
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,880
can see that indeed we have been

414
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,200
rotating 90° clockwise every single time

415
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,559
we went from 62 to 26 to 66 -2 to -2 6

416
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,080
and then 360° back again to 62 and this

417
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,400
was all done in a clockwise

418
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,120
way but okay so this is great but how

419
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,000
would this really help us this is no

420
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,480
different than you know as I was saying

421
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
those classic techniques we need an

422
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,520
algorithm or some sort of pattern so

423
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,159
let's actually take a look at what this

424
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:00,480
pattern is so as you can see pattern we

425
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,400
have we begin with postive 6

426
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,840
pos2 now in order to get to the next uh

427
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,120
the next uh rotation the next rotation

428
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
the next 90° clockwise rotation what we

429
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,559
need to do is first of all we have to

430
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,159
have a negator okay and we also have to

431
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,159
have and what we're going to do

432
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,240
essentially is we're going to swap as

433
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,240
you can see we went from 62 to 2-6 and

434
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,880
so we're going to to

435
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,480
swap the six and the two but what we're

436
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,000
also going to do is we're going to make

437
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
it so that while the six the x value is

438
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,600
moving into the Y value into the Y

439
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,120
position we're going to negate it to

440
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,400
make it

441
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,679
A6 and so the positive2 over there the Y

442
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,200
value that's going into X that remains

443
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,559
intact the sign remains intact however

444
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,000
the positive six that goes into the Y

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,159
value that's currently X that goes into

446
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,480
y gets negated to -6 and we end up with

447
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
our

448
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,039
coordinate now another thing I'd

449
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,000
actually like to draw your attention to

450
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,559
uh is just before we continue with our

451
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,559
pattern if you take a look over here we

452
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,400
have 62 and we have -6

453
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,520
-2 now these two uh coordinates uh

454
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,559
what's happening is when you have uh

455
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,880
these when we have 62 which is on our

456
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
which is one of the Quant if we were to

457
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,679
move it diagonally if we were to reflect

458
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:34,480
remember when I explained Reflections in

459
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,360
the beginning if we were to reflect it

460
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,280
exactly diagonally to the to the to its

461
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,280
diagonal um quadrant we would have it uh

462
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,240
exactly uh placed diagonally and as you

463
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,200
can see if we just negate the six and

464
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,760
the two we have 6 -2 and it's placed

465
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,600
perfectly uh at a 180° angle uh from uh

466
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
clockwise or counterclockwise uh anyway

467
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,440
from 62 and that proves again that we've

468
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,240
been rotating 90° every single time but

469
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,480
continuing with the pattern though so

470
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,840
now we've got positive 2 -6 let's see if

471
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,200
the same pattern that we applied to POS

472
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,679
6 pos2 applies to this as well so let's

473
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,840
say we swap and negate the x value while

474
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,880
it's going to Y as you can see we end up

475
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,559
with -6 -2 because the -6 value its sign

476
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,760
stays intact while going over to X how

477
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,360
however the posit 2 gets negated while

478
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,240
going over to Y and we end up with -6 -2

479
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,000
which puts us at 18 180° angle with that

480
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,559
other quadrant over there which is a 90°

481
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,760
turn which is 90° uh rotate however from

482
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,760
positive2 -6 now again we put the same

483
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,679
pattern into play uh we have the Y value

484
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,760
going to x uh sign stays intact the X

485
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,960
going to Y uh it's it gets negated and

486
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,600
we end up with -2

487
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,000
pos6 because of course uh -6 negated

488
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,360
would be pos6 so now continuing though

489
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
let's say we were to put this again now

490
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,240
as you can see with -26 we've done as I

491
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,320
said a whole 270° of

492
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,760
rotating and if this pattern continues

493
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,159
again with 26 -26 sorry and we're able

494
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,919
to get 62 that means we've done a full

495
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:29,640
360 degree rotation and every single

496
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,480
time we rotated 90 Dees so let's

497
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,640
see positive 6 will remain intact while

498
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
going over to X from y but the negative

499
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,720
-2 will get negated to positive2 while

500
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,279
going over to the yv value and we end up

501
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,760
with POS 6 pos2 and we have made a full

502
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,520
360° rotation with this pattern which

503
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,120
proves that it actually does

504
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,600
work now let's actually take a look at

505
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,559
the algorithm though sure we've gotten a

506
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,240
pattern but what's our final algorithm

507
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,120
of how we can actually rotate uh a point

508
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,400
90° uh by from the origin well it's as

509
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,799
simple as this we have our original

510
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,799
starting point let's say positive 6

511
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,840
positive2 are positive X and positive y

512
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,600
values we essentially have the X going

513
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,360
over to the Y spot and getting negated

514
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,600
whereas the Y goes over to the X Spot

515
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,000
while keeping its sign intact

516
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,840
and we end up with positive y Negative X

517
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,200
because the negative X was

518
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,159
negated now you must be wondering though

519
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,640
sure we can you know apply this to

520
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,159
points but what about shapes how can we

521
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,240
rotate shapes from the origin well let's

522
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,480
put this simply all you need to do is

523
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,039
let's say you have a triangle with

524
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,200
points a b and c well what you do is

525
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,679
exactly that You' label those points and

526
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,960
you'd find their positions in the grid

527
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,799
what you do is You' actually rotate each

528
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,039
point individually using this algorithm

529
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,120
once you've done that and once you've uh

530
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,159
labeled those rotated points you're

531
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:11,159
going to connect those points just like

532
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,679
you would uh for creating the shape and

533
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,440
of course you have your shape that has

534
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,559
been rotated 90°

535
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,480
clockwise all right so that's the

536
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,919
algorithm for this but you know this is

537
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,720
nice and all we're rotating from the

538
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,880
origin but let's say we want something

539
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
more complex more fun

540
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,200
well what if we wanted to rotate from a

541
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,480
point that's not the origin sounds weird

542
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,080
doesn't it but let me explain so we have

543
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,200
this blank grid here again this blank

544
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,679
coordinate space and we have our origin

545
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,840
label as 0 0 and we have a red dot that

546
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,679
we want to rotate we're going to label

547
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,000
this as 1315 because that's its position

548
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,840
on the grid that is relative to the

549
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,880
origin

550
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,159
but now let's say we have a black dot

551
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
okay and we label as black dot 912 which

552
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,760
is its position relative to the

553
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,039
origin and we wanted to rotate this red

554
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:13,919
dot not from the origin but about this

555
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,640
black dot how would we do it well first

556
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,320
of all let's begin by drawing a circle

557
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,399
and let's talk about the algorithm let's

558
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:25,480
Dive Right In so to begin we have 13 15

559
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,559
now again we are not rotating about or

560
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:32,279
relative to the origin that's supposed

561
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,360
to be about the black dot and so in

562
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,960
order to do that we need to find the red

563
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,120
Dot's position with respect to that

564
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,760
black dot in

565
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,000
912 and so what we do is we subtract

566
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,279
that 912 value from 1315 and this

567
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,799
results in 43 POS 4 pos3 and this is our

568
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,559
final value which is actually you know

569
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,320
the 135

570
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,919
position according or sort of uh in

571
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,120
respect to the 912 Dot and so what this

572
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,919
means is of course the 4X 3 Y and so

573
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,440
this means that we're going four to the

574
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,960
right and three up that is our position

575
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,080
that is the red Dot's position uh like

576
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,520
relative to that black

577
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,679
dot and so what we can do now is use our

578
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:27,399
classic algorithm that we're so used to

579
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,960
we can swap these values and negate the

580
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,919
X going to the Y and we end up with pos3

581
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,399
-4 but wait a minute we have our

582
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:39,480
algorithm output that we've been using

583
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,799
for so long

584
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,159
now but this is not the value of 1315

585
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,279
rotated 90°

586
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,440
clockwise remember how we factored in or

587
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,760
we found 131 15's location relative to

588
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,080
that black dot well yeah we encode ened

589
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,840
that so I guess you could say encoded

590
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,880
it's not technically encoding but uh

591
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,440
quote unquote if you will uh we have

592
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,919
encoded uh 1315 with that 912 location

593
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,200
and we got

594
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,720
43 and so now we need to take this

595
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,360
location that this location that we've

596
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,039
got this coordinate pair and decode it

597
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,600
and we're going to put this on the side

598
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,240
okay so we don't mess up our current

599
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,360
coordinate pair uh and in order to

600
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,039
decode it well quite simply we just add

601
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,440
back the 9 and 12 this results in 1208

602
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,240
and in order to prove to you that 1208

603
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,240
is in fact that 90° uh that we've uh

604
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,840
rotated from

605
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,679
1315 on about the 912 well let's put

606
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,240
that on the grd uh sorry the grid and

607
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,480
let's label it as you can see that is

608
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,279
our 128 point and that is how we were

609
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:57,440
able to rotate 1315 90° clockwise about

610
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,960
the 9 12 or black dot Point instead of

611
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,279
the

612
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,240
origin that's pretty interesting but

613
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,120
let's say we wanted to continue we've

614
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,640
done 90° but let's do

615
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,000
180° which is 128 but another 90°

616
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,200
clockwise how do we do that well again

617
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,760
we're using the same uh positive3 -4

618
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,159
value that we got from our algorithm and

619
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,080
we're going to run the same classic

620
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,399
algorithm again the Y value going to X

621
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:29,360
will stay the the same not stay the same

622
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,120
the sign will stay intact whereas the x

623
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,200
value going to the Y will be negated and

624
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,720
finally we get -4 -3 but again we need

625
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,799
to decode it and so what we do is we

626
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,480
bring it to the side we add 912 and we

627
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,159
end up with

628
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,080
509 and using this value we can put that

629
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,960
on the grid label it and as you can see

630
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,480
that is indeed 90° clockwise from 128

631
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,640
and

632
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,120
180° from the clockwise uh from

633
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,000
1315 and then again that is about the

634
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,159
912 and not from the origin let's

635
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,240
actually continue this pattern once more

636
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,120
and we end up again with

637
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,840
-34 if we take this to the side again

638
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,559
decode it with a 9 and 12 and we end up

639
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,120
with 616 we put that on the graph and we

640
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,720
label it and as you can see

641
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,440
we have that 90° turn again so now what

642
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,320
we've done what we've done is we have a

643
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,480
90° clockwise turn from 59 about the 912

644
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,559
which is

645
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,080
616 but it's 180° rotation from 128 and

646
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,519
it's a 270° rotation from

647
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,279
1315 and so again we apply the same

648
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,399
algorithm as we did last time if we can

649
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,200
take 616

650
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,399
and apply our same algorithm in order to

651
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,360
rotate at 90° clockwise that would mean

652
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,880
from 1315 it should be

653
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,000
360° and since 360° is a perfect circle

654
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,960
that means we should end up with

655
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,279
135 and so we run our algorithm again

656
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,640
the positive4 sign stays intact and it

657
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,240
goes from y to X and negative3 sign gets

658
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,120
negated to three and goes over to Y and

659
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,519
as you can see we end up with 4

660
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,000
pos3 and that is the same value we got

661
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,399
when we took pos3 pos5 minus postive 9

662
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,279
pos2 we got 43 and now we got 43 again

663
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,159
and so there's no doubt that if we take

664
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,240
it to the side add 912 again we get

665
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,080
135 as our final result and as you can

666
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:57,120
see we have rotated 13 15 360° clockwise

667
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,279
about the point 912 not the

668
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,120
origin now this is pretty nice isn't it

669
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
how we were able to take something that

670
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,720
was so frustrating and simplify it down

671
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,159
into one

672
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,159
algorithm but we're not quite done yet

673
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:15,240
there's still one more

674
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,159
step what if we wanted to take all of

675
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,880
this and we wanted to condense it into

676
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,679
one final algorithm how would we do

677
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:27,559
it well let's say we have two different

678
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,639
algorithm one to rotate a point

679
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:34,039
clockwise and one to rotate a point

680
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,200
counterclockwise let's begin describing

681
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,320
how this would work well again this

682
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,799
isn't going to be about the origin it

683
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,200
could be about any point it could be

684
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,240
about the origin it could be about uh

685
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,880
another Point really anything and so we

686
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,880
have this red dot uh that we want to uh

687
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,399
that we want to rotate okay and we're

688
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:56,240
going to say its location is XP YP that

689
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,360
is the red dots location and this is

690
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,600
what we want to

691
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,080
rotate and this is one of the inputs

692
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
that both of our algorithms will

693
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,559
take but then we also label the the

694
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,760
black dot and this black dot is what we

695
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480
want to rotate about now this black dot

696
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,080
could be the origin it could be where

697
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,039
the black dot currently is it could be

698
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,600
any place or any location on this

699
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,679
coordinate

700
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,159
space and we're going to label this

701
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,039
black dot as XO and

702
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,639
yo then what we're going to do is we're

703
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,519
going to take this uh this black dot and

704
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,880
what we're going to do is again just

705
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,760
like we did just a few seconds ago we're

706
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,159
going to take XP and YP and we're going

707
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,000
to subtract XO and yo from XP and YP

708
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,720
just like we did as I said a few seconds

709
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,840
ago and this is going to happen in both

710
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,039
of the algorithms and we're going to end

711
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,799
up with a result that I like to call X1

712
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,639
and y1 and this is where the algorithms

713
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,880
start to defer a bit uh and so what

714
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,480
going to happen

715
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
is uh let's just put our negators here

716
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,760
and so just like last time again what

717
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm saying is we're using the same

718
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,360
algorithm uh we are essentially uh for

719
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,159
the clockwise one at least we're taking

720
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:11,720
X1 and we're putting it into the Y's

721
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,799
position while negating it so the

722
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,320
positive X1 becomes a negative X1

723
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,519
whereas the positive y1 switches over

724
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,799
with the X's position while keeping its

725
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,880
sign

726
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,399
intact however on the counterclockwise

727
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:26,919
side now I mean you've already seen the

728
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,840
clockwise side that's pretty you're fam

729
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,559
you're pretty familiar with that but

730
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,120
let's talk about

731
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,399
counterclockwise on the counterclockwise

732
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,600
side we were essentially able to take

733
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,639
the positive y1 value and we're

734
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:40,519
essentially doing the exact opposite

735
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,679
thing that we would do for clockwise we

736
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:45,279
are taking the we're taking the positive

737
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,679
X1 and we're swapping it with the Y

738
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,880
position all right we're doing that but

739
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,080
we're not negating we're keeping its

740
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,399
sign intact whereas we're taking the

741
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,000
positive y1 and we are of of course

742
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,960
swapping it out with the X position and

743
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,039
negating that instead so we end up with

744
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,080
negative y1 and positive

745
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,079
X1 and so finally as you can see we're

746
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,560
doing the exact opposite thing for the

747
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,720
counterclockwise algorithm than we are

748
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,800
for the clockwise algorithm and this

749
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,960
allows us to end up with our result now

750
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,839
again we have actually

751
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:25,359
found the location of the 90°

752
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,879
rotated uh point this Red Dot 90°

753
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,320
rotated we found its uh location

754
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,359
clockwise or counterclockwise but this

755
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:37,760
isn't our final location but why well

756
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,639
again I mean you should probably

757
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,440
remember this it's because we were we

758
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,280
did not yet decode it because of course

759
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,240
we found the red dots

760
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,280
location in you know with respect to

761
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,040
that black dot and so now what we need

762
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,320
to do is make it back in respect to that

763
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,560
uh Middle Point that origin

764
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,839
and so what we need to do is we need to

765
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,560
add XO and yo back to our result and we

766
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,720
should finally get an XA value a ya a

767
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,760
value uh for our clockwise algorithm and

768
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,680
an XB value and a YB value from our

769
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,160
counterclockwise algorithm and so of

770
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,880
course from our clockwise algorithm as I

771
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,440
said we get that XA and ya a uh which

772
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,320
which is our final 90° clockwise rotated

773
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,520
algorithm uh or Point uh and of course

774
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,440
from the counterclockwise algorithm we

775
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,839
get XB and YB which is the final point

776
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:37,560
of where uh we uh which is the final

777
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,800
Point uh of our 90° counterclockwise

778
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,560
rotation and that was all there was to

779
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,680
this video of course I really hope you

780
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,040
