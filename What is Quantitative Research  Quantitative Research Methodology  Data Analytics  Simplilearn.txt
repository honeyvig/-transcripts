quantitative research is the systematic
analysis of measurable data and the
application of statistical mathematical
or computer methods with the use of
sampling techniques and the distribution
of online questionaries polls and
surveys quantitative research gathers
data from current and potential clients
now that we understood what is the
definition of quantitative data let's
discuss what are we going to discuss
today
we will we have already discussed about
what is quantitative research method
examples of quantitative research after
that what are the methods in
quantitative research and what are the
characteristics of quantitative research
advantages and disadvantages coming to
example a poll of teenagers was
performed to examine the effect of using
mobile phone on kids young people and
teenagers between the ages of 15 and 30
make up the survey sample
while the youngsters are being educated
via their mobile devices they are also
being spoiled because of the content is
inappropriate for young children so the
topic of whether it is Advantage is to
offer mobile phones to children or not
was posed by 150 respondents of whom 100
were men and 50 were women the response
includes the seven point scale option
with seven denoting a strong agreement
six with agreement five with mild
disagreement neutral agreement and three
with moderate disagreement one with
strong disagreement so this is how a
quantitative survey is conducted this
data helps to gain insight into the
societal mindset and gain conclusion
according to that let us take up another
example every firm that wants to conduct
customer satisfaction survey can do so
by using customer satisfaction template
using the this type of survey a company
can gather quantifiable in information
and metrics on the perception that the
customers have of the brand or company
based on a variety of factors including
product quality cost and customer
experience regardless of the types of
research there is always one thing
common in every type of research that is
data data is omnipresent let me convey
how simply learn can help you to master
it please check out the course on data
analytics in collaboration with IBM with
real-time projects and business case
studies link is given in the description
box below enroll now now comes important
types of quantitative research first is
correlational research survey research
descriptive research and experimental
research let's learn every one of them
in detail first is correlational
research in order to create a connection
between two related things and asserting
how one influences the other
correlational research is used a
researcher will need at least two
different groups to do this although
this kind of research doesn't not go as
far as to analyze the various patterns
it will be able to spot Trends and
patterns in the data survey research the
most basic tool for all quantitative
research methodology is survey research
there's research primary goal is to
comprehensively explain the traits of a
specific population or group of
populations both small and large
businesses frequently use this study to
comprehend their clients needs and
opinions of their products and
merchandise the
research the goal of descriptive
research is to describe how a variable
is currently behaving descriptive
research seeks should describe and
interpret the current state of
individuals environments customers
circumstances or events and the last one
is experimental research as its name
implies experimental research typically
relies on one or more theories it is
predicated in one or more theories known
as real experimentation and it applies
to scientific method to determine the
cause and effect link between a number
of study related variables moving on to
quantitative research characteristics
first is structure tool what is
structure two structure two such as
surveys polls or questionaries are used
to gather quantitative data using such
structured methods helps collecting
depth and actionable data from the
survey responding
second is sample size quantitative
research is conducted on a significant
sample size that represent the target
market sampling methods have to be used
when deriving the sample to fortify the
research objective
measurable data typically non-numerical
forms such as tables charts and graphs
are used to portray quantitative data
this makes it simple to comprehend the
information that has been gathered and
to demonstrate the reliability of the
market treason these are the main
characteristics of a quantitative data
so what are the advantages of using
quantitative research first is Swift
data collection quantitative research
looks at a sample of people who
represent a wider population information
from these participants is gathered
using a survey or another quantitative
research technique the application of
statistics facilitates and exhilarates
the process of data analysis and pattern
Discovery scope of data analysis this
study approaches or allows for a broad
range of data acquisition because of
statistics
gather and collect reliable data what do
you mean by that the results that are
produced through data analysis and
presentation in numerical form are quite
reliable they provide a clear accurate
and honest representation of the study
that was actually done quantitative
research is done in circumstances when
this researcher forces the controversy
the quantitative technique allows
researchers to concentrate on a
particular population wide fact that
they want to explode this approach is
also helpful when a number of data
points are highly sought after by a
specific population it is a procedure
that enables us to comprehend the social
context of the motivation guiding our
choices activities or behavior these are
the advantages now let's concentrate on
disadvantages of quantitative research
this approach disregards the
significance of social phenomena a
specific hypothesis can be proved or
refuted using the quantitative approach
replies to specific queries it is
unconcerned with the reasons behind why
people Express their opinions or make
decision
sometimes it can be misleading many
individuals believe that quantitative
research is more trustworthy or
scientific than observational
qualitative research since it is based
on numbers both type of study here I
mean qualitative and quantitative
research nevertheless have the potential
to be falcious or biased
more expensive this process is very
expensive compared to qualitative
research creating data for independent
research or surveys are highly expensive
we have already made a video on
qualitative research please check out
that people are frequently hired by
researchers to help with the process of
gathering and evaluating the data even
gaining access to enormous databases and
protecting secondary data can be costly
researchers who employ the quantitative
abroads must proceed under the
presumption that every response they
receive from service test and
experiments are not alive it's very
difficult to predict right as there are
no face-to-face interactions while using
this method interviewers or researchers
cannot evaluate the validity of each
outcome after learning quantitative
research one thing is for sure that it
has many applications so what are the
applications
it is used in Psychology economics
demography sociology marketing health
and development gender studies and
political science
by definition in mathematical Sciences
such as physics is also quantitative
however the context in which the term is
used here is different that's all about
quantitative research I hope you enjoyed
