hello everyone and Welcome to our spring
boot restful API tutorial at simpa in
this comprehensive tutorial we will be
exploring building a powerful restful
API using spring boot which is a Java
based backend framework whether you are
a beginner or an experienced developer
this tutorial is going to walk you
through the essentials of creating the
rest API we will cover topics like your
how to create project structure defining
controllers implementing service classes
managing repositories and finally we are
going to test our API now before we move
on and learn more about it I request you
guys that do not forget to hit the
Subscribe button and click the Bell icon
so now let us discuss our agenda for our
today's session so guys we are going to
start with an introduction to Spring
Boot and restful apis next we'll be
moving ahead with setting up our spring
boot project then we are going to define
the data models and entities moving
ahead we will also be implementing our
control layer and finally we are going
to conclude our session with developing
the service layer craving a career
upgrade subscribe like and comment
below dive into the link in the
description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back just a quick info guys you can
accelerate your career as a certified
Java fullstack developer and acquire
essential industry skills such as react
angler spring spring board hibernate and
jsps while mastering MVC and web
services to craft highly scalable web
applications hurry up now and join the
course the course link is mentioned in
the description box so guys let's start
with what is spring wood guys spring
boot is an open-source Java based
framework which is developed by pivotal
now it's a p of viare that simplifies
the process of building and deploying
Standalone production ready spring based
applications it aims to a streamlined
way to set up string based applications
with minimal configuration which allows
developers to quickly bootst their
project and focus more on writing
business logic rather than setting up
infrastructure now let us discuss the
key features of spring boot first one we
have all over here is convention over
configuration spring boot uses sensible
defaults and conventions to reduce the
amount of configuration required this
means developers can get started with
minimal
and Frameworks will automatically
configure many aspects of the
application based on these conventions
second one is Standalone springboard
applications are designed to be
Standalone and selfcontained meaning
they can be deployed as executable jar
files with embedded application servers
like tomat jety or under or even as a
files in traditional subet containers
third one is auto configuration spring
boot provides Auto configuration which
automatically configures the application
based on dependencies present in the
class path this eliminates the need for
manual configuration in many cases as
spring boot can automatically detect and
configure components such as data
sources messaging systems and web
servers fourth one is spring boot
starters spring boot includes a
collection of starters that simplifies
dependency management by bundling
commonly used libraries and Frameworks
for specific use cases for example web
applications data access security into
easy to ous dependencies developers can
simply include these starters in their
project and spring boot will
automatically configure the necessary
dependencies fifth one is actuator
spring boot actuator provides production
ready features to Monitor and manage the
application in production environments
it includes end points for health checks
metrics environment information logging
and many more which allows developers to
easily
and manage their applications sixth one
is spring boot CLI spring boot CLI
allows developers to quickly prototype
and develop spring boot applications
using command line interface it provides
commands for creating running and
testing spring boot applications without
a need for complex build configuration
overall spring boot simplifies the
development process of spring based
applications by providing a set of op
defaults like Auto configuration and a
range of tools and features that enables
developers to build robust and
production ready applications with
minimal effort now we will move to the
eclipse and create a simple rest API so
guys in this tutorial we are going to
build a rest API you might be wondering
what a rest API is first of all Let Me
Explain you rest API stands for
representational State transfer
application programming interface it is
a kind of a service architecture which
is designed to allow communication
between different systems over the
Internet it follows the principle of
rest which emphasizes stateless
communication uniform resource
identifiers for resource identification
and use the standard HTTP methods like
get post put and delete for performing
action on resources so guys let us build
an employ CPI with controller entity
service and repository classes in Java
so let me explain you what will be the
class files the first one will be the
entity class in the entity class guys we
are going to Define our model for
example in employee rest API what are
the main things that we are going to
need for example the name of the
employee the department and what are the
salary then we will be using the
repository interface so guys you will be
wondering why would we need a repository
class guys basically repository class is
responsible for interacting with the
database or any storage mechanism for
performing C operation which means
create read update and delete operations
on the database the repository class
abstracts away the details of data
access by providing a clean separation
between the data layer and the rest of
the application it allows for easier
testing and maintenance by centralizing
data access logic second one we have all
over here service class service class
contains the business logic of the
application it trates various operation
coordinates between different components
and performs complex business rules and
validation service class promotes
separation of concerns by keeping
business logic separate from web layer
and data access layer it enhances code
readability reusability and testability
by encapsulating the application score
logic in a single place finally we have
the controller class the controller
class handles the incoming HTTP request
processes them and
appropriate responses it typically
contains methods or end points ma to
different U and HTTP methods defining
API Behavior but why do we need it the
controller class acts as entry point for
external clients to interact with the
application it receive request delegates
the processing to the service layer and
returns responses it helps in achieving
clean separation of concerns by keeping
the web related logic separate from the
business logic and the data access logic
I hope so you have got a brief idea
regarding these classes now let us make
these classes so what we have to do
first guys let us go to Spring
initializer this is a website where we
are going to download all our
dependencies we'll be needing spring
data jpa and spring stter web so let us
add the dependencies so here I'm going
to type
spring web okay just add this dependency
and add the next one that
is spring data
jpa okay now our project building tool
will be M just click on this and let us
choose 3.1.1 version because I'm using
Java 17 so I feel so the older version
of spring board would be compatible with
it now let us update our meta data so
let's say com. example. rest API or let
us give some other name such as
employee and here also we are going to
type
employee now let us generate the zip
file and let us extract this ZIP file so
I'm going to go on my downloads so we
can see all over here we have the
employee zip file just click on this and
click on extract all now go to downloads
and you can see our employee file has
been extracted now we'll be going to the
eclipse okay and here we are going to
import our project so you can see this
option all over here just click on mavin
okay so you can see this is mavin and
click on existing mavin projects just
click on next so it is going to tell you
to browse the root directory go on to
the downloads as you know we have
downloaded all over here and just select
this folder and click on finish now as
you can see we have download our folder
and it is visible all over here you can
see all these files such as Java
resources and test let me explain you
each one of them one by one so this is
our main application file and you can
see in a spring boot application you
would get this annotation as spring boot
which tells that hey Spring this is a
spring boot based application and which
is basically build on the spring
framework now let us go to the resources
and the resources you get app properties
in this generally we add lot of other
things such as we can customize our port
number if you using the mySQL database
we have to also add all the other
information such as your username
password okay similarly for testing we
have SRC test. Java the most important
file to understand is pom.xml file guys
this is pom.xml file this file tells the
apach m to download all the necessary
dependencies such as the spring data jpa
spring start web the test there's a
Marin plugin okay so you can see these
are all closed under the dependency
section and you can see also the version
of java we are using we are using Java
17 and you can see all our metadata has
been stored all over here and it is very
very important file for our project now
let us create our other files so we are
going to go on Main
and let us open this file and let us run
this file first so guys you can see all
over here that it is telling it is
failed to run so sometimes you're going
to get this error the reason is we have
already added the spring data jpa
dependency and because of that it is
showing the error no worries let us move
forward and let us create all the other
classes first so let us go into the
package let's create a new package all
over
here so here
say this is
entity
and let's create the
class let's click on
finish similarly we going to create a
repository
class
[Applause]
similarly we are going to create our
controller class
sh
and finally we are going to create our
service
class have
all these classes all over here now let
us start writing some of the codes to
understand what we are going to do so
basically as we have discussed that we
are going to create our model first so
let us click on the entity okay this is
our employed. Java so let us consider a
scenario where we are creating a simple
rest API so for employee we need its ID
name and what department they working in
okay guys
so let us create certain annotation for
the same so this will be our entity
class so we are going to use the entity
annotation
okay now here let us create the ID okay
now ID would be there at
theate
generated value
and here we are going to add the
strategy equals
to generation
type do
identity now let us declare our Fields
so first would be ID and access modifier
would be
private
next one would be name
so third one would be Department we can
also keep this access modifiers as
private
and let us uh choose for salary as
double
okay that would be our data type for it
and finally let us create the
constructors and get inserters you could
see there are errors coming up so in
order to remove the error just H upon
this and you could see we have to import
certain things now earlier it was Java X
persistence now we are importing entity
from Jakarta that is a slight change
that has happened all over here let's
click on entity this is ID type import
ID and here for Generation value here we
are going to import it from Jakarta
persistence now our all errors are
removed now let us do one thing just
click on
source
and you could see generate Getters and
Setters select all and click on
generate next thing is we have to also
generate Constructors so click on Source
generate Constructors using fluids click
this option and click on generate so you
could see all over here we have
generated all our Constructors so this
is the constructors which is all
automated okay this is a of eclipse and
this is the gets and Setters so finally
we have created our model now let us
move to the next part that is repository
so guys earlier I have told you that why
do we need repository class the reason
is because it is very very responsible
for interacting with the database or any
data storage mechanism it typically
performs all the CR operation and that's
why we need to create this class so let
us delve into the repository section and
and here the line of code is very Less
in this section just you have to extend
this to the jpa repository so this is
basically an interface so I did one
mistake all over here let us create an
interface for this
first Okay click on interface and it
will be
employee
repository click on finish okay okay
this is done now public interface
employee repository and this is going to
extend the jpa repository basically jpa
repository has all the pre-built tools
this is basically an interface which is
going to help us give us all the methods
and functionalities for interacting with
any database so let's type
extends jpa
Repository
this will be
employee the name of
our model and here will be type would be
long now you have to import this so let
us import this and also you have to
import the employee so finally we have
imported all the things we are going to
leave it empty all over here uh for the
sake of purpose but there are certain
additional methods which we can do it
but we going to stick to the minimal
right now now let us create the service
class just click on all over here and
how spring is going to understand that
this is a service class so the answer is
guys service annotation let us type that
annotation okay this is employee service
and now we are going to use one more
pattern that is called dependency
injection
so guys we all know that this framework
is basically working on dependency
injection we are going to inject the
repository inance of repository all over
here and so for spring to understand
that we have injected we are going to
use an annotation that is
autowired
so type Auto
wir
and I'm going to type
private employee
[Music]
repository and just we can type ER all
over here okay now let us import this
okay next we are going to also import
the auto finally we have also imported
the employ repository and is instance
now we are going to do certain things
all here and the first thing is let us
create a list of employee to get all the
employees
so public
list employee and here we are going to
type get all
employee and basically it is going to
return
do find all method from the
repository now let us import
this list first
okay and here we are going to import the
employee
okay
basically this method is going to return
details of all the employees next if you
have to find the ID of a particular
employee so for that
purpose
Public
Employee
get employee by ID
method and here we are going to use data
type as
long and with the help of this instance
ER so we're going to
return er do find by ID
method
so the parameter would be ID and here we
can use or also or
else we could enter as
null if the employee doesn't
[Applause]
[Music]
exist
for
[Applause]
for
sh
sh
now next would be adding the employee so
guys for adding the employee we are
going to create this method same so I'm
not going to type it all over
again let's copy and
paste so Public Employee and and let's
say add employees so method would
be and we are going to create an
instance all over here of
employee
okay now here we are going to
ER Dove
method okay we're going to save this
entity and just add the instance e all
over
here and finally we have a method for
updating the
[Applause]
employee
so it will be long
ID and we can create an instance
employee and say
e and we can do certain conditionals all
over here so if the given employee
exists by its ID so we can do something
like this er do exist by ID so we can
see this this method is there just click
on this and
uh after this what we have to do guys we
can set its ID so click on all over here
so e
do set
ID and it will be ID and finally let's
add the return statement for
this return er do save
and the entity would be
e so that works pretty fine all over
here
now let us see what the error is coming
up now it works pretty fine and finally
we are going to add a delete
method okay
so public
void
delete
employee data type would be
long and it would be
ID so er
dot we can say delete by ID method
so can we see the method so here is a
method delete by ID just click on this
and it works pretty
fine
now
let us make this code a little bit
correct or we can say return
null
okay so finally guys after a lot of hard
work we have created our service
class guys if you are doing for the
first time please don't be afraid lot of
mistakes are going to happen
but we all know the fact that uh the
more mistakes we are going to do the
more we are going to learn so uh let us
move forward with the next and the final
one we have the controller class now in
the controller class we are going to add
all the HTTP verbs like get put delete
so that in the service class what are
the Logics we have added we can access
it on the URL so let us go to the
controller class
and finally we are using AR rest
so let us Put The annotation as rest
controller import
this
okay finally let's uh do the uh okay
since this is rest controller okay now
let us create a request mapping
tool so that when we are mapping the
given URL so our URL would be/ employee
okay okay now let us import this request
mapping
okay now finally what we will do we are
going to also inject the instance of
service
[Music]
so we going to type the
autowired okay and here would
be
private employee
service and we can create the instance
as
es okay so let us import this service
and let us import the auto wired okay
now let us do the get mapping first
so
get
mapping and how we going to get a
particular employee so the answer is
with its particular ID and
here let us type slash and with respect
to its particular ID we are going to
access the given employee let us create
a method for the same so
Public
Employee so basically it is going to be
a list
so
okay get all
employees return es that's the instance
we have injected from the service class
and the method would be get all
employees now it's done but it's still
showing certain errors let us resolve
the error first we have to import the
list second we have to import the
employee okay and finally we have to
import the get mapping from or spring
framework. web bind
annotation okay now initially I have
told you certain features about spring
wood and I hope so you would be seeing
that how our development is getting
easier little by little so most of the
thing uh like you would have seen like
when you were in college basically you
would have thought like we have to do a
lot of coding but actually coding is
reduced a lot because here in this ID is
a very smart ID okay and we can just
import the things one by one and all the
methods you could see it's it's suggest
so that makes our work pretty easy now
let's create a post request and uh at
the rate post
mapping and here will be
Public
Employee
and say add
employee so for adding
employee we going to type the request
mapping okay this is a parameter
so requesting the body okay is this
annotation tells that uh hey Spring
whenever we are posting any post request
to the web server uh we need a body
without that this request is incomplete
so for that this annotation is used and
finally we are going to add the employee
so return e is. add employee and the
instance is e that we have created all
over here now let us import certain
things so we have imported the post
mapping let us import the request body
annotation and finally let us close it
with a
delimiter now let us create the put
mapping
so for put mapping this would
be
slid and here the method would be
Public
[Applause]
Employee say update
employee
and for updating a given employee
suppose I have added the name as say uh
Neil and say department is uh you can
say sales and um and the salary is
around like 30,000 but finally there's a
program happened and the designation has
been changed okay now he has moved to
the marketing road so for that what we
are going to do we have to update that
particular uh you know the data for that
employee in order to do that guys what
we are going to add so we are going to
add the particular path for which this
update is going to happen and for that
there's a particular annotation that is
path variable so just add the path
variable and here the data type would be
long ID and they are also going to
request
the body all over
here pretty fine so at theate request
body
annotation so because without body this
request would be incomplete so basically
for updating uh any data we use the put
request okay so request body annotation
and the instance would be
employee and
sayp not say
e
and finally we are going to call our
update service so return
es do
update employee ID
okay and the instance we have injected
is a so that makes our work pretty
easier now let us import so we have
imported the port
mapping path variable and and is pretty
much
done now finally we are going to create
an annotation for delete
mapping and it would be
ID so for deleting we are going to use a
delete method so public void
delete
employee and here will be the path
variable let us use
annotation and we going to call the
return
statement
so you can see this method pops up just
click on this and let's close this okay
now let us import delete
mapping okay I think there something
wrong has
happened let us debug
it return
es
Dot
delete given employee by its
ID so guys we have come to the final
part of the video now let us run our
application so in order to run the
application you have to just select all
and you can type run as Java application
or you can directly click all over here
so guys I've already started my
application and my application is
running okay okay we can see certain
failure so let us rerun the
application so guys you can see all over
here our server has started now let us
test our apis so what we are going to do
we are going to go at this Postman which
is the API testing tool and for this
port 81 we are using and our endpoint is
employees so let us try to add one
employee so remember guys for sending a
post request you have to always add a
body so you can see I will add one name
okay
say son vanand and he's
a
and I'm going to
add okay now for the headers you have to
add application. Json it will be content
type and you can also add a description
now let us try to send this request so
you can see our ID is automatically
generated and name Johnny vanand
department and salary has been added now
guys as you can all over here after
triggering the get request we could see
we are getting ID name as one named as
Johnny vanand and department is musician
and the salary so all the data which we
have added using the post request we are
returned now this is simple and basic
rest API we have created using spring
boot I hope so you would have enjoyed
