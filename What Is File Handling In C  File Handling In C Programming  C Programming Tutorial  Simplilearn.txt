hey guys welcome back to another video
by simply learn in today's video we're
gonna be learning all about file
handling and see but before we begin if
you haven't subscribed to our channel
already make sure to hit the subscribe
button and the bell icon to never miss
an update
so now without any further delay let's
begin
this session will help you to understand
what file handling in c is
then fine handling operations and
functions associated with it
and finally the file opening modes in c
so now let's begin with what is file
handling in c
as we all know to maintain or organize
the data we use files to understand in a
better way wi-fi handling is used let's
consider an example of our program's
input and output so what happens is that
we store value in the variables and that
data will be stored for time being in
grammar the data will be lost whenever
the program is terminated or when the
system is switched off
so when we want our results to be stored
permanently in the secondary device we
use file handling functions
this means that the data is stored in a
file using a program known as file
handling
the main objectives of the file handling
are to create
read write and update the files
in file handling a file pointer is used
to fetch and access the file in the
program to perform operations on it in
general a file pointer is a variable
used to reference the files in the
program
in c programming we declare variables to
hold a value right for example in ta
comma b
this means the variable a and b hold a
value of type integer
similarly in file handling and c the
declaration is pi
asterisk and followed by file pointer
name
in the following declaration file acts
similar to data type which means that
the file pointer variable is of the type
file
in file handling every file is
represented with a unique file pointer
variable to access the file and perform
certain operations
the general syntax to open a file is
file asterisk and followed by the file
pointer name
then to open a file we use the function
if open and specify the file name and
import which will be assigned to the
file pointer variable all right
now let's have a look at the file
handling operations in sync
to do any operations on the file we
first create a file and then perform
operations
but if the file already exists we open
an existing file and perform the task
and once after the creation or opening a
file we read from a file
or write to a file or if required we
perform both the operations
and the next operation we have is to
move a file to the specified location
if required we can move a file otherwise
the last operation is to close the file
so whenever we open a file it's
compulsory to close the file
therefore we have a set of functions to
perform operations on the file
so now let's see what those file
handling functions are
we have so many functions to handle
files and see but in this session we
will understand a few basic and
important functions
and the functions are given below
as discussed before to perform any
operation the first thing is to open an
existing file and then perform the task
so basically if open function is used to
open an existing file and if the file is
not present in the system it will return
a null
the following function we have is f
close
whenever we open a file and complete the
operations on it finally we must close a
file
in addition to this there is a limit to
opening many files at a time so the
unnecessary files must be closed when
the task is completed
next fprintf function is similar to
printer function as we all know printf
function is used to print the output or
we can say it is used to print the
result on the console
whereas fprintf function is used to
write values in the specified file
up next we have f scanf function which
is similar to scanf function
again we know that scanf function is
used to take inputs from the user
whereas f scan a function is used to
read data or information from the
specified file next we have f puts and
fgts function used to write and read
strings from files respectively
following we have f6 function so
whenever we want to write or read
something on a specific part of the file
we need to set the pointer to that
particular position and to do this we
use f6 function
then we have rewind function that is
used to set the current position to the
start of the file that means the pointer
is set to the beginning of the file
and finally we have remove function
hence the remove function is used to
delete the file
so i think you got a good understanding
of all the file handling functions of c
okay so let us move on to the file
opening modes of c language
these opening modes specify on what
basis the file is opened for example
suppose you want to write something on
the file we open an existing file using
f open function and specify the mode
either to read or write the file and
that is done using the following file
opening modes
first let's start with mode r it is used
to open existing text file to read only
and mode w creates and opens the file
for writing but if the file already
exists then it will overwrite its
content
next is yeti which is used to append the
data at the end of the existing file
append is nothing but adding up the data
for writing only
then rt plus where r stands for reading
and t stands for text file so this mode
opens the existing file to read and
write
next the wt plus
this mode creates and opens the file for
reading and writing but if the file
exists it will overwrite the content or
empty the content of the existing file
and then eap plus we'll append the data
at the end of the existing file and open
it for reading and writing
following we have rb where b stands for
binary files so basically it is used to
open an existing binary file for reading
only
wb
this mode is used to create and open an
existing binary file for writing
a b mode appends at the end of the
existing binary file
next rbplus opens an existing binary
file for reading and writing wb plus
creates and opens a binary file for
reading and writing and finally we have
eab plus
this mode is used to append to the end
of the existing binary file for reading
and writing so now let's have a look at
the declaration
let's see how the functions and modes
are used in file handling
for the file opening operation we have
the following declaration file and
followed by file pointer name the
pointer variable will contain the
address of the file structure so as
discussed before to perform any
operation on the file we must open a
file so for that we have the f open
function assigned to a file pointer
variable
specified with the file name and remote
so in this example the file is open to
perform the write operation
the following declaration is based on a
reading of file therefore if scanf
function is used to read from a file we
can also use the f gets function
next
write a file
so first we open an existing file and
specify the file name and the mode w
that is the right mode
the fprintf function is followed to
write data on a specified file
finally
after performing the operations on the
file we must close the file and to close
the file we use fclose function the
function parameter is the pointer name
now let us understand this operation
using a simple program
if getting your learning started is half
the battle what if you could do that for
free
visit skill up by simply learn click on
the link in the description to know
more
in this program we're gonna perform the
write and read operation so for that
let's first open a file named file1.c
and the next step is to write on the
open file
and once we write the content into the
open file we're gonna read from the file
and at last we will close the file so
now let's run it
enter the file content
okay
and once you write the data into the
file the next step is to read data from
the file
reading content of your file hey guys
welcome you all to simply learn and it's
printed successfully
so now let's open the file and see if
the data is written into the file
so this is the file and it's written
successfully
so with this we have come to the end of
this session on the file handling in c
programming i hope this session was
informative and interesting until next
time thank you stay safe and keep
