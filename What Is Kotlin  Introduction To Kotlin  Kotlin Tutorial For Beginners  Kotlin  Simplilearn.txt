hey guys welcome back to another
tutorial by simply learn
in this session we will be learning what
is kotlin kotlin is widely used for
android development and is used by more
than 60 percent of the professional
android developers for their projects
so let's go ahead and understand what is
kotlin
so we will start by why kotlin language
then what is scotland then we will
understand the history of courtney
language then we will move to its
features and uses
and at last we will cover the companies
that uses kotlin language
but before we begin

so why kotlin
kotlin is one of the fastest growing and
widely used programming language
in may 2017
google announced it as an official
language for developing android
applications
after this announcement the jobs for
kotlin increased in large numbers
since then the job openings for kotlin
gets doubled every three months as per
dice
it is very easy and friendly language
also it is quite easy to maintain and
debug this language
which is why it is a good language to
start with
kotlin has a bright future as it is
being widely used for android
development companies like google
netflix pinterest are some of the
companies using kotlin
so being a kotlin developer will boost
up your career growth
now coming to what is scotland
kotlin is an open source statically
typed language designed by jetbrains
it has both the features of object
oriented programming and functional
programming
kotlin is interoperable with java that
means both the languages can share and
use the information and just like java
compiler the kotlin compiler also
generates the byte code which can run on
jvm
also we can say kotlin is kind of java
with some added features
even the java libraries can also be used
in kotlin project
although java is a really cool language
the developers of kotlin focused
more on simplifying the code and
increasing the transparency
now let's learn some history of the
scotland language
the development of the kotlin language
was announced in the year 2011.
in 2012 the first web demo of kotlin was
released along with the new logo and
became an open source
then in 2014
kotlin lang.org was released along with
some features to increase the
interoperability with java
in the year 2015 some new features were
added like the companion objects
multiple constructor etc
after a quite long development process
kotlin 1.0 version was released in
february 2016.
it was developed by jetbrains in russia
the developers of jetbrains were fed up
with the repetitive code so they wanted
a much modern language
but the problem was most of their code
was already written in java and
switching to some other language would
create a bigger headache for them
so the team decided to create a language
which is compatible with java and with
all the features they wanted
so then they created the kotlin language
in the year 2017 google announced the
first class support for kotlin on
android
later kotlin 1.2 was released with
features like sharing code between jvm
and javascript
after that
various versions were released like
kotlin 1.3 in 2018
kotlin 1.4 in 2020 kotlin 1.5 in 2021
etc
now
moving on to features of kotlin language
the first feature is
kotlin language can be used on multiple
platforms which reduces the time that is
spent on writing and maintaining the
code on different platforms
kotlin doesn't depend on virtual machine
on the target platform
next is kotlin has some modern features
like null safety which is a feature to
reduce the problems associated with the
null references
then the lambda function which is an
anonymous function
and the smart casts which are used to
track conditions inside the f expression
next is in kotlin language there are
many extensions
which allows us to add the functionality
without inheriting from the class or any
decorative pattern
this feature makes the code easy to
maintain and read
now coming to another feature of kotlin
which is
in kotlin functions can be passed as
parameters to the function
that means function act as a variable
and just like the variable it can also
be passed
it is also known as higher order
function its functionality is to do two
things first to take the functions as
parameters and second to return a
function
next feature is
kotlin is compatible with java
it is fully interoperable with java and
you can convert the java file to the
kotlin file with just a script
also it works on jvm and java libraries
work fine on kotlin
next is
in kotlin there is a data class
a data class is that class which doesn't
perform any operation
and only contains state
the advantage of this class is that it
provides self-generated code and avoids
the implementation of methods within the
class
now
coming to uses of kotlin
kotlin is used in web development it is
compatible with java and also
much easier to work with
also kotlin works fine with spring and
some other frameworks
which makes it an easy replacement of
java when it comes to web development
is
kotlin is used in data science as well
because of its features like null safety
statically typed maintainable code and
also being a language which runs on jvm
makes scotland a good choice for working
with the data
next is it is used for android
development
after google has announced kotlin as the
first class language the user's interest
in cotton language elevated to a great
extent which resulted in creating a
large community of android developers
going for kotlin
this language allows the developers to
write more expressive and concise code
and its interoperability with java is
one of the main attraction to choose
this language
with google statement not only the
android developers but also the app
development companies are opting the
kotlin language
similar to these uses there are many
more uses to the cotton language
but now let's move on to its
applications
so we'll start with google
google widely uses the kotlin language
not only they have declared it as the
first class programming
but they also use it in their production
code
google also implemented kotlin in more
than 60 applications
such as google home
google maps google drive
google pay
google sheets etc
similarly airbnb which is an american
company that operates online marketplace
for lodging and home stays to vacation
rentals also uses kotlin language for
their android frameworks
mvrx for a seamless experience
other companies like zometo which is
india's largest food delivery company
also uses kotlin for the android app
which has helped them to reduce the
lines of code and made the code a lot
more concise
next is netflix
netflix is world's leading streaming
service also use the kotlin language to
rebuild their ui player for the android
app of netflix
next is uber
the american mobility company uber that
provides services like food delivery
ride hailing package delivery couriers
etc uses kotlin language because of its
popularity for android development and
its interoperability with java
so these were some popular companies
that uses the kotlin language
similar to these companies there are
many more companies like pinterest
tinder slack etc that uses this language
now let's have a look at what we have
learnt so far
in this video we spoke about why kotlin
language what exactly kotlin is then
history of kotlin language and some of
the features and uses of kotlin language
and at last we have covered the
companies that uses cotton language
and with that we have reached to the end
of this video
