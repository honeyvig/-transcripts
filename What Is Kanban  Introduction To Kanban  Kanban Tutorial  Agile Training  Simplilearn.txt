do you know that a brilliant Industrial
Engineer at Toyota taiichi Uno got
inspired by supermarkets that
revolutionize the way we think about
workflow it's like grocery store of
efficiency only restocking what's needed
and when it's needed and they call it
Canan and it's not just about
manufacturing it's a game changer in
optimizing processes across the board

let's start with what is Canan all right
imagine you're running a kitchen and you
have got different dishes to prepare
ingredients to manage and chefs working
on different tasks now think of Canan as
your super organized kitchen and the
Canan world you have cards for each dish
representing task these cards move
across your whiteboard in different
columns such as to-do in progress and
done each column signifies a stage in
the cooking process if a a chef is
whipping up a lasagna the card starts in
too and when the order comes in as they
start cooking it moves to in progress
and when it's ready to serve it lands in
the done column the magic here is guys
that you can see everything at a glands
no chaos no guessing and if a chef
finishes one dish and has capacity they
can grab another to-do card it's like
dance of efficiency Canan isn't just for
kitchens it's actually a project
management philosophy whether you are
developing software planning events or
organizing a team project Canan helps
things flowing smoothly it's about
visualizing work limiting work in
progress and maximizing the efficiency
now let us say what is a technical
definition of Canan Canan is an
organizational approach designed to
enhance the teamwork and productivity
and it employs visual representations of
project workflow CL offering team
members a clear understanding of where
their tasks fit in in the broader
context the visual display ensures that
the entire team has transparency in the
workflow aiming to eradicate duplication
and unnecessary efforts while promoting
continuous delivery now let's move on
and discuss the history of Canan during
the early 1940s in Japan Toyota
Automotive faced stiff competition from
its American count parts and sought to
enhance the efficiency of its production
processes a critical challenge was the
substantial and costly accumulation of
stocked inventory including raw
materials and unfinished items and any
items remaining in the inventory instead
of progressing to the next production
stage or reaching the final customer
were deemed wasteful in response to this
challenge taiichi hunu an Industrial
Engineer at Toyota Drew Inspirations
from supermarkets observing that
supermarkets restock products only after
customers have purchased most of the
available item Ono envisioned applying a
similar principle to Toyota's production
change he proposed that the rate of one
production process should determine the
demand for preceding process through the
entire chain to implement this concept
visual signals in the form of cards were
introduced to trigger specific actions
for instance an empty raw materials
container with a card would signal the
need to replenish those raw materials
these visual cues became the basis for
the term Canan symbolizing a system
where visual signals guide and optimize
the flow of production processes now
let's move on and discuss about the
principles of Canan the first thing is
start with what you know start by
looking at what you are currently doing
that's where Canan comes in handy it
values your existing processes at the
beginning of a project experts in change
management use Canan ban to figure out
any issues affecting how things are done
can banss help you check your workflow
roles job titles communication and
everything this way you can make things
work better save money and pinpoint
areas for improvement because Canan
makes things clear you can track how
your changes pay off over the time and
see the impact of making things better
this transparency also makes it easier
to work with other managers and teams
they can quickly understand why changes
are needed making collaboration smoother
the next is agree to pursue incremental
and evolutionary change continuous
Improvement is a crucial idea in Canan
much like agile and scrum methodologies
all three share the practice of bringing
about changes gradually and steadily in
small steps this approach is valuable
because it reduces disruptions and makes
the entire changes process easier to
handle implementing big changes can be
tough and might face resistance
internally Senior Management could worry
about the cost and project teams might
fear that altering how they work would
affect their productivity Canan is aware
of this Challenge and highlights the
importance of making small and
continuous improvements over the time
this way it acknowledges the need for
manageable and incremental CHS to
overcome the potential obstacles and
resistance within an
organization the next is respect the
current process roles responsibilities
and titles respecting existing practices
is the key to emphasizing that Canan
won't cause excessive disruptions or
entirely overhaul established ways of
working especially if those methods are
effective this instance position scan b
as a cooperative and collaborative way
to enhance exist existing processes
without fundamentally shaking up how an
organization operates this approach is
quite crucial for gaining support for
Canan especially in environments where
teams are attached to the established
practices it proves especially helpful
in larger organizations where changes
tend to be slower and there are more
people to convince of the benefits of
adopting Canan by being respectful and
considerate of the current operating
models Canan Bec becomes an approachable
and adaptable solution for organizations
aiming to improve without causing
unnecessary upheaval the next is
encourage the acts of leadership at all
the levels in your organization Canan
puts a spotlight on collaboration
allowing anyone in the team to set up
and tackle a problem thanks to the
transparency it offers every team member
should feel confident in taking action
backed by a solid data this support
culture empowers team members to take
initiative Embrace risks and experience
growth both professionally and
personally in essence can ban Fosters an
environment where everyone has the
opportunity to contribute make decisions
and Thrive now let's move on and discuss
about the six Canan practices unlike the
time constraint structure of agile
methodologies like scrum which follows
strict schedules with defined Sprints
can man operates using a pull system
this means that work begins only when
there is a demand for specific
deliverable evolving from this principle
David Anderson wrote five properties
where we can identifying the following
six Canan practices so you can see there
are three things on the Canan board the
first one is too the next is in progress
and the third thing is done okay so now
you can see how the can ban operates so
here you you can see a small simulation
of the Canan board now let's move on and
understand about the six Canan practices
the first thing that comes up in my mind
is visualize the workflow and business
risk boosting visibility in your
workflow is essential for pinpointing
areas that require enhancements Canan
board act as a visual representation
showcasing the status of work items
what's in progress what's is done and
what hasn't started this visual aid
enables you and your team to comprehend
the journey from request to completion
identifying areas for optimization in
your workflow think of Canon boards like
project dashboards aiming to provide
maximum visibility in an easily
understandable format the concept is to
present information clearly much like a
digital Canan board in team Hood the
second is limit work in progress the
ultimate aim of employing Canan board is
to optimize the project projects by
eliminating unnecessary time and
resource wastage key to this efficiency
is the implementation of Canan work in
progress limits these limits are
critical as they Define the maximum
workload allowed in a workflow work in
progress limits functions by putting a
cap on the number of work items that can
be in progress simultaneously this
establishes a pull system ensuring that
new tasks are only initiated when there
is sufficient capacity to handle them
on a Canan board work in progress limits
are visually represented as numerical
values assigned to different statuses or
columns thus providing a clear
indication of the workload constraints
at the each stage of the workflow this
approach streamlines processes prevents
overload and promotes a more controlled
and efficient project progression next
is manage the flow the Canan board
serves as a visual tool to track the
movement of work from one column to the
next thus emphasizing the flow of task
through these columns brings attention
to the potential bottlenecks this
approach empowers managers to
concentrate on smoothing out
interruptions in the standard flow and
identifying areas that may require some
additional Resources by actively
managing the flow the next is manage
flow the Canan board serves as a visual
tool to track movement of work from one
column to the next emphasizing the flow
of task through these columns which
brings attention to the potential bottom
legs this approach empowers managers to
concentrate on smoothing out
interruptions and the standard flow and
identifying areas that may require
additional Resources by actively
managing the flow teams can enhance the
overall efficiency and address issues
promptly to ensure a smoother
progression of task the next one is make
policies explicit Define publish and
share what your processes and policies
are this ensures that everyone on your
team comprehends how work is conducted
and what goals are by establishing
Clarity you can guarantee that everyone
is aligned when proposing improvements
this approach also contributes to
maintaining objective and dispassionate
team discussions preventing emotions and
subjective viewpoints from unduly
influencing the decision-making process
next is implementing the feedback loops
the canman method promotes small
continuous incp mental and evolutionary
changes as I have told you earlier
determining these necessary changes
relies on establishing reliable feedback
loops in Canan feedback is collected at
various project stages whether during
meetings delivery operational activities
or risk reviews the specific points for
collecting input and the frequency are
typical tailored to Project's nature and
what works best for your team this
flexible approach ensures that feedback
back is consistently integrated thus
allowing for informed and adaptive
adjustments throughout the project next
is improve collaborated and evolve
experimentally collaborative Improvement
and the ongoing Evolution stand out as a
fundamental principles in Canan David
Anderson who wrote a book on the six
Canan principles in his books
underscores the significance of Team
proposing a shared knowledge and a
unified understanding of problems he
advocates for adoption of scientific
model encompassing experimentation
analysis and continuous Improvement
Anderson suggest that exploring
established models such as the theory of
constraints theory of profound knowledge
and the lean economic model implementing
one of these proven models facilitates
the measurement of outcomes and help
mitigate the risk associated with change
by incorporating these models into Canan
approach teams can systematically ident
identify constraints deepen their
understanding of problems and
methodically work towards effective
solution this scientific model driven
mindset enhances the adaptability and
success of Canan driven
initiatives now the biggest question
comes up in our mind that is when to use
Canan Canan is particularly well suited
for various scenarios and environments
here are some situation where using
Canan can be highly effective the first
first one is continuous workflow Canan
is excellent for processes with A
continuous flow of work where task don't
fit neatly into fixed iterations or
Sprint the next one is variable
workloads in situation where workloads
fluctuate and priorities may change
frequently can Ban's flexibility allows
teams to adapt it swiftly the next is
service oriented task can ban is widely
used in service oriented Industries
where work items are often unique and
require diverse skill set next one is
the visual management if I talk about
visual management visualizing work and
creating transparency in the workflow
are priorities can bance visual boards
make it easy to understand the status of
task at a glance next is continuous
Improvement if I talk about continuous
Improvement can bans emphasis on
incremental changes and feedback loops
make it well suited for environments
that prioritize continuous Improvement
and
evolution next is if there comes an
unpredictable work when work items are
unpredictable and arrive sply can Ban's
pull system ensures that team only take
on the new task when they have the
capacity to the next one is maintenance
and support when your project needs
maintenance and support in that case you
can use Canan ban and finally if there
is parallel development going on along
with some other task then applying Canan
can be amazing solution to your project
management now in conclusion if I have
to say something Canan stands as a
versatile and effective methodology
which is well suited for dynamic
environments requiring adaptability and
continuous Improvement its emphasis on
visualizing workflows managing flow and
implementing small incremental changes
Fosters efficiency Canan applicability
to various industries from service
oriented task to parallel development
projects makes it a valuable tool for
the teams who are seeking flexibility
and transparency by encouraging
collaboration shared knowledge and
scientific approach to problem solving
Canan facilitates not only project
success but also a culture of continuous
Evolution and Improvement thank you guys
