Liam a 19-year-old freshman recently
joined an Ivy League College to study
history and political science while
reading about thinkers and Scholars of
the early 20th century he stumbled upon
a name Alan T Liam was fascinated by
Allan and realized that the computer
that he knows of today Allan is
considered to be the father of modern
computer science that eventually led to
the invention of his computer but there
was something that was even more
fascinating about Allan although Alan
Turing was famous for his work
developing the first modern computers
decoding the encryption of German Enigma
machines during the second world war he
also built a detailed procedure known as
the touring test forming the basis for
artificial intelligence Liam had his
mind blown by this fact he realized that
AI is not a modern phenomenon but rather
more than a thought experiment existing
since the early '90s
leam used AI tools like chat GPT
perplexity and consensus on a daily
basis for his research he had a
smartphone that he used for multiple
tasks like using Siri or Google
Assistant to find local food places
using autocorrect of multiple apps like
Instagram and WhatsApp and even AI photo
editing features
he realized that AI has seeped into
almost every aspect of his life for
making trivial decisions like where to
have his morning coffee to complex AI
tools like chat GPT for his research to
even his father self-driving Tesla that
he used whenever he got a chance to
artificial intelligence or AI in the
21st century has become a very subtle
technology that exists in every human
life without them even realizing it but
what is this AI does this mean robots in
a completely dystopian AI warlord future
not really let us dive a little deeper
into understanding everything about AI
artificial intelligence or AI is like
giving computers the ability to think
and learn much like humans do imagine
teaching a friend how to solve puzzles
and then that friend can solve different
types of puzzles on their own AI Works
similarly it helps computers understand
and Carry Out tasks that typically need
human intelligence these tasks include
recognizing faces and photos chatting
with us through smart assistants like
sir or Google assistant and even driving
cars think of AI as a smart helper that
makes our daily lives easier it can
learn from data make decisions and
improve itself over time this means that
AI isn't just about robots taking over
the world it's more about using smart
technology to assist us in various ways
making complex tasks simpler and
everyday routines smoother AI has found
its way into many areas of Our Lives
often making things easier without us
even realizing it in healthcare for
example AI helps doctors by quickly
analyzing medical images like x-rays to
detect issues faster than the human IM
in finance AI Works to keep our money
safe by spotting unusual activities in
our bank accounts that could indicate
fraud when you stream shows on Netflix
AI suggests movies and series based on
what you've watched and liked before in
retail AI manages stock and predicts
what items will be popular ensuring that
store shelves are filled with what
customers need even in our homes AI is
at work through smart devices like
thermostats that learn your schedule and
adjust the temperature automatically or
lights that turn on when you enter a
room AI touches so many parts of our
daily lives making things more
convenient and efficient one of the best
AI applications today which is very
widely known and used is chat GPT an
advanced AI developed by open AI that
can chat with you just like a human
would imagine having a friend who knows
almost everything and can help you with
any question or topic that's what chat
GPT does but how does it work chat GPT
is powered by something called a
Transformer model this is a type of
machine learning model that learns
patterns in Language by looking at a
vast amount of text Data from books
websites and other sources think of it
like reading millions of books and
remembering important information from
all of them when you ask chat GPT a
question it doesn't just pull out a
random answer instead it looks at the
words you used understands the context
and predicts what a good response would
be based on what it has
learned for example if you ask about the
weather it understands you are looking
for current weather conditions and gives
you relevant information if you ask it
to help with homework it draws on its
number knowledge to explain Concepts
clearly chat GPT uses a process called
Deep learning which is a bit like how
our brains work it breaks down sentences
into smaller parts and looks at how
these parts fit together this helps it
understand not just the meaning of
individual words but also how they
combine to convey a complete idea this
is why chat GPT can handle complex
questions and give answers that make
sense
to make sure it provides useful and
accurate information chat GPT was
trained on a diverse range of
topics this training helps it recognize
and generate text on anything from
Science and History to entertainment and
daily life it's like having an
encyclopedia and a friendly tutor rolled
into
one similar to chat GPT there are a
plethora of other tools and applications
being developed every day that are
trained for various purposes using Vari
kind of data sets for example doll e
which has been traded on a de First Data
set of text and images from the internet
stable diffusion which has been trained
on a variety of images and corresponding
text descriptions Tesla autopilot which
has been trained on sensor data from
Tesla vehicles and driving data and so
on and so forth AI is a remarkable
technology that holds great promise for
the future offering solutions to some of
the world's most pressing challenges
imagine a future where AI takes care of
routine tasks giving us more time to be
creative and focus on what we love AI
can help in many ways from improving
Medical Treatments to making our daily
lives more
efficient however it's essential to use
use AI responsibly this means creating
guidelines and rules to ensure AI is
developed and used in ways that benefit
Everyone by embracing Ai and
understanding its potential we can look
forward to a future where technology and
human creativity go hand
inand AI is not just about smart gadgets
it's about opening new possibilities and
making our world a better place the
future of AI is bright filled with
opportunities for Innovation and
progress helping us achieve things we
never thought possible
