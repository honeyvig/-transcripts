hi everyone welcome to Simply Lear have
you ever noticed how WhatsApp says every
message is end to endend encrypted but
do you really know what that means when
you send a message on WhatsApp it says
it's protected by end to end encryption
but what does that actually mean for
your privacy we'll find this out in this
tutorial and in today's world data
security is more important than ever for
example did you know that in 2020 or 37
ion records were exposed in data
breaches imagine all your private chats
emails and files being open for anyone
to see scary right that's where end to
end encryption or E2 comes in it's a
technology that keeps your communication
safe from prying eyes even big companies
like WhatsApp signal and proton mail use
E2 to make sure only you and the person
you are talking to can videoo messages
in this tutorial we'll dive into what
endtoend encryption is how it works and
why so crucial for your privacy let's
get started and learn how E2 keeps your
Digital Life
secure craving a career upgrade

description to FastTrack your Ambitions
whether you're making a switch or aiming
higher simply learn has your
back and before we start guys just a
quick info for you if you are an
aspiring C C security professional
looking for online training and
certification from the prestigious
universities and in collaboration with
leading experts to enhance your
credibility then search no more simply
learns postgraduate program in cyber
security from Mi University in
collaboration with EC Council should be
your right choice for more details you
can use the link in the description box
and B comment so let's get started so
let's get started with what is
encryption so encryption is like turning
your data into secret code to prevent
unauthorized access so imagine you're
sending a postcard with a message to a
friend and that message could be hello
how are you so anyone who handles the
post card can read what's written on it
or if you're sending a message through a
social media messenger app that can also
be read but with encryption this message
is transformed into something unreadable
like the secret code that is shown on
the screen so this coded message looks
like giberish to anyone who intercepts
it only someone with the right key can
turn it back into the original message
so think of the key as a special decoder
ring and without this ring the message
remains a jumble of random characters
this ensures that even if someone
intercepts your data while it's being
sent over the Internet they can't
understand it an encryption it is used
everywhere in emails messaging apps
online shopping and banking to keep your
personal information safe from prying
eyes and it's like sending a postcard
inside a loged box that only you and
your friend can open so now we will
understand what is end to end encryption
so end to end encryption or E2 that
ensures that only the sender and
receiver can read the messages imagine
you are sending a secret note to your
friend you put the note inside a log box
and only you and your friend have the
keys to open it as the note travels from
you to your friend no one else can
unlock the box and read it not even the
mailman with end to end encryption your
message is encrypted on your device
before it sent this means it turns into
a code that can't be read by anyone else
the encrypted message travels securely
over the internet and can only be
decrypted by the friend's device which
has the right key to unlock it even the
service providers like the company that
runs the messaging app can't access the
encrypted data this way your
communication stays private and secure
just between you and the person you're
talking to so now we'll see how end to
end encryption works so end to end
encryption uses a system of public and
private keys to secure messages so now
we'll see the public key encryption so
this is when you want to send a message
and your device uses the recept an's
public key to encrypt it imagine you
have a special Lo that anyone can use to
lock a box but only you have the key to
unlock it the public key is like this
lock anyone can use it to encrypt a
message but only the intended recipent
can decrypted with your private key and
then comes the message transmission the
encrypted message is now jumble of
unreadable characters that is sent over
the internet and during transmission
even if someone intercepts the message
they can't read it because they don't
have the private key and now comes the
private key decryption so when the
message reaches the recipent the device
uses the private key to decrypt it the
private key is like the unique key that
can unlock the box and reveal the
original message this process ensures
that your communication stays secure
from start to finish even the service
providers or hackers who intercept the
message can't read it without the
private key so your message remains
private and secure just between you and
the recipent so now we'll see some of
the examples of end to end encryption
services so many popular services use
endtoend encryption to secure their
communication for example messaging apps
like WhatsApp and Signal messenger
ensure that only you and the person you
are chatting with can read your messages
and email providers like proton mail
uses end to end encryption to keep your
emails private and the cloud storage
services like trro protect your files
from unauthorized access now we'll see
the benefits of end to end encryption
end to end encryption provides enhanced
privacy and security by protecting your
data from hackers and unauthorized
access imagine your communication is
intercepted by someone with ENT
encryption they can't read your messages
because they don't have the decryption
key this level of security ensures that
your personal information stay safe and
private Beyond keeping your messages
secret and to end encryption protect
sensitiv data like financial information
personal documents and private photos
for example when you use WhatsApp to
send a bank account number or password
and to an encryption ensures only the
intended recipent can see it and in a
world with increasing cyber threats and
to an encryption acts as a critical
sheet maintaining trust and Security in
a digital communication and it's a
powerful tool that gives you control
over your privacy in an Ever connected
world now we see the challenges in
implementing and to end encryption so
implementing end to end encryption comes
with several challenges it involves
technical complexities that require
robust cryptographic algorithms and
secure Key Management additionally end
to end encryption can impact the
performance of services as encrypting
and decrypting data requires extra
processing power so service providers
need to balance strong security measures
with a smooth user experience and now
we'll have a look on the limitations of
end to end encryption so while end to
end encryption protects the content of
your messages it doesn't protect
metadata such as who you are
communicating with the time of
communication and the frequency of
messages this information can still be
accessible to service providers and
potentially to malicious actors
additionally there are legal and
Regulatory considerations as some
governments and agencies seek access to
encrypted Communications for security
purposes so it's important to be aware
of these limitations when relying on end
to end encryption for for privacy so
