1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,839
so hello there and welcome to another

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,600
tutorial my name is henry bakshi and

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,120
this time we're going to be going over

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,600
tower fanoy part 3.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,480
now

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,760
just in case you haven't watched the

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,040
other parts and you wanted to skip

8
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,800
straight to three here's a little

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,320
rundown or a recap of of the other parts

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,920
now it's been quite a while since i've

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,720
released part two or even part one

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
so here it is

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,560
in part one we covered what the tower of

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,840
hanoi is

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,480
because as i know it's not that much of

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,119
a famous game uh so some people don't

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,680
know about it so uh we talked about what

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,600
the tower of noise is we talked about

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
how you can play the tower of noise all

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,520
the rules etc uh and then we talked

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,600
about how many maximum number i mean

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,320
minimum number of moves it would take uh

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,280
to actually solve optimally one tower of

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,320
anoint game with n number of disks

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
uh then in the second part of our

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,879
tutorial series uh we went through the

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,000
algorithm that i created uh and it uses

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,879
the trees data structure uh now i'm not

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,199
exactly sure and i haven't actually seen

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,680
this online yet or in any book or

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
anything so if you can find it leave it

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
in the description or i mean in the

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,600
comments or you can email me attachment

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
gmail.com more info on that at the end

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,600
of this video

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,080
anyway then we talked about solving the

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
puzzle manually and we also talked about

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,640
the code itself

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
uh so i showed you the code uh i

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,520
showed you an implementation of it in

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,640
swift too

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
uh and so

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
uh now in this part we're gonna be

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,479
showing you the ui

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,280
for this uh code now i'm not gonna be

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
making an entire like sprite kit

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
full-fledged ui or even a scene kit

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,159
full-fledged 3d ui uh all that i'm going

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,680
to be doing is i'm going to be creating

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,399
a character user interface for you uh

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,159
meaning it'll print out uh turn this of

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,040
this

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
uh moving

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,079
this disc from peg this to peg that and

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,119
then it'll be like uh you know those old

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
dots or command line sort of printed

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,399
graphics so it's gonna be fun yeah okay

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,000
so let's get to the mac part now where

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,680
i'm going to be demonstrating uh how to

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,440
create the character user interface for

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,160
the tower finoi let's get to it

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
so welcome back to the mac part and now

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
i'm going to be showing you the code of

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
this app and also before we get into the

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
code i'm going to show you a little demo

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,280
of this app so let's just make my face

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,520
smaller and move it to the corner here

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,360
now i'm going to make this full screen

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
and move it out of the way a bit okay

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
perfect now let's just see how many

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,640
discs we want to give an example of so

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
first of all i'm going to give an

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
example for three disks so if i type in

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,319
the number three here

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,920
and i click enter

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
as you can see it gives us this

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
wonderful little character user

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,560
interface

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
and it says turn zero of seven so it

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,720
calculates some of the number of moves

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,239
that it will take

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,000
uh and then it sees which move we are

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,239
currently on and then we use a print

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,160
legs function to actually print out

85
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,720
these legs over here

86
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,280
uh next we can just click enter

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
and as you can see turn one of seven

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,159
moving disk one from peg one to peg

89
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,440
three

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
turn two of seven moving disk two from

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,519
peg one to peg two

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,720
now as you can see this will continue

93
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,080
uh it's on turn five now

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
now it's on turn six

95
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,599
and as you can see it has solved it now

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,400
if i click enter we'll just stop okay so

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,080
that was an example of three disks now

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
just before we get into the code i'll

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,799
show you an example of four disks then

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
we'll get to the code

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,120
so four disks turn 0 14

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,080
and as you can see as i click enter

103
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,159
this tower of hanoi puzzle is getting

104
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
progressively solved

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,200
and

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
turn 14 and turn 15. perfect okay now

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,040
what we're going to be doing is we're

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
going to go into the code so now let's

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
close this down

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,400
and let's do this

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
um

112
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,920
okay so now i'm also going to show you a

113
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,880
demo of five however first i'm going to

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
go through the code then i'm going to

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
show you two more demos

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
so

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,199
okay perfect let's get started now there

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,360
is some code that you should already

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,080
know from the older parts such as this

120
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,880
hanoi node class which holds the disks

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,360
the from using two leaf one leaf two

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
leaf three and the initializer so you

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
know that from part two

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,400
uh now there's one thing that you don't

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,080
i yes you do know this the inst array uh

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
it's an array of strings which holds our

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
instructions

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
then there's this input function which i

129
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
i did not make this i got this from

130
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
somebody's blog i forgot the name i will

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,400
leave the link in the description

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
okay so this is an input function what

133
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
this allows us to do is allows the user

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,960
to enter input in this case i'm just uh

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,840
using it to have the user enter or

136
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,440
actually just click the enter button so

137
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,800
i know when to move to the next term

138
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,639
okay then there's a function that you

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,120
haven't exactly seen before the hanoi

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,880
function

141
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
uh what this function will do or

142
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
actually the hanoi underscore function

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
is it taste takes um

144
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,840
disks as an integer

145
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
it takes a as an integer it takes b as

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
an integer i i mean a is a string b is a

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
string and c is a string

148
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
so disks is the number of disks that

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
we're going to be using

150
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,720
uh for this hanoi puzzle

151
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
then a is going to be

152
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,440
the name of the apex then the name of

153
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,160
the bpeg and then the name of the cpeg

154
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,320
of course

155
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,199
uh then uh you know already all of this

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,520
code from part two again

157
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,120
now these are the contents over here

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
where we declare the initial leaf or

159
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
node uh then we check if it has leaf one

160
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
and then we check if it has a leaf two

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
and then we check if it has elite three

162
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,800
etcetera etcetera

163
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,759
uh

164
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,520
uh and then so

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
we go on from there okay

166
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
perfect

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,199
so next after the hanoi underscore

168
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,280
function we have the normal hanoi

169
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,080
function now this has a function much

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,199
more similar to what you what a user

171
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,319
would want

172
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
this just taste takes disks that's it

173
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
nothing else and it returns an array of

174
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
strings

175
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
and so the array of strings that it

176
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,560
returns will be the instructions

177
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,479
required to actually solve the hanoi

178
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,360
puzzle for the required amount of disks

179
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,120
and this function just calls the hanoi

180
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
underscore function

181
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
with the disks that you gave it

182
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
the apec named as a the be pick named as

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,919
b and the c peg named as c

184
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
then we just return inst or the

185
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,639
instructions

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
perfect then we have a new function

187
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,479
which you haven't even heard of before

188
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,280
it's called print legs what this does is

189
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,400
it takes

190
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
discs as an integer these are how many

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,039
discs we're going to have in the legs

192
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,479
uh then it takes var a as the entire peg

193
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
not just the name of the peg the actual

194
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,000
contents of the peg so if uh peg a if

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
we're just starting out then peg a will

196
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,520
have all the disks in the uh container

197
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,160
uh so

198
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,360
uh let's say we're starting out with

199
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,639
three disks uh it'll a will be one two

200
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,960
three b will be blank c will be blank uh

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
et cetera et cetera

202
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
okay then what we're doing is we're

203
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,919
checking if a dot count is less than

204
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,960
disks

205
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,919
meaning

206
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,919
not all of the disks are in a

207
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,440
if so

208
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
then go

209
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,800
4i and 1 to disks minus a.count what

210
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,080
this will do is it'll see how many disks

211
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,039
are not in a

212
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,280
depending on how many there are loop

213
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,199
through that many

214
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
and insert zeros in their place

215
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,120
so instead of having uh something like

216
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,800
this let's just imagine

217
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,759
uh this is this is a

218
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,080
uh one two or sorry

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,919
this is a one two

220
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,160
over here then this is b which is just a

221
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
three and this is c a four

222
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,759
now instead of having a as one two we're

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,720
going to have it as zero zero one two

224
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,800
then instead of having b as just three

225
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,680
we're going to have it as zero zero zero

226
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,320
three and instead of having c as just

227
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,519
four we're going to have a 0 0 0 4

228
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,440
because there are four

229
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,279
as you can see

230
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,440
disks that we could have put

231
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
on this peg

232
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,040
there are three of them and so we add

233
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,959
three zeros to make up for those place

234
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,800
okay then we do the same thing for b and

235
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,399
c

236
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
then we loop through

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,040
four i and one to disks

238
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,640
so what we're going to do here is we're

239
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,760
going to say

240
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
print and then

241
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,279
listen carefully this because this can

242
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,560
get a little bit complicated

243
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
we're going to print pipe

244
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,839
space

245
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,120
then a

246
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,720
the a peg array i minus one so we're

247
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,839
going to say which disk are we on

248
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,480
okay uh if it's uh let's say we're on

249
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
the first disk we're on one

250
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,720
we're going to say one minus one that's

251
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
zero so we're going to get the zeroth

252
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,959
element from a

253
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
when we get the zeroth element for a we

254
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,680
put it in between these pipes uh and

255
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
then we have four spaces and then

256
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,880
another thing except instead of a for b

257
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,080
then four spaces again and then for c

258
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
then what we're doing is we're handling

259
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
what happens if we have a zero or if we

260
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,320
have since we've inserted all the zeros

261
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,880
uh now before i even continue what i'm

262
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
going to do is i'm going to um

263
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
quickly take this little snippet of code

264
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,120
command exit and put it in the comment

265
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,920
here now if i run the app as you can see

266
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,959
i've removed that little line of code

267
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,360
now if i run the app on let's say three

268
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,079
disks it shows you all the zeros that

269
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,480
we've inserted into peg a peg b and peg

270
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,279
c

271
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,519
so instead of just having nothing in

272
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,680
these uh pegs that are blank it has

273
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,959
three zeros so now if i click enter

274
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,360
it's zero two three zero zero zero and

275
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,959
zero zero one

276
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,560
and as you can see

277
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,519
it keeps going on so the arrays of the

278
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
pegs are actually never empty they're

279
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
always full of something like completely

280
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,079
full to the brim of at least

281
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,959
normal disks or zeros but they will be

282
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,800
completely full because then what we're

283
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
doing is this command that i removed

284
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,240
actually replaces all zeroes with spaces

285
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
from inside of that string

286
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,440
and so what happens is if i run this now

287
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
as you can see

288
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
all the zeros that were in these pegs

289
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,079
have been replaced with spaces

290
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,279
and so we don't see the zeros so it's uh

291
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,880
programming friendly and it's user

292
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
friendly as well

293
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,000
perfect then all we're doing is we are

294
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
just printing out uh

295
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,320
five equals then i think one two three

296
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
four yeah four spaces then five equal

297
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
signs then four spaces and five equal

298
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,640
signs then a new line and then print

299
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
adds a new line by itself uh this is so

300
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
that we have this little ending of the

301
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
jar here it's like a little illusion

302
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
it's like uh the equals act as the

303
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
bottom of the jar

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,399
okay then we're just printing so it adds

305
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,360
yet to another line

306
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
okay you know actually instead of doing

307
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
that we could just do this perfect

308
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,959
okay

309
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,120
next we're getting into the really

310
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
really interesting stuff

311
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
so let's just close that so you can see

312
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
the code nicely

313
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,959
okay so now what we're doing uh is we

314
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,160
are creating a new constant called ndisk

315
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,640
now ndisk is the variable that will hold

316
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,240
the number of disks that we have

317
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
throughout the game

318
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
and so in order to calculate this not

319
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
really calculate you get the input by

320
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
doing the integer conversion of the

321
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,399
input function that i just introduced to

322
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,240
you if you want a little while ago and

323
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
then we are forced unwrapping this

324
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
because i don't want to implement error

325
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,800
handling it this this is just

326
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,680
a proof of concept for simple uh

327
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
programming beginners not beginners but

328
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
you get the point uh just the tower of

329
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,320
noise and so i'm expecting that the user

330
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
has inputted a number

331
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,680
so you can take care of the error

332
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
handling if you'd like to or you can

333
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,839
email me uh if you need assistance with

334
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,240
that anyway after that we are creating

335
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,480
the pegs dictionary which is a

336
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,279
dictionary of index type string and

337
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,360
value type array of integers and we're

338
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,639
declaring this as a blank dictionary

339
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,040
then what we're doing uh is we are doing

340
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,200
a loop four i and one to n disk this is

341
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
going to loop through from one to three

342
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,839
if we type in three numbers uh or three

343
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,079
disks one to four if we type in four

344
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,399
disks one to five if we type in five

345
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,360
disks

346
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
etc you get the point

347
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,240
okay

348
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,639
uh so next we are creating a actually

349
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,720
sorry i forgot to tell you uh inside of

350
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
this loop what we're doing is we're

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
checking if i is one if i is one we are

352
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
setting pegs a to a blank array pegs b

353
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,720
to a blank array and play uh sorry pegs

354
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,200
c to a blank array

355
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
and then what we're doing is regardless

356
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,079
of if i is one or if it's two or if it's

357
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,920
three or if it's four whatever

358
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,720
we are just saying pegs a

359
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,279
dot append i

360
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
that symbol

361
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,560
so what it's doing

362
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
uh is it's saying

363
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
fill up a

364
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,079
with

365
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
top with the amount of disks that the

366
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,760
user gave us

367
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,839
so if he gave us

368
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,440
three fill up peg a with one two three

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
if he gave us ten or actually ten

370
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
doesn't work with this app nine

371
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,800
uh then fill it up with one two three

372
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
four five six seven eight nine

373
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
that simple

374
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,120
okay

375
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,760
then we have a new constant uh outside

376
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
of this loop and what it does is this is

377
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,600
the turtle i mean total turns uh that's

378
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,839
our apple need to create that uh that

379
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,680
our apple needs to

380
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,480
take

381
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,959
uh and so we calculate this by con uh

382
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,639
taking the power

383
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,279
uh two to the power specifically two to

384
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,639
the power uh n disk uh then we minus one

385
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
from that and then we convert that to an

386
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,000
integer i believe

387
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
we can force unwrap that

388
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,440
okay never mind uh only converting

389
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,040
strings to integers gives you an

390
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,279
optional if you convert a def uh i mean

391
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
a double to an integer it does not give

392
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,320
you an optional so you don't need to

393
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
unwrap

394
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,399
okay uh then we just print out

395
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,000
turn zero of total turns

396
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,760
uh then we call the print likes function

397
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
that we just created on the uh three

398
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,920
pegs that we have uh and the end disk

399
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,079
then we just take input meaning uh we're

400
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,160
waiting for the user to click enter or

401
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
they can type whatever they like at

402
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,320
really but once they click enter uh it

403
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,000
will actually starts uh with the um

404
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,560
with the actual uh solving

405
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
okay then we're actually storing turn as

406
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,680
a variable uh because we have to change

407
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,279
this i can't have this as a constant

408
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,079
okay then what we have uh is we have a

409
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,040
function called peg english so what this

410
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,959
does is it takes a peg as a string and

411
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,560
it turns a string

412
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,399
now we expect this peg to be either a b

413
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
or c

414
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
so we're doing a switch case on this peg

415
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,800
string and we're checking if it's a

416
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,440
return peg one if it's b return peg two

417
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,000
and if it's c or turn tag three

418
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,519
the reason we're doing this is let me

419
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,720
just show you um

420
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
because as you can see it says moving

421
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,759
disk one from peg one to peg three it's

422
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,240
actually peg a to peg c but then we call

423
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,800
the peg english function on these pegs

424
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,519
uh to get peg one instead of a so the

425
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
user can understand it so it's a bit

426
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,519
more you know user friendly

427
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,680
okay

428
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,079
so if it's not a b or c we just return a

429
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,600
blank string because we don't know what

430
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,639
this is

431
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,839
actually you know what i don't think

432
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
swift 2 requires you to have a default

433
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
case

434
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
yep it does

435
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,320
anyway okay

436
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,920
perfect

437
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,399
or in this specific case it told me that

438
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,680
you have to have a default um

439
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,199
case okay

440
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,399
then we have a very big loop uh this is

441
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,440
4i in hanoi and disk so what this will

442
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
do is it will call hanoi function

443
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,639
which will turn an array of instructions

444
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,120
of how we can solve the tower of hanoi

445
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,959
and so we're calling that function with

446
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,600
endisk and so we're looping through the

447
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
instructions required to solve the tower

448
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,000
of noise for a specified number of disks

449
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,199
and so first of all what we're doing

450
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,720
this is the most important we're just

451
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,559
incrementing the turn so that the user

452
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
can see what turn they're on then we're

453
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
actually printing turn turn of total

454
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
turns

455
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,360
uh then we're seeing since uh these um

456
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,679
what do you call it

457
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,480
instructions are formatted in uh this

458
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,000
sort of way like let's say we have to

459
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
move peg 1 to peg

460
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,000
2

461
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,200
aka in computer language peg

462
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,480
peg a

463
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,080
to peg

464
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,120
c

465
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
i mean b

466
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,799
then actually what it's giving us the

467
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,919
the real instruction from the uh array

468
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,840
would be

469
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,600
a to me

470
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,960
or just a sec

471
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
no it's actually that was an older

472
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,919
method of mine it's actually just a b

473
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,039
so

474
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,880
it's a very simple language for the

475
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,919
computer i'm just to understand because

476
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,640
the

477
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
from is the first letter and the two is

478
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,039
the last letter there can be anything in

479
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,400
the middle and the computer will just

480
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,440
ignore it

481
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
because all swift is doing is it's

482
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
parsing out the first character and

483
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
parsing out the last character

484
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,039
okay perfect

485
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,360
okay

486
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
so now what we're doing is after we've

487
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
calculated from into

488
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,200
we are going to print out moving disk

489
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,799
now this is a bit hard

490
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,679
we're moving dicks disk

491
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,720
pegs

492
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,240
from

493
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
so we're seeing which peg are removing

494
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
from

495
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
take the

496
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,559
highest disk in that peg

497
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,720
the first disk in that peg

498
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,520
and replace it here and put it here so

499
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
moving disk

500
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
then whichever disk is on the top of the

501
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,679
peg that we're moving from

502
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,760
simple

503
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,720
and then we're saying moving this disk

504
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,760
from

505
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,720
this peg so peg english for the front

506
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,640
peg two

507
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
and then peg english again for the two

508
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,760
peg

509
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,440
simple again then we're just making a

510
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,799
new line

511
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,679
okay

512
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,280
it's a bit complicated uh but

513
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,520
once you just read it a few times it

514
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
you'll get the point

515
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,760
anyway after that what we're doing is

516
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
we're saying pegs two

517
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,679
so now we're actually moving the disk in

518
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,200
software terms

519
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
so we're saying pegs two

520
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,919
so we're taking the two peg and we're

521
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,480
force unwrapping it and we are inserting

522
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,400
whatever we remove

523
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,280
actually we're inserting

524
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,559
from

525
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,480
the pegs for the from uh

526
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,520
how do i explain this uh

527
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,240
if i do this it could be a bit simpler

528
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,559
uh from value

529
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,679
is equal to

530
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,520
this now quick uh thing i need to tell

531
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,000
you first

532
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,880
when you call the remove first function

533
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,919
uh from an array uh to an or you call

534
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,280
this function on an array it will remove

535
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,760
the first value from the array but it'll

536
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
also return

537
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,400
that first value to uh

538
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,039
to you so you can use it in let's say a

539
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,159
variable

540
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,840
and so what we're doing in this case is

541
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,520
we're removing the first

542
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
value from the from peg because of

543
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,120
course we're going to remove from from

544
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,760
put on to so removing it from the from

545
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,440
and we're getting that value we're

546
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
getting that disk value

547
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,960
and so what we're doing is we're taking

548
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,799
that disk value and inserting it to the

549
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,400
zeroth index the highest index the first

550
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,200
spot on the two peg

551
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
now it's quite simple okay

552
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,120
if you'd like more information on that

553
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
or this is essentially simulating a

554
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
stack so if you'd like some more

555
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,919
information on that you can visit my uh

556
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,799
operator or actually math parsing

557
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,120
and evaluating in swift tutorial i have

558
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,559
two of them there will be two links in

559
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,880
the description for them

560
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,559
okay

561
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,760
then what we're doing is we're calling

562
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
the print legs function for end disk and

563
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,240
then of course our three pegs and then

564
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
we're just waiting for input right as

565
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
the input is given meaning the enter

566
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,880
button is clicked uh the i this loop

567
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
will iterate once more and it will go

568
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
through all of this now let me show you

569
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,159
a demo for numbers five and numbers you

570
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,000
guessed it nine

571
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,320
okay

572
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,919
okay so now let me show you a demo for

573
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,240
five disks so if i type in five

574
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
turn zero thirty one so as you can see

575
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,880
as i click enter

576
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,520
five is progressively getting solved one

577
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,760
turn six seven eight

578
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,760
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

579
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:12,880
17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29

580
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
30 31

581
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,440
and as you can see we have solved five

582
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,559
disks

583
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,000
now let me show you something really

584
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,080
interesting

585
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,640
nine discs

586
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
seems crazy right well it is

587
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,880
so as you can see there are 511

588
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,640
turns

589
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
for the number nine

590
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,120
that is a lot of turns

591
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,320
for us to possibly go through so now i'm

592
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
going to show you something that's

593
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,039
amazing

594
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
as you can see it shows us nine discs

595
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,480
here

596
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
now if i take the enter button and i

597
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,600
just keep it clicked like i don't

598
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,559
release my finger

599
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,600
as you can see you can watch the tower

600
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,559
of hanoi get progressively solved

601
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,640
i'm going to stop at

602
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
100 here

603
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,240
and as you can see on turn 100 we have

604
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,440
already gotten to this sort of a state

605
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,480
we moved disk 3 from peg 1 to peg 3 and

606
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,760
as you can see

607
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
we can actually see the entire history

608
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,799
of all the pegs we can see how each peg

609
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,840
was moved

610
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,600
now let's continue to 200

611
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,919
as you can see

612
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,360
is getting solved

613
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,840
quite

614
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,159
nicely and as i said this is going to be

615
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,280
no matter what like guaranteed

616
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,480
to give you

617
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,280
the lowest number of moves

618
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,039
it will never give you higher than

619
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,960
what's required so let me just show you

620
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,400
quickly though uh 511 so

621
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,799
yeah this is the minimum number of moves

622
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,960
you can't get better than this at this

623
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,280
point so as you can see we are in turn

624
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,480
200 uh and we are moving disc four from

625
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,480
peg one to peg two okay turn 200 next

626
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
turn 300

627
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,360
and as you can see we can see

628
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
um the tower

629
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,799
if you can't see where i'm seeing this

630
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,440
just look at this specific board oh i

631
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,360
missed 300

632
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,600
but as you can see uh now we're moving

633
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,080
this 4 from peg 3 to peg 1

634
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,120
we're just moving all of this

635
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,440
all of these discs and stuff until we

636
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,799
get to the

637
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,360
end where we have solved it

638
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
so actually uh one thing that i haven't

639
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,880
told you uh this app isn't looking to

640
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,039
complete the tower of hanoi

641
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,840
uh

642
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,159
what it's actually just doing

643
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,320
is it's just taking the instructions and

644
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,240
following them one by one

645
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,120
it's not actually uh looking have we

646
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,360
finished yet if we have then stop or

647
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,960
else look at the next instruction it's

648
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,039
just blindly following the instructions

649
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,120
uh that it gets from uh the hanoi node

650
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,000
class

651
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,159
uh and so

652
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,240
don't that have hanoi cloud node class

653
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,520
is guaranteed to give you the

654
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,400
instructions that will work uh and so

655
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,919
that's why uh it can blindly trust the

656
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,279
instructions from there now again i'm

657
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,279
going to click the end keep the enter

658
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,279
button clicked now i'm just going to go

659
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,840
straight to 511 actually i'll stop a

660
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,440
little bit before there

661
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,480
now if we just keep going

662
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,080
as you can see we are very very close to

663
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
having nine discs in the tower of noise

664
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
solved

665
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,919
and as you can see

666
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,520
last two moves

667
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,159
two goes on to uh peg three

668
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,400
and one goes on to pick three

669
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,320
now let me just show you uh my ui isn't

670
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,000
yet able to handle stuff like 10.

671
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,760
this is due to the fact that first of

672
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,480
all 10 has two digits which completely

673
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,279
messes up the pipe formatting uh so

674
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,000
that's one thing next 10 has a zero in

675
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
it and the zero automatically gets

676
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,880
removed as you know using our algorithm

677
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
uh so i mean i can fix that really

678
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,320
easily by putting a symbol that you

679
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
wouldn't really use in numbers like a

680
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,919
tilde or something like that

681
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,279
but again

682
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,720
then we'd have to redo the pipe

683
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,960
formatting and so it's just really hard

684
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,279
uh so till now it's only able to do uh

685
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,640
single digit numbers so from one to nine

686
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,760
though you wouldn't really want to do

687
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,960
one so from three to nine it'll handle

688
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,159
uh so

689
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,520
even though the instructions the

690
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
instruction function

691
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
uh can uh

692
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,559
get

693
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,400
for like even 100 discs if you were to

694
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,720
give it enough time uh but it can

695
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,720
so this app this ui can only solve

696
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,960
the number of disks up to nine that's it

697
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,880
that's the final thing

698
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,960
uh and the uh

699
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
but really note so

700
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,520
one last note just so you don't forget

701
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,480
this the algorithm can solve any number

702
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,720
of disks as long as your memory permits

703
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,039
so final note the algorithm can solve

704
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,440
anything the ui

705
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,520
that's lacking behind

706
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,400
but i'm planning on releasing maybe if i

707
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,600
get enough

708
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,360
views or ratings on this video or

709
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,600
request for it i will make this ui

710
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,480
better uh and i may just include uh the

711
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,120
double digit or actually any digit uh

712
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,760
version of the gui or cy

713
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,039
and that's going to be it for this

714
