[Music]

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,039
so hello there and welcome to another

3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,119
tutorial my name is tan bakshi and this

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,320
time we're going to be going over neural

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,640
networks in Nimble ninja and how you can

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,199
code a game to play itself on your

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,560
behalf using neural net Works in Swift

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,640
let's begin now if you've already seen

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,760
part one of this video series you

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,200
probably know what this is uh and so now

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,719
that you now after some time that we are

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,520
creating part two uh now I'm going to be

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,879
showing you the actual code behind the

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,280
system itself uh so if you haven't

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,520
already seen part one I'd recommend you

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,559
go and see part one it's on the it's in

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,960
the video description down below and on

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
screen right now as well uh all right so

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,519
let's actually go ahead and begin uh

20
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,920
this tutorial now how is this system

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,960
going to work uh you probably already

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,840
have a briefing of how the system will

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,000
work from part one but I'm going to give

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
you another quick overview so you know

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
the context so I can explain the code

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,200
too nicely let's begin so the way the

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,400
system is going to work uh is of course

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200
the the general concept is that you are

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,000
to play a game called Nimble ninja uh

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,159
Nimble ninja is an open source iOS game

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,320
developed by crash course code or

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,240
Michael leech uh it is a video series on

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,520
YouTube about how you can build this and

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,880
it's also a code available on GitHub and

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
so what I've gone ahead and done is I've

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,439
taken Nimble ninja and modified it

37
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,680
myself to incorporate neural network

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,840
technology so I can learn how to play

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,840
the game as you play it let me explain

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
what happens is it starts off by

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,040
observing you play so say that you've

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
got Nimble

43
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,039
ninja the first step is for it to learn

44
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,520
how to play or other data about you

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,079
playing the game so it can learn to play

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,880
from that data so the way this works is

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,319
of course we've got this nibble ninja

48
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,239
game uh and you are the user are

49
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,160
actually playing this

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,160
game now as you play the game I've

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,400
injected these sorts of scripts into the

52
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,080
code that'll actually gather data every

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
around a half a second uh or so orever

54
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,640
you know around 100 to 500 milliseconds

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,440
uh it'll gather data about the closest

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,480
block from you it'll it'll it'll find

57
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,040
the x value of that block and once it

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,360
has the x value of that block now there

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,800
can be two output values either a zero

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,640
or a one if it's a zero then that means

61
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,840
at this millisecond you were not

62
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,680
clicking the screen however if it is a

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,560
one then that means you are clicking the

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,319
screen at this distance and so a neural

65
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,879
network basically just has to learn uh

66
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,720
at around what x value you like to click

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,120
the screen uh and so of course as you

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,360
play Nimble ninja it gathers a bunch of

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,560
data about the x value and whether or

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,840
not you clicked the

71
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,000
screen this is the type of data

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,720
gathers however there's a little problem

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,159
as you know when you're playing nibble

74
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,879
ninja you're not you're not tapping on

75
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,840
the screen as often as you aren't

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,799
tapping on the screen and that means

77
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,239
that you've got thousands of more in

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,519
this data where you're not clicking than

79
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,319
when you are and so some data cleanup is

80
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,040
required or else the neural network

81
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,879
doesn't have good quality data meaning

82
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
it'll either overfit or not trained

83
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,080
properly uh something bad will happen

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,040
and so what has to happen uh is this of

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,519
course once the game generates the sorts

86
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,760
of data then it'll go through another

87
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,400
script and that's called the data

88
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,879
cleanup

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,840
script and so the data cleanup

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,439
will allow

91
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,720
you to remove some of the values where

92
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,040
you're not clicking to basically balance

93
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,760
it out with the values where you are

94
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,720
clicking once you've done that then

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,680
you're ready to actually do the real

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
neural network implementation so after

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,799
this this data will be passed over to a

98
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,759
library called Swift AI by Colin Hundley

99
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,759
uh now there are a few notes Here col

100
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,320
hly developed Swift Ai and allows you to

101
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,880
create very easy neural network

102
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,880
implementations in Swift uh however I'm

103
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,160
using a slightly older version of Swift

104
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,199
AI because that's the original version

105
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,639
that I had coded the system with however

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,960
soon I will update that code and provide

107
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,680
it to you in the description not too

108
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,960
much has changed uh however he has made

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,919
many more performance improvements which

110
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,479
is of course great because you don't

111
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,600
want the user waiting for their game uh

112
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,120
to train you want it to happen instantly

113
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
so there are a few more performance

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
improvements on the way uh but for now

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
I'm going to show you how you can

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,479
actually implement the Swift AI core

117
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,400
itself and so of course once the data

118
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,759
has been cleaned up uh then it will go

119
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,240
to the

120
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,000
Swift AI

121
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,720
library and then Swift from and then

122
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,919
Swift AI of course will train a neural

123
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,759
network to understand this data uh and

124
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,039
this neural network actually has one

125
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,440
input it has 300 Hidden

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,840
units and it has one output

127
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
that is how the neural network works in

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,880
fact a neat little trick here is if you

129
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,440
want to find out exactly how many

130
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,319
connections there are there are or how

131
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,000
many individual weights will need to be

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,960
tuned you can just do one um yes 1 *

133
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,919
300 plus

134
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,280
300 * 1 so you're doing the connections

135
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,440
between these two layers and the

136
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,560
connections between these two layers and

137
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,080
if you were to find that that should be

138
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,000
around 600 because of course 300 300 uh

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,560
and then of course that would become 600

140
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,199
so you've got 600 individual weights to

141
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,639
tune in this neural network and that is

142
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
how the system works from there what's

143
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,479
going to happen is some fancy logic

144
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,520
we'll actually use this neural network

145
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,080
to find out when the character should

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,440
flip on the screen so after you play and

147
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,720
lose the game once the neural network

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,400
will automatically start training and

149
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
once the neural network is done training

150
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,319
it will then of course go ahead uh and

151
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,560
play for you the next time you start the

152
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,960
game all right so now let's get over to

153
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,039
the Mac part where I'll show you how you

154
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,800
can actually implement this system let's

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,360
get over to it now all right so welcome

156
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,680
back to the Mac part and now I'm going

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,599
to show you how you can actually build

158
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,759
this Nimble Ninja system but first I'd

159
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,880
like to show you a demo if you've

160
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,520
already watched part one you know about

161
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,000
the game mechanics so I'd highly

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,160
recommend you go and watch part one

163
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,400
before you actually start watching part

164
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
two all right so as you can see I'm

165
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,080
actually starting to play Nimble ninja

166
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,039
and my goal here is to reach a score of

167
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,479
around 30 right as I reach them the

168
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,720
neural network should have gathered

169
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,039
enough data to learn how to play the

170
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:08,160
game now as you can see what's happening

171
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
is as I'm playing it's Gathering data

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,639
about the closest Block's x value uh and

173
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,000
of course uh it's able to find out

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,479
whether or not I'm clicking the screen

175
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,440
uh and it'll label those it'll uh

176
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,680
basically Stitch that data together uh

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,319
and once it's done stitching the data

178
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,720
together it will give it to the neural

179
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,599
network uh to learn from now as you can

180
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,479
see let's just say I a score of around

181
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,199
50 right I mean the more data the better

182
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,000
uh you don't want too much data but uh

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,400
you know more data is good uh the reason

184
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,639
we don't want too much data those

185
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,039
because then it trains very very slowly

186
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,840
okay now I'm just going to not not play

187
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,159
the game and wait for it to just die uh

188
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,400
and okay there we go so I've now lost

189
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
the game and as you can see it's kind of

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,120
Frozen and when it's frozen that means

191
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,560
it's training the neural network but as

192
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,639
you can see it says it's game over now

193
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,639
uh meaning that it is done training the

194
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
neural network so I can actually click

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,919
the game over screen and right as I want

196
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,680
to I can actually now tap to start and

197
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
right as I tap to start watch this I'm

198
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
actually not going to uh you know click

199
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,240
on the uh screen at all but I should be

200
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,680
able to tap to start uh and there we go

201
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,080
it is playing by itself what's happening

202
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,599
is the neural network has learned how to

203
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,039
play Nimble ninja and it is now playing

204
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,120
on my behalf exactly how I would play

205
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,680
you could say that quite literally it is

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,319
uh an an IM ation of the really tiny

207
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,560
part of my brain that knows how to play

208
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,039
Nimble ninja uh that really tiny

209
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,959
biological part of my neural network uh

210
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,399
that's being put onto an artificial

211
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,159
neural network in my phone and so as you

212
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,159
can see that is how you can have your

213
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,600
phone played Nimble Ninja for you so

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,160
that was a demo and I'm actually going

215
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
to keep this running so it just keeps on

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,519
uh you know playing Nimble ninja but I'm

217
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,800
going to go over to xcode and I'm going

218
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,680
to start explaining how you can actually

219
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,040
build this entire system now as you can

220
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,320
see of of course first of all we've got

221
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,839
an extension to the array class and in

222
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,959
this array class I've got a sample

223
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,279
function uh this was from stack Overflow

224
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,079
and it basically just gets a random

225
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:11,320
index from the uh from the array and a

226
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,839
random value but after that of course

227
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,160
I've got a function called cleanup uh

228
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
cleanup will take the current array of

229
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,640
course self uh and it'll also take

230
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,959
another two-dimensional float array

231
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,880
called with answers uh now of course uh

232
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,839
there are two separate arrays to niml

233
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,360
ninous function or at least the neural

234
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,920
Network part and these arrays are first

235
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,279
of all of course the the x value arrays

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,760
uh the x value array where you have a

237
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,279
bunch of X values from the from the uh

238
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,600
from of course the from from the data

239
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,440
gatherer uh but then of course you've

240
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
also got another array that contains

241
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,600
whether or not at each x value I have

242
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,079
clicked the screen uh and so of course

243
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,880
once the cleanup function is given both

244
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,399
arrays it's able to do some really great

245
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,200
logic uh and over here what it's able to

246
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,680
do is after the data pre-processing here

247
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,519
it's able to actually clean up the data

248
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,279
and make sure there's an equal amount of

249
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,959
zeros and ones in the training data so

250
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,720
that the neural network is able to train

251
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,399
properly with good quality data and so

252
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,200
that it does not uh need to be you know

253
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,240
uh so it does not overfit or it doesn't

254
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,600
uh you know underfit or something of

255
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,160
that sort uh so of course uh it balances

256
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,560
out the amount of data that we've got in

257
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,000
the

258
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,519
array after that of course I've got a a

259
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,399
function called random between numbers

260
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,800
and I'll explain what that does in just

261
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
a minute and you'll see in the end of

262
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,320
the uh in the end of the code but apart

263
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,760
from that of course you see that I've

264
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,360
created a neural network uh using the

265
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,600
ffnn class provided by Swift Ai and I'm

266
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
and I'm making the neural network have

267
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,800
one input 300 Hidden units and one

268
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,200
output apart from that in the game scene

269
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,959
there are only two variables related to

270
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,279
the neural Network's functioning uh

271
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,079
first of all it's called neural play

272
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,560
second last flip neurop playay is the

273
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
variable of whether or not the neural

274
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,519
network is currently playing the game

275
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,959
now after you lose this will

276
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,800
automatically be set to True last flip

277
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,560
is whether or not the neural network has

278
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,639
just told the character to flip but why

279
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,440
well if I actually open my phone back up

280
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,680
here uh and go back over here as you can

281
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,760
see what's happening is the character

282
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,720
doesn't instantaneously within a

283
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
fraction of you know millisecond uh

284
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,399
actually just flip between the flip

285
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,360
between the sides of the platform it

286
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,160
does take him a few sort of you know

287
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,839
milliseconds to actually animate to the

288
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,560
other side of the platform uh and so

289
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,600
what happens is since that's not

290
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,800
instantaneous uh the neural network is

291
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,760
actually called more times uh per more

292
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,760
times uh it was actually called faster

293
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
uh than the character can flip on the

294
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,440
platform it's called that fast uh and so

295
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,880
what happens is eventually say that the

296
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,399
neural network wants the character to

297
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,519
flip and the neural network issues use a

298
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,800
flip command what happens is the the the

299
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,600
character could be in between states uh

300
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
could be just about to flip technically

301
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,079
on the other side uh but has not you

302
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,200
know completely flipped yet uh that

303
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,639
means that the uh that the neural

304
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,880
network might issue another flip command

305
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,320
which in turn brought him to the other

306
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,560
plat the same side of platform again

307
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,079
which defeats the purpose and then they

308
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,600
would issue another flip command and

309
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,440
another one and another one and it would

310
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,360
just keep going on there's really no

311
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,959
point to having the neural network

312
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,440
infinitely called a flip Comm command uh

313
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,079
and so of course in order to prevent

314
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,079
that what I do is whenever the neural

315
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,560
network issues a flip command I set last

316
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,199
flip to true and once last flip has been

317
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,920
set to true then I do not allow the

318
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,560
neural network to issue another flip

319
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,440
command until last flip is equal to

320
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
false uh and the way it gets Su to false

321
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,240
is if neural if the neural network uh

322
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,040
tells a program that it does not want

323
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,120
the neural net the hero to flip uh and

324
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,000
so that's how the last flip logic Works

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,480
apart from that of course I've also got

326
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,680
this little code here uh and if you do

327
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
want the neural network to start playing

328
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,000
Nimble ninja in the beginning of the

329
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,639
game even though it wouldn't really do

330
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,920
anything at all it would just you know

331
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,160
randomly uh flip and not flip uh then

332
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,560
you can just set this to True uh but

333
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,680
apart from that I've actually got some

334
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,519
code over here in game over now in the

335
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,040
game over function this is a code that I

336
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,760
have

337
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,680
implemented now this is actually what

338
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,600
starts the entire Nimble ninja pipeline

339
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
what it does is it checks if the neural

340
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,279
network is not playing meaning that you

341
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,000
have lost the game a human has lost the

342
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,160
game then what'll happen is it'll

343
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,959
actually clean up the data it'll print

344
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,800
out the old data it'll print out the new

345
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,600
data just so I can see what's happening

346
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,240
uh and then it'll actually train a

347
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,160
neural network using Swift AI on the

348
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,000
data and the error threshold is 0.1

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,560
meaning at maximum from the trading data

350
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,839
uh it can get the the neural network

351
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,880
should be able to get at maximum 0.1 off

352
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,800
uh from the training data specifically

353
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
uh and then once you're done that and

354
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,079
once you have trained your neural

355
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,040
network I just print out the weights of

356
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,639
the neural network just in case I really

357
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,519
like the way that this one plays and I

358
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,560
want to save its weights uh and

359
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,639
basically just I guess you could say uh

360
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,320
preserve its brain uh so it's able to

361
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,720
play again in the future if I just want

362
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
to take those weights uh and put them

363
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,240
into a the uh program once again and

364
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
load up a specific neural

365
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,120
network after that I set neural play to

366
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
true and once neurop play is true the

367
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,240
neural network will start playing the

368
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
game the next time it's oh the next time

369
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,079
you turn on the

370
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,959
game but next I've got some more code in

371
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,120
the update function in the update

372
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
function and of course if you don't know

373
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
exactly how Sprite kit functions and uh

374
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
and what it update function does I'd

375
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,720
recommend you find out a bit more about

376
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,880
Sprite kit there might be some resources

377
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,399
uh and links to resources in the

378
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,120
description for you to find out a bit

379
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
more about that but apart from that

380
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
though uh let's take a look at the code

381
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,759
inside the update function

382
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,480
uh as you can see the first if statement

383
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,600
that I've got here uh is that I'm making

384
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,920
sure that the closest obstacle x value

385
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,199
is not equal to zero uh now this uh

386
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,160
basically what this will do uh is it'll

387
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,120
make sure that the closest obstacle x

388
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,639
value actually exists uh because what

389
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,600
I've gone ahead and programmed it to do

390
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,800
is whenever that the the character does

391
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,839
not have the um a block in front of him

392
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,680
then this variable will be equal to zero

393
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,519
uh and so what happens is I make sure

394
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,399
that that's not equal to zero and

395
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
there's also an array called done for

396
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,639
done for contains the X values that uh

397
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,040
the neural network has already been

398
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,800
trained for uh if done for already

399
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,759
contains this x value uh then of course

400
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,880
do not run this if statement or the code

401
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,600
inside the if statement however if both

402
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,759
of these end out to be true uh then what

403
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,319
we can do is actually pend this x value

404
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,480
to the array uh or the inputs array and

405
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,440
then of course append a zero meaning I'm

406
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,680
not clicking the screen to the answers

407
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,120
array then after that check if the

408
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
neural network is playing the game and

409
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,639
the game has been started and the game

410
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,680
is not over if so then call the neural

411
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,880
network and give it the current x value

412
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
find that neural network value and

413
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,920
create a new constant called Network

414
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,199
wants to flip and this is equal to

415
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,800
whether or not the network value is

416
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,959
greater than

417
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,160
0.99 this means that if the network

418
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,519
wants to flip that means that it is over

419
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
99% sure that it does in fact want to

420
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
flip

421
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,519
after that it'll print out whether or

422
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,880
not the network wants to flip and with

423
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,600
and with how much confidence it wants to

424
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,199
flip or not flip and apart from that

425
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,360
after that uh I check if the neural

426
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,839
network wants to flip and if not last

427
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,399
flip then I do hero. flip and I set last

428
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
flip to true and this is that last flip

429
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,680
logic that I was talking about where if

430
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,839
last flip is is false then it will allow

431
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,600
the neural network to flip and set it to

432
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,079
true meaning that this will not be run

433
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,440
until last flip is set to false when the

434
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,399
neural network does not want to flip and

435
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,799
from there you are ready to continue and

436
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,520
once you have injected these sorts of I

437
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,280
guess you could say scripts into Nimble

438
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,039
ninja uh you ready to go and have an AI

439
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,600
enabled Nimble ninja that can learn from

440
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,919
you and how you like to play nibble

441
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,640
ninja all right so thank you very much

442
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,000
for joining in today that's what I had

443
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,280
to show you in fact I actually to get

444
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,039
back here as you can see the neural

445
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,600
network is at

446
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
550 now of course this game is actually

447
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,080
not very hard but this very same

448
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,320
algorithm could be applied to many

449
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,760
different games whether that be you know

450
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,280
uh Tetris or or whatever whatever else

451
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,440
it might be this exact same algorithm

452
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,240
can be applied to many other games and

453
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,320
of course soon in the future I will be

454
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,039
showing you how you can actually apply

455
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
this algorithm and actually algorithms

456
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
like this one for example convolutional

457
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,280
neural networks and more on other games

458
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,919
on how you can create AI games or or AIS

459
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,640
for games that don't actually support

460
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,200
them natively all right so thank you

461
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,640
