sometimes but there's always room for
improvement the world of business is
constantly changing and staying on the
top of the latest trends and
Technologies is essential for Success
one of the most valuable skills you can
have is the ability to continuously
improve your process and systems that's
where lean Six Sigma comes in lean Six
Sigma is a management system that
focuses on reducing waste and increasing
efficiency by applying these principles
you can eliminate unnecessary steps cut
down on resources and costs and improve
quality this leads to faster product
delivery better customer satisfaction
and higher profits don't let yourselves
fall behind take this opportunity to
learn what lean Six Sigma is all about
and how you can apply in your business
you will learn about the importance of
process flow mapping 5S Kaizen and other
fundamental principles that can help you
streamline your operations the video
covers a wide range of topics including
statistics data analysis and project
management with this knowledge you will
be able to identify and eliminate waste
in your own process improve your
products or service and create more
value for your customers it's essential
for any successful businessmen or women
to continually learn and improve their
skills so what are you waiting for let's
get started Six Sigma is a set of tools
and techniques that have helped several
companies around the world achieve
business success hi guys I'm Raul from
Simply learn and let's get started with
our introduction to Six Sigma now let's
understand this better with an example
here let's talk about how things were
before Six Sigma was introduced here
Jenny and James are having a
conversation with each other Jenny is
James's manager and she's not happy at
all she says James is in a lot of
trouble this is because she found out
that the customers weren't happy with
the organization's service and the
operational costs with V2 High and as
manager James had to make sure that this
did not happen now let's have a look at
the same scenario in present day here we
have Jenny congratulating James she's
very impressed with his work but James
says it's all thanks to Six Sigma
methodology so Jenny asks she wants to
know more about Six Sigma so to
understand Six Sigma here's what you
need to know firstly we'll have to
understand what is Six Sigma what its
advantages are some of its methodologies
what are the different roles in a Six
Sigma team what is lean what is a lean
process and what is lean Six Sigma so
now let's get started with understanding
what exactly is Six Sigma the Six Sigma
methodology makes sure to find as well
as eliminate any sort of defect or
variation that could be affecting your
product service or process now this
methodology is statistics based is data
driven and focused on continuous
Improvement now this means that there's
no end goal in the Horizon there's
always another goal to reach there are
three core ideologies behind Six Sigma
the first one states that for any
business to be successful there is
continue is efforts that are required so
that you can achieve stable as well as
predictable process results the second
ideology states that in any business or
manufacturing process there are certain
characteristics that can be defined
measured analyzed and controlled the
final ideology says that along with the
rest of the organization the top level
management plays a very important role
to making sure that this sustained
quality now let's talk about the
advantages of Six Sigma Six Sigma can
help produce a road map or a path
through which you can easily find and
reduce any sort of organizational risk
and reduce the operational costs another
Advantage is that it helps improve the
efficiency of the process and making
sure that it works in a timely manner it
decreases defects improves the overall
tracking and monitoring process and
ensures that the products are aligned
with the company's policies it is also
reported that it greatly helps improve
customer as well as vendor satisfaction
it helps improve the cash flow and
ensures that the products are complying
with the regulations of the organization
now let me tell you about the process of
Six Sigma now Six Sigma projects are of
basically two methodologies the dmaic
and the dma DV now let's talk about
dmaic in detail that's short for Define
measure analyze improve and control this
is one of the most commonly used
methodologies in the world this is
commonly used by companies when they
have to fix or improve an already
existing product or process that does
not meet the company's standards now
let's have a look at the process first
phase is the Define phase in this phase
you define the problem that the
customers are facing you find out where
you can improve and you clearly
understand what the customers require of
you the second phase is the measure
phase now in this phase you actually
identify how well the process is doing
in its current unaltered state in the
analyze phase you process the data that
you get from the measure phase and
determine what exactly is the cost of
the delay or variation in the improve
phase you start by making small changes
to the business process and make sure
that the problem you identified earlier
is being taken care of and finally in
the control phase you control the new
process so that it doesn't go wrong and
use the same knowledge for future
processes now let's have a look at dmadv
this is short for Define measure analyze
design and verify now this is also
commonly known as dfss or the design for
Six Sigma now this is commonly used by
companies around the world when they
have a new product that needs to be
created all the way from scratch in the
first phase which is the defined phase
you define what the goal of the project
is and what the customers require of you
in the measure phase you measure as well
as determine what the customer needs and
how they respond to your products in the
analyze phase you perform analysis to
determine how you can improve your
product or service so they can better
serve your customers in the design phase
you set up process details and make
optimizations to the design to make sure
your customer is satisfied and finally
in the verify phase you check how well
the design is working out and how well
it meets the customer's needs now before
we go on let's talk about how Six Sigma
was used in reference to the earlier
example the situation that James was
facing a survey conducted by the
organization James was working for
indicated that the customers weren't
very happy with the organization so they
decided to fix that with the help of Six
Sigma so they decided that the dmaic
methodology would be best suited to
solve their problem so let's have a look
at what they did firstly in the Define
phase they used a tool called the voice
of the customer this tool represented
the needs as well as requirements of the
customer this showed that the customers
expected prompt delivery the correct
product selection and a knowledgeable
distribution team from the company and
now on to the measure phase the company
wanted to know why the customers didn't
like them so they performed some data
collection from there they found out
that they took 56 percent longer than
other companies to deliver their product
so they decided to reduce the amount of
time it takes between order entry and
the delivery of the product and now in
the analyze here they knew what the
issue was but they wanted to know what
exactly made their products delivery so
slow why were the customers receiving
the products so late then they performed
some analysis their analysis showed the
possible causes it could have been
inaccurate sales plans issues with their
safety stock issues with their vendors
delivery performance and falling behind
on the manufacturing schedule further
analysis also indicated that most of
their sales almost 80 percent came from
30 percent of their products the issue
was that they didn't have enough Safety
stock to satisfy the customers who
required that 30 percent of products and
now onto the improved phase so now that
they knew what was causing their problem
they wanted to solve it they began to
have monthly reviews and try to make
sure that their in-demand products
stayed in demand another thing that they
wanted to focus on was to make sure that
they could order and provide the
customer with the products that they
wanted and finally onto the control
phase they began to set up plans so that
they could monitor the sales of that 30
percent of product that were selling the
most each year they would review how
well a product was selling and replace
it if it had fallen out of favor now let
me tell you what Six Sigma team consists
of let's talk about the roles in a Six
Sigma team first up is level 7. now
these are individuals who are at the
novice level now these individuals don't
know in great detail about what the
project is but they have a basic
understanding of the principles and the
methodology behind the program now they
usually support with smaller projects
and with smaller issues but these
individuals found the foundation for the
people who decide where the program is
going and now we're at level 6. now
these are individuals who have a yellow
Belt certification now they are core
members of the Six Sigma team who have
an understanding of how the basic
metrics work and how they can perform
some sort of improvement now they have
their own areas of expertise and they're
required to determine certain processes
that need to improve at the same time
they're also in charge of smaller
Improvement projects now level five
these are people people who have a Green
Belt certification now these individuals
are usually part-time professionals who
have a number of different duties to
fulfill they focus on smaller Six Sigma
projects they are usually involved with
Gathering data performing some sort of
experiment and analyzing information
they also assist with black belt
projects and now we're at level 4 these
are individuals who have a Black Belt
certification they usually team leaders
of a Six Sigma project they complete
four to six projects a year and are
experts in the principles methodologies
and lean Concepts thanks to their
understanding of statistical
experimental design they can also
understand the hidden reasons behind why
a particular product failed and now
we're at level 3 these are individuals
who have a master Black Belt
certification now these are individuals
who are experts when it comes to
resources the practices and the
methodologies that are employed in Six
Sigma their main emphasis is to coach
train and certify black belts they also
are involved with other Six Sigma
leaders to ensure a company's goals are
met now level 2 these individuals are
called Champions so they work really
closely with the executives and usually
have a role like a senior or a middle
executive level role they also have a
clear understanding of what exactly is
the company's vision and Mission they
also understand metrics so that they can
set up a Six Sigma project that lines up
with the company's goals they're
responsible for removing any sort of
Roadblock that could hamper the success
of a project and finally we are at level
one these are the executives now these
individuals represent the highest level
when it comes to a Six Sigma team now
they have training as well as experience
through which they can set up Six Sigma
projects that clearly line up with the
company's goals their main emphasis is
to ensure that the project is able to
add value to the organization and at the
end of the day is successful now this is
when Jenny interjects she wants to know
about lean John tells her that lean just
like sex Sigma is another methodology so
what exactly is lean now lean is a
methodology that has a very important
ideology to make sure that this
continuous optimization of the processes
and there's an elimination of waste so
what's waste so waste is basically any
part of the process that the customer
doesn't want to pay for it is a process
that does not add any value to the
customer now coming back to lean here
are some of its characteristics whenever
decisions are being made in a lean team
the main emphasis is to understand how
it exactly adds value to the customer
every member in a lean team has a clear
understanding of what exactly are the
goals of the organization it also
encourages employees to push for further
success even if the organization is in a
good place or is already doing well
there's also an emphasis on
cross-functional collaboration and
communication lean focuses on answering
the difficult question or the complex
ones rather than employing short-term
fixes and with lean you can easily
prepare for issues that can come up in
the future or improvise in unexpected
circumstances so let's talk about how
lean and Six Sigma are different from
one another the lean methodology aims to
reduce waste it does so by analyzing the
workflow it also emphasizes on
minimizing resource usage and improving
customer value now let's talk about Six
Sigma the aim of Six Sigma is to provide
near perfect results it wants to reduce
costs and improve customer satisfaction
basically both of them are moving
towards the same goal to reduce the
amount of waste and to create efficient
processes now let's talk about the
process of lean now there are five
different steps let's start with the
first one identifying value you need to
identify value by determining what
exactly is the problem you're trying to
solve for the customer the second step
is to map your value stream you need to
map the workflow of your company you
need to focus on the different actions
and the people that are involved with
the process you need to be able to
identify which parts of the process are
able to add value and the ones that
don't the third step is to create a flow
you need to break up your work into
smaller silos and visualize the
workflows so that you can easily
identify problems that might show up
later the next step is to establish pull
you need to set up a system through
which products are created only when
there is a demand or a requirement for
it through this you can optimize
resource capacity and finally we're at
the fifth step which is continuous
Improvement you need to ensure all your
employees at all levels are involved in
the continuous Improvement of the
process so what exactly is lean Six
Sigma what if you could combine The Best
of Both Worlds the combination of Six
Sigma and lean methodology led to the
creation of lean Six Sigma lean Sig
Sigma is a methodology that aims to
solve problems removes any form of waste
or inefficiency and improving the
working conditions of employees to make
sure that they can serve the customers
better now this is a combination of the
tools methods and principles that are
employed in lean and Six Sigma let's
talk about some of its advantages it
aims to provide customers with a better
experience by streaming lining the
process with efficient power flows it
aims to drive higher results it can
reduce cost remove waste and prevent
effects it can help the organization
handle day-to-day problems the decreased
lead times help increase capacity and
profitability and finally it helps with
people development and improving the
morale of the organization the
organizational benefits of Six Sigma are
as follows
a sex Sigma process eliminates the root
cause of problems and defects in a
process
sometimes the solution is creating
robust products and services that
mitigate the impact of a variable input
or output on a customer's experience for
example many Electrical Utility Systems
have voltage variability up to and
sometimes exceeding a 10 deviation from
nominal value thus most electrical
products are built to tolerate the
variability drawing more amperage
without damage to any components or the
unit itself
using Six Sigma reduces variation in a
process and thereby reduces waste in a
process
it ensures customer satisfaction and
provides process standardization
rework is substantially reduced because
one gets it right the very first time
further Six Sigma addresses the key
business requirement
Six Sigma can also be used by
organizations to gain advantage and
become world leaders in their respective
fields ultimately the whole Six Sigma
process is to satisfy customers and
Achieve organizational goals
let us understand how Six Sigma Works in
this screen
sex Sigma is successful because of the
following reasons Six Sigma is a
management strategy it creates an
environment where the management
supports Six Sigma as a business
strategy and not as a standalone
approach or a program to satisfy some
public relations need
Six Sigma mainly emphasizes the DMACC
method of problem solving
Focus teams are assigned well-defined
projects that directly influence the
organization's bottom line with customer
satisfaction and increased quality being
byproducts
Six Sigma also requires extensive use of
statistical methods imagine you're the
manager of a supermarket chain you've
noticed that two things need your
immediate attention the first issue is
how to handle the different kinds of
ways that you encounter at your
supermarket
the next one requires you to address the
supply chain issues at the supermarket
which are causing delays to the morning
delivery of milk
leading to customer dissatisfaction and
attrition these problems can be solved
by incorporating two of the most popular
quality management methodologies in the
world lean and Six Sigma one famous for
its ability to handle waste and another
known for process Improvement but what
if there was a methodology that combined
the concepts of both Six Sigma and lean
one that could solve all your issues
well there is lean Six Sigma before we
dive into lean Six Sigma let's take a
closer look at its parent methodologies
first off lean is a methodology that
focuses on providing value to the
customer
eliminating waste continuous Improvement
reducing cycle time lean in Six Sigma
both aim to handle waste but what is
this waste waste is any step or action
in the process that a user does not gain
any value from in short things that
users wouldn't want to pay for
why would a consumer want to pay extra
for the additional truck that was
required to deliver milk to the
supermarket just because the other one
broke down
this waste can be divided into eight
categories let's have a look at each of
them One Transportation this waste
refers to the excess movement of people
tools inventory equipment and other
components of a process then it is
required 2. inventory this waste occurs
due to having more products and
materials than required this can cause
damage and effects to products or
materials greater time for completion
inefficient allocation of capital and so
on
three motion this refers to the time and
effort wasted due to unnecessary
movement of people equipment or
Machinery this could be sitting through
inventory double data entry and so on
4. waiting this can be time wasted
waiting on information instructions
materials or equipment
five overproduction this is the waste
created due to producing more products
than required
6. over processing it refers to more
work more components or more steps in a
product or service than required
7. defects this is the waste originating
from a product or service that fails to
meet customer expectations 8. skills
this waste refers to the waste of human
potential under utilizing capabilities
and delegating tasks to people with
inadequate training
for years now many systems have emerged
that use the lean methodology to
identify and handle the different kinds
of waste some of the more popular and
effective ones are jit or just in time
5s and kanban
the jit methodology focuses on reducing
the amount of time the production system
takes to provide an output and the
response time from suppliers to
customers 5S is another methodology that
focuses on cleanliness in organization
while improving profits and efficiency
kanban is also another popular
methodology to achieve Lane
it is a visual method to manage tasks
and workflows
kanban enables users visualize the
workflow to identify issues in the
process and fix them
these methodologies help in optimizing
the waste production and are often used
together to maximize results
so that's the first problem solved now
let's have a look at how you can improve
the supermarket supply chain efficiency
for that let's have a look at the other
part of lean Six Sigma Six Sigma
Six Sigma is a set of tools and
techniques that are used for process
Improvement and removing defects let's
see how Six Sigma makes that possible
Six Sigma has two major methodologies
dmaic and dmadv
you can learn more about these two
methodologies by checking out our Six
Sigma in nine minutes video by clicking
on the top right corner let's have a
closer look at dmaic since lean Six
Sigma uses the dmaic methodology of Six
Sigma dmaic is an acronym for Define
measure analyze improve control it is
used to improve existing products and
processes so that it can meet the
customers requirements
in the Define phase you determine what
the goals of the project are in this
case you want to reduce the amount of
time taken to deliver milk from the
warehouse to the supermarket so that it
is stocked on the supermarket shelves
before 8 30 in the morning
in the measure phase you measure the
performance of the current unaltered
process the milk truck leaves at 7 30
a.m in the morning and can take one of
three routes a b and c route a is
currently the preferred one as it takes
only 60 Minutes to reach the supermarket
compared to the routes B and C which
takes 70 and 80 minutes respectively
in the analyze phase you find out why
the defects exist
since routes B and C were school bus
routes by reducing the starting time by
one hour at 6 30 instead of 7 30 meant
avoiding the traffic routes B and C now
take 40 to 45 minutes to reach the
supermarket route a still takes the milk
truck one hour to get to the supermarket
even when the truck leaves at 6 30 am
in the improve phase performance can be
improved by addressing and eliminating
the root causes
now that you've realized that advancing
the milk pickup by an hour and changing
the route to Route B can save time you
change the process accordingly providing
your workers with ample time to stock
the milk into the shelves before the
morning rush and finally in the control
phase you make regular adjustments to
control new processes and future
performance
you continue to monitor the delivery
times and try out alternate routes to
continually improve the process and
ensure even faster delivery
this process change LED to reduced man
hours and cost enhanced sales and
customer retention
the lean Six Sigma methodology offers
many such benefits to businesses let's
take a look at some of them one increase
in profits two standardized and
simplified process three reduced errors
4. employee development five value to
customers and that is lean Six Sigma for
you the term lean refers to creating
more value to customers with fewer
resources it means reducing unwanted
activities or processes that do not add
value to the product or service for the
customer
the lean philosophy is to provide
perfect value to the customer through a
perfect value creation process that has
zero waste
while the ultimate goal is to achieve
zero waste you may not always get that
in the first couple of tries however you
will achieve minimum waste and continue
to move towards zero waste eventually
hence lean is the path towards
perfection
lean is about optimizing the process
from beginning to end eliminating
non-value-adding activities in va's and
increasing flow to ensure that parts and
services are provided to customers more
quickly
if quality is the word to describe Six
Sigma then speed is the word to describe
lean let's understand the importance of
lean
there are many benefits of lean and some
of them are reduced cost reduced cycle
time more throughput and increase
productivity
despite all of these benefits lean is
not implemented by most of the
organizations because of the
misconception that it is only suited in
manufacturing areas
the reason for this misconception is the
beginning of lean it began and grew in
popularity in the manufacturing areas
starting with Toyota
in recent years one can notice more
applications of Lane in other areas such
as Healthcare and the transactional
space
however the truth is that lean Concepts
can be applied in any business and in
any process
on the next screen let's discuss how
lean and Six Sigma combine
lean and Six Sigma are two different
principles or methodologies that combine
to form and create one powerful
continuous Improvement methodology
they have various overlapping goals
toward the improvement with the aim of
creating the most efficient system
though the approaches are different the
methods complement each other
lean Six Sigma takes the power and rigor
of Six Sigma methodology and combines it
with lean Concepts leading to faster
results better quality and improved
customer satisfaction
let's look at the differences between
lean and Six Sigma lean focuses on
efficiency by identifying value from the
customer's point of view removing
unnecessary steps in the process and
improving process speed or velocity
on the other hand Six Sigma focuses on
Effectiveness with the help of
breakthrough processes identifying root
causes and reduction in variation
therefore when six sigmas combine with
lean it is possible to achieve business
transformation
so remember lean is about speed with a
focus on efficiency Six Sigma is about
quality with a focus on Effectiveness
and lean Six Sigma brings the best of
both together
peeled a better result first Implement
lean to streamline the process this
helps to understand the chronic problems
and the ways to handle them quickly
once the problem is identified use six
single methodology to analyze the issues
and provide business Improvement
transformation
in other words lean is used to reduce
the waste and Six Sigma is used to
reduce the variation let us understand
process mapping in this screen
process mapping refers to a workflow
diagram which gives a clear
understanding of the process or a series
of parallel processes it is also known
as process charting or flow charting
process mapping can be done either in
the measure phase or the analyze phase
the features of process mapping are as
follows
process mapping is usually the first
step in process improvement process
mapping gives a wider perspective of the
problems and opportunities for process
Improvement
it is a systematic way of recording all
the activities performed
process mapping can be done by using any
of the methods like flow charts written
procedures and detailed work
instructions
let us understand process input and
output variables in this screen
any Improvement of a process has a few
prerequisites
to improve a process the key process
output variables kpov and key process
input variables kpiv should first be
measured
metrics for key process variables
include percent effective operation cost
elapsed time backlog quantity and
documentation errors
critical variables are best identified
by the process owners
process owners know and understand each
step of a process and are in a better
position to identify the critical
variables initially
once identified the relationship between
the variables is depicted using tools
such as cypok and cause and effect
Matrix
the process input variables results are
compared to determine which input
variables have the greatest effect on
the output variables this lesson will
focus on the improved phase of the DMACC
process
the improved phase comes after the
analyze phase
in the analyze phase the data was
analyzed and some patterns were found to
identify where the problem lies
in this lesson we will review the
improve phase to understand how to go
about the improvements their validation
Etc
let us start with the objectives of this
lesson in the next screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to describe the concepts of design
of experiments doe explain the uses of
residuals analysis and box and Cox
transformation technique discuss the
cause and effect Matrix and the 5y tool
in root cause analysis
explain the lean and Kaizen techniques
let us proceed to the first topic of
this lesson in the following screen
in this topic we will discuss design of
experiments in detail let us learn about
design of experiments in the following
screen
design of experiments or doe consists of
a series of planned and scientific
experiments that test various input
variables and their eventual impact on
the output variable
design of experiments can be used as a
One-Stop alternative for analyzing all
influencing factors to arrive at a
successful model
doe is applicable where multiple input
variables known as factors affect a
single response variable an output
variable is the variable which may get
affected due to multiple input variables
doe is preferred over one factor at a
time or ofat experiments because it does
not miss interactions
with techniques like blocking
experimental error can be eliminated the
trials should be randomized to avoid
concluding that a factory is significant
when the time at which it is measured or
the sequence followed may have
influenced the response's result
an example of blocking is highlighted in
the table given on the screen
with techniques like replication many
experiments can be conducted to ensure a
robust model
we will understand the concept of design
experiments through an example in the
upcoming screen
to understand doe and the main effects
consider the following example
suppose the objective of the experiment
is to achieve uniform part Dimensions at
a particular Target value to reduce
variations
the inputs X or factors that affect the
output are cycle time mold temperature
holding pressure holding time and
material type
the process is the molding process and
the output or the response of the
experiment is the part hardness
the components of the doe in this
example will be described in the next
screen
output response factors levels and
interactions are the components of the
doe in the given example
click each component to learn more
the response variable is the part
hardness and is measured as a result of
the experiment and is used to judge the
effects of factors
factors of this experimental setup are
cycle time mold temperature holding
pressure holding time and material type
factors can be varied and are called
levels the molding temperature can be
set at 600 degrees Fahrenheit or 700
degrees Fahrenheit
plastic type can be fillers and no
fillers and the material type has two
levels of nylon or acetyl
interactions refer to the degree to
which factors depend on one another
some experiments evaluate the effective
interactions
in the molding example the interaction
between cycle time and molding
temperature is critical
the best level for time depends on what
temperature is set
if the temperature level is higher the
cycle time may have to be decreased to
achieve the same response from the
experiment
let us understand full factorial
experiments through an example
full factorial experimental design
contains all combinations of all levels
of all factors
this experimental design ensures no
possible treatment combinations get
omitted hence full factorial designs are
often preferred over other designs the
table shown here is for a two-way heat
treatment experiment there are two
factors oven time X2 and the temperature
X1 at which the material is drawn out of
the oven
the output y of the experiment is the
hardness of the material
each of the factors has two levels
this example illustrates the concepts of
main factor and interaction effects
from the table it is clear that without
repetition the experiment will have four
different outcomes based on the changes
in levels of factors
each experimental trial here is repeated
to give a total of eight values
let us now analyze the mean effect an
analysis of the means helps in
understanding how a change in
temperature at which the material is
drawn creates a difference in the
average part hardness this affects the
output and is called the main effect
analysis of means also tells how a
change in oven time creates a difference
in the average part hardness this is
also the main effect
analysis of means explains how
interaction between temperature and time
affects the average part hardness this
is known as the interaction effect
let us next understand the concept of
main effect
for calculating the main effect the
means have to be calculated hence to
calculate the main effect of draw
temperature the mean of the hardness
values has to be calculated
the values are populated in the
corresponding Columns of draw
temperatures The Columns have been
labeled A1 and A2
the value of the mean of A1 is 91 and of
A2 is 82. plotting the data on a graph
shows that changing draw temperatures
changes the average hardness
similarly we calculate the mean of
hardness values in B1 and B2
the values are 87 and 86 which are
plotted on a graph
it can be seen that changing the oven
time does not affect the average
hardness
now let us understand how the
interaction between temperature and time
affects the average part hardness
to check out draw temperature and oven
time interact the mean values are
calculated by taking the repetition
response hence the cell A1 B1 has the
mean of the values 90 and 87. the cell
A2 B1 has the mean of the values 84 and
87.
after the mean values are calculated
they are plotted on a graph
the graph shows that to reduce
interactions low temperature and high
oven time should be selected to have the
desired output of high hardness also
called renel hardness
if low hardness is the desired output
the experimental setup should have high
draw temperature and high oven time
the ideal case is represented by the
parallel lines which give the desired
output based on the main effect without
being affected by the interaction
between the factors
the parallel lines are shown as a dotted
line
the mean of the factors are also
calculated and shown in the small table
in this we will introduce the concept of
runs in design of experiments
the numbers of experiments in a doe
setting is known as runs
a full factorial experiment without
replication on five factors and two
levels is two raised to the power of
five which equals 32 runs
a full factorial experiment with one
replication on five factors and two
levels is 32 plus 32 which equals 64
runs
a half fractional factorial experiment
without replication on five factors and
two levels is two raised to the power of
five minus one which equals 16 runs
a half factorial experiment with one
replication on five factors and two
levels is 16 plus 16 which equals 32
runs
the number of combinations can be
determined using the formula L to the
power of f where L is the number of
levels and F is the number of factors
half fractional factorial is calculated
using the formula L to the power F minus
one
at three levels five factors full
factorial experiment would amount to 243
trials and half factorial experiments
would require 81 trials
the difference between full factorial
and half fractional factorial
experiments can be seen from the number
of runs
let us proceed to the next topic of this
lesson in the following screen
in this topic we will discuss root cause
analysis in detail
we will learn about residuals analysis
in the following screen
while performing the regression analysis
of a linear or non-linear model you will
get a model with the predicted values
some of the data might fit within that
model whereas others may be scattered
across
the model equation predicts one value
for Y at level X however the actual
value for y observed at that level of X
is different from the predicted value
this difference between the observed
value of the dependent variable Y and
the predicted value is called residual
the formula to calculate residual is
observed value minus predicted value
residuals are considered to be errors
and each data point has one residual you
can validate the assumptions on random
errors as they are independent exhibit
normal distribution have a constant
various Sigma Square for all the
settings of the independent variables
and finally have a mean as zero
in the next slide we will continue to
discuss residuals analysis
as discussed in the previous screen
while performing any regression analysis
you will observe that not all the data
fits into the linear model as the linear
regression model is not always
appropriate for the data therefore you
should assess the appropriateness of the
model by defining residuals and
examining the residual plots
if all assumptions are satisfied the
residuals should randomly vary around
zero and the spread of the residuals
should be the same throughout the plot
that is no systematic patterns are
observed
remember in residuals analysis both the
sum and the mean of the residuals are
zero
residuals and diagnostic statistics
allow you to identify patterns that
either poorly fit in the model with a
strong influence on the estimated
parameters or have a high Leverage
it is helpful to interpret these
Diagnostics together to understand any
potential problems with the model
in the next screen we will learn about
data transformation using the Box Cox
method the available data must be
transformed when it does not exhibit the
normal distribution box and Cox in the
year 1964 developed a procedure for
estimating the best transformation to
normality within the family of power
transformation
it works by taking the current Y data
and raising it to the power known as
Lambda the formula for transformation of
Y is represented as y asterisk equals y
to the power Lambda minus 1. the whole
divided by Lambda this formula is used
where the value of Lambda is not zero if
the value of Lambda is zero you can use
natural logarithm to transform y
the family of power Transformations can
be used for the following
for converting a data set so that
parametric statistics can be used here
Lambda is a parameter to be defined from
the data for any continuous data greater
than zero this will not work when the
values are less than or equal to zero
transforming specs note that the use of
the transformation does not guarantee
normality
in the next screen we will continue the
discussion on data transformation using
box and Cox
the table on the screen shows how the
data can be transformed using Lambda the
First Column lists down values of Lambda
and the second column shows the
transformed value
if the value of Lambda is negative two
it becomes y to the power negative 2
after the transformation which is 1
divided by y Square
similarly if the value of Lambda is
negative one after transformation it
becomes y to the power of negative one
which is one divided by Y and so on note
that you will use a different formula
when you have the value of Lambda as
zero wherein you will take natural log
of the value y
similarly transform values are also
shown on the screen click the example
button to know more
let us look at an example of how data
transformation is done using box Cox the
difference between original data and the
data transformed using Fox Cox is shown
on the screen Figure 1 shows the
original data plotted on a histogram
here you can see that this data is
abnormal in figure 2 the box and Cox
procedure is applied on the original
data and it is transformed you can see
that the data in the second figure is
more normal than figure 1.
let us learn about process input and
output variables in the following screen
process Improvement has a few
prerequisites before a process can be
improved it must first be measured to
assess the level of improvement required
the first step is to know the input
variables and output variables and check
for any relationship
the sipoc map and the cause and effect
Matrix are very helpful
there are many ways to measure the key
process variables metrics such as the
percent defective operation costs
elapsed time backlog quantity and
documentation errors can be used
critical variables are best identified
by the process owners
once they are identified cause and
effect tools are used to establish the
relationship between variables
a cause and effect Matrix is shown on
the screen the key process input
variables have been listed vertically
and the key process output variables
horizontally
for each of the output variables a
prioritization number is assigned
numbers which reflect the effect of each
input variable on the output variable
are entered in The Matrix
the process output priority is
Multiplied with the input variables to
arrive at the results for each input
variable
the values are added to determine the
results for each input variable
for process input variable 1 the output
variables are 3 4 and 7 with a
prioritization value of 4 7 and 11
respectively therefore multiplying the
output variables with their
corresponding prioritization numbers and
adding those gives 117 which is around
33 percent of the total effect
the process input variables results are
compared to each other to determine
which input variable has the greatest
effect on the output variables
click the cause and effect Matrix
template button to view another template
a sample of the cause effect Matrix or
CE Matrix is shown here
the CE Matrix gives the correlation
between input and output variables
in this screen we will discuss the steps
to update the CE Matrix
the steps for updating the cause and
effect Matrix are
list the input variables vertically
under the column process inputs
list the output variables horizontally
under the numbers 1 to 15. these output
variables are important from the
customer's perspective one can refer to
either the qfd or the ctq tree to know
the key output variables
rank the output variables based on
customer priority
these numbers can also be taken from the
qfd
the input variables with the highest
score become the point of focus in the
project
another method to establish the cause
effect relation is the cause and effect
diagram this is explained in detail in
the following screen the cause and
effect diagram is used to find the root
cause and the potential solutions to a
problem a cause and effect diagram
breaks down a problem into bite-sized
pieces and also displays the possible
causes in a graphic manner it is also
known as the fishbone the 4M or the
Ishikawa diagram
it is commonly used to examine effects
or problems to find out the possible
causes and to indicate the possible
areas to collect data
the steps involved in the cause and
effect diagram are
all the possible causes of the problem
or effects selected for analysis are
brainstormed
the major causes are classified under
the headings of materials methods
machinery and Manpower
the cause and effect diagram is drawn
with the problem at the point of the
Central Access line and the causes on
the diagram are written under the
classifications chosen
the next screen illustrates the cause
and effect diagram with the help of an
example
the diagram shows the cause and effect
diagram for the possible causes of
solder defects on a Reflow soldering
line
this diagram helps in collecting data
and discovering the root cause during
brainstorming the group looked at all
the major causes and then grouped them
under the main headings
under materials causes like types of
solder paste components and the
components packaging used are considered
the major causes under methods are
technology and preventive maintenance
similarly operator and schedule are
placed under Manpower while tools and
oven are grouped under Machinery causes
the next screen will discuss another
root cause analysis tool in detail
5y is one of the tools used to analyze
the root cause of a problem the
responsibility of the root cause
analysis lies with the 5y analysis team
the technical experts have a great
responsibility as the conclusion will be
drawn from the way the drill down of the
symptoms is carried out
the 5y is a very simple tool as it poses
the why question to every problem till
the root cause is obtained
it is important to know that the 5y tool
does not restrict the interrogation to
five questions
why can be asked as many times as
required till the root cause for the
problem is found
it can be used along with the cause and
effect diagram
the following screen will explain the
process of the 5y technique
the process for the 5y technique is
identify the problem and emphasize the
problem statement arrange for a
brainstorming session with the team
including subject matter experts process
owners and team members
explain the purpose and the problem
statement
analyze scenarios working backwards from
the problem
ask why for the answers of tanned until
the root cause is found
normally reasons like insufficient
resources and time become the root
causes
if the drill down in brainstorming is
carried out in the right direction it is
often found that the root cause is
related to the process therefore the
occurrence of a problem is often due to
the process and not an individual or a
team
in the next screen we will understand
the concept of the 5y technique with the
help of an example
the process for the 5y technique is
identify the problem and emphasize the
problem statement
a range for a brainstorming session with
the team including subject matter
experts process owners and team members
explain the purpose and the problem
statement
analyze scenarios working backwards from
the problem
ask why for the answers of tanned until
the root cause is found
normally reasons like insufficient
resources and time become the root
causes
if the drill down in brainstorming is
carried out in the right direction it is
often found that the root cause is
related to the process
therefore the occurrence of a problem is
often due to the process and not an
individual or a team
in the next screen we will understand
the concept of the five wide technique
with the help of an example
in this topic we will discuss lean Tools
in detail let us learn about lean
techniques in the following screen
the eight Lane techniques are Kaizen
vokayoke 5S just in time kanban judoka
tact time and hijunka click each
technique to know more
Kaizen or continuous Improvement is the
building block of all lean production
methods Kaizen philosophy implies that
all incremental changes routinely
applied and sustained over a long period
of time results in significant
improvements
the second technique is pokayoka it is
also known as mistake proofing it is
good to do it right the first time and
even better to make it impossible to do
it wrong the first time
The Prompt received to save the word
document before closing it without
saving is an example of pocoyocha
5S is a set of five Japanese words which
translate to sort set in order shine
standardize and sustain this is a simple
and yet powerful tool of lean
the sword principle refers to sorting
items according to a rule the rule could
be frequency of use or time of use
after sorting the objects are set in
order
the place for everything is defined and
everything is placed accordingly
cleaning of the area refers to the shine
principle
the fourth step requires formation and
circulation of a set of written
standards
the last step refers to sustaining the
process by following the standards set
earlier
5S is useful as a framework to create
and maintain the workplace
just in time or jit is another lean
technique
this technique philosophizes about
producing the necessary units in the
necessary quantity at the necessary time
with the required quality
as an item is removed from a shelf of a
Supermart the system confirms it and
automatically sends a note for
replenishment
this kind of technique can be used in an
organization to prevent accumulation of
inventory
the fifth technique is known as kanban
which means signboard in Japanese
kanban utilizes visual display cards to
Signal movement of material between the
steps of a product process
this is one of the examples of visual
control in Lane
the next technique is geduca it means
automation with human touch and is
sometimes known as autonomation jiduca
implements supervisory function in the
production line and stops the process as
soon as a defect is encountered the
process does not start again till the
root cause of the defect is eliminated
tact time is the maximum time in which
the customer demands need to be met for
example a customer needs 100 products
and the company has 420 minutes of
available production time tax time
equals time available divided by demand
in this case the company has a maximum
of 4.2 minutes per product this will be
the target for the production line
the final technique is hijenka which
means production leveling and smoothing
it is a technique to reduce waste
occurring due to fluctuating customer
demand
let us understand the concept of cycle
time reduction in this screen
cycle time reduction refers to the
reduction in the time taken for a
complete process
implementing lean techniques reduces
cycle time and releases resources faster
than any other method
low cycle time increases productivity
and throughput
lean techniques release resources early
achieving more production with the same
machinery
internal and external waste is reduced
and the operational process is
simplified with a decrease in product
damage
all these factors help in satisfying the
customer and staying ahead in
competition
the following screen describes the
concept of cycle time reduction through
an example
the changes brought by implementing lean
techniques on an existing process are
Illustrated in the given diagram
things to be noticed are number of
operators used work allocation to The
Operators path or the movement in the
process and flow of the process
notice the changes brought about by
implementing lean techniques on the old
process
first the path followed by the material
in between the process is considerably
reduced this decreases the cycle time
for the entire process
second the number of operators is
reduced to three when compared to five
in the old process
operator 1 can now work on process one
and process 4. similarly Operator 2 can
work on process 2 and process 3. hence
there is an increased productivity of
The Operators and the remaining skilled
operators can be used in some other
process or system
the next screen will introduce the
concept of Kaizen and Kaizen Blitz
Kaizen means good change in Japanese
kaizan is a continuous Improvement
method to improve the functions of an
organization
the improvements could be in process
productivity quality Technology and
Safety it brings in small incremental
changes to the process
and Blitz is known as chaison event or
Kaizen Workshop if the event is tightly
defined and the scope is evident for
implementation processes can be easily
changed and improved teams could improve
processes through creative problem
solving methods in structured workshops
over a short time scale
the next screen will provide the
differences between Kaizen and Kai's n
Blitz
the differences between Kaizen and
Kaizen Blitz are Kaizen is a method that
brings continuous Improvement in the
organization while kais and Blitz is a
workshop or an event that brings in
change
in small incremental changes in the
organization there are no major changes
made within the processes Caius and
Blitz is applied when a rapid solution
is required the Kaizen method follows a
step-by-step process it standardizes
measures and compares the process with
the requirement before improving it and
Blitz plans for the event executes it
arrives at a solution and follows it
through
all the people of the organization are
involved in Kaizen whereas kais and
Blitz is led by the top management and
others are invited to participate
the decision-making lies with the upper
management
in Kaizen the process is standardized
and measurements are regularly collected
and compared before the decision is
taken this relatively delays the process
of decision making
Blitz decisions are taken soon and the
process change is wrapped in three to
five days
Kaizen is a continuous Improvement
method whereas the keys and Blitz is
part of the improving process
in follows pdca in essence plan do and
check and act for the improvement
process
guys and Blitz uses pdca for execution
where the events are planned conducted
decided implemented and followed up
the following screen will elaborate on
the concepts of Kaizen and Kaizen Blitz
through examples
and Blitz are practiced in many
organizations across the world the
examples of Kaizen and kaiza and Blitz
method are shown here click each tab to
know more
the Toyota production system is known
for Kaizen practices in Toyota if any
issue arises in the production line the
line Personnel seesaw the production
until the issue is resolved once the
solution is implemented the team resumes
the production cycle
a wood window company in the state of
Iowa U.S uses the case and Blitz method
to redesign their shop floor and replace
expensive non-flexible automation with
low-cost highly flexible cellular
applications
eliminating scraps reorganizing work
areas and reducing inventory are some of
the examples of quick implementation
through Kaizen Blitz let us get some
Concepts cleared on multi-varied charts
a popular tool used by Green bells and
black belts
multivari charts helps you understand
within peace peace peace and time time
variation
these variations are also known as
positional variation
cyclical variation and temporal
variation with the help of multivari
chart you can clearly identify what is
the major source of variation in your
process
this variation family has roots in
common and special causes of variation
so black belts need not worry about
dealing with a new family of variation
use the tool provided MBA in your
toolkit to conduct a multi-very analysis
multi-variate analysis helps you to
identify the dominant source of
variation that is to say within peace
peace piece or lots a lot
this is a very important tool that is
used in almost all dfss implementations
Hue Matrix is a method for selecting a
concept amongst multiple concepts by
using a scoring Matrix and is used in
almost all dfss implementations
the Pew Matrix is closely tied to the
qfd and is in the form of a
prioritization matrix
options are scored relatively score one
for a solution better than the current
solution
score zero if the solution is the same
in Effectiveness and score a 1 if the
solution is worse than the current
solution
this method is effective only when you
have multiple solution Alternatives and
you wish to choose one for your project
deployment
now if you go to some social media sites
and you went to LinkedIn for example
you'd find that about 40 percent of
managers and top companies are lean
certified you'll see that certified lean
Six Sigma professionals earn 40 percent
more than their non-certified peers and
you know the majority of quality
managers hold multiple certifications
now it stands to reason that because the
methodology is all about solving
critical issues for an organization that
when you empower
somebody
through the ability to make changes to
the organization when they've got
leadership support and they've got a
skill set the capability to take on
those challenges and lead people
as part of a team through a project that
addresses and permanently resolves a
critical issue for that business that
that individual is going to be
recognized not only have they driven
value through the organization as you
can see you know from Motorola to Ford
and so on
but
they've proven themselves as somebody
that can really get things done and so
you know one of the best things that
I've personally found through my
involvement in lean six people over the
years is that you're really able to
tackle those critical
those big issues and key opportunities
that an organization periodically faces
and and get things done and that's
exciting it's fun to come to work each
day knowing you're going to make a
change have a positive impact not only
on the organization but on the people
around you as well and so you certainly
will be recognized noticed in you know
succeed as a result of that
now over the course of the training we
go through six different learning units
now the first learning unit is around
providing an overview of lean and Six
Sigma so a little bit about the history
you know how to lean come about uh how
did Six Sigma come about you know what
are the methodologies and you know what
are some of the historical what's the
historical context of each so that you
appreciate that there's been an
evolution of sorts from
you know using the methodology and
incorporating the tools that we used
within lean Six Sigma to where we are
today where it's a Mainstay as a
continuous Improvement approach for you
know so many different businesses
we move in to define the measure analyze
and prove and control phases of our of a
project because it is a project
based methodology we tackle issues or
challenges in an organization and we we
put projects together to address those
issues
and so you might have heard the phrase
or the acronym demac and domainic is
really just the acronym for defined
measure analyze Improvement control it's
easier to say I suppose than you know
five separate words but through any
Improvement initiative or any work that
we do in an organization we start out by
defining what it is that we want to
achieve you know
it's not a lone wolf activity
you put together a project team you put
subject matter experts around you to
work on that issue you're leading that
team so you're demonstrating and gaining
leadership competence but you're also
putting team a team of people around so
that helps ensure that you've got the
right
knowledge process knowledge you've got
the right set of people that to help
it's not all one person having to do
everything you can delegate and so on
and maybe most importantly you get
buy-in from the subject matter experts
because they're part of the solution
they're part of the team of people that
are going to be figuring this out and so
in the Define phase you you know you
select your team members
you put a project Charter together that
says you know here's the objective of
what we're going to be working on if
we're successful this is what we'll
achieve these are maybe some of the
resources we anticipate needing for this
project here's the timeline that we're
you know thinking that this will take
and so on so those parameters create the
foundation for your project and it also
ensures that everybody's aligned and on
the same page and knows that what
they're working on
As you move into the measure phase
here's where we talk about the tools or
the strategies we can employ to measure
and understand our current state where
are we today as we start this
it takes the blinders off there's no Foo
Fighting ourselves thinking things are
maybe better than they really are or
worse than they really are it's about
taking stock of what the reality is for
our current situation
and so we use a variety of tools or
strategies to accomplish that we make
sure whatever information or data that
we're using can be relied upon
you know just because we run a report or
a computer generates a report for us to
look at doesn't mean that the
information is correct you have to
validate it make sure that whatever
critical information we're using and
making decisions upon can be trusted
as we move through the measure phase
using the tools or strategies to create
that current state understanding
we move into the analyze phase because
the reality is this that
we only have limited resources we only
have so much time so much money so much
energy so much whatever is important to
us it's limited we want to make sure
that we invest it in the right ways in
the right places at the right time and
so on
and so because of that we go through the
analyze phase to identify those critical
elements of our process that we're
trying to improve whether trying to
improve the financial part of the
business whether we're trying to improve
a customer related part of the business
an employee related and so on
and so it's important for us to be able
to
understand those critical elements so
that we can invest our resources wisely
because not every element or every
component or every piece of that you
know area of the business is going to be
equally important and so if we can
invest our resources on the right places
in the right way at the right time we're
going to get the best return on that
investment
and so the analyze phase is about using
tests quite often we use a lot of
statistical Tools in this area and we
teach them of course through the two
through the training so they become much
more intuitive
that you can make that determination
and as we've identified those critical
elements where we're going to invest our
resources we move into the improved
phase and in the improved phase this is
about using tools to identify to test to
maybe experiment to figure out what are
the best ways to go about improving
those critical elements we might pilot
something we might use brainstorming we
might use design of experiments we might
use root cause analysis and so on to be
able to figure out what's the best way
to not only identify those improvements
but also the most effective way to
implement them successfully as we've
done that we move into the control phase
because we want to make sure that
whatever we've done is sustainable you
know it doesn't help us if we make a
quick Improvement and then everybody
celebrates and it goes back to
afterwards to the old way of doing
things that's not what this is about
this is about permanently changing
things for the better
and so it's important for us to be able
to use tools or strategies to make sure
that the improvements we've generated
are sustainable in the long term
and so we can use you know statistical
process control charts or SPC charts for
short we can use control plans and so on
and so through those five phases to
define the measure of the analyze the
Improvement control phases we build upon
that Foundation or that understanding of
lean and Six Sigma are all about that we
learned at the outset of the training
program
to truly understand how we can improve
the business in the long term across
those areas that will deliver the best
return so let's talk a little bit about
lean Six Sigma just from the short
discussion we've had so far it should
become somewhat evident that it's a
disciplined process you know it's not
about using Intuition or best guesses
it's about using information or
sometimes what we can say data but data
is information using data to make better
decisions
it's a much more robust much more
disciplined way about going doing to
about doing things it's also about
continuous Improvement each day we want
to get better than we were the day you
know that we were the day before and so
we don't necessarily have to make these
gigantic leaps you know every single day
but those incremental improvements over
time add up significantly and so every
day we get better and better and lean
Six Sigma can help accelerate the pace
of that Improvement certainly when you
instill and provide you know seamless
training and resources to people you
instill that capability in your people
and you Empower them to make changes
across those areas of the business that
need it and will benefit the most that's
very powerful
in order for that to be successful of
course you have to have consistent top
management support
and so when the leader of an
organization says look the way we're
going to make Improvement across
critical areas those key issues and
challenges that we face is through a
more standardized more systematic more
robust approach lean Six Sigma and that
sends a message and so you need to be
able to empower your employees you need
to have that the with the capability and
you need to have them supported now I
want you to think about for a moment a
scenario from two perspectives
the first perspective is this
let's pretend that you own a restaurant
and you can imagine as the owner of a
restaurant you work long hours
you probably work six or even seven days
a week as the owner you probably work
long hours mornings you might work
nights as well you don't get a lot of
time for vacation now the good news is
that you happen to be a member of a
local trade Association or Chamber of
Commerce or some type of group that has
a contest new in the contest and you
have a two-week vacation it's been a
long time since you've had a vacation
and so as you can imagine most employees
when they take their vacation they're
pretty happy but in the back of their
mind they're wondering about work and so
as the owner of this restaurant you're
going to phone the manager left in
charge and ask them for some information
because you'd like to know how the
restaurant is doing in your absence kind
of questions do you think you might ask
well I think that as an order of a
restaurant I would probably ask about
food sales I might ask about beverage
sales or liquor sales I might ask about
dessert sales appetizer sales I might
ask about any employee issues or any
equipment issues
just like any manager any owner any
business leader will want to know how
the business is doing across different
areas they probably have a series of
metrics maybe it's on a balanced
scorecard or some kind of a dashboard
but they're usually metrics
or measures that that manager that
business leader will want to know to
gauge how well the business is
performing you know there's often a
financial or a series of financial
metrics maybe it's it maybe it's profit
net profit gross profit maybe it's sales
revenue maybe it's something else but
there are usually some Financial metrics
just like there might be customer
related metrics and employee metrics and
so on
well the reality is this that they're
really outputs they're effects in an
equation we could say that there are why
they're the result of other things
they're they're a byproduct of the
activities being performed across the
business and how well those activities
are being performed now let's look at
that restaurant from a different
scenario and let's pretend instead of
being the manager or the owner or a
customer you know as you can imagine the
customer probably has a choice of a
large variety of restaurants different
styles of food different price points
different types of ambiance customer
might be interested the speed of service
are they there for a long leisurely
dinner are they on a work lunch what's
the presentation of food like what's the
quality of the service like
lots of different things a customer
might be interested in and consider when
determining which restaurant to select
well those are the inputs they're the
causes they're the things that drive the
sales the customer satisfaction the
employee productivity the employee
engagement and so on
the results or the effects those whys
are really a function of those inputs or
those causes and the better we
understand and can identify and manage
those inputs those X's the better we can
determine what our why will be and so
lead Six Sigma is about solving this
equation
wherever we've got a metric or a measure
within our business that's really
struggling or isn't where it needs to be
or could be or believe it should be
if we can understand what those drivers
are for that metric those exits will say
the causes then we can focus our efforts
on improving those X's by being more
surgical in terms of our Improvement
approach and our why will take care of
itself too often we throw things at that
Y without necessarily understanding what
those X's are
and very often when we've got a process
or an area of our business that's
struggling or suffering we're not
performing as well as it needs to it's
because we don't really understand what
those X's are at all or we misunderstand
what they might be and so when we solve
this equation we understand what the
drivers are the causes the inputs to our
critical processes and we focus on those
most critical axes then our y becomes
better and we see better better results
and when we work on a project to
identify those X's we as I started the
presentation talking about typically
work through this demand or Define
measure analyze improve control project
approach and they're really phases of a
project so you know we start by defining
the problem the statement we'll say we
might say we want to improve
productivity from where we believe we
are today to some improved level
tomorrow or at the end of the project
maybe it's improving customer
satisfaction from where we are today to
somewhere else maybe it's improving
something else
so we Define our terms we determine
who's going to be involved in the
project who who makes sense to have on
the project team
we think this will take so much time and
so on so we set the foundation we align
our goals we all understand what we're
working towards and so on
we collect data as we move into the
measure phase to understand you know
what the current state really is we
create a process map to understand the
elements and this the steps the pieces
of our project
we determine through the analyze phase
which are the most critical elements of
that process
once we've done that we can identify
prioritize test the improvements
and we set up a control plan towards the
end to make sure that going forward our
improvements will be sustained
because the project team that we're
working with isn't a permanent fixture
it's probably a group of four five six
eight people that will work on this
project until we've achieved some goal
and then it disbands
and so it's important for this team to
leave behind this Legacy saying here's a
more robust way here's a control plan
we'll say to make sure that the people
involved in this process know how to
manage it effectively so that the gains
that we've been able to achieve through
this project are sustained and perhaps
even continue to be improved upon now it
stands to reason of course that the team
members are often people that are
involved in that process in any event
and so they'll be involved going forward
just maybe not in a more formal sense
that you know we had a project here
before and they were focused on this
effort and and then you know you move on
and you go back to
um you know your regular roles but the
elements of that process control plan
stay in place and so the new normal the
new way of doing things is much more
clearly laid out for you as we go
through those those different phases
that Define measure analyze and control
phases and we talk about tools or
strategies this is a small sample of
some of those tools or strategies and so
as an example you know cypok is just an
acronym stands for supplier input
process output and customer and it's a
way of visually mapping out the steps of
a process
and when we map out those steps of a
process we look at each element of the
process you know what's who's the
supplier what's the supplier for that
element
what's the input what's the process step
what's the output of the result and
who's the customer for that element
it's a very good visual that helps also
scope the project from its starting
point to its ending point because you
want to make sure that everybody
understands the things that are
happening today and very often what will
happen is you'll have multiple people on
the team saying gosh I didn't know
that's what happened after my
involvement or I didn't know what
happened before my involvement when you
start having those conversations people
can often Identify some quick hit
improvements
saying well gosh if I if I had known
that then I could have done this
differently and so that's often a very
valuable exercises you're starting your
project you know VOC voice of the
customer ctq is critical to Quality Tree
Quality Function deployment and so on
so these are acronyms and as we go
through of course these will become much
more familiar for you as we talk about
them and teach you how to use them now
you'll notice that some of the tools are
listed in multiple places and it's
because there's no set rule that says
You must use an FMEA or failure modes
and effects analysis tool only in the
defined phase
these tools were not designed for lean
Six Sigma they were designed to solve
specific problems and very often they
were developed or designed or invented
with an organizations and considered
proprietary they were Trade Secrets of
sorts at you know once upon a time and
so you know because they were invented
or designed to solve a specific problem
or answer a specific question if that
problem or question happens in a
different phase of the project and
that's the right way to solve it then
you use the tool that's appropriate
now very often you'll use you know the
scipop map very early on in the project
just like you know your voice the
customer it makes sense to use it very
early on so you understand what your
customers want as soon as possible you
know you're not going to do your VOC at
the end of the project when you might
find well gosh they wanted something
completely different you want to do it
on the front end to make sure you align
what you're doing with what your
customers are looking for stands to
reason now lean Six Sigma is going to be
successful for the following reasons
when management supports lean Six Sigma
as a business strategy it says this is
the way we're going to make important
decisions we're no longer going to rely
on gut feel or intuition
we're going to use a more robust way to
make important decisions so if we rely
on information or data instead
it uses that Dometic methodology for
solving problems that's a very logical
very straightforward makes a lot of
sense you know let's define what we're
looking at let's measure where we're at
today let's analyze to figure out what's
important let's figure out what we're
going to do about it the improvements
and then let's make sure that we can
control it going forward
very straightforward very logical makes
a lot of sense and we of course
incorporate the tools or the strategies
within that framework or within that
domain methodology so that we can answer
the questions we need to move forward
we have well-defined projects that
directly impact the organization's
bottom line now I will expand on that by
saying that what's really important is
we work on those issues that are
important to the organization
very often they have a financial
component certainly when you can argue
that this project will deliver you know
this many dollars or this this much
money to the organization's bottom line
that becomes a compelling argument for
the project however there are often
times when an organization will take on
a project because of some other reason
maybe they're trying to mitigate some
long-term risk maybe they're trying I
here's an example I I work with an
organization that really wanted to be a
good Community citizen really good
corporate Citizen and they partnered
with different charitable organizations
in their community and periodically do
projects for them
didn't necessarily help the businesses
bottom line but they did it because they
believed it was the right thing to do
often
lean six signal will help increase
customer satisfaction
in fact I would say that virtually every
project you do in some respect has an
impact on your customer
and very often it also helps use
statistical methods so we'll require or
will require the extensive use of
statistical methods so for example if we
look at our measure at the beginning of
the project we say here's how well we're
performing when we started
at the end of the project now here's how
well we're performing after we can run a
test to determine whether or not that
difference is likely to happen by chance
we would we would you know most
instances if I know it isn't uh by
chance it's because the improvements we
put in place let's not just us saying
hey things seem better people seem
happier customers seem better I think
we're making more money it's not a soft
statement like that that we're making
we're able to demonstrate through
numbers saying that yes we've made a
meaningful change to the business now
some key terms that we would want to
look at and talk about as
we move forward now we keep saying the
word or the words lean Six Sigma now you
might be wondering what is a sigma well
a sigma is another way to say the
standard deviation of a process metric
or a measure
now you can imagine if we have some type
of a measure in our business maybe it's
profitability maybe it's custom
satisfaction maybe it's employee
productivity whatever that measure is we
don't simply take one measure at one
period of time and move on with it we
probably take it over a period of time
and there's probably some variation not
every customer gives you exactly the
same customer satisfaction score not
every transaction delivers exactly the
same amount of profitability and so on
so there's some variation
well standard deviation is the average
amount of variation about the about the
mean or the average means another way to
say average
and so we can look at a process and the
variation across that process over time
and we can measure that and we know in a
normal bell-shaped you know distribution
that if we were to take a look at that
over let's say I'll make up six months
or a year it could be any amount of time
that about 68 percent of all the results
will fall within one standard deviation
well 95 will fall within 2.99 will fall
within three and so on all the way up to
Six Sigma well with six sigmas of
variation six standard deviations and
variation it's going to capture about
99.9966 percent of all expected values
now when we can ensure that a process is
delivering within customer expectations
or customer specifications at the Six
Sigma level what we're really saying is
that if my customer wants this product
this service this whatever and here are
the parameters and how they want it and
we can consistently deliver that
99.9966 of the time Six Sigma then
that's where how good we are and so we
want to be able to deliver Flawless
performance now when we look at an
opportunity it's really just either do
it right or you do it wrong relative
customer expectations
and when you do it wrong we call it a
defect
a defect another way to say this is that
when you fall either on the lower side
or the upper side of customer
specifications it's a defect
now to put this in plain language if I
go into my local Starbucks and I order a
cup of coffee
I like my coffee to be a certain
temperature and so the company might say
that I'm going to make up some numbers
here
if that cup of coffee and it could be
tea it could be whatever is within 60 to
70 degrees Celsius that that's just the
right temperature if it's less than 60
it's too cold if it's more than 70 it's
going to be too hot so my spec limits
might be within 60 to 70 degrees Celsius
anything outside of that is a defect
our goal of course is to consistently
make that cup of coffee within spec
it's up to the customer to tell us what
those specs are if they can't tell us we
need to figure it out because that's
what will make them happy
I might not be able to say that I want
to be able to get in and out in and out
of a drive through in less than three
minutes but the business might be able
to run a test and figure out that hey
our customers as long as they get in and
out of the drive through in under three
minutes they give us really high
recommended scores well it takes longer
than three minutes the scores go down
dramatically and so sometimes a business
will have to go out and figure out what
their customers want what is that voice
of the customer
and then be able to figure out how to
deliver that consistently
now very often what happens is that an
organization will have you know a
process in place and each individual
within that process will think that
they're performing pretty well in fact
I've gone into groups where I've asked
people to prop their hand if you think
90 is good and you know most of the time
almost everybody puts up their hand
well you can imagine that if you've got
a three-step process which would be
pretty simple pretty straightforward
process three steps and you're done
well let's say at the very beginning the
process I give you 100 units
first person does their thing and 90 are
good so tenor scraptor have to be
reworked but ninety percent get to move
on and they're pretty happy they're 90
good
well the second person now gets that 90
percent
and they're 90 good so ninety percent of
that ninety percent gets passed to the
third person that's 81 the starting
point for that third person is only 81
percent and they're doing ninety percent
of that it goes down even further when
you've got multiple people involved at
each step of the process you get more
and more waste involved and that becomes
very expensive
not only does it cost a lot in terms of
scrap to rework product or Services
customers don't get what they want they
have to pay more presumably because the
company is not as efficient or as
effective as they are and they're either
absorbing the costs or passing them on
through higher prices
customers may have to wait longer it's
got to be the first got to be
frustrating for the employees
it's a bad deal and so rules for put
yield is one way to look at that
expressed as a percentage it's a way to
look at process efficiency is expressed
as a percentage you know I mentioned
earlier on that you know at the Six
Sigma level
were
99.996 good well another way to look at
that is defects per million opportunity
at the Six Sigma level we'd only produce
about 3.4 defects now that sounds really
good in fact if I said I was 99.379 I'm
good most people would be pretty happy
with that in fact I think most people
would be pretty excited they'd be
putting up banners at ham
99.379
but for every million opportunities for
defect they'd produce 6 200. anybody
want to get on a plane that's at four
Sigma I don't think so
there are some processes there's some
things that organizations do that are so
critical that you simply can't afford to
be anything but flawless
now if I'm manufacturing you know
something that you know I'm serving
popcorn or something that's much less
critical than maybe I can afford to be a
little more Cavalier with that but we
have to look at our organization say for
those critical process how good do we
have to be
and this is the way we go about getting
to be that good and when you can
Implement lean Six Sigma and you can put
it into place some of the benefits you
know they're so widespread you know when
you eliminate the root causes of
problems and defects in the process you
know you create robust products and
services you reduce process variation
you're going to you know achieve all
kinds of of benefits for your
organization you help ensure customer
satisfaction
you can reduce rework by getting it
right the first time you know imagine
what that does to employee engagement
morale
um you know when you set your employees
up for success
and they go in each day they have a
better day
and because they have a better day you
have lower turnover you have happier
customers you have lower costs it's a
win-win-win for everybody
and you can see that the benefits aren't
necessarily strictly Financial or
strictly customer driven or strictly
about employees they go hand in hand
when one benefits they all seem to
benefit they all seem to work in
conjunction that way you know I've never
talked to someone that said you know I
went home at the end of the day
yesterday because I had you know had
such a hard day I was just too
productive you just don't hear people
say that you'd hear them say instead
that I went home at the end of the day
and you know I said to my family that I
had a hard day and then they talk about
the problems or the obstacles that got
in their way well when we can remove
those obstacles those problems we can
enable people to be productive they have
better days
you have higher morale better engagement
they're happier and customers are
getting what they paid for as well and
the companies incurring lower waste and
expense because you have
all those benefits as well now the
history of lean Six Sigma is interesting
because I mentioned earlier on that none
of these tools or strategies that we
talk about were developed or invented
following six in fact the methodology
really came about back in the 1980s when
a reliability engineer by the name of
Bill Smith working with Mikhail Harry at
Motorola put together the program
because they wanted to get from where
they were where a lot of their products
were effective and they were having a
lot of challenges and issues their
competitors were simply getting better
than they were
they developed this methodology
now coincidentally some of the members
on Smith's team happen to be karate
enthusiasts they recognized the
similarity between the discipline that
they were looking at employing through
the Six Sigma thing that they were
talking about
with karate and so they call themselves
belts hence you know Green belts and
black belts that's where it came from
now
Motorola went on to win the Malcolm
Baldridge award in 1986 the inaugural
award Malcolm Baldridge was a secretary
of Commerce at one time in the United
States and a big proponent of quality
and after his death they named this very
prestigious award in his honor and
Motorola Motorola was the inaugural
winner and because of that word started
to get out and people started saying hey
what are you guys doing and people
started talking about this Six Sigma
Jack Welsh at GE got on board sometime
in the 1990s Allied signal got on board
you know today you know the vast
majority of Fortune 500 companies use
lean Six Sigma you see a proliferation
across you know smaller and smaller
organizations as well happening so small
and medium Enterprises are adopting it
I've certainly seen a number of cities
and municipalities and government
agencies adopting Six Sigma it's a very
powerful
industry neutral methodology that
enables an organization to transform
itself from the old way of thinking you
know
let's rely on gut feel or Intuition or
you know whoever is the most Authority
gets to make the decision to instead of
relying upon data let's use the
information to guide us to make our
critical decisions
and when you do that it changes the
nature of the way an organization
operates and functions and thinks about
solving its problems
and as some of these you know examples
on the slide that you can see the
savings are incredible you know you're
seeing these organizations saving
millions and in some cases billions of
dollars because they're driving waste
and efficiency out of out of their
system now there's no one single
model that says this is the only way you
can Implement a lean Six Sigma team
however this is a very good overview of
what most successful organizations look
like now whether they call these roles
by these names can vary but essentially
they function as as outlined here so you
know you'll have talk Executives that
will lead the change and provide
Direction They ultimately own the lean
Six Sigma initiatives because if they're
saying you know our our goals for the
organization are you know here here's
around profitability here is around you
know customer satisfaction want to be
the first choice of customers here's
around you know employees
and so on then they know where they need
to focus their efforts and so they can
say we need to improve in these areas
they have that broad oversight
visibility to not only where they are
today but that longer term Vision so
they can align the two
you'll have Six Sigma champions
they'll help identify and scope projects
they may be you know they may not be
c-suite Executives but they might be
vice presidents or or senior leaders
that will help identify as well the
projects that will be worked on they
have that visibility as well they're
connected that way you'll have six even
Master black belts they're the
functional leaders of the organization
they'll and they'll train other
functional leaders as well they'll train
and Coach black belts and green belts
they're the technical experts in lean
Six Sigma
they may also take on some broadly
scoped projects or strategic projects in
nature and then you'll have both green
belts and black belts now black belts
and green belts in some organizations
will be determined in terms of the time
they spend on projects as well as the
scope and complexity of those projects
so black belt for example might be a
full-time resources that's what they do
every day they work on lean Six Sigma
and they can work on lean Six Sigma
across the business it's a very very
good leadership development approach as
well when you take some of your best
employees you train them in lean Six
Sigma and then you let them
work on projects across the business
that's extremely powerful as a
development strategy green belts tend to
work on projects that aren't necessarily
as as complex or broadly scope as black
belts they may or may not be full-time
resources so for example they may say
well gosh I work in HR or I.T or
operations or Finance or engineering or
wherever
and I want to work on projects within my
area of the business and so they'll work
on it more on a part-time basis so some
percentage of their time might be
devoted to improvement work
and of course it varies from
organization to organization how they
Define you know Green belts and black
belts and and so on but this is a very
common framework now let's talk about an
example of one of the lessons that we
would talk about this one comes from
overview of lean Six Sigma so at the
outset of the training you know the
first day for example we would talk
about this in topic number three happens
to be about design for Sigma
now designed for Six Sigma or dfss for
short and I guess dfss is a lot easier
to say it's not quite the same mouthful
when we've got one of two situations
happening designed for six sigmas really
the approach that we take
when we've got a process or a product
that is too badly broken to merely fix
it needs to be instead redesigned or or
a new one developed invented of sorts
then dfss is a very good approach
alternatively if we are trying to create
to an existing product line or service
then we might use dfss as well one of
the tools within the dfss framework is
the failure modes and effects analysis
or the FMEA for short
now the FMEA is a very good preemptive
tool that helps identify potential ways
a process might fail now when we work
through the FMEA we're going to
calculate something called a risk
priority number
and it's it's simply a measure of risk
that we can
assess that would be associated with
that design or that process
and the risk priority number is the
result of looking at a potential failure
and that potential failure has been
looked at through three different lenses
the first is the occurrence how
frequently does it occur
severity how bad would it be if it did
occur and detectability what is the
strength of our detection mechanism to
stop that failure from happening in the
first place and so when we look at each
element of a process and we say to
ourselves or our team rather you know
how frequently do we think this occurs
uh how bad would it be what's the
detection we score those on scale of 1
to 10 10 being the worst you know the
most severe the most frequently
occurring and so on
multiply those scores by each other we
get that risk priority number now we can
use the FMEA on either a new process
we're designing or an existing process
for that matter might look something
like this
Well we'd say you know what's the
process step
what's the key process input in what
ways does the key process input go wrong
what's the impact on the output variable
the customer requirements how is the
customer impacted if this fails how
severe would that affect beyond the
customer
what causes the key input to go wrong
how often does it occur what are the
existing controls and procedures that
might prevent the cause or the failure
from happening
and how well can you detect or cause
detect how well can you detect uh or
prevent that failure mode from happening
and then when you take the severity on a
scale of one to ten occurrence and
detection you multiply you get that risk
priority number
now there are scales that we can use and
I would suggest that you can certainly
use this exact scale in the language
that's used here or you could go through
your project team and calibrate them and
say well look
10 being the worst on a scale of 1 to 10
for severity
you know how would we want to word that
and maybe it's catastrophic maybe it's
you know something else it's important
to make sure that everybody on the team
that's going to go through and use this
rating understands what the language
means and if hazardous without warning
makes perfect sense to you then that's
great use this language but again if it
doesn't then what would a 10 be in your
world what would a nine be in your world
and so on for a current similarly we've
got a scale here same thing in terms of
does this language do these numbers make
sense for you energy detection score
absolute uncertainty there's nothing in
place at all today very remote you know
there's a very remote chance the design
or the process control will detect
potential cause or mechanism subsequent
failure mode there's really very little
in place that will prevent it you know
remote and so on and so here we have an
example and let's pretend that we're a
big manager as a manager of that bank we
recognize that very often we compete on
our our rates and we're saying well gosh
that's a pretty tough way to to do
business and so what we're going to do
is we're going to make sure that we
provide great customer service
we want to make sure that our customers
can depend on us
and so let's look through the customer
satisfaction scores over the last period
of time let's say six months and look at
the different things that customers have
said about us so that we can identify
those areas of the business we need to
improve the most
we've done that and one of the top items
happened to be when people take up money
or cash withdrawal from the ATM the
customer's accounts debited but cash is
not paid in other words you see the slip
that your balance has been reduced by
whatever you tried to take out but
didn't dispense any cash for you so
you're going to be pretty unhappy
extremely unhappy even
fact on a scale of one to ten you might
say gosh that's a nine you might say as
the project team well what are potential
ways this could you know happen well
maybe there's not available
maybe there was a network issue it
thinks he gave the cash but it didn't
how often does it occur well the team
believes based on you know their their
research or their experience their
training they had on a scale of 110 the
first one's the seven seconds of five
now just break at this point to mention
that we haven't gone out and validated
the the data yet this is a tool we tend
to use early on in a project because we
probably have you know a quite a large
number of customer complaints we want to
filter down to the ones that are most
critical for us before we go out and
start collecting hard data and measuring
and actually testing and so on if that'd
be very potentially it's time consuming
and so this is a preemptive tool in that
sense it gets us very close to those
issues that are most important and so
you know we're still using and relying
on the subject matter experts on our
project team at this point before we
actually start going out and measuring
and collecting data in an event going
back to the FMEA we've taken those the
severity occurrence and detection scores
we've multiplied them by each other and
we've gotten 112 and 405 respectively
and I will say that I see that current
design control has been given you know
none and they score that in nine I
personally give it a 10 because if
you've got nothing in place it doesn't
get any worse than that so you know it's
a judgment call but this team gave it a
nine now as a project team you'll
probably put together some recommended
actions which they've done you might
assign responsibility and Target
completion completion dates they've left
that a little bit vague now we'll come
back to this at the end of the project
where we score this because the project
was about identifying those critical
areas let's pretend that we went out and
we verified that yes in fact this is
happening a lot you know it's not just
that we hear about it because those
customers that this happens to are the
loudest these issues really do happen a
lot and they need to be addressed and so
we've addressed them we've put
improvements in place and we have come
back to the FMEA to rescore to test to
see how effective our improvements are
now the team has said well gosh if this
happens it's still a nine the difference
after the improvements have been put in
place at the end of the project is that
they're really not happening very often
at all
we've gone from occurrence of seven down
to a four and from a five down to a two
it's because our detection mechanisms
are far more robust they're much better
in fact we've gone from seven to a one
and a five to a three and so our risk
party numbers have decreased
tremendously as well from the 112 to a
32 and from a four or five to a 54. so
we've Revisited this and we've said okay
based on the improvements we've put in
place they've been very effective and
we've been able to improve the business
as a result and customers are much
happier with us as a result of this as
well now this is just one small example
of a tool that we talk about in lean Six
Sigma
and we would certainly go through it in
more detail and we've got you know the
template for you that we would work
through as well so you'd gain an even
better understanding of how to use this
tool and what situations and
circumstances it could benefit you and
we do that through you know more than 57
hours of training in lean Six Sigma we
talk through different industry case
studies and you know more than 100 real
world examples you could attend batches
you know on weekends or weekdays or you
know whatever makes sense for your
schedule there's on-demand support with
dedicated team and simply learned
community so you can reach out and talk
to others there are guest lectures
there's training by industry experts
people that have done this and use the
methodology in in the real world and can
talk about their experiences now here
are some of the upcoming batch dates as
you can see they you know are during the
week and in evenings and weekends as
well so whatever makes sense for your
schedule there's availability so you can
select a batch that makes sense for you
on that note I see we have a few minutes
left that I'll uh open it up for any
questions that you might have I think I
can see your questions in the chat box
if you uh have anything you'd like to
ask alternatively you can also send a
note through to Simply learn directly or
go to the simply learn community and
query there
foreign
about the rpn being 126 instead of 112.
let me take a look
just like 9 times 5 times 9 should be
four or five I haven't done the math
manually but thank you for pointing that
out
um how do we get 32 yeah let me just
minimize this so I can see yeah we've
gone back through this again so you know
we will use the FMEA two points in the
project we'll do it at the beginning or
early on in the project so that we get a
sense of you know we might have 25 or 30
elements of a process that we're looking
at some larger number well that's a lot
of stuff to go investigate and test and
so this FMEA is like a filtering tool
where we can go through this with the
subject matter experts they say
you know they'll come through and
they'll we'll calculate these initial
rpns some of them will be you know like
405 is pretty high some will be much
lower I don't know if 112 would be
particularly high on most fdas but we'll
say it is this example
well we're not going to go investigate
everything nor are we going to address
everything in this project because there
may just be too much stuff there and so
we'll we'll prioritize it based on the
rpns those rpns the team believes are
critical enough that we move forward
with we go we collect data for we
validate what we thought was happening
we'd actually go measure this and test
this to see if this is really happening
and if so then we developed and
Implement improvements we make sure they
work and we come back and we visit the
afternoon at the end to make sure that
you know that they've had the desired
impact and so we would re-score it at
that point and so at the end of the
project after the improvements have been
put in place we'd say well if it happens
it's still just as bad because it you
know it is the difference is it's not
happening anymore it used to happen a
lot now because of the stuff we've done
it just doesn't happen very frequently
so let's review what is the definition
for landscape Sigma
so in recent years there were two
methods that of improving manufacturing
processes have come to the front that
are basically lean and seek Sigma they
were used to solve two different types
of cleaners problems in the past but
today lean on 16 are integrated into one
methodology and tool set for solving any
process problem in any type of
organization from Fortune 500 companies
to small private business to non-profit
institutions believe me that this is
something that is real I've been using
it in any kind of company very small
from just one person to big companies
like Coca-Cola
so 169 improves the quality of
manufacturing outputs by using
statistical tools to minimize the
variations on the other hand lean
manufacturing is a production process
that eliminates waste thereby increasing
the endpoint value for the customers
so both matters have been used
successfully by large corporations in
the United States in India and in Japan
in any part of system works
so the real truth is that at the very
beginning Min and 16 months both started
in the manufacturing side
16 months is a philosophy of Process
Management developed by Motorola in the
80s that uses statistical methods to
minimize errors over the long term
manufacturing processes tend to deviate
from the standard so 60 is not is
helping to reduce that deviation
in the case of the sixth symptom the
case of a limiting factoring sorry it
began in Japanese manufacturing after
World War II crisis
from Toyota the car manufacturing
company went to visit American plants
because they were in prices
so they organize their learnings in a
new system called did for just in time
which later was called as GPS or Toyota
production system
but that system was was a bit laid
behind after uh like in the 90s James
Walmart an american guy wrote a book
about this new methodology to be used in
any plant across the world known only
manufacturing and he call it lean
manufacturing it basic usefulness is in
providing the tool to identify the
laminate waste throughput the
manufacturing process
so this is how
Six Sigma started only manufacturing
started
so
what is lean 16ma together
in 16 is a systemic approach to
improving the way people do processing
Improvement
there's a methodology that is involved
that allows them to systematically
enhance your process business are really
in business for two reasons right one is
to satisfy the customer and the other
one is to make money
so there always is in mind you have a
systemic approach to improve improve
processes and to satisfy the customer
today what we're going to see is how the
systemic approach works and of course
we're going to see what are the benefits
so let's move to the next slide
one of the benefits is increase employee
involvement increasing employment
involvement is one of the big benefits
of namesake Sigma
through the participation and process
Improvement teams designed to help the
Improvement processes and increase value
for their own customers so people gets
really really involved because they
actually can see how they can help their
company to improve what they are doing
to improve the processes and to improve
customer satisfaction
so by involving employees and
implementation of these programs they
gain a greater appreciation for the
impact of the work they do
on bottom line business results as well
as an appreciation for how the work of
our employees and departments also
contribute to success so this is one of
the key benefits
the second benefit is that you have
reduced costs one of the primary desired
benefits is a reduction in cost
associated with improvements to process
to require less time to receive sex or
errors that can result in work
by examining the various steps involving
a process understanding what customers
value and the taking steps are imminent
eminent unnecessary steps you can also
increase the volume value value for the
customer but also you will be reducing
all your costs
as you can see
you can you can save like from 20 to 50
percent of your costs that's great thing
but as I said you are not only going to
involve your employees and reduce costs
but also you will be increasing customer
satisfaction
mythology involves a strong focus on
customer needs and delivering high value
to them
so you will not only focus on the
process but also you will know you will
also focus on how the customer is going
to receive your product and your service
and of course ultimately increase
consumer satisfaction we need to repeat
business increase positive word of mouth
and with successful implementation you
will also increase sales and of course
overall business access
so what is that customer wants
customer wants everything right we
always see if you are if you always see
customers within your business you may
be the owner of the business you may be
just one of the employees that customers
want everything so in 16 months Indian
is a systemic process to continually
improve what they want which is quality
cost and delivery time
whatever the problem whatever the
service all customers are looking for
this react faster that would be I will
use cycle times that they can get the
order much faster they want it better
they can improve performance of course
better quality
and what's normally why cheaper for Less
so in Six Sigma will help you know this
matters
so let me show you now this is the
demide methodology this is the famous
demand toolkit that is similar to the
one used just for 16
million Six Sigma projects comprise
aspects of students voice elimination
and the 16 month focus on reducing
difference based on this demand
methodology
then in my toolkit of lean 16ma comprise
all the links and seeking modules
is the project flow of every six in my
effort and represents defined measure
analyze improve and control that will be
defining the problem
understanding how to measure the effect
of the project so you can see how you
are and where you want to be
third step is analyzing the process of
experimentation
then the fourth one once you know one is
that you want to improve you just have
to go on and improve the process based
on the solutions and putting controls at
the end in place to maintain the
Improvement
so where is lean
in this denial process lean is basically
on the I and C of the Maya it's there
it's basically part of the improve and
the control as you will see later on
moving to the next slide you will see a
chart with the Mac Tools this is the
table show some of the selective methods
of course it's not imperative to use
every tool on every project but here you
can see a wide range of tools that you
can that you can use in each of the
steps
again you don't you can use some of the
tools in various of the steps for
example you can use for example the
brainstorming which is a very common
tool in the measurement in the measure
space you can use it in the analyze
phase or you can use it in improve it
it's all up to you the tools are for you
to use whenever you want them you just
uh need to
learn which tool is the best for each
each part of the process that we need to
develop
and of course we have the link tools as
you can see on the slide
lean tools have a lot of a lot of
five five based objectives which is to
seek Perfection allow customers to pull
create flow identify the value stream
and aluminum waste and finally
standardize and visualize customer value
okay this this is um the well-known
House of quality of the House of Toyota
production system
with uh the the roof of the house is
Quezon the Japanese word that stands for
continuous Improvement
so what we're going to see today is
where are we going to use all these
tools like the ones from the TPM 5S or
the visual Factory considering that in
Maya methodology
well before we start with the demand
methodology just uh let me tell you one
last thing which is the training the
training foreign is provided through the
well-based training system which is very
similar to the Judo one so they have
been depending on the amount and
complexity of the tools that that every
employee is trained Personnel are
designated as white Bales yellow Bells
green belts black belts and even Master
Blasters again very similar to Judo
black belts tend to be project leaders
or agreements usually are projecting
members
so this is
nice and this is all the steps that
we're going to see today
let's get started with it
they're fine this is the first step of
the demand methodology
so what are the outputs for the defined
phase
you have to define the product on the
service you have to identify your
customers you have to define the process
and you have to understand the customer
requirements
so this is a phrase I like very much
which is uh which was
said by Joseph Duran one of the main
rules of quality which says all
Improvement takes place project by
project and in no other way
so this is the way that sixtina and name
start getting together having a project
so the first thing that you have to do
to start news in the demand methodology
is having a project to work on you have
to look at your processes and see what's
going on when uh where are customers
complaining or where are your employees
complaining that they have to work too
hard or they have to work too fast and
it's not okay for them so when you have
some kind of issues or when you're
having a lot of costs that you would
like to reduce whether you may have a
project
so once you have defined your project
The Next Step that I would recommend to
do is to use a type of diagram
the cycle diagram is useful to see the
big picture and define whether it ends
where it ends the process and where it
starts
so
now we are getting getting closer to
what a manufacturing company is right
so let's see what is um the process of a
bottling company for example
this type of standard it stands for
suppliers input process output and
customers so the first thing that you
need to do with your process is to
understand it
how you understand it the first thing is
to Define future your suppliers
you need to see that every task that you
do has something that is that it starts
before and something that starts after
you finish your process so the best
thing that each of your employees need
to know is how their processes are
connected to other tasks on the other
people in the company
so we have our process for both links
and the process for bottling has
suppliers
it may be a bottling company or it may
be employees
those those the supplier on your place
provide inputs those inputs are bottles
juice States
in the bottom
then once I finish the process for
bottling I have the output which is the
juice bottle and the customer which is
the distributor which is going to
distribute my juice or the employees
that may drink it
so
what about the the process itself for
bottling
well you just have to write all the
tasks that are related to your process
in my case would be first clean the
bottles that have been received from the
supplier
for hot juice into the bottles
close the bottles invert them so that
the juice get to them to all the part of
the bottle
then you have to cool it down
then you have to label it and then you
like it
once you finish all the steps you are
ready to have the juice button and
distribute it
okay so this is the first step so that
you know exactly where to start
now now that you know what comes after
and what comes before your process you
have to walk every difference which is
going to doing a filtered
the flow chart is a virtual
representation of the sequence of steps
in a process it's very similar to what
we have already done but it's more
detail
so in this kind of thought process
floater I have included also not only
the steps but also the responses for
each of them which is operations
purchases and resection in this case
so
the filter the basic usefulness of the
function is that you develop a common
understanding of a process what will
when where and how
this way you also identify Improvement
opportunities so you have you can this
way you can see if you if there are
problem areas or inefficiencies or if
you already have redundancy if you have
recycling if there are gaps between the
Aziz and the idea
so soldiers are very useful for you to
see what's going on in your process and
it also will help you to standardize how
work is done
saltra is also very useful to train your
employees also to document the process
so this is one of the very very first
tools that you need to use as a green
belt or black belt
so now that you have defined your
process and you have defined what is
that you are going to have a son as an
output of your process you have to
measure how it works that's the second
step of the mind that is the measure
phase
the measure phase allows you to
understand the before percent condition
of the process before you attempt to
identify improvements
because the measure phase is based upon
valid data it eliminates guesswork about
how well your process is working because
you know sometimes you say yeah my
process is working well that can you
actually say that it's working well do
you know
um you know what is uh the profitability
of the business do you know the cost
that you're having you know the cycle
time well if you don't know that you are
not sure if your bus is actually going
well I mean it's going quite well it
will go better
so first that you need to do is try to
refine which is the process and output
measures that you want to have what is
that you want to measure you have to
have a performance measurement and you
have to identify the gaps with the idea
of process measurements
this is another very nice phrase that I
like to use that is uh if you don't
measure work processes or you can't
possibly manage them and that was said
but by Bill Hewitt and this is very
right as I said before if you cannot
measure what you're doing it's very very
difficult that you can manage it because
the only way to show your employees that
something is going wrong that people is
complaining that the manufacturing
process is very slow or is very cost
effective
forms not quite as effective then if you
cannot tell them the truth you cannot
tell them numbers well you cannot
actually make them
change anything about it so the first
thing is that you have your process flow
turn and start measuring how it's
working
so one of the measurement tools that I
can use is to actually go and count or
measure what you're doing so you have
your process launcher
um and then you first need to request
materials so you have to request equal
to suppliers so measure how much time
you spend your question quotes to your
suppliers
so let's say you spend an hour
okay
but then the next step is selecting your
supplier how much time do you spend
until you actually select the supplier
but sometimes it takes like for example
three days or a week or two weeks you
know so this is a very important phase
of your mind methodology you actually
need to know all the time that you're
spending not only by doing something but
all but also all the time that you're
spending doing nothing like waiting
waiting for someone just let suppliers
waiting from from the supplier to get
you the supplies waiting for getting the
stuff actually on the manufacturing
plans so
first measure everything you can about
your process
once you have measure how your process
is going
then you can analyze or more to the next
step where you can see why you're not
getting the results you want
why is it that I'm getting my supplies
for both of my
for bottling my juice in two weeks if I
want in two days well that's one we have
to analyze
we basically in the analyze space what
we're going to do is understand why
we're going to have this gaps
so the first tool that we can use to
analyze is the brainstorming the one
that I mentioned before which is the
technique for generating a high volume
of ideas on any topic
so you can use this to to stimulate
creativity using your team to encourage
any participant to build on another's
ideas
you get all the team members involved
because the brainstorming session
basically what you do is have a
facilitator
asking for team members to look for new
ideas you just have to show your problem
on the charts on your screen and then
team members need to tell what what they
think it's the problem about them okay
brainstorming is a very important tool
and it's very simple but it can be
incredibly used together with other
tools like the fish from dining room
which is the next tool
the official diagram is a brainstorming
tool designed to identify possible
causes of the problem
it's also now known as the cause and
effect diagram or imusicaward diagram
so what you can do is just as you can
see on this line just
show on the screen what is the problem
and start looking for the different
causes the different root causes okay so
what we do on the fission diagram you
can just set like signs or categories
that are commonly used or you can use
your own
well the ones that are commonly used are
what is called the six ends which is
Machinery methods material
people
environment and measurement
so as you can see on the next slide this
is a nice example a half of how you can
use that
visual diagram to analyze the causes of
your problems for example in this case
we have no mind time
so why you may be having a long buying
time because of your methods if you go
to their methods spine because you're
dreaming from first floor takes longer
another option
substitution takes long
let's say this is a clinic that you are
looking for buying things doctor is too
busy to pick up the phone okay
um let's go to the person's fine
uh
maybe people is busy retrieving because
it's not in many immediately available
for Council many people is Young and
inexperienced
so this is some some parts that may be
affecting what is going on in your
process so what's good about the visual
diagram is that you'll see in just one
slide a lot of root causes you just have
to keep asking why which is another two
then five wise keep asking why something
is going wrong so why is that
that we have the problems with the
methods again why because we tune in
from the first floor to a plumber while
retrieving from first or take longer
then you keep answering why until you
get to the five and then you are going
to get the right answer
what you're going to to get with this is
a lot of as I said before a lot of root
losses that you have to analyze then
with your experience team which will be
people from different from different
sectors in the company from different
areas even you can input suppliers and
customers they all can vote and see
which is the real root cause for the
problem
another tool that you can use to analyze
well the information that you have
is decorated charts the pressure chart
is very well used if you have real data
you know for example waiting time or if
you have information about
how much how much cost you're having
well the operator chart is a form of bar
chart that helps to identify Problems by
displaying them in a descending order of
frequency or size
so the Pareto Principle is founded on
the observation that many instances just
a large percentage of problems are
caused by only a small percentage of the
total contributing factors so that is
here you know you will have like six or
seven categories of problems but if you
just focus on the first one
which is going to have 80 percent of the
of the
their problems you will only be solving
one of the causes okay so just please
solve one of the causes and you will be
resolving eighty percent of your
problems
the principle was established by
referral party in 2019 and he really
studied that this was the 80 20 Rule and
it's applied to any kind of industry
you just have to check your data and see
where you get the 80 percent of your
problems
so now you have you have built your
visual diagram you have a lot of courses
then you have analyzed your process and
you have gig data then you've got your
current chart to try to prioritize which
are the the courses that you got and
then you get that one of the processes
is the most important about it so how
you solve it
you need to work on the improved phase
I've been broadcast you will innovate
look for Solutions and test them
test them in just a pilot area that's
the most recommendable way of doing it
and if in that kind of area it works
then you can implement the solution
across the problem
so here in the group phase as I said
before is where we're going to start
using the very limiting tools
so this these little tools are going to
help you basically to reduce the a waste
that every company can have
we had ways are non-valuable activities
for just any effort that doesn't
increase value for the product or the
customer minutes that needs to be
eliminated or reduced
those eight ways that you have the
acronym for downtime are defects or
production waiting
non-viable and processing Transportation
inventory motion waste unemployed
immunized skills
so lean tools will help you animating
all these eight waste and the first one
and I always recommend to start with
when you when you have a when you want
to implement that environment
methodology within the plant if the 5S
which is to organize the workplace used
in the fibers
the 5S is a Japanese methodology that
has five steps that will help you
organize where you work in a way that
it's easier to see the defects and
explicit work it's easy also to to
visualize what's going well what's going
wrong and CC for anyone to see it not
only for experiencing over adults or
operators or I mean employees and also
for customers
so what is 5S about the first step of 5S
is short it's a separate needed tools
materials and instructions from those
that are not needed you have to remove
everything that is not unit from the
work area
so once you have split what you need
from what you don't need you need to
store well what you're actually need you
have to sort and organize all tools
equipment files data materials and
resources for quick easy location and
use
we'll have to label all the locations on
the tools and the equipment so that
everyone can see it you can find it in
less than 30 seconds yes it's less than
30 seconds if you are spending more than
that to find any two then you're having
a problem and you may be looking forward
to implement 5S
so once you have story on your precious
material your
um
whatever these products finished
products equipments or any kind of
material then you need to set a new
level of playinginess in the shine step
you have to clean and remove all trash
freeze and dirt what happens mostly in a
manufacturing environment is that with
some dirt are
a way of hiding these so as soon as
possible that you can remove any grief
any dirt any Trash then you will be able
to see much better what's going on
what's going well so
if there's a machine that is not working
probably if it's clean you will see
exactly when you are getting a flow of
water that shouldn't be there or the
flow of
oil or grease that shouldn't be there
on top of that cleanliness provides a
safe work area makes potential problems
business so you will be able in order to
not only to see the equipment links as I
said before but also in those parts
reason words newspaper or materials
whatever
the first step for the 5S is to
standardize
which we're going to see later on as
well in the mayak in the C control phase
okay but it will also have it inclined
the 5S so it standardized with V2
systematically do the one second and
third step of fibers
so you had to establish schedules for
cleaning you have to define the
standards for each of the processes and
the five part the the five steps is to
sustain it the only way that only 16 can
work if you sustain it
you have to make
Liam Six Sigma the same way as 5S as
part of your culture you have to build
an organizational commitment
so that
this tool is sustained Through Time
on let me tell you one more thing
are very great funds of 5S
will tell you that 25 to 30 for Quality
difference are directly related to order
and synonyms in the workers so that's
really true
now what's more this only this is also
5S is a great contributor to to employee
satisfaction and workplace because they
feel more comfortable with when they're
working
so moving to the next tool
as you can see this is some pictures of
5S where you can see some tools very
well organized you have these are all
pictures of real real examples of
factories where employees have been
working on 5S trying to organize their
the parts the materials for the works
the tools so this helps them much better
to improve the processes they do improve
how they work they are much faster and
they just know when they need something
the next picture will also show you how
you can not only
have signs on the on the tools but also
you can have signs on the floor just
showing where you should include any
kind of material so that you don't get
them lost
this is another good example where you
can have
you can have places to to put all the
all the materials that you need but as
much as possible that you can see them
that's much better you may use labels
but you also can use transparent
Parts you know the drawers transparent
drawers so that you can see everything
that is inside and you can figure out
easily where you have to change it or
where you have to uh buy more stuff
this is probably to a very to another
tool that is very very well used in
means 16 now which is division Factory
okay this is the same picture for the
the drawer that we just saw remember
this one
okay
let me go back
do you remember this one
this one
on the on the door you will see a sign
which is red or green showing where you
need to change the where you need to
change either the tools or you need more
material so visual factor is a big part
of lim fixing one you need visual
science to help you have real-time
dashboards real time things I will tell
you what to do and when to do it
and this helps a lot team leaders on the
factory floor you can see that Toyota is
much more effective than General Motors
and index in a sense that team leaders
and 90 of the time on the factory floor
because they have all the information
they need right there they don't have it
on the computer they just have it on the
floor
and that's that's a very good thing
about visual factoring here I have
another example this is a box that is
used to have
glue for uh for the factory
and you know the same employees just cut
cut down
the bus so that they can see inside how
much glue they have and it's easier for
them to identify when they need to buy
more
another good tool for music Sigma to
reduce waste is polka yoga which is
Mystic proofing
devices which is the practice of
Australian for zero defects to prevent
errors
it applies to any process where
repetitive steps occur which could be
skipped for format of folder or not
conducted correctly mistake proofing
ensures that test can only be done the
right way you can use lights you can use
signs whatever you need so that you can
show right away what's going right and
what's going on
I also use very much example of the
Excel when you are writing something
that is not correct when you are
supposed to write a date and you're
writing some you're writing letters then
you will receive a message on the Excel
file but then the same in you know any
Erp instance like sap
you get a message showing hey this is
not what you should be doing so before
you continue working on that you already
see what's going on
an honoring tool that is very much used
is net which is uh stands for single
minutes change of time and it refers to
the time it should take to set up a
machine to produce a part
it's very very common as you can see
there are some examples of companies
that need to do fasting jewelries well
net is a very good tool to reduce the
time of the changeovers in automatic
plans there are numerous instances where
you would take like three or four hours
till you set up
so with the use of business that means
the setup time would be reduced to three
minutes
for example the other day I went to
Toyota plant and really you are having
like a new car every 110
seconds right and it was any kind of car
with any color it wasn't like 10 black
cars no it wasn't red car 110 minutes
later you would have a black car
whatever I'm 10 minutes later you would
have like a Vans no it's it was
wonderful so that is basically one of
the things that that are great about
cement
another tool is the total preventive
maintenance which is to try the
operators to contribute to keeping the
equipment in good condition
and that's another another great tool
that you can use for living stigma
so how much time do you lose when you
need to repair a machine
well you can create a flow if you start
if you just spend one or seven minutes
you know every day before using it and
two minutes to clean it after but you
will never have this the machines going
down instead of just spending three
hours every two weeks just spend five
minutes every day and you will work much
better and you will know how it works
this is your operators know how the
machines work they will be much better
prepared to fix it faster and to make it
work much better
another tool is the command
is a great tool which is also very
Visual and is
um it's a it's not as good it says like
it's like a scaling system but sweater
production control system
and it's not automated it's a very very
simple tool it's just cards posting
notes being fireless whatever you need
to visualize how things are level you
can use like these cards and I'm showing
them the slides you can use postage to
show how things are working
on their next slide we're going to see
that there are palettes that we're going
to have different colors like green if
something is already processed and ready
to pack or you can use a red if
something needs to be fixed or something
needs to be arranged well you can use a
sense that you can use the cards telling
you how much materials you need for any
product you can have parts to tell if
the product is approved it's not there
are very you need a lot of imagination
to to be able to use wealth these camera
cards and you can use it in any process
it's very much like the waiter when they
they get your order at the restaurant
that would be like Let It come on card
if you got it if you got it to a to the
chest
on the kitchen
so they want this all these tools were
part of the improved phase so now you
have to find your process you can't
measure how it should work you have
analyze why it's not working that well
then you have improve it and now it's
time for control you need to monitor
what you have been working on to make
sure it is sustained Through Time
so one of the tools that we use a lot
for controlling is the control chart
which is an advanced form of brand chart
which displays how stable is the process
and what types of variation it is
subject to
as you can see this is a
nice well it's not that nice it's not
very clean right but it's a very good
place where you can get all the
information you need online instead of
just going to the computer you just go
to the to the plant to the floor and see
what are the metrics for production for
cost for Quality Security for HR you can
put whatever you need as long as you can
measure it and what I recommend
is that a measures are done directly by
the operator that each of the employees
can draw in a very simple Universal
graph how they are doing and what which
are the objectives so that you can see
if we are working one or not in this
case for example you have an objective
of 1.3
having
who are using paper and you want to have
it only to 1.3 percent but in this case
they are having very very bad numbers as
you can see because they are on top of
the objectives okay
but this is something good because the
operator exactly won't know what is
going wrong and which day it went wrong
and maybe they can figure out if there's
something to correct on that particular
day
so
as I said control is part of monitoring
and controlling but you also need to
try to have procedures you need to
standardize what you have been doing the
same thing that I mentioned with 5S that
the fourth step of 5S was standardizing
when you have your demand methodology in
the control part you also need to make
sure it sustained through time and the
only way to sustain a change through
time is using standardized standard
operating procedures that will be
manuals or that would be things that are
standardized ways of cleaning ways of
also as preferring a package waste of
um
solving a problem ways of
cleaning a certain tool or certain
machine or ways to do a fast change over
well you need to write it down so in the
case now you define
um
with lean or with a smell you to find a
way to do your your changeovers faster
then you need to write them ones so that
it helps everyone to find the best way
to perform each operation
okay what happened is that if you have a
small company well maybe there's just
one person doing one of the activities
right maybe you are you are you have a
restaurant and you have some someone
that is cooking or you have a plant
Where You Are
where you are having as I said before
the example of the bottom company well
you need to find the best way to model
every every juice
so all must understand the notion that
variation is equal to digits so if you
have the inspiration you will reduce the
exact levels and the only way to reduce
variation is to have standard work
that is everyone doing things the same
way and the same way that is the best
way
the best way that is discovered of
course you know everything what has to
do with quality management it also has
to do with continuous improvements so we
need to focus on improving whatever you
do
continue growing every time so maybe you
want to find the best way to perform one
operation but maybe the next day one of
the new employees realizes that there is
a better way well then you need to
update your process and show them and
communicate them so everyone else knows
exactly what is the best way
so what is good about it is that work is
to be performed according to the
standard but this soon applies to
everyone to our workers to supervisors
to managers to training us
whoever so everyone needs to have a
standard for what they are doing every
day okay the six signal process is known
as Dometic domain comprises five phases
Define measure analyze improve and
control
these phases are the roadmap to problem
solving and improving our processes
the effectiveness of Six Sigma method is
derived from its structure
each phase has an overarching objective
and specific deliverables that need to
be completed which helps us achieve the
objectives the purpose of the defined
phase is to document the problem the
desired outcome goals and deliverables
the purpose of the measure phase is to
obtain Baseline process performance
levels and quantify the problem the
focus of the analyze phase is to
identify the key root causes for process
variation and defects the purpose of the
improved phase is to develop test and
implement the solutions
the goal of the control phase is to
monitor the key factors and maintain the
gains you learn the aspects of the
domainic process now we'll look at the
tools used in each phase the list of
tools corresponds to the Dometic phase
in which they are used
the use or application of these tools
gives the expected deliverables in each
domainic phase for a green belt some of
the tools listed are not required in
every Six Sigma Greenbelt project
these tools give us an insight into the
problem and lead us toward the real
issues in our processes that is with
more experience you are likely to know
the tools you need for your projects
in the Define phase we use cypok voice
of the customer or VOC critical to
quality ctq the quality function
deployment or qfd failure modes and
effects analysis
known as the FMEA or the familiar and
the cause and effect CNE Matrix
in the measure phase we use measurement
system analysis or MSA control charts
process capability and normality plots
and the analyze phase we use Simple
linear regression or SLR Pareto charts
fishbone diagram Builder modes and
effects analysis The Familiar
multivariate charts and hypothesis
testing
in the improved phase we use
brainstorming piloting and also the
failure modes effects analysis and
design of experiments Doe
in the last phase control will use
control charts a control plan and
measurement system analysis
Pareto chart is a histogram ordered by
the frequency of occurrence of events it
is also known as the 80 20 rule or vital
view trivial many
it helps project teams to focus on the
issues which cause the highest number of
defects or complaints
to explain further the given chart plots
all the causes for defects in a product
or service the values are represented in
descending order by vars and the
cumulative total is represented by the
line
Pareto chart emphasizes that 80 percent
of the effects come from 20 percent of
the causes thus a Pareto chart Narrows
the scope of the project or problem
solving by identifying the major causes
affecting quality
burrito charts are useful only when
required data is available
if data is not available then other
tools such as brainstorming and
multi-voting should be used to find the
root cause of any problem
Network diagrams are one of the tools
used by the project manager for project
planning
they are also sometimes referred to as
Arrow diagrams because they use arrows
to connect activities and represent
precedence and interdependencies between
activities of a project
there are some assumptions that need to
be made while forming the network
diagram the first assumption is that
before a new activity begins all pending
activities have been completed
the second assumption is that all arrows
indicate logical precedence this means
that the direction of the arrow
represents the sequence that activities
need to follow the last assumption is
that a network diagram must start from a
single event and end with a single event
there cannot be multiple start and end
points to the network diagram
critical path method also known as CPM
is an important tool used by project
managers to monitor the progress of the
project and to ensure that the project
is on schedule
the critical path for a project is the
longest sequence of tasks on the network
diagram the critical path in the given
Network diagram is highlighted in Orange
critical path is characterized by zero
slack for all tasks on the sequence
this means that the smallest delay in
any of the tasks on the critical path
will cause a delay in the overall
timeline of the project
this makes it very important for the
project manager to closely monitor the
tasks on the critical path and ensure
that the tasks go smoothly
if needed the project manager can divert
resources from other tasks that are not
on the critical path to tasks on the
critical path to ensure that the project
is not delayed
when a project manager removes resources
from such tasks he needs to ensure that
the task does not become a critical path
task because of the reduced number of
resources
during the execution of the project the
critical path can easily shift because
of multiple factors and hence needs to
be constantly monitored by the project
manager a complex project can also have
multiple critical paths staying ahead in
