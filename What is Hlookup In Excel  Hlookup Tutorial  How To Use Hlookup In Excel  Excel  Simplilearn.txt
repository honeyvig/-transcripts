hey everyone welcome to simply learn's
youtube channel in this session we will
be discussing the horizontal lookup in
excel but before we begin let me tell
you guys that we have daily updates on
multiple technologies so if you're a
tech geek in a continuous hunt for
latest technological trends then
consider getting subscribed to our
youtube channel and don't forget to hit
that bell icon to never miss an update
from simply learn so let's get started
with horizontal lookup or hlookup in
excel so here we might want to switch to
the practical mode that is starting up
microsoft excel now we are on the sheet
of microsoft excel and here you can see
some data on my sheet
that is employee name employee id and
salary
so here we are going to perform more
horizontal lookup but before that let me
show you that this particular drop down
menu so this particular drop down menu
has all the names of the employees in
this particular table and we have
created this using data validation in
excel
if you want to create the drop down
menus just like these then feel free to
check out our data validation in excel
tutorial link to which is in the
description box below now let's try to
implement hlookup in excel so here we
have employee name but we want to find
out the employee id so for that let's
create the hlookup now for that equals
to hlookup
now the first one is the lookup value so
this one
is
the cell which is the employee name now
after that the table array we have to
select all the table arrays here
now
the row index number so the employee id
is in row index number 2 according to
the table so for that provide 2 and
close the bracket and before closing
brackets you might want to give the
exact match so for exact match select
false
and close the bracket press enter and
there you go
and if you select
jack then you'll find the employee id of
check and if you select jury you'll find
the employee id of cherry reflecting
here
now similarly let's find out the salary
of all the employees using hlookup
so equals hlookup
and lookup value that happens to be the
name of the employee
now the table array
and next we have
row index number that is salary happens
to be the third row in the table so
three
and
exact match
close the bracket and enter so now if
you change the values in this particular
dropdown menu you will find the employee
id and their particular salary so jack
happens to be carrying the employee id
as 1001 and his salary is ten thousand
so similarly let's try to find out
peter's employee id and salary
so there you go one zero zero five and
fifty thousand dollars salary so that's
how you use hlookup in excel if you have
any queries regarding any of the topics
covered in the session or if you need
the data set that we have used in this
particular tutorial then please feel
free to let us know in the comment
section below and our team of experts
will be happy to resolve all your
queries at the earliest until next time
