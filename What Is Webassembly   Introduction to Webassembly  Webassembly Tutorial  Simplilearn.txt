hey there have you ever wondered what
goes on behind the scenes when you
browse the web well it's not just HTML
CSS and JavaScript webassembly is a new
technology that's changing the way we
build websites and apps in this video we
will dive into the web assembly why it's
important and how it's changing the web
webassembly is a new type of code that
can run into your web browser it's
designed to be fast secure and portable
which means that code is written in
webassembly can run on any device
regardless of its operating system or
browser one of the biggest benefits of
webassembly is that it lets developer to
use any programming language to write
code for the web this means that
programmers can use their favorite
languages like C plus plus rust or
python to build web apps instead of
being limited to JavaScript and because
webassembly is so fast it can be used
for more demanding applications like
games 3D graphics and even artificial
intelligence but webassembly isn't just
for developers it's also good for users
because webassembly code can run faster
than JavaScript code it can make apps
and website load faster which is greater
for user who just want to get things
done quickly another benefit of
webassembly is that it's more secure
than JavaScript because webassembly code
runs in a sandboxed environment it's
harder for hackers to exploit security
veneabilities
this means that webassembly apps can be
more secure which is important when you
are dealing with sensitive data like
personal information so if you are a
developer or just a web user webassembly
is something you should learn more about
with its speed portability and security
webassembly is changing the way we build
the web and it's only going to get more
important in the years to come but here
is another quick nugget of information
for you according to recent reports of
flexera adoption of cloud computing is
expected to grow and an annual growth
rate of 17.5 percent through 2023 and
with all the applications today moving

[Music]
when I won the Grammy Award back in 2007
I
thought was the highest
I eventually made your choice to drive
software development as my full-time job
and this year I changed my domain to
cloud computing simple large course
helped me make the switch and get a new
job with 100 salary hike
hey I'm whoever Wasa I live in Georgia
USA with my wife two sons and two dogs
I started off as a video editor and
producer in Venezuela I even started my
own company there
in 2006 I work as one of the producers
and writer for the short music video
Bena Mikasa esta Navidad
the video got me the Latin Grammy Award
in the best video category for the year
2007.
my life was all set I shifted to the
United States with my wife and son in
2008 as a resident with special
abilities the first two years were
really hard
there was no work I have to start from
scratch I landed some projects but those
were not enough
to survive I have to make some hard
decisions I have done some software
development in Venezuela so in 2011 I
got a job as a software developer over
the years I fell in love with my
professional
so last year to advance my career I made
another choice to upskill myself with
simple learns cloud computing bootcamp
in association with Caltech ctme the
work is really moving towards Cloud
technology and I wanted to have a
professional certification in the same
the course proved to be very beneficial
I completed the course in June this year
and within three weeks I got hired as a
cloud engineer and my salary is just
double I got the job because of the AWS
and Azure technologies that I learned
during the course
professional I have not given up on my
passion for video production
it was hard initially but my work
eventually got me recognition and
acknowledgment since then I have worked
on several short videos and films like
the case against Mr Shepard verified
music in there and many more
my Mantra is never give up always try to
become better and keep your eye on the
price
so let's get started what is webassembly
webassembly is transforming web
development by introducing a
groundbreaking technology that offers a
new way to run code on the web while
JavaScript has long been the dominant
language for web development webassembly
brings a universal programming language
that can be understood and executed by
all modern browsers unlocking a world of
possibilities let's see what sets apart
webassembly its low level Assembly
Language nature designed to closely
resemble compiled machine code for
Optimal Performance although you won't
write script directly in webassembly it
serves as a compilation Target for other
language that means that web browser can
now execute code written in a variety of
programming languages including C plus
plus rust python expanding The Horizon
of web development
the impact of webassembly is pronounced
by enabling developer to leverage
different languages it breaks the
boundaries of traditional web
development developers can tap into
their preferred language and exciting
code basis unlocking new levels of
flexibility power and efficiency in web
application development now let's see
webassembly unleashing performance
security and portability in web
development
webassembly brings significant
performance Improvement compared to
traditional JavaScript it executes code
faster leading to reduce loading time
for apps and websites this enhanced
speed translate into a smoother and more
responsive user experience
with webassemblies efficiency web
application can now handle resource
intensive tasks such as complex
emulation games and even artificial
intelligence all while maintaining
Optimal Performance
next we have security security is
another area where web assembly shines
by running code within a secure sandbox
environment it provides an extra layer
of protection against potential threads
the sandbox execution isolates code
making it more challenging for hackers
this high-end security is particularly
crucial in handling sensitive user data
and ensuring the overall protection of
personal information furthermore
webassembly is designed to be portable
across devices operating systems and
browsers ensuring a constant user
experience regardless of the environment
where application can be seamlessly
accessed making them more widely
available and accessible to users now
let's explore the key features of
webassembly the first one on our list is
language diversity webassembly enables
developer to write code in multiple
programming languages including C plus
plus rust and python expanding the
possibilities for web development this
line language diversity empowers
developer to leverage their preferred
language and existing code bases
resulting in more efficiency and
Powerful web applications the next we
have high performance webassembly is
engineered to execute at near native
speeds offering significant performance
improvements over traditional JavaScript
by utilizing a low level binary format
it efficiently executes code resulting
in Faster loaded time and smoother
execution of a complex applications this
makes it well suited for duplications
such as games simulations and other
complications intensive tasks next we
have enhanced security
webassembly operates within a secure
sandbox environment providing an
additional layer of security this
isolation prevents milliquis code for
accessing sensitive user data or
compressing the Integrity of the system
web application built with webassembly
are more resistant to attack ensuring
the safety and privacy of user
information next we have platform
independency webassembly is designed to
be platform independent enabling it to
run seamlessly on various devices
operating systems and web browsers this
cross-platform compatibility ensures
that application built with webassembly
can exist and run continuously across
different environment it streamlines the
development process and provides user
with a seamless experience in summary
webassembly language diversity enhance
performance improves security and
platform independency are
revolutionarizing web development
developers now have the freedom to
choose from multiple programming
languages resulting in more powerful and
efficient web applications users benefit
from faster loading time and enhanced
security measurements and a constant
experience across devices
as web assembly continue to evolve it
promises to shape the future of web
development enabling further Innovative
